- **Summary**: Each year, numerous segmentation and classification algorithms are invented or reused to solve problems where machine vision is needed. Generally, the efficiency of these algorithms is compared against the results given by one or many human experts. However, in many situations, the location of the real boundaries of the objects as well as their classes are not known with certainty by the human experts. Furthermore, only one aspect of the segmentation and classification problem is generally evaluated. In this paper we present a new evaluation method for classification and segmentation of image, where we take into account both the classification and segmentation results as well as the level of certainty given by the experts. As a concrete example of our method, we evaluate an automatic seabed characterization algorithm based on sonar images.

- **Summary**: In image classification, merging the opinion of several human experts is very important for different tasks such as the evaluation or the training. Indeed, the ground truth is rarely known before the scene imaging. We propose here different models in order to fuse the informations given by two or more experts. The considered unit for the classification, a small tile of the image, can contain one or more kind of the considered classes given by the experts. A second problem that we have to take into account, is the amount of certainty of the expert has for each pixel of the tile. In order to solve these problems we define five models in the context of the Dempster-Shafer Theory and in the context of the Dezert-Smarandache Theory and we study the possible decisions with these models.

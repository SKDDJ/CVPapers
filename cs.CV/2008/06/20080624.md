- **Summary**: In the previous paper, we have conceptualized the localization and the organization of seeded region growing by pixels aggregation (SRGPA) but we do not give the issue when there is a collision between two distinct regions during the growing process. In this paper, we propose two implementations to manage two classical growing processes: one without a boundary region region to divide the other regions and another with. Unfortunately, as noticed by Mehnert and Jakway (1997), this partition depends on the seeded region initialisation order (SRIO). We propose a growing process, invariant about SRIO such as the boundary region is the set of ambiguous pixels.

- **Summary**: Adams and Bishop have proposed in 1994 a novel region growing algorithm called seeded region growing by pixels aggregation (SRGPA). This paper introduces a framework to implement an algorithm using SRGPA. This framework is built around two concepts: localization and organization of applied action. This conceptualization gives a quick implementation of algorithms, a direct translation between the mathematical idea and the numerical implementation, and an improvement of algorithms efficiency.

- **Summary**: In the two previous papers of this serie, we have created a library, called Population, dedicated to seeded region growing by pixels aggregation and we have proposed different growing processes to get a partition with or without a boundary region to divide the other regions or to get a partition invariant about the seeded region initialisation order. Using this work, we implement some algorithms belonging to the field of SRGPA using this library and these growing processes.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a simple, generic and robust method to extract the grains from experimental tridimensionnal images of granular materials obtained by X-ray tomography. This extraction has two steps: segmentation and splitting. For the segmentation step, if there is a sufficient contrast between the different components, a classical threshold procedure followed by a succession of morphological filters can be applied. If not, and if the boundary needs to be localized precisely, a watershed transformation controlled by labels is applied. The basement of this transformation is to localize a label included in the component and another label in the component complementary. A "soft" threshold following by an opening is applied on the initial image to localize a label in a component. For any segmentation procedure, the visualisation shows a problem: some groups of two grains, close one to each other, become connected. So if a classical cluster procedure is applied on the segmented binary image, these numerical connected grains are considered as a single grain. To overcome this problem, we applied a procedure introduced by L. Vincent in 1993. This grains extraction is tested for various complexes porous media and granular material, to predict various properties (diffusion, electrical conductivity, deformation field) in a good agreement with experiment data.

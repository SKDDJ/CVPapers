- **Summary**: The compound models of clutter statistics are found suitable to describe the nonstationary nature of radar backscattering from high-resolution observations. In this letter, we show that the properties of Mellin transform can be utilized to generate higher order moments of simple and compound models of clutter statistics in a compact manner.

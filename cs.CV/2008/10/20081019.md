- **Summary**: The purpose of this paper is to introduce an algorithm that can detect the most unusual part of a digital image. The most unusual part of a given shape is defined as a part of the image that has the maximal distance to all non intersecting shapes with the same form.   The method can be used to scan image databases with no clear model of the interesting part or large image databases, as for example medical databases.

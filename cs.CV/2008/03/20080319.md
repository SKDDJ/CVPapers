- **Summary**: The method of a linear high dynamic range imaging using solid-state photosensors with Bayer colour filters array is provided in this paper. Using information from neighbour pixels, it is possible to reconstruct linear images with wide dynamic range from the oversaturated images. Bayer colour filters array is considered as an array of neutral filters in a quasimonochromatic light. If the camera's response function to the desirable light source is known then one can calculate correction coefficients to reconstruct oversaturated images. Reconstructed images are linearized in order to provide a linear high dynamic range images for optical-digital imaging systems. The calibration procedure for obtaining the camera's response function to the desired light source is described. Experimental results of the reconstruction of the images from the oversaturated images are presented for red, green, and blue quasimonochromatic light sources. Quantitative analysis of the accuracy of the reconstructed images is provided.

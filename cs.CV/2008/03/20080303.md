- **Summary**: This paper draws a proposal of a set of parameters and methods for accuracy evaluation of visual inspection systems. The case of a monochrome board is treated, but practically all conclusions and methods may be extended for colour acquisition. Basically, the proposed parameters are grouped in five sets as follows:Internal noise;Video ADC cuantisation parameters;Analogue processing section parameters;Dominant frequencies;Synchronisation (lock-in) accuracy. On basis of this set of parameters was developed a software environment, in conjunction with a test signal generator that allows the "test" images. The paper also presents conclusions of evaluation for two types of video acquisition boards

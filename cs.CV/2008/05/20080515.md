- **Summary**: By considering the features of the airport runway image filtering, an improved bilateral filtering method was proposed which can remove noise with edge preserving. Firstly the steerable filtering decomposition is used to calculate the sub-band parameters of 4 orients, and the texture feature matrix is then obtained from the sub-band local median energy. The texture similar, the spatial closer and the color similar functions are used to filter the image.The effect of the weighting function parameters is qualitatively analyzed also. In contrast with the standard bilateral filter and the simulation results for the real airport runway image show that the multilateral filtering is more effective than the standard bilateral filtering.

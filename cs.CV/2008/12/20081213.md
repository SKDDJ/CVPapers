- **Summary**: Applications such as face recognition that deal with high-dimensional data need a mapping technique that introduces representation of low-dimensional features with enhanced discriminatory power and a proper classifier, able to classify those complex features. Most of traditional Linear Discriminant Analysis suffer from the disadvantage that their optimality criteria are not directly related to the classification ability of the obtained feature representation. Moreover, their classification accuracy is affected by the "small sample size" problem which is often encountered in FR tasks. In this short paper, we combine nonlinear kernel based mapping of data called KDDA with Support Vector machine classifier to deal with both of the shortcomings in an efficient and cost effective manner. The proposed here method is compared, in terms of classification accuracy, to other commonly used FR methods on UMIST face database. Results indicate that the performance of the proposed method is overall superior to those of traditional FR approaches, such as the Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, and D-LDA methods and traditional linear classifiers.

- **Summary**: Recently, Adaboost has been widely used to improve the accuracy of any given learning algorithm. In this paper we focus on designing an algorithm to employ combination of Adaboost with Support Vector Machine as weak component classifiers to be used in Face Detection Task. To obtain a set of effective SVM-weaklearner Classifier, this algorithm adaptively adjusts the kernel parameter in SVM instead of using a fixed one. Proposed combination outperforms in generalization in comparison with SVM on imbalanced classification problem. The proposed here method is compared, in terms of classification accuracy, to other commonly used Adaboost methods, such as Decision Trees and Neural Networks, on CMU+MIT face database. Results indicate that the performance of the proposed method is overall superior to previous Adaboost approaches.

- **Summary**: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition is an important task for practical applications. The performance of automatic speech emotion recognition systems degrades in cross-corpus scenarios, particularly in scenarios involving multiple languages or a previously unseen language such as Urdu for which limited or no data is available. In this study, we investigate the problem of cross-lingual emotion recognition for Urdu language and contribute URDU---the first ever spontaneous Urdu-language speech emotion database. Evaluations are performed using three different Western languages against Urdu and experimental results on different possible scenarios suggest various interesting aspects for designing more adaptive emotion recognition system for such limited languages. In results, selecting training instances of multiple languages can deliver comparable results to baseline and augmentation a fraction of testing language data while training can help to boost accuracy for speech emotion recognition. URDU data is publicly available for further research.

- **Summary**: We introduce ABC-Dataset, a collection of one million Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models for research of geometric deep learning methods and applications. Each model is a collection of explicitly parametrized curves and surfaces, providing ground truth for differential quantities, patch segmentation, geometric feature detection, and shape reconstruction. Sampling the parametric descriptions of surfaces and curves allows generating data in different formats and resolutions, enabling fair comparisons for a wide range of geometric learning algorithms. As a use case for our dataset, we perform a large-scale benchmark for estimation of surface normals, comparing existing data driven methods and evaluating their performance against both the ground truth and traditional normal estimation methods.

- **Summary**: Similar and indeterminate defect detection of solar cell surface with heterogeneous texture and complex background is a challenge of solar cell manufacturing. The traditional manufacturing process relies on human eye detection which requires a large number of workers without a stable and good detection effect. In order to solve the problem, a visual defect detection method based on multi-spectral deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed in this paper. Firstly, a selected CNN model is established. By adjusting the depth and width of the model, the influence of model depth and kernel size on the recognition result is evaluated. The optimal CNN model structure is selected. Secondly, the light spectrum features of solar cell color image are analyzed. It is found that a variety of defects exhibited different distinguishable characteristics in different spectral bands. Thus, a multi-spectral CNN model is constructed to enhance the discrimination ability of the model to distinguish between complex texture background features and defect features. Finally, some experimental results and K-fold cross validation show that the multi-spectral deep CNN model can effectively detect the solar cell surface defects with higher accuracy and greater adaptability. The accuracy of defect recognition reaches 94.30%. Applying such an algorithm can increase the efficiency of solar cell manufacturing and make the manufacturing process smarter.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models hold state of the art performance in many fields, yet their design is still based on heuristics or grid search methods that often result in overparametrized networks. This work proposes a method to analyze a trained network and deduce an optimized, compressed architecture that preserves accuracy while keeping computational costs tractable. Model compression is an active field of research that targets the problem of realizing deep learning models in hardware. However, most pruning methodologies tend to be experimental, requiring large compute and time intensive iterations of retraining the entire network. We introduce structure into model design by proposing a single shot analysis of a trained network that serves as a first order, low effort approach to dimensionality reduction, by using PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The proposed method simultaneously analyzes the activations of each layer and considers the dimensionality of the space described by the filters generating these activations. It optimizes the architecture in terms of number of layers, and number of filters per layer without any iterative retraining procedures, making it a viable, low effort technique to design efficient networks. We demonstrate the proposed methodology on AlexNet and VGG style networks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, and successfully achieve an optimized architecture with a reduction of up to 3.8X and 9X in the number of operations and parameters respectively, while trading off less than 1% accuracy. We also apply the method to MobileNet, and achieve 1.7X and 3.9X reduction in the number of operations and parameters respectively, while improving accuracy by almost one percentage point.

- **Summary**: Since the labelling for the positive images/videos is ambiguous in weakly supervised segment annotation, negative mining based methods that only use the intra-class information emerge. In these methods, negative instances are utilized to penalize unknown instances to rank their likelihood of being an object, which can be considered as a voting in terms of similarity. However, these methods 1) ignore the information contained in positive bags, 2) only rank the likelihood but cannot generate an explicit decision function. In this paper, we propose a voting scheme involving not only the definite negative instances but also the ambiguous positive instances to make use of the extra useful information in the weakly labelled positive bags. In the scheme, each instance votes for its label with a magnitude arising from the similarity, and the ambiguous positive instances are assigned soft labels that are iteratively updated during the voting. It overcomes the limitations of voting using only the negative bags. We also propose an expectation kernel density estimation (eKDE) algorithm to gain further insight into the voting mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme beyond the baselines.

- **Summary**: Explicit representations of the global match distributions of pixel-wise correspondences between pairs of images are desirable for uncertainty estimation and downstream applications. However, the computation of the match density for each pixel may be prohibitively expensive due to the large number of candidates. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Discrete Distribution Decomposition (HD^3), a framework suitable for learning probabilistic pixel correspondences in both optical flow and stereo matching. We decompose the full match density into multiple scales hierarchically, and estimate the local matching distributions at each scale conditioned on the matching and warping at coarser scales. The local distributions can then be composed together to form the global match density. Despite its simplicity, our probabilistic method achieves state-of-the-art results for both optical flow and stereo matching on established benchmarks. We also find the estimated uncertainty is a good indication of the reliability of the predicted correspondences.

- **Summary**: Designing an end-to-end deep learning network to match the biometric features with limited training samples is an extremely challenging task. To address this problem, we propose a new way to design an end-to-end deep CNN framework i.e., PVSNet that works in two major steps: first, an encoder-decoder network is used to learn generative domain-specific features followed by a Siamese network in which convolutional layers are pre-trained in an unsupervised fashion as an autoencoder. The proposed model is trained via triplet loss function that is adjusted for learning feature embeddings in a way that minimizes the distance between embedding-pairs from the same subject and maximizes the distance with those from different subjects, with a margin. In particular, a triplet Siamese matching network using an adaptive margin based hard negative mining has been suggested. The hyper-parameters associated with the training strategy, like the adaptive margin, have been tuned to make the learning more effective on biometric datasets. In extensive experimentation, the proposed network outperforms most of the existing deep learning solutions on three type of typical vein datasets which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: We present Hinted Networks: a collection of architectural transformations for improving the accuracies of neural network models for regression tasks, through the injection of a prior for the output prediction (i.e. a hint). We ground our investigations within the camera relocalization domain, and propose two variants, namely the Hinted Embedding and Hinted Residual networks, both applied to the PoseNet base model for regressing camera pose from an image. Our evaluations show practical improvements in localization accuracy for standard outdoor and indoor localization datasets, without using additional information. We further assess the range of accuracy gains within an aerial-view localization setup, simulated across vast areas at different times of the year.

- **Summary**: In saliency detection, every pixel needs contextual information to make saliency prediction. Previous models usually incorporate contexts holistically. However, for each pixel, usually only part of its context region is useful and contributes to its prediction, while some other part may serve as noises and distractions. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-wise contextual attention network, \ie PiCANet, to learn to selectively attend to informative context locations at each pixel. Specifically, PiCANet generates an attention map over the context region of each pixel, where each attention weight corresponds to the relevance of a context location w.r.t the referred pixel. Then, attentive contextual features can be constructed via selectively incorporating the features of useful context locations with the learned attention. We propose three specific formulations of the PiCANet via embedding the pixel-wise contextual attention mechanism into the pooling and convolution operations with attending to global or local contexts. All the three models are fully differentiable and can be integrated with CNNs with joint training. We introduce the proposed PiCANets into a U-Net architecture for salient object detection. Experimental results indicate that the proposed PiCANets can significantly improve the saliency detection performance. The generated global and local attention can learn to incorporate global contrast and smoothness, respectively, which help localize salient objects more accurately and highlight them more uniformly. Consequently, our saliency model performs favorably against other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we also validate that PiCANets can also improve semantic segmentation and object detection performances, which further demonstrates their effectiveness and generalization ability.

- **Summary**: The Euclidean scattering transform was introduced nearly a decade ago to improve the mathematical understanding of the success of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) in image data analysis and other tasks. Inspired by recent interest in geometric deep learning, which aims to generalize ConvNets to manifold and graph-structured domains, we generalize the scattering transform to compact manifolds. Similar to the Euclidean scattering transform, our geometric scattering transform is based on a cascade of designed filters and pointwise nonlinearities, which enables rigorous analysis of the feature extraction provided by scattering layers. Our main focus here is on theoretical understanding of this geometric scattering network, while setting aside implementation aspects, although we remark that application of similar transforms to graph data analysis has been studied recently in related work. Our results establish conditions under which geometric scattering provides localized isometry invariant descriptions of manifold signals, which are also stable to families of diffeomorphisms formulated in intrinsic manifolds terms. These results not only generalize the deformation stability and local roto-translation invariance of Euclidean scattering, but also demonstrate the importance of linking the used filter structures (e.g., in geometric deep learning) to the underlying manifold geometry, or the data geometry it represents.

- **Summary**: Can learning to measure the quality of an action help in measuring the quality of other actions? If so, can consolidated samples from multiple actions help improve the performance of current approaches? In this paper, we carry out experiments to see if knowledge transfer is possible in the action quality assessment (AQA) setting. Experiments are carried out on our newly released AQA dataset (http://rtis.oit.unlv.edu/datasets.html) consisting of 1106 action samples from seven actions with quality scores as measured by expert human judges. Our experimental results show that there is utility in learning a single model across multiple actions.

- **Summary**: Omnidirectional video enables spherical stimuli with the $360 \times 180^ \circ$ viewing range. Meanwhile, only the viewport region of omnidirectional video can be seen by the observer through head movement (HM), and an even smaller region within the viewport can be clearly perceived through eye movement (EM). Thus, the subjective quality of omnidirectional video may be correlated with HM and EM of human behavior. To fill in the gap between subjective quality and human behavior, this paper proposes a large-scale visual quality assessment (VQA) dataset of omnidirectional video, called VQA-OV, which collects 60 reference sequences and 540 impaired sequences. Our VQA-OV dataset provides not only the subjective quality scores of sequences but also the HM and EM data of subjects. By mining our dataset, we find that the subjective quality of omnidirectional video is indeed related to HM and EM. Hence, we develop a deep learning model, which embeds HM and EM, for objective VQA on omnidirectional video. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance of VQA on omnidirectional video.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper studies the challenging problem of fingerprint image denoising and inpainting. To tackle the challenge of suppressing complicated artifacts (blur, brightness, contrast, elastic transformation, occlusion, scratch, resolution, rotation, and so on) while preserving fine textures, we develop a multi-scale convolutional network, termed U- Finger. Based on the domain expertise, we show that the usage of dilated convolutions as well as the removal of padding have important positive impacts on the final restoration performance, in addition to multi-scale cascaded feature modules. Our model achieves the overall ranking of No.2 in the ECCV 2018 Chalearn LAP Inpainting Competition Track 3 (Fingerprint Denoising and Inpainting). Among all participating teams, we obtain the MSE of 0.0231 (rank 2), PSNR 16.9688 dB (rank 2), and SSIM 0.8093 (rank 3) on the hold-out testing set.

- **Summary**: We consider an active visual exploration scenario, where an agent must intelligently select its camera motions to efficiently reconstruct the full environment from only a limited set of narrow field-of-view glimpses. While the agent has full observability of the environment during training, it has only partial observability once deployed, being constrained by what portions it has seen and what camera motions are permissible. We introduce sidekick policy learning to capitalize on this imbalance of observability. The main idea is a preparatory learning phase that attempts simplified versions of the eventual exploration task, then guides the agent via reward shaping or initial policy supervision. To support interpretation of the resulting policies, we also develop a novel policy visualization technique. Results on active visual exploration tasks with 360 scenes and 3D objects show that sidekicks consistently improve performance and convergence rates over existing methods. Code, data and demos are available.

- **Summary**: Object detection has made great progress in the past few years along with the development of deep learning. However, most current object detection methods are resource hungry, which hinders their wide deployment to many resource restricted usages such as usages on always-on devices, battery-powered low-end devices, etc. This paper considers the resource and accuracy trade-off for resource-restricted usages during designing the whole object detection framework. Based on the deeply supervised object detection (DSOD) framework, we propose Tiny-DSOD dedicating to resource-restricted usages. Tiny-DSOD introduces two innovative and ultra-efficient architecture blocks: depthwise dense block (DDB) based backbone and depthwise feature-pyramid-network (D-FPN) based front-end. We conduct extensive experiments on three famous benchmarks (PASCAL VOC 2007, KITTI, and COCO), and compare Tiny-DSOD to the state-of-the-art ultra-efficient object detection solutions such as Tiny-YOLO, MobileNet-SSD (v1 & v2), SqueezeDet, Pelee, etc. Results show that Tiny-DSOD outperforms these solutions in all the three metrics (parameter-size, FLOPs, accuracy) in each comparison. For instance, Tiny-DSOD achieves 72.1% mAP with only 0.95M parameters and 1.06B FLOPs, which is by far the state-of-the-arts result with such a low resource requirement.

- **Summary**: Automated Computer Aided diagnostic tools can be used for the early detection of glaucoma to prevent irreversible vision loss. In this work, we present a Multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that jointly segments the Optic Disc (OD), Optic Cup (OC) and predicts the presence of glaucoma in color fundus images. The CNN utilizes a combination of image appearance features and structural features obtained from the OD-OC segmentation to obtain a robust prediction. The use of fewer network parameters and the sharing of the CNN features for multiple related tasks ensures the good generalizability of the architecture, allowing it to be trained on small training sets. The cross-testing performance of the proposed method on an independent validation set acquired using a different camera and image resolution was found to be good with an average dice score of 0.92 for OD, 0.84 for OC and AUC of 0.95 on the task of glaucoma classification illustrating its potential as a mass screening tool for the early detection of glaucoma.

- **Summary**: Purpose: The suppression of motion artefacts from MR images is a challenging task. The purpose of this paper is to develop a standalone novel technique to suppress motion artefacts from MR images using a data-driven deep learning approach. Methods: A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to remove motion artefacts in brain MR images. A CNN was trained on simulated motion corrupted images to identify and suppress artefacts due to the motion. The network was an encoder-decoder CNN architecture where the encoder decomposed the motion corrupted images into a set of feature maps. The feature maps were then combined by the decoder network to generate a motion-corrected image. The network was tested on an unseen simulated dataset and an experimental, motion corrupted in vivo brain dataset. Results: The trained network was able to suppress the motion artefacts in the simulated motion corrupted images, and the mean percentage error in the motion corrected images was 2.69 % with a standard deviation of 0.95 %. The network was able to effectively suppress the motion artefacts from the experimental dataset, demonstrating the generalisation capability of the trained network. Conclusion: A novel and generic motion correction technique has been developed that can suppress motion artefacts from motion corrupted MR images. The proposed technique is a standalone post-processing method that does not interfere with data acquisition or reconstruction parameters, thus making it suitable for a multitude of MR sequences.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel 3D spatial representation for data fusion and scene reconstruction. Probabilistic Signed Distance Function (Probabilistic SDF, PSDF) is proposed to depict uncertainties in the 3D space. It is modeled by a joint distribution describing SDF value and its inlier probability, reflecting input data quality and surface geometry. A hybrid data structure involving voxel, surfel, and mesh is designed to fully exploit the advantages of various prevalent 3D representations. Connected by PSDF, these components reasonably cooperate in a consistent frame- work. Given sequential depth measurements, PSDF can be incrementally refined with less ad hoc parametric Bayesian updating. Supported by PSDF and the efficient 3D data representation, high-quality surfaces can be extracted on-the-fly, and in return contribute to reliable data fu- sion using the geometry information. Experiments demonstrate that our system reconstructs scenes with higher model quality and lower redundancy, and runs faster than existing online mesh generation systems.

- **Summary**: Recently, enthusiastic studies have devoted to texture synthesis using deep neural networks, because these networks excel at handling complex patterns in images. In these models, second-order statistics, such as Gram matrix, are used to describe textures. Despite the fact that these model have achieved promising results, the structure of their parametric space is still unclear, consequently, it is difficult to use them to mix textures. This paper addresses the texture mixing problem by using a Gaussian scheme to interpolate deep statistics computed from deep neural networks. More precisely, we first reveal that the statistics used in existing deep models can be unified using a stationary Gaussian scheme. We then present a novel algorithm to mix these statistics by interpolating between Gaussian models using optimal transport. We further apply our scheme to Neural Style Transfer, where we can create mixed styles. The experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results. Because all the computations are implemented in closed forms, our mixing algorithm adds only negligible time to the original texture synthesis procedure.

- **Summary**: Uncertainty estimation in deep learning becomes more important recently. A deep learning model can't be applied in real applications if we don't know whether the model is certain about the decision or not. Some literature proposes the Bayesian neural network which can estimate the uncertainty by Monte Carlo Dropout (MC dropout). However, MC dropout needs to forward the model $N$ times which results in $N$ times slower. For real-time applications such as a self-driving car system, which needs to obtain the prediction and the uncertainty as fast as possible, so that MC dropout becomes impractical. In this work, we propose the region-based temporal aggregation (RTA) method which leverages the temporal information in videos to simulate the sampling procedure. Our RTA method with Tiramisu backbone is 10x faster than the MC dropout with Tiramisu backbone ($N=5$). Furthermore, the uncertainty estimation obtained by our RTA method is comparable to MC dropout's uncertainty estimation on pixel-level and frame-level metrics.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification is indeed a challenging visual recognition task due to the critical issues of human pose variation, human body occlusion, camera view variation, etc. To address this, most of the state-of-the-art approaches are proposed based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN), being leveraged by its strong feature learning power and classification boundary fitting capacity. Although the vital role towards person re-identification, how to build effective CNN baseline model has not been well studied yet. To answer this open question, we propose 3 good practices in this paper from the perspectives of adjusting CNN architecture and training procedure. In particular, they are adding batch normalization after the global pooling layer, executing identity categorization directly using only one fully-connected, and using Adam as optimizer. The extensive experiments on 3 widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that, our propositions essentially facilitate the CNN baseline model to achieve the state-of-the-art performance without any other high-level domain knowledge or low-level technical trick.

- **Summary**: Correlation filter (CF) based trackers generally include two modules, i.e., feature representation and on-line model adaptation. In existing off-line deep learning models for CF trackers, the model adaptation usually is either abandoned or has closed-form solution to make it feasible to learn deep representation in an end-to-end manner. However, such solutions fail to exploit the advances in CF models, and cannot achieve competitive accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art CF trackers. In this paper, we investigate the joint learning of deep representation and model adaptation, where an updater network is introduced for better tracking on future frame by taking current frame representation, tracking result, and last CF tracker as input. By modeling the representor as convolutional neural network (CNN), we truncate the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and interpret it as a deep network of updater, resulting in our model for learning representation and truncated inference (RTINet). Experiments demonstrate that our RTINet tracker achieves favorable tracking accuracy against the state-of-the-art trackers and its rapid version can run at a real-time speed of 24 fps. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/tourmaline612/RTINet.

- **Summary**: Single image rain removal is a typical inverse problem in computer vision. The deep learning technique has been verified to be effective for this task and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, previous deep learning methods need to pre-collect a large set of image pairs with/without synthesized rain for training, which tends to make the neural network be biased toward learning the specific patterns of the synthesized rain, while be less able to generalize to real test samples whose rain types differ from those in the training data. To this issue, this paper firstly proposes a semi-supervised learning paradigm toward this task. Different from traditional deep learning methods which only use supervised image pairs with/without synthesized rain, we further put real rainy images, without need of their clean ones, into the network training process. This is realized by elaborately formulating the residual between an input rainy image and its expected network output (clear image without rain) as a specific parametrized rain streaks distribution. The network is therefore trained to adapt real unsupervised diverse rain types through transferring from the supervised synthesized rain, and thus both the short-of-training-sample and bias-to-supervised-sample issues can be evidently alleviated. Experiments on synthetic and real data verify the superiority of our model compared to the state-of-the-arts.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present a novel learning-based framework for face reenactment. The proposed method, known as ReenactGAN, is capable of transferring facial movements and expressions from monocular video input of an arbitrary person to a target person. Instead of performing a direct transfer in the pixel space, which could result in structural artifacts, we first map the source face onto a boundary latent space. A transformer is subsequently used to adapt the boundary of source face to the boundary of target face. Finally, a target-specific decoder is used to generate the reenacted target face. Thanks to the effective and reliable boundary-based transfer, our method can perform photo-realistic face reenactment. In addition, ReenactGAN is appealing in that the whole reenactment process is purely feed-forward, and thus the reenactment process can run in real-time (30 FPS on one GTX 1080 GPU). Dataset and model will be publicly available at https://wywu.github.io/projects/ReenactGAN/ReenactGAN.html

- **Summary**: 3D reconstruction of the fiber connectivity of the rat brain at microscopic scale enables gaining detailed insight about the complex structural organization of the brain. We introduce a new method for registration and 3D reconstruction of high- and ultra-high resolution (64 $\mu$m and 1.3 $\mu$m pixel size) histological images of a Wistar rat brain acquired by 3D polarized light imaging (3D-PLI). Our method exploits multi-scale and multi-modal 3D-PLI data up to cellular resolution. We propose a new feature transform-based similarity measure and a weighted regularization scheme for accurate and robust non-rigid registration. To transform the 1.3 $\mu$m ultra-high resolution data to the reference blockface images a feature-based registration method followed by a non-rigid registration is proposed. Our approach has been successfully applied to 278 histological sections of a rat brain and the performance has been quantitatively evaluated using manually placed landmarks by an expert.

- **Summary**: Vocal tract configurations play a vital role in generating distinguishable speech sounds, by modulating the airflow and creating different resonant cavities in speech production. They contain abundant information that can be utilized to better understand the underlying speech production mechanism. As a step towards automatic mapping of vocal tract shape geometry to acoustics, this paper employs effective video action recognition techniques, like Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCN) models, to identify different vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) sequences from dynamic shaping of the vocal tract. Such a model typically combines a CNN based deep hierarchical visual feature extractor with Recurrent Networks, that ideally makes the network spatio-temporally deep enough to learn the sequential dynamics of a short video clip for video classification tasks. We use a database consisting of 2D real-time MRI of vocal tract shaping during VCV utterances by 17 speakers. The comparative performances of this class of algorithms under various parameter settings and for various classification tasks are discussed. Interestingly, the results show a marked difference in the model performance in the context of speech classification with respect to generic sequence or video classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Weight pruning methods of DNNs have been demonstrated to achieve a good model pruning rate without loss of accuracy, thereby alleviating the significant computation/storage requirements of large-scale DNNs. Structured weight pruning methods have been proposed to overcome the limitation of irregular network structure and demonstrated actual GPU acceleration. However, in prior work the pruning rate (degree of sparsity) and GPU acceleration are limited (to less than 50%) when accuracy needs to be maintained. In this work,we overcome these limitations by proposing a unified, systematic framework of structured weight pruning for DNNs. It is a framework that can be used to induce different types of structured sparsity, such as filter-wise, channel-wise, and shape-wise sparsity, as well non-structured sparsity. The proposed framework incorporates stochastic gradient descent with ADMM, and can be understood as a dynamic regularization method in which the regularization target is analytically updated in each iteration. Without loss of accuracy on the AlexNet model, we achieve 2.58X and 3.65X average measured speedup on two GPUs, clearly outperforming the prior work. The average speedups reach 3.15X and 8.52X when allowing a moderate ac-curacy loss of 2%. In this case the model compression for convolutional layers is 15.0X, corresponding to 11.93X measured CPU speedup. Our experiments on ResNet model and on other data sets like UCF101 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate the consistently higher performance of our framework.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks have led to significant breakthroughs in the domain of medical image analysis. However, the task of breast cancer segmentation in whole-slide images (WSIs) is still underexplored. WSIs are large histopathological images with extremely high resolution. Constrained by the hardware and field of view, using high-magnification patches can slow down the inference process and using low-magnification patches can cause the loss of information. In this paper, we aim to achieve two seemingly conflicting goals for breast cancer segmentation: accurate and fast prediction. We propose a simple yet efficient framework Reinforced Auto-Zoom Net (RAZN) to tackle this task. Motivated by the zoom-in operation of a pathologist using a digital microscope, RAZN learns a policy network to decide whether zooming is required in a given region of interest. Because the zoom-in action is selective, RAZN is robust to unbalanced and noisy ground truth labels and can efficiently reduce overfitting. We evaluate our method on a public breast cancer dataset. RAZN outperforms both single-scale and multi-scale baseline approaches, achieving better accuracy at low inference cost.

- **Summary**: In order to resonate with the viewers, many video advertisements explore creative narrative techniques such as "Freytag's pyramid" where a story begins with exposition, followed by rising action, then climax, concluding with denouement. In the dramatic structure of ads in particular, climax depends on changes in sentiment. We dedicate our study to understand the dynamic structure of video ads automatically. To achieve this, we first crowdsource climax annotations on 1,149 videos from the Video Ads Dataset, which already provides sentiment annotations. We then use both unsupervised and supervised methods to predict the climax. Based on the predicted peak, the low-level visual and audio cues, and semantically meaningful context features, we build a sentiment prediction model that outperforms the current state-of-the-art model of sentiment prediction in video ads by 25%. In our ablation study, we show that using our context features, and modeling dynamics with an LSTM, are both crucial factors for improved performance.

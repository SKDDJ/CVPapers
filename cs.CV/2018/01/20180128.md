- **Summary**: Activity detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Detecting activities of different temporal scales is particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose the contextual multi-scale region convolutional 3D network (CMS-RC3D) for activity detection. To deal with the inherent temporal scale variability of activity instances, the temporal feature pyramid is used to represent activities of different temporal scales. On each level of the temporal feature pyramid, an activity proposal detector and an activity classifier are learned to detect activities of specific temporal scales. Temporal contextual information is fused into activity classifiers for better recognition. More importantly, the entire model at all levels can be trained end-to-end. Our CMS-RC3D detector can deal with activities at all temporal scale ranges with only a single pass through the backbone network. We test our detector on two public activity detection benchmarks, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet. Extensive experiments show that the proposed CMS-RC3D detector outperforms state-of-the-art methods on THUMOS14 by a substantial margin and achieves comparable results on ActivityNet despite using a shallow feature extractor.

- **Summary**: Malaria is mosquito-borne blood disease caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Conventional diagnostic tool for malaria is the examination of stained blood cell of patient in microscope. The blood to be tested is placed in a slide and is observed under a microscope to count the number of infected RBC. An expert technician is involved in the examination of the slide with intense visual and mental concentration. This is tiresome and time consuming process.   In this paper, we construct a new mage processing system for detection and quantification of plasmodium parasites in blood smear slide, later we develop Machine Learning algorithm to learn, detect and determine the types of infected cells according to its features.

- **Summary**: Despite the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image generation, the trade-off between visual quality and image diversity remains a significant issue. This paper achieves both aims simultaneously by improving the stability of training GANs. The key idea of the proposed approach is to implicitly regularize the discriminator using representative features. Focusing on the fact that standard GAN minimizes reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, we transfer the representative feature, which is extracted from the data distribution using a pre-trained autoencoder (AE), to the discriminator of standard GANs. Because the AE learns to minimize forward KL divergence, our GAN training with representative features is influenced by both reverse and forward KL divergence. Consequently, the proposed approach is verified to improve visual quality and diversity of state of the art GANs using extensive evaluations.

- **Summary**: This paper derives new formulations for designing dominant pole placement based proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers to handle second order processes with time delays (SOPTD). Previously, similar attempts have been made for pole placement in delay-free systems. The presence of the time delay term manifests itself as a higher order system with variable number of interlaced poles and zeros upon Pade approximation, which makes it difficult to achieve precise pole placement control. We here report the analytical expressions to constrain the closed loop dominant and non-dominant poles at the desired locations in the complex s-plane, using a third order Pade approximation for the delay term. However, invariance of the closed loop performance with different time delay approximation has also been verified using increasing order of Pade, representing a closed to reality higher order delay dynamics. The choice of the nature of non-dominant poles e.g. all being complex, real or a combination of them modifies the characteristic equation and influences the achievable stability regions. The effect of different types of non-dominant poles and the corresponding stability regions are obtained for nine test-bench processes indicating different levels of open-loop damping and lag to delay ratio. Next, we investigate which expression yields a wider stability region in the design parameter space by using Monte Carlo simulations while uniformly sampling a chosen design parameter space. Various time and frequency domain control performance parameters are investigated next, as well as their deviations with uncertain process parameters, using thousands of Monte Carlo simulations, around the robust stable solution for each of the nine test-bench processes.

- **Summary**: 3D face shape is more expressive and viewpoint-consistent than its 2D counterpart. However, 3D facial landmark localization in a single image is challenging due to the ambiguous nature of landmarks under 3D perspective. Existing approaches typically adopt a suboptimal two-step strategy, performing 2D landmark localization followed by depth estimation. In this paper, we propose the Joint Voxel and Coordinate Regression (JVCR) method for 3D facial landmark localization, addressing it more effectively in an end-to-end fashion. First, a compact volumetric representation is proposed to encode the per-voxel likelihood of positions being the 3D landmarks. The dimensionality of such a representation is fixed regardless of the number of target landmarks, so that the curse of dimensionality could be avoided. Then, a stacked hourglass network is adopted to estimate the volumetric representation from coarse to fine, followed by a 3D convolution network that takes the estimated volume as input and regresses 3D coordinates of the face shape. In this way, the 3D structural constraints between landmarks could be learned by the neural network in a more efficient manner. Moreover, the proposed pipeline enables end-to-end training and improves the robustness and accuracy of 3D facial landmark localization. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the 3DFAW and AFLW2000-3D datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with existing methods.

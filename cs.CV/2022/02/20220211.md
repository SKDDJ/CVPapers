- **Summary**: Contrast Sensitivity of the human visual system can be explained from certain low-level vision tasks (like retinal noise and optical blur removal), but not from others (like chromatic adaptation or pure reconstruction after simple bottlenecks). This conclusion still holds even under substantial change in stimulus statistics, as for instance considering cartoon-like images as opposed to natural images (Li et al. Journal of Vision, 2022, Preprint arXiv:2103.00481).   In this note we present a method to generate original cartoon-like images compatible with the statistical training used in (Li et al., 2022). Following the classical observation in (Magritte, 1929), the stimuli generated by the proposed method certainly are not what they represent: Ceci n'est pas une pipe. The clear distinction between representation (the stimuli generated by the proposed method) and reality (the actual object) avoids eventual problems for the use of the generated stimuli in academic, non-profit, publications.

- **Summary**: Knee pain is undoubtedly the most common musculoskeletal symptom that impairs quality of life, confines mobility and functionality across all ages. Knee pain is clinically evaluated by routine radiographs, where the widespread adoption of radiographic images and their availability at low cost, make them the principle component in the assessment of knee pain and knee pathologies, such as arthritis, trauma, and sport injuries. However, interpretation of the knee radiographs is still highly subjective, and overlapping structures within the radiographs and the large volume of images needing to be analyzed on a daily basis, make interpretation challenging for both naive and experienced practitioners. There is thus a need to implement an artificial intelligence strategy to objectively and automatically interpret knee radiographs, facilitating triage of abnormal radiographs in a timely fashion. The current work proposes an accurate and effective pipeline for autonomous detection, localization, and classification of knee joint area in plain radiographs combining the You Only Look Once (YOLO v3) deep convolutional neural network with a large and fully-annotated knee radiographs dataset. The present work is expected to stimulate more interest from the deep learning computer vision community to this pragmatic and clinical application.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art sign language generation frameworks lack expressivity and naturalness which is the result of only focusing manual signs, neglecting the affective, grammatical and semantic functions of facial expressions. The purpose of this work is to augment semantic representation of sign language through grounding facial expressions. We study the effect of modeling the relationship between text, gloss, and facial expressions on the performance of the sign generation systems. In particular, we propose a Dual Encoder Transformer able to generate manual signs as well as facial expressions by capturing the similarities and differences found in text and sign gloss annotation. We take into consideration the role of facial muscle activity to express intensities of manual signs by being the first to employ facial action units in sign language generation. We perform a series of experiments showing that our proposed model improves the quality of automatically generated sign language.

- **Summary**: This work proposes a minimal computational model for learning structured memories of multiple object classes in an incremental setting. Our approach is based on establishing a closed-loop transcription between the classes and a corresponding set of subspaces, known as a linear discriminative representation, in a low-dimensional feature space. Our method is simpler than existing approaches for incremental learning, and more efficient in terms of model size, storage, and computation: it requires only a single, fixed-capacity autoencoding network with a feature space that is used for both discriminative and generative purposes. Network parameters are optimized simultaneously without architectural manipulations, by solving a constrained minimax game between the encoding and decoding maps over a single rate reduction-based objective. Experimental results show that our method can effectively alleviate catastrophic forgetting, achieving significantly better performance than prior work of generative replay on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-50, despite requiring fewer resources.

- **Summary**: Recent research that applies Transformer-based architectures to image captioning has resulted in state-of-the-art image captioning performance, capitalising on the success of Transformers on natural language tasks. Unfortunately, though these models work well, one major flaw is their large model sizes. To this end, we present three parameter reduction methods for image captioning Transformers: Radix Encoding, cross-layer parameter sharing, and attention parameter sharing. By combining these methods, our proposed ACORT models have 3.7x to 21.6x fewer parameters than the baseline model without compromising test performance. Results on the MS-COCO dataset demonstrate that our ACORT models are competitive against baselines and SOTA approaches, with CIDEr score >=126. Finally, we present qualitative results and ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed changes further. Code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/jiahuei/sparse-image-captioning.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZSSBIR), as a popular studied branch of computer vision, attracts wide attention recently. Unlike sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), the main aim of ZSSBIR is to retrieve natural images given free hand-drawn sketches that may not appear during training. Previous approaches used semantic aligned sketch-image pairs or utilized memory expensive fusion layer for projecting the visual information to a low dimensional subspace, which ignores the significant heterogeneous cross-domain discrepancy between highly abstract sketch and relevant image. This may yield poor performance in the training phase. To tackle this issue and overcome this drawback, we propose a Wasserstein distance based cross-modal semantic network (WAD-CMSN) for ZSSBIR. Specifically, it first projects the visual information of each branch (sketch, image) to a common low dimensional semantic subspace via Wasserstein distance in an adversarial training manner. Furthermore, identity matching loss is employed to select useful features, which can not only capture complete semantic knowledge, but also alleviate the over-fitting phenomenon caused by the WAD-CMSN model. Experimental results on the challenging Sketchy (Extended) and TU-Berlin (Extended) datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed WAD-CMSN model over several competitors.

- **Summary**: The continuous increase in the use of social media and the visual content on the internet have accelerated the research in computer vision field in general and the image captioning task in specific. The process of generating a caption that best describes an image is a useful task for various applications such as it can be used in image indexing and as a hearing aid for the visually impaired. In recent years, the image captioning task has witnessed remarkable advances regarding both datasets and architectures, and as a result, the captioning quality has reached an astounding performance. However, the majority of these advances especially in datasets are targeted for English, which left other languages such as Arabic lagging behind. Although Arabic language, being spoken by more than 450 million people and being the most growing language on the internet, lacks the fundamental pillars it needs to advance its image captioning research, such as benchmarks or unified datasets. This works is an attempt to expedite the synergy in this task by providing unified datasets and benchmarks, while also exploring methods and techniques that could enhance the performance of Arabic image captioning. The use of multi-task learning is explored, alongside exploring various word representations and different features. The results showed that the use of multi-task learning and pre-trained word embeddings noticeably enhanced the quality of image captioning, however the presented results shows that Arabic captioning still lags behind when compared to the English language.

- **Summary**: Targeted for real world scenarios, online continual learning aims to learn new tasks from sequentially available data under the condition that each data is observed only once by the learner. Though recent works have made remarkable achievements by storing part of learned task data as exemplars for knowledge replay, the performance is greatly relied on the size of stored exemplars while the storage consumption is a significant constraint in continual learning. In addition, storing exemplars may not always be feasible for certain applications due to privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel exemplar-free method by leveraging nearest-class-mean (NCM) classifier where the class mean is estimated during training phase on all data seen so far through online mean update criteria. We focus on image classification task and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-100 and Food-1k. The results demonstrate that our method without using any exemplar outperforms state-of-the-art exemplar-based approaches with large margins under standard protocol (20 exemplars per class) and is able to achieve competitive performance even with larger exemplar size (100 exemplars per class).

- **Journal**: International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)
- **Summary**: One critical component in lossy deep image compression is the entropy model, which predicts the probability distribution of the quantized latent representation in the encoding and decoding modules. Previous works build entropy models upon convolutional neural networks which are inefficient in capturing global dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based entropy model, termed Entroformer, to capture long-range dependencies in probability distribution estimation effectively and efficiently. Different from vision transformers in image classification, the Entroformer is highly optimized for image compression, including a top-k self-attention and a diamond relative position encoding. Meanwhile, we further expand this architecture with a parallel bidirectional context model to speed up the decoding process. The experiments show that the Entroformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image compression while being time-efficient.

- **Summary**: Imitation learning is employed to learn sensorimotor coordination for steering angle prediction in an end-to-end fashion requires expert demonstrations. These expert demonstrations are paired with environmental perception and vehicle control data. The conventional frame-based RGB camera is the most common exteroceptive sensor modality used to acquire the environmental perception data. The frame-based RGB camera has produced promising results when used as a single modality in learning end-to-end lateral control. However, the conventional frame-based RGB camera has limited operability in illumination variation conditions and is affected by the motion blur. The event camera provides complementary information to the frame-based RGB camera. This work explores the fusion of frame-based RGB and event data for learning end-to-end lateral control by predicting steering angle. In addition, how the representation from event data fuse with frame-based RGB data helps to predict the lateral control robustly for the autonomous vehicle. To this end, we propose DRFuser, a novel convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for learning end-to-end lateral control. The encoder module is branched between the frame-based RGB data and event data along with the self-attention layers. Moreover, this study has also contributed to our own collected dataset comprised of event, frame-based RGB, and vehicle control data. The efficacy of the proposed method is experimentally evaluated on our collected dataset, Davis Driving dataset (DDD), and Carla Eventscape dataset. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method DRFuser outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) used as evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Text spotting end-to-end methods have recently gained attention in the literature due to the benefits of jointly optimizing the text detection and recognition components. Existing methods usually have a distinct separation between the detection and recognition branches, requiring exact annotations for the two tasks. We introduce TextTranSpotter (TTS), a transformer-based approach for text spotting and the first text spotting framework which may be trained with both fully- and weakly-supervised settings. By learning a single latent representation per word detection, and using a novel loss function based on the Hungarian loss, our method alleviates the need for expensive localization annotations. Trained with only text transcription annotations on real data, our weakly-supervised method achieves competitive performance with previous state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods. When trained in a fully-supervised manner, TextTranSpotter shows state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Motion estimation and motion compensation are indispensable parts of inter prediction in video coding. Since the motion vector of objects is mostly in fractional pixel units, original reference pictures may not accurately provide a suitable reference for motion compensation. In this paper, we propose a deep reference picture generator which can create a picture that is more relevant to the current encoding frame, thereby further reducing temporal redundancy and improving video compression efficiency. Inspired by the recent progress of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), this paper proposes to use a dilated CNN to build the generator. Moreover, we insert the generated deep picture into Versatile Video Coding(VVC) as a reference picture and perform a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our network on the latest VVC Test Model VTM. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves on average 9.7% bit saving compared with VVC under low-delay P configuration.

- **Summary**: Recently, Deep Learning-based methods for inverse tone-mapping standard dynamic range (SDR) images to obtain high dynamic range (HDR) images have become very popular. These methods manage to fill over-exposed areas convincingly both in terms of details and dynamic range. Typically, these methods, to be effective, need to learn from large datasets and to transfer this knowledge to the network weights. In this work, we tackle this problem from a completely different perspective. What can we learn from a single SDR video? With the presented zero-shot approach, we show that, in many cases, a single SDR video is sufficient to be able to generate an HDR video of the same quality or better than other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Authors of posts in social media communicate their emotions and what causes them with text and images. While there is work on emotion and stimulus detection for each modality separately, it is yet unknown if the modalities contain complementary emotion information in social media. We aim at filling this research gap and contribute a novel, annotated corpus of English multimodal Reddit posts. On this resource, we develop models to automatically detect the relation between image and text, an emotion stimulus category and the emotion class. We evaluate if these tasks require both modalities and find for the image-text relations, that text alone is sufficient for most categories (complementary, illustrative, opposing): the information in the text allows to predict if an image is required for emotion understanding. The emotions of anger and sadness are best predicted with a multimodal model, while text alone is sufficient for disgust, joy, and surprise. Stimuli depicted by objects, animals, food, or a person are best predicted by image-only models, while multimodal models are most effective on art, events, memes, places, or screenshots.

- **Summary**: Production-level workflows for producing convincing 3D dynamic human faces have long relied on an assortment of labor-intensive tools for geometry and texture generation, motion capture and rigging, and expression synthesis. Recent neural approaches automate individual components but the corresponding latent representations cannot provide artists with explicit controls as in conventional tools. In this paper, we present a new learning-based, video-driven approach for generating dynamic facial geometries with high-quality physically-based assets. For data collection, we construct a hybrid multiview-photometric capture stage, coupling with ultra-fast video cameras to obtain raw 3D facial assets. We then set out to model the facial expression, geometry and physically-based textures using separate VAEs where we impose a global MLP based expression mapping across the latent spaces of respective networks, to preserve characteristics across respective attributes. We also model the delta information as wrinkle maps for the physically-based textures, achieving high-quality 4K dynamic textures. We demonstrate our approach in high-fidelity performer-specific facial capture and cross-identity facial motion retargeting. In addition, our multi-VAE-based neural asset, along with the fast adaptation schemes, can also be deployed to handle in-the-wild videos. Besides, we motivate the utility of our explicit facial disentangling strategy by providing various promising physically-based editing results with high realism. Comprehensive experiments show that our technique provides higher accuracy and visual fidelity than previous video-driven facial reconstruction and animation methods.

- **Summary**: Image inpainting is a restoration method that reconstructs missing image parts. However, a carefully selected mask of known pixels that yield a high quality inpainting can also act as a sparse image representation. This challenging spatial optimisation problem is essential for practical applications such as compression. So far, it has been almost exclusively adressed by model-based approaches. First attempts with neural networks seem promising, but are tailored towards specific inpainting operators or require postprocessing.   To address this issue, we propose the first generative adversarial network (GAN) for spatial inpainting data optimisation. In contrast to previous approaches, it allows joint training of an inpainting generator and a corresponding mask optimisation network. With a Wasserstein distance, we ensure that our inpainting results accurately reflect the statistics of natural images. This yields significant improvements in visual quality and speed over conventional stochastic models. It also outperforms current spatial optimisation networks.

- **Summary**: We, humans, are entering into a virtual era and indeed want to bring animals to the virtual world as well for companion. Yet, computer-generated (CGI) furry animals are limited by tedious off-line rendering, let alone interactive motion control. In this paper, we present ARTEMIS, a novel neural modeling and rendering pipeline for generating ARTiculated neural pets with appEarance and Motion synthesIS. Our ARTEMIS enables interactive motion control, real-time animation, and photo-realistic rendering of furry animals. The core of our ARTEMIS is a neural-generated (NGI) animal engine, which adopts an efficient octree-based representation for animal animation and fur rendering. The animation then becomes equivalent to voxel-level deformation based on explicit skeletal warping. We further use a fast octree indexing and efficient volumetric rendering scheme to generate appearance and density features maps. Finally, we propose a novel shading network to generate high-fidelity details of appearance and opacity under novel poses from appearance and density feature maps. For the motion control module in ARTEMIS, we combine state-of-the-art animal motion capture approach with recent neural character control scheme. We introduce an effective optimization scheme to reconstruct the skeletal motion of real animals captured by a multi-view RGB and Vicon camera array. We feed all the captured motion into a neural character control scheme to generate abstract control signals with motion styles. We further integrate ARTEMIS into existing engines that support VR headsets, providing an unprecedented immersive experience where a user can intimately interact with a variety of virtual animals with vivid movements and photo-realistic appearance. We make available our ARTEMIS model and dynamic furry animal dataset at https://haiminluo.github.io/publication/artemis/.

- **Summary**: We propose an automatic framework for toll collection, consisting of three steps: vehicle type recognition, license plate localization, and reading. However, each of the three steps becomes non-trivial due to image variations caused by several factors. The traditional vehicle decorations on the front cause variations among vehicles of the same type. These decorations make license plate localization and recognition difficult due to severe background clutter and partial occlusions. Likewise, on most vehicles, specifically trucks, the position of the license plate is not consistent. Lastly, for license plate reading, the variations are induced by non-uniform font styles, sizes, and partially occluded letters and numbers. Our proposed framework takes advantage of both data availability and performance evaluation of the backbone deep learning architectures. We gather a novel dataset, \emph{Diverse Vehicle and License Plates Dataset (DVLPD)}, consisting of 10k images belonging to six vehicle types. Each image is then manually annotated for vehicle type, license plate, and its characters and digits. For each of the three tasks, we evaluate You Only Look Once (YOLO)v2, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and FasterRCNN. For real-time implementation on a Raspberry Pi, we evaluate the lighter versions of YOLO named Tiny YOLOv3 and Tiny YOLOv4. The best Mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 98.8% for vehicle type recognition, 98.5% for license plate detection, and 98.3% for license plate reading is achieved by YOLOv4, while its lighter version, i.e., Tiny YOLOv4 obtained a mAP of 97.1%, 97.4%, and 93.7% on vehicle type recognition, license plate detection, and license plate reading, respectively.

- **Summary**: Tiny objects, frequently appearing in practical applications, have weak appearance and features, and receive increasing interests in meany vision tasks, such as object detection and segmentation. To promote the research and development of tiny object tracking, we create a large-scale video dataset, which contains 434 sequences with a total of more than 217K frames. Each frame is carefully annotated with a high-quality bounding box. In data creation, we take 12 challenge attributes into account to cover a broad range of viewpoints and scene complexities, and annotate these attributes for facilitating the attribute-based performance analysis. To provide a strong baseline in tiny object tracking, we propose a novel Multilevel Knowledge Distillation Network (MKDNet), which pursues three-level knowledge distillations in a unified framework to effectively enhance the feature representation, discrimination and localization abilities in tracking tiny objects. Extensive experiments are performed on the proposed dataset, and the results prove the superiority and effectiveness of MKDNet compared with state-of-the-art methods. The dataset, the algorithm code, and the evaluation code are available at https://github.com/mmic-lcl/Datasets-and-benchmark-code.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in skin lesion classification. A balanced dataset is required to train a good model. However, due to the appearance of different skin lesions in practice, severe or even deadliest skin lesion types (e.g., melanoma) naturally have quite small amount represented in a dataset. In that, classification performance degradation occurs widely, it is significantly important to have CNNs that work well on class imbalanced skin lesion image dataset. In this paper, we propose SuperCon, a two-stage training strategy to overcome the class imbalance problem on skin lesion classification. It contains two stages: (i) representation training that tries to learn a feature representation that closely aligned among intra-classes and distantly apart from inter-classes, and (ii) classifier fine-tuning that aims to learn a classifier that correctly predict the label based on the learnt representations. In the experimental evaluation, extensive comparisons have been made among our approach and other existing approaches on skin lesion benchmark datasets. The results show that our two-stage training strategy effectively addresses the class imbalance classification problem, and significantly improves existing works in terms of F1-score and AUC score, resulting in state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Detecting diffusion-generated deepfake images remains an open problem. Current detection methods fail against an adversary who adds imperceptible adversarial perturbations to the deepfake to evade detection. In this work, we propose Disjoint Diffusion Deepfake Detection (D4), a deepfake detector designed to improve black-box adversarial robustness beyond de facto solutions such as adversarial training. D4 uses an ensemble of models over disjoint subsets of the frequency spectrum to significantly improve adversarial robustness. Our key insight is to leverage a redundancy in the frequency domain and apply a saliency partitioning technique to disjointly distribute frequency components across multiple models. We formally prove that these disjoint ensembles lead to a reduction in the dimensionality of the input subspace where adversarial deepfakes lie, thereby making adversarial deepfakes harder to find for black-box attacks. We then empirically validate the D4 method against several black-box attacks and find that D4 significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses applied to diffusion-generated deepfake detection. We also demonstrate that D4 provides robustness against adversarial deepfakes from unseen data distributions as well as unseen generative techniques.

- **Summary**: This work aims at generating captions for soccer videos using deep learning. In this context, this paper introduces a dataset, model, and triple-level evaluation. The dataset consists of 22k caption-clip pairs and three visual features (images, optical flow, inpainting) for ~500 hours of \emph{SoccerNet} videos. The model is divided into three parts: a transformer learns language, ConvNets learn vision, and a fusion of linguistic and visual features generates captions. The paper suggests evaluating generated captions at three levels: syntax (the commonly used evaluation metrics such as BLEU-score and CIDEr), meaning (the quality of descriptions for a domain expert), and corpus (the diversity of generated captions). The paper shows that the diversity of generated captions has improved (from 0.07 reaching 0.18) with semantics-related losses that prioritize selected words. Semantics-related losses and the utilization of more visual features (optical flow, inpainting) improved the normalized captioning score by 28\%.

- **Summary**: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in areas with similar scenes such as urban or indoor scenarios is a major challenge. Existing VPR methods using global descriptors have difficulty capturing local specific regions (LSR) in the scene and are therefore prone to localization confusion in such scenarios. As a result, finding the LSR that are critical for location recognition becomes key. To address this challenge, we introduced Patch-NetVLAD+, which was inspired by patch-based VPR researches. Our method proposed a fine-tuning strategy with triplet loss to make NetVLAD suitable for extracting patch-level descriptors. Moreover, unlike existing methods that treat all patches in an image equally, our method extracts patches of LSR, which present less frequently throughout the dataset, and makes them play an important role in VPR by assigning proper weights to them. Experiments on Pittsburgh30k and Tokyo247 datasets show that our approach achieved up to 6.35\% performance improvement than existing patch-based methods.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a well-addressed topic in the computer vision literature, but the design of fast and accurate video processing networks remains challenging. In addition, to run on embedded hardware, computer vision models often have to make compromises on accuracy to run at the required speed, so that a latency/accuracy trade-off is usually at the heart of these real-time systems' design. For the specific case of videos, models have the additional possibility to make use of computations made for previous frames to mitigate the accuracy loss while being real-time.   In this work, we propose to tackle the task of fast future video segmentation prediction through the use of convolutional layers with time-dependent channel masking. This technique only updates a chosen subset of the feature maps at each time-step, bringing simultaneously less computation and latency, and allowing the network to leverage previously computed features. We apply this technique to several fast architectures and experimentally confirm its benefits for the future prediction subtask.

- **Summary**: In deep neural networks for facial recognition, feature vectors are numerical representations that capture the unique features of a given face. While it is known that a version of the original face can be recovered via "feature reconstruction," we lack an understanding of the end-to-end privacy risks produced by these attacks. In this work, we address this shortcoming by developing metrics that meaningfully capture the threat of reconstructed face images. Using end-to-end experiments and user studies, we show that reconstructed face images enable re-identification by both commercial facial recognition systems and humans, at a rate that is at worst, a factor of four times higher than randomized baselines. Our results confirm that feature vectors should be recognized as Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in order to protect user privacy.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed the resurgence of knowledge engineering which is featured by the fast growth of knowledge graphs. However, most of existing knowledge graphs are represented with pure symbols, which hurts the machine's capability to understand the real world. The multi-modalization of knowledge graphs is an inevitable key step towards the realization of human-level machine intelligence. The results of this endeavor are Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs). In this survey on MMKGs constructed by texts and images, we first give definitions of MMKGs, followed with the preliminaries on multi-modal tasks and techniques. We then systematically review the challenges, progresses and opportunities on the construction and application of MMKGs respectively, with detailed analyses of the strength and weakness of different solutions. We finalize this survey with open research problems relevant to MMKGs.

- **Summary**: The upheaval brought by the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to bring fresh challenges over the past two years. During this COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a need for rapid identification of infected patients and specific delineation of infection areas in computed tomography (CT) images. Although deep supervised learning methods have been established quickly, the scarcity of both image-level and pixel-level labels as well as the lack of explainable transparency still hinder the applicability of AI. Can we identify infected patients and delineate the infections with extreme minimal supervision? Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated promising performance under limited labelled data and sufficient unlabelled data. Inspired by semi-supervised learning, we propose a model-agnostic calibrated pseudo-labelling strategy and apply it under a consistency regularization framework to generate explainable identification and delineation results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with the combination of limited labelled data and sufficient unlabelled data or weakly-labelled data. Extensive experiments have shown that our model can efficiently utilize limited labelled data and provide explainable classification and segmentation results for decision-making in clinical routine. The code is available at https://github.com/ayanglab/XAI COVID-19.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection has been an active research area with a wide range of potential applications. Key challenges for anomaly detection in the AI era with big data include lack of prior knowledge of potential anomaly types, highly complex and noisy background in input data, scarce abnormal samples, and imbalanced training dataset. In this work, we propose a meta-learning framework for anomaly detection to deal with these issues. Within this framework, we incorporate the idea of generative adversarial networks (GANs) with appropriate choices of loss functions including structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Experiments with limited labeled data for high-speed rail inspection demonstrate that our meta-learning framework is sharp and robust in identifying anomalies. Our framework has been deployed in five high-speed railways of China since 2021: it has reduced more than 99.7% workload and saved 96.7% inspection time.

- **Summary**: Abstraction is at the heart of sketching due to the simple and minimal nature of line drawings. Abstraction entails identifying the essential visual properties of an object or scene, which requires semantic understanding and prior knowledge of high-level concepts. Abstract depictions are therefore challenging for artists, and even more so for machines. We present CLIPasso, an object sketching method that can achieve different levels of abstraction, guided by geometric and semantic simplifications. While sketch generation methods often rely on explicit sketch datasets for training, we utilize the remarkable ability of CLIP (Contrastive-Language-Image-Pretraining) to distill semantic concepts from sketches and images alike. We define a sketch as a set of B\'ezier curves and use a differentiable rasterizer to optimize the parameters of the curves directly with respect to a CLIP-based perceptual loss. The abstraction degree is controlled by varying the number of strokes. The generated sketches demonstrate multiple levels of abstraction while maintaining recognizability, underlying structure, and essential visual components of the subject drawn.

- **Summary**: Robots need object-level scene understanding to manipulate objects while reasoning about contact, support, and occlusion among objects. Given a pile of objects, object recognition and reconstruction can identify the boundary of object instances, giving important cues as to how the objects form and support the pile. In this work, we present a system, SafePicking, that integrates object-level mapping and learning-based motion planning to generate a motion that safely extracts occluded target objects from a pile. Planning is done by learning a deep Q-network that receives observations of predicted poses and a depth-based heightmap to output a motion trajectory, trained to maximize a safety metric reward. Our results show that the observation fusion of poses and depth-sensing gives both better performance and robustness to the model. We evaluate our methods using the YCB objects in both simulation and the real world, achieving safe object extraction from piles.



### Motion Correction and Volumetric Reconstruction for Fetal Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data

- **Summary**: Motion correction is an essential preprocessing step in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the fetal brain with the aim to remove artifacts caused by fetal movement and maternal breathing and consequently to suppress erroneous signal correlations. Current motion correction approaches for fetal fMRI choose a single 3D volume from a specific acquisition timepoint with least motion artefacts as reference volume, and perform interpolation for the reconstruction of the motion corrected time series. The results can suffer, if no low-motion frame is available, and if reconstruction does not exploit any assumptions about the continuity of the fMRI signal. Here, we propose a novel framework, which estimates a high-resolution reference volume by using outlier-robust motion correction, and by utilizing Huber L2 regularization for intra-stack volumetric reconstruction of the motion-corrected fetal brain fMRI. We performed an extensive parameter study to investigate the effectiveness of motion estimation and present in this work benchmark metrics to quantify the effect of motion correction and regularised volumetric reconstruction approaches on functional connectivity computations. We demonstrate the proposed framework's ability to improve functional connectivity estimates, reproducibility and signal interpretability, which is clinically highly desirable for the establishment of prognostic noninvasive imaging biomarkers. The motion correction and volumetric reconstruction framework is made available as an open-source package of NiftyMIC.

- **Summary**: Truncation is widely used in generative models for improving the quality of the generated samples, at the expense of reducing their diversity. We propose to leverage the StyleGAN generative architecture to devise a new truncation technique, based on a decomposition of the latent space into clusters, enabling customized truncation to be performed at multiple semantic levels. We do so by learning to re-generate W-space, the extended intermediate latent space of StyleGAN, using a learnable mixture of Gaussians, while simultaneously training a classifier to identify, for each latent vector, the cluster that it belongs to. The resulting truncation scheme is more faithful to the original untruncated samples and allows a better trade-off between quality and diversity. We compare our method to other truncation approaches for StyleGAN, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: We propose a learning paradigm for numerical approximation of differential invariants of planar curves. Deep neural-networks' (DNNs) universal approximation properties are utilized to estimate geometric measures. The proposed framework is shown to be a preferable alternative to axiomatic constructions. Specifically, we show that DNNs can learn to overcome instabilities and sampling artifacts and produce numerically-stable signatures for curves subject to a given group of transformations in the plane. We compare the proposed schemes to alternative state-of-the-art axiomatic constructions of group invariant arc-lengths and curvatures.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an approach to detect out-of-context (OOC) objects in an image. Given an image with a set of objects, our goal is to determine if an object is inconsistent with the scene context and detect the OOC object with a bounding box. In this work, we consider commonly explored contextual relations such as co-occurrence relations, the relative size of an object with respect to other objects, and the position of the object in the scene. We posit that contextual cues are useful to determine object labels for in-context objects and inconsistent context cues are detrimental to determining object labels for out-of-context objects. To realize this hypothesis, we propose a graph contextual reasoning network (GCRN) to detect OOC objects. GCRN consists of two separate graphs to predict object labels based on the contextual cues in the image: 1) a representation graph to learn object features based on the neighboring objects and 2) a context graph to explicitly capture contextual cues from the neighboring objects. GCRN explicitly captures the contextual cues to improve the detection of in-context objects and identify objects that violate contextual relations. In order to evaluate our approach, we create a large-scale dataset by adding OOC object instances to the COCO images. We also evaluate on recent OCD benchmark. Our results show that GCRN outperforms competitive baselines in detecting OOC objects and correctly detecting in-context objects.

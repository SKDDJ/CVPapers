- **Summary**: Self-training has shown great potential in semi-supervised learning. Its core idea is to use the model learned on labeled data to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples, and in turn teach itself. To obtain valid supervision, active attempts typically employ a momentum teacher for pseudo-label prediction yet observe the confirmation bias issue, where the incorrect predictions may provide wrong supervision signals and get accumulated in the training process. The primary cause of such a drawback is that the prevailing self-training framework acts as guiding the current state with previous knowledge, because the teacher is updated with the past student only. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel self-training strategy, which allows the model to learn from the future. Concretely, at each training step, we first virtually optimize the student (i.e., caching the gradients without applying them to the model weights), then update the teacher with the virtual future student, and finally ask the teacher to produce pseudo-labels for the current student as the guidance. In this way, we manage to improve the quality of pseudo-labels and thus boost the performance. We also develop two variants of our future-self-training (FST) framework through peeping at the future both deeply (FST-D) and widely (FST-W). Taking the tasks of unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation and semi-supervised semantic segmentation as the instances, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach under a wide range of settings. Code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Lane detection is one of the fundamental modules in self-driving. In this paper we employ a transformer-only method for lane detection, thus it could benefit from the blooming development of fully vision transformer and achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both CULane and TuSimple benchmarks, by fine-tuning the weight fully pre-trained on large datasets. More importantly, this paper proposes a novel and general framework called PriorLane, which is used to enhance the segmentation performance of the fully vision transformer by introducing the low-cost local prior knowledge. Specifically, PriorLane utilizes an encoder-only transformer to fuse the feature extracted by a pre-trained segmentation model with prior knowledge embeddings. Note that a Knowledge Embedding Alignment (KEA) module is adapted to enhance the fusion performance by aligning the knowledge embedding. Extensive experiments on our Zjlab dataset show that PriorLane outperforms SOTA lane detection methods by a 2.82% mIoU when prior knowledge is employed, and the code will be released at: https://github.com/vincentqqb/PriorLane.

- **Summary**: In recent years, face recognition systems have achieved exceptional success due to promising advances in deep learning architectures. However, they still fail to achieve expected accuracy when matching profile images against a gallery of frontal images. Current approaches either perform pose normalization (i.e., frontalization) or disentangle pose information for face recognition. We instead propose a new approach to utilize pose as an auxiliary information via an attention mechanism. In this paper, we hypothesize that pose attended information using an attention mechanism can guide contextual and distinctive feature extraction from profile faces, which further benefits a better representation learning in an embedded domain. To achieve this, first, we design a unified coupled profile-to-frontal face recognition network. It learns the mapping from faces to a compact embedding subspace via a class-specific contrastive loss. Second, we develop a novel pose attention block (PAB) to specially guide the pose-agnostic feature extraction from profile faces. To be more specific, PAB is designed to explicitly help the network to focus on important features along both channel and spatial dimension while learning discriminative yet pose invariant features in an embedding subspace. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on both controlled and in the wild benchmarks including Multi-PIE, CFP, IJBC, and show superiority over the state of the arts.

- **Summary**: A common study area in anomaly identification is industrial images anomaly detection based on texture background. The interference of texture images and the minuteness of texture anomalies are the main reasons why many existing models fail to detect anomalies. We propose a strategy for anomaly detection that combines dictionary learning and normalizing flow based on the aforementioned questions. The two-stage anomaly detection approach already in use is enhanced by our method. In order to improve baseline method, this research add normalizing flow in representation learning and combines deep learning and dictionary learning. Improved algorithms have exceeded 95$\%$ detection accuracy on all MVTec AD texture type data after experimental validation. It shows strong robustness. The baseline method's detection accuracy for the Carpet data was 67.9%. The article was upgraded, raising the detection accuracy to 99.7%.

- **Summary**: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based generative models offer flexible representation learning by incorporating meta-priors, general premises considered beneficial for downstream tasks. However, the incorporated meta-priors often involve ad-hoc model deviations from the original likelihood architecture, causing undesirable changes in their training. In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning method, Gromov-Wasserstein Autoencoders (GWAE), which directly matches the latent and data distributions using the variational autoencoding scheme. Instead of likelihood-based objectives, GWAE models minimize the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) metric between the trainable prior and given data distributions. The GW metric measures the distance structure-oriented discrepancy between distributions even with different dimensionalities, which provides a direct measure between the latent and data spaces. By restricting the prior family, we can introduce meta-priors into the latent space without changing their objective. The empirical comparisons with VAE-based models show that GWAE models work in two prominent meta-priors, disentanglement and clustering, with their GW objective unchanged.

- **Summary**: Subgraph isomorphism or subgraph matching is generally considered as an NP-complete problem, made more complex in practical applications where the edge weights take real values and are subject to measurement noise and possible anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, almost all subgraph matching methods utilize node labels to perform node-node matching. In the absence of such labels (in applications such as image matching and map matching among others), these subgraph matching methods do not work. We propose a method for identifying the node correspondence between a subgraph and a full graph in the inexact case without node labels in two steps - (a) extract the minimal unique topology preserving subset from the subgraph and find its feasible matching in the full graph, and (b) implement a consensus-based algorithm to expand the matched node set by pairing unique paths based on boundary commutativity. Going beyond the existing subgraph matching approaches, the proposed method is shown to have realistically sub-linear computational efficiency, robustness to random measurement noise, and good statistical properties. Our method is also readily applicable to the exact matching case without loss of generality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation and a case study is performed on the Erdos-Renyi random graphs and the image-based affine covariant features dataset respectively.



### Can We Solve 3D Vision Tasks Starting from A 2D Vision Transformer?

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have proven to be effective, in solving 2D image understanding tasks by training over large-scale image datasets; and meanwhile as a somehow separate track, in modeling the 3D visual world too such as voxels or point clouds. However, with the growing hope that transformers can become the "universal" modeling tool for heterogeneous data, ViTs for 2D and 3D tasks have so far adopted vastly different architecture designs that are hardly transferable. That invites an (over-)ambitious question: can we close the gap between the 2D and 3D ViT architectures? As a piloting study, this paper demonstrates the appealing promise to understand the 3D visual world, using a standard 2D ViT architecture, with only minimal customization at the input and output levels without redesigning the pipeline. To build a 3D ViT from its 2D sibling, we "inflate" the patch embedding and token sequence, accompanied with new positional encoding mechanisms designed to match the 3D data geometry. The resultant "minimalist" 3D ViT, named Simple3D-Former, performs surprisingly robustly on popular 3D tasks such as object classification, point cloud segmentation and indoor scene detection, compared to highly customized 3D-specific designs. It can hence act as a strong baseline for new 3D ViTs. Moreover, we note that pursing a unified 2D-3D ViT design has practical relevance besides just scientific curiosity. Specifically, we demonstrate that Simple3D-Former naturally enables to exploit the wealth of pre-trained weights from large-scale realistic 2D images (e.g., ImageNet), which can be plugged in to enhancing the 3D task performance "for free".

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high resolution (HR) provides more detailed information for accurate diagnosis and quantitative image analysis. Despite the significant advances, most existing super-resolution (SR) reconstruction network for medical images has two flaws: 1) All of them are designed in a black-box principle, thus lacking sufficient interpretability and further limiting their practical applications. Interpretable neural network models are of significant interest since they enhance the trustworthiness required in clinical practice when dealing with medical images. 2) most existing SR reconstruction approaches only use a single contrast or use a simple multi-contrast fusion mechanism, neglecting the complex relationships between different contrasts that are critical for SR improvement. To deal with these issues, in this paper, a novel Model-Guided interpretable Deep Unfolding Network (MGDUN) for medical image SR reconstruction is proposed. The Model-Guided image SR reconstruction approach solves manually designed objective functions to reconstruct HR MRI. We show how to unfold an iterative MGDUN algorithm into a novel model-guided deep unfolding network by taking the MRI observation matrix and explicit multi-contrast relationship matrix into account during the end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on the multi-contrast IXI dataset and BraTs 2019 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.

- **Summary**: Event camera is an emerging bio-inspired vision sensors that report per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously. It holds noticeable advantage of high dynamic range, high speed response, and low power budget that enable it to best capture local motions in uncontrolled environments. This motivates us to unlock the potential of event cameras for human pose estimation, as the human pose estimation with event cameras is rarely explored. Due to the novel paradigm shift from conventional frame-based cameras, however, event signals in a time interval contain very limited information, as event cameras can only capture the moving body parts and ignores those static body parts, resulting in some parts to be incomplete or even disappeared in the time interval. This paper proposes a novel densely connected recurrent architecture to address the problem of incomplete information. By this recurrent architecture, we can explicitly model not only the sequential but also non-sequential geometric consistency across time steps to accumulate information from previous frames to recover the entire human bodies, achieving a stable and accurate human pose estimation from event data. Moreover, to better evaluate our model, we collect a large scale multimodal event-based dataset that comes with human pose annotations, which is by far the most challenging one to the best of our knowledge. The experimental results on two public datasets and our own dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and strength of our approach. Code can be available online for facilitating the future research.



### Efficient Perception, Planning, and Control Algorithms for Vision-Based Automated Vehicles

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles have limited computational resources; hence, their control systems must be efficient. The cost and size of sensors have limited the development of self-driving cars. To overcome these restrictions, this study proposes an efficient framework for the operation of vision-based automatic vehicles; the framework requires only a monocular camera and a few inexpensive radars. The proposed algorithm comprises a multi-task UNet (MTUNet) network for extracting image features and constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (CILQR) and vision predictive control (VPC) modules for rapid motion planning and control. MTUNet is designed to simultaneously solve lane line segmentation, the ego vehicle's heading angle regression, road type classification, and traffic object detection tasks at approximately 40 FPS (frames per second) for 228 x 228 pixel RGB input images. The CILQR controllers then use the MTUNet outputs and radar data as inputs to produce driving commands for lateral and longitudinal vehicle guidance within only 1 ms. In particular, the VPC algorithm is included to reduce steering command latency to below actuator latency to prevent vehicle understeer during tight turns. The VPC algorithm uses road curvature data from MTUNet to estimate the correction of the current steering angle at a look-ahead point to adjust the turning amount. Including the VPC algorithm in a VPC-CILQR controller leads to higher performance than CILQR alone; this controller can minimize the influence of command lag, maintaining the ego car's speed and lateral offset at 76 km/h and within 0.52 m, respectively, on a simulated road with a curvature of 0.03 1/m. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed autonomous driving system, which does not require high-definition maps, could be applied in current autonomous vehicles.

- **Summary**: Vision guided navigation requires processing complex visual information to inform task-orientated decisions. Applications include autonomous robots, self-driving cars, and assistive vision for humans. A key element is the extraction and selection of relevant features in pixel space upon which to base action choices, for which Machine Learning techniques are well suited. However, Deep Reinforcement Learning agents trained in simulation often exhibit unsatisfactory results when deployed in the real-world due to perceptual differences known as the $\textit{reality gap}$. An approach that is yet to be explored to bridge this gap is self-attention. In this paper we (1) perform a systematic exploration of the hyperparameter space for self-attention based navigation of 3D environments and qualitatively appraise behaviour observed from different hyperparameter sets, including their ability to generalise; (2) present strategies to improve the agents' generalisation abilities and navigation behaviour; and (3) show how models trained in simulation are capable of processing real world images meaningfully in real time. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a self-attention based agent successfully trained in navigating a 3D action space, using less than 4000 parameters.



### Exploring Visual Interpretability for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) learns rich representations via readily available supervision of natural language. It improves the performance of downstream vision tasks, including but not limited to the zero-shot, long tail, segmentation, retrieval, caption, and video. However, the visual explainability of CLIP is rarely studied, especially for the raw feature map. To provide visual explanations of its predictions, we propose the Image-Text Similarity Map (ITSM). Based on it, we surprisingly find that CLIP prefers the background regions than the foregrounds, and shows erroneous visualization results against human understanding. This phenomenon is universal for both vision transformers and convolutional networks, which suggests this problem is unique and not owing to certain network. Experimentally, we find the devil is in the pooling part, where inappropriate pooling methods lead to a phenomenon called semantic shift. For this problem, we propose the Explainable Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (ECLIP), which corrects the explainability via the Masked Max Pooling. Specifically, to avoid the semantic shift, we replace the original attention pooling by max pooling to focus on the confident foreground, with guidance from free attention during training. Experiments on three datasets suggest that ECLIP greatly improves the explainability of CLIP, and beyond previous explainability methods at large margins. The code will be released later.

### PROB-SLAM: Real-time Visual SLAM Based on Probabilistic Graph Optimization

- **Summary**: Traditional SLAM algorithms are typically based on artificial features, which lack high-level information. By introducing semantic information, SLAM can own higher stability and robustness rather than purely hand-crafted features. However, the high uncertainty of semantic detection networks prohibits the practical functionality of high-level information. To solve the uncertainty property introduced by semantics, this paper proposed a novel probability map based on the Gaussian distribution assumption. This map transforms the semantic binary object detection into probability results, which help establish a probabilistic data association between artificial features and semantic info. Through our algorithm, the higher confidence will be given higher weights in each update step while the edge of the detection area will be endowed with lower confidence. Then the uncertainty is undermined and has less effect on nonlinear optimization. The experiments are carried out in the TUM RGBD dataset, results show that our system improves ORB-SLAM2 by about 15% in indoor environments' errors. We have demonstrated that the method can be successfully applied to environments containing dynamic objects.

- **Summary**: Developing and integrating advanced image sensors with novel algorithms in camera systems are prevalent with the increasing demand for computational photography and imaging on mobile platforms. However, the lack of high-quality data for research and the rare opportunity for in-depth exchange of views from industry and academia constrain the development of mobile intelligent photography and imaging (MIPI). To bridge the gap, we introduce the first MIPI challenge, including five tracks focusing on novel image sensors and imaging algorithms. In this paper, RGBW Joint Fusion and Denoise, one of the five tracks, working on the fusion of binning-mode RGBW to Bayer, is introduced. The participants were provided with a new dataset including 70 (training) and 15 (validation) scenes of high-quality RGBW and Bayer pairs. In addition, for each scene, RGBW of different noise levels was provided at 24dB and 42dB. All the data were captured using an RGBW sensor in both outdoor and indoor conditions. The final results are evaluated using objective metrics, including PSNR, SSIM}, LPIPS, and KLD. A detailed description of all models developed in this challenge is provided in this paper.

- **Summary**: Since the preparation of labeled data for training semantic segmentation networks of point clouds is a time-consuming process, weakly supervised approaches have been introduced to learn from only a small fraction of data. These methods are typically based on learning with contrastive losses while automatically deriving per-point pseudo-labels from a sparse set of user-annotated labels. In this paper, our key observation is that the selection of what samples to annotate is as important as how these samples are used for training. Thus, we introduce a method for weakly supervised segmentation of 3D scenes that combines self-training with active learning. The active learning selects points for annotation that likely result in performance improvements to the trained model, while the self-training makes efficient use of the user-provided labels for learning the model. We demonstrate that our approach leads to an effective method that provides improvements in scene segmentation over previous works and baselines, while requiring only a small number of user annotations.

- **Summary**: Human cognition has compositionality. We understand a scene by decomposing the scene into different concepts (e.g., shape and position of an object) and learning the respective laws of these concepts, which may be either natural (e.g., laws of motion) or man-made (e.g., laws of a game). The automatic parsing of these laws indicates the model's ability to understand the scene, which makes law parsing play a central role in many visual tasks. This paper proposes a deep latent variable model for Compositional LAw Parsing (CLAP), which achieves the human-like compositionality ability through an encoding-decoding architecture to represent concepts in the scene as latent variables. CLAP employs concept-specific latent random functions instantiated with Neural Processes to capture the law of concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLAP outperforms the baseline methods in multiple visual tasks such as intuitive physics, abstract visual reasoning, and scene representation. The law manipulation experiments illustrate CLAP's interpretability by modifying specific latent random functions on samples. For example, CLAP learns the laws of position-changing and appearance constancy from the moving balls in a scene, making it possible to exchange laws between samples or compose existing laws into novel laws.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has received much attention recently in computer vision. Most of the existing works in literature aggregate multi-scale features for depth prediction via either straightforward concatenation or element-wise addition, however, such feature aggregation operations generally neglect the contextual consistency between multi-scale features. Addressing this problem, we propose the Self-Distilled Feature Aggregation (SDFA) module for simultaneously aggregating a pair of low-scale and high-scale features and maintaining their contextual consistency. The SDFA employs three branches to learn three feature offset maps respectively: one offset map for refining the input low-scale feature and the other two for refining the input high-scale feature under a designed self-distillation manner. Then, we propose an SDFA-based network for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, and design a self-distilled training strategy to train the proposed network with the SDFA module. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparative state-of-the-art methods in most cases. The code is available at https://github.com/ZM-Zhou/SDFA-Net_pytorch.

- **Summary**: Medical vision-and-language pre-training provides a feasible solution to extract effective vision-and-language representations from medical images and texts. However, few studies have been dedicated to this field to facilitate medical vision-and-language understanding. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning paradigm with multi-modal masked autoencoders (M$^3$AE), which learn cross-modal domain knowledge by reconstructing missing pixels and tokens from randomly masked images and texts. There are three key designs to make this simple approach work. First, considering the different information densities of vision and language, we adopt different masking ratios for the input image and text, where a considerably larger masking ratio is used for images. Second, we use visual and textual features from different layers to perform the reconstruction to deal with different levels of abstraction in visual and language. Third, we develop different designs for vision and language decoders (i.e., a Transformer for vision and a multi-layer perceptron for language). To perform a comprehensive evaluation and facilitate further research, we construct a medical vision-and-language benchmark including three tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where state-of-the-art results are achieved on all downstream tasks. Besides, we conduct further analysis to better verify the effectiveness of different components of our approach and various settings of pre-training.

- **Summary**: Creating novel views from a single image has achieved tremendous strides with advanced autoregressive models, as unseen regions have to be inferred from the visible scene contents. Although recent methods generate high-quality novel views, synthesizing with only one explicit or implicit 3D geometry has a trade-off between two objectives that we call the "seesaw" problem: 1) preserving reprojected contents and 2) completing realistic out-of-view regions. Also, autoregressive models require a considerable computational cost. In this paper, we propose a single-image view synthesis framework for mitigating the seesaw problem while utilizing an efficient non-autoregressive model. Motivated by the characteristics that explicit methods well preserve reprojected pixels and implicit methods complete realistic out-of-view regions, we introduce a loss function to complement two renderers. Our loss function promotes that explicit features improve the reprojected area of implicit features and implicit features improve the out-of-view area of explicit features. With the proposed architecture and loss function, we can alleviate the seesaw problem, outperforming autoregressive-based state-of-the-art methods and generating an image $\approx$100 times faster. We validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method with experiments on RealEstate10K and ACID datasets.

- **Summary**: Displacement is an important measurement for the assessment of structural conditions, but its field measurement is often hindered by difficulties associated with sensor installation and measurement accuracy. To overcome the disadvantages of conventional displacement measurement, computer vision (CV)-based methods have been implemented due to their remote sensing capabilities and accuracy. This paper presents a strategy for non-target structural displacement measurement that makes use of CV to avoid the need to install a target on the structure while calibrating the displacement using structured light. The proposed system called as LAVOLUTION calculates the relative position of the camera with regard to the structure using four equally spaced beams of structured light and obtains a scale factor to convert pixel movement into structural displacement. A jig for the four beams of structured light is designed and a corresponding alignment process is proposed. A method for calculating the scale factor using the designed jig for tunable structured-light is proposed and validated via numerical simulations and lab-scale experiments. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed displacement measurement process, experiments on a shaking table and a full-scale bridge are conducted and the accuracy of the proposed method is compared with that of a reference laser doppler vibrometer.

- **Summary**: Medical vision-and-language pre-training (Med-VLP) has received considerable attention owing to its applicability to extracting generic vision-and-language representations from medical images and texts. Most existing methods mainly contain three elements: uni-modal encoders (i.e., a vision encoder and a language encoder), a multi-modal fusion module, and pretext tasks, with few studies considering the importance of medical domain expert knowledge and explicitly exploiting such knowledge to facilitate Med-VLP. Although there exist knowledge-enhanced vision-and-language pre-training (VLP) methods in the general domain, most require off-the-shelf toolkits (e.g., object detectors and scene graph parsers), which are unavailable in the medical domain. In this paper, we propose a systematic and effective approach to enhance Med-VLP by structured medical knowledge from three perspectives. First, considering knowledge can be regarded as the intermediate medium between vision and language, we align the representations of the vision encoder and the language encoder through knowledge. Second, we inject knowledge into the multi-modal fusion model to enable the model to perform reasoning using knowledge as the supplementation of the input image and text. Third, we guide the model to put emphasis on the most critical information in images and texts by designing knowledge-induced pretext tasks. To perform a comprehensive evaluation and facilitate further research, we construct a medical vision-and-language benchmark including three tasks. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, where state-of-the-art performance is achieved on all downstream tasks. Further analyses explore the effects of different components of our approach and various settings of pre-training.

- **Summary**: Reliable point cloud data is essential for perception tasks \textit{e.g.} in robotics and autonomous driving applications. Adverse weather causes a specific type of noise to light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor data, which degrades the quality of the point clouds significantly. To address this issue, this letter presents a novel point cloud adverse weather denoising deep learning algorithm (4DenoiseNet). Our algorithm takes advantage of the time dimension unlike deep learning adverse weather denoising methods in the literature. It performs about 10\% better in terms of intersection over union metric compared to the previous work and is more computationally efficient. These results are achieved on our novel SnowyKITTI dataset, which has over 40000 adverse weather annotated point clouds. Moreover, strong qualitative results on the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset indicate good generalizability to domain shifts and to different sensor intrinsics.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed the great success of blind image quality assessment (BIQA) in various task-specific scenarios, which present invariable distortion types and evaluation criteria. However, due to the rigid structure and learning framework, they cannot apply to the cross-task BIQA scenario, where the distortion types and evaluation criteria keep changing in practical applications. This paper proposes a scalable incremental learning framework (SILF) that could sequentially conduct BIQA across multiple evaluation tasks with limited memory capacity. More specifically, we develop a dynamic parameter isolation strategy to sequentially update the task-specific parameter subsets, which are non-overlapped with each other. Each parameter subset is temporarily settled to Remember one evaluation preference toward its corresponding task, and the previously settled parameter subsets can be adaptively reused in the following BIQA to achieve better performance based on the task relevance. To suppress the unrestrained expansion of memory capacity in sequential tasks learning, we develop a scalable memory unit by gradually and selectively pruning unimportant neurons from previously settled parameter subsets, which enable us to Forget part of previous experiences and free the limited memory capacity for adapting to the emerging new tasks. Extensive experiments on eleven IQA datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in cross-task BIQA. The source code of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/maruiperfect/SILF.

- **Summary**: Video prediction is an important yet challenging problem; burdened with the tasks of generating future frames and learning environment dynamics. Recently, autoregressive latent video models have proved to be a powerful video prediction tool, by separating the video prediction into two sub-problems: pre-training an image generator model, followed by learning an autoregressive prediction model in the latent space of the image generator. However, successfully generating high-fidelity and high-resolution videos has yet to be seen. In this work, we investigate how to train an autoregressive latent video prediction model capable of predicting high-fidelity future frames with minimal modification to existing models, and produce high-resolution (256x256) videos. Specifically, we scale up prior models by employing a high-fidelity image generator (VQ-GAN) with a causal transformer model, and introduce additional techniques of top-k sampling and data augmentation to further improve video prediction quality. Despite the simplicity, the proposed method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches on standard video prediction benchmarks with fewer parameters, and enables high-resolution video prediction on complex and large-scale datasets.

- **Summary**: In this work, we tackle one-shot visual search of object parts. Given a single reference image of an object with annotated affordance regions, we segment semantically corresponding parts within a target scene. We propose AffCorrs, an unsupervised model that combines the properties of pre-trained DINO-ViT's image descriptors and cyclic correspondences. We use AffCorrs to find corresponding affordances both for intra- and inter-class one-shot part segmentation. This task is more difficult than supervised alternatives, but enables future work such as learning affordances via imitation and assisted teleoperation.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have brought remarkable breakthroughs in medical image analysis. However, due to their data-hungry nature, the modest dataset sizes in medical imaging projects might be hindering their full potential. Generating synthetic data provides a promising alternative, allowing to complement training datasets and conducting medical image research at a larger scale. Diffusion models recently have caught the attention of the computer vision community by producing photorealistic synthetic images. In this study, we explore using Latent Diffusion Models to generate synthetic images from high-resolution 3D brain images. We used T1w MRI images from the UK Biobank dataset (N=31,740) to train our models to learn about the probabilistic distribution of brain images, conditioned on covariables, such as age, sex, and brain structure volumes. We found that our models created realistic data, and we could use the conditioning variables to control the data generation effectively. Besides that, we created a synthetic dataset with 100,000 brain images and made it openly available to the scientific community.

- **Summary**: Diagnosis based on medical images, such as X-ray images, often involves manual annotation of anatomical keypoints. However, this process involves significant human efforts and can thus be a bottleneck in the diagnostic process. To fully automate this procedure, deep-learning-based methods have been widely proposed and have achieved high performance in detecting keypoints in medical images. However, these methods still have clinical limitations: accuracy cannot be guaranteed for all cases, and it is necessary for doctors to double-check all predictions of models. In response, we propose a novel deep neural network that, given an X-ray image, automatically detects and refines the anatomical keypoints through a user-interactive system in which doctors can fix mispredicted keypoints with fewer clicks than needed during manual revision. Using our own collected data and the publicly available AASCE dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the annotation costs via extensive quantitative and qualitative results. A demo video of our approach is available on our project webpage.

- **Summary**: Graph convolutional neural network (GCN) has drawn increasing attention and attained good performance in various computer vision tasks, however, there lacks a clear interpretation of GCN's inner mechanism. For standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs), class activation mapping (CAM) methods are commonly used to visualize the connection between CNN's decision and image region by generating a heatmap. Nonetheless, such heatmap usually exhibits semantic-chaos when these CAMs are applied to GCN directly. In this paper, we proposed a novel visualization method particularly applicable to GCN, Vertex Semantic Class Activation Mapping (VS-CAM). VS-CAM includes two independent pipelines to produce a set of semantic-probe maps and a semantic-base map, respectively. Semantic-probe maps are used to detect the semantic information from semantic-base map to aggregate a semantic-aware heatmap. Qualitative results show that VS-CAM can obtain heatmaps where the highlighted regions match the objects much more precisely than CNN-based CAM. The quantitative evaluation further demonstrates the superiority of VS-CAM.

- **Summary**: Breast tumor segmentation is one of the key steps that helps us characterize and localize tumor regions. However, variable tumor morphology, blurred boundary, and similar intensity distributions bring challenges for accurate segmentation of breast tumors. Recently, many U-net variants have been proposed and widely used for breast tumors segmentation. However, these architectures suffer from two limitations: (1) Ignoring the characterize ability of the benchmark networks, and (2) Introducing extra complex operations increases the difficulty of understanding and reproducing the network. To alleviate these challenges, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful nested U-net (NU-net) for accurate segmentation of breast tumors. The key idea is to utilize U-Nets with different depths and shared weights to achieve robust characterization of breast tumors. NU-net mainly has the following advantages: (1) Improving network adaptability and robustness to breast tumors with different scales, (2) This method is easy to reproduce and execute, and (3) The extra operations increase network parameters without significantly increasing computational cost. Extensive experimental results with twelve state-of-the-art segmentation methods on three public breast ultrasound datasets demonstrate that NU-net has more competitive segmentation performance on breast tumors.

- **Summary**: The effective localization of mitosis is a critical precursory task for deciding tumor prognosis and grade. Automated mitosis detection through deep learning-oriented image analysis often fails on unseen patient data due to inherent domain biases. This paper proposes a domain homogenizer for mitosis detection that attempts to alleviate domain differences in histology images via adversarial reconstruction of input images. The proposed homogenizer is based on a U-Net architecture and can effectively reduce domain differences commonly seen with histology imaging data. We demonstrate our domain homogenizer's effectiveness by observing the reduction in domain differences between the preprocessed images. Using this homogenizer, along with a subsequent retina-net object detector, we were able to outperform the baselines of the 2021 MIDOG challenge in terms of average precision of the detected mitotic figures.

- **Summary**: For the past decades, face recognition (FR) has been actively studied in computer vision and pattern recognition society. Recently, due to the advances in deep learning, the FR technology shows high performance for most of the benchmark datasets. However, when the FR algorithm is applied to a real-world scenario, the performance has been known to be still unsatisfactory. This is mainly attributed to the mismatch between training and testing sets. Among such mismatches, face misalignment between training and testing faces is one of the factors that hinder successful FR. To address this limitation, we propose a face shape-guided deep feature alignment framework for FR robust to the face misalignment. Based on a face shape prior (e.g., face keypoints), we train the proposed deep network by introducing alignment processes, i.e., pixel and feature alignments, between well-aligned and misaligned face images. Through the pixel alignment process that decodes the aggregated feature extracted from a face image and face shape prior, we add the auxiliary task to reconstruct the well-aligned face image. Since the aggregated features are linked to the face feature extraction network as a guide via the feature alignment process, we train the robust face feature to the face misalignment. Even if the face shape estimation is required in the training stage, the additional face alignment process, which is usually incorporated in the conventional FR pipeline, is not necessarily needed in the testing phase. Through the comparative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the face misalignment with the FR datasets.

- **Summary**: Determining an appropriate number of attention heads on one hand and the number of transformer-encoders, on the other hand, is an important choice for Computer Vision (CV) tasks using the Transformer architecture. Computing experiments confirmed the expectation that the total number of parameters has to satisfy the condition of overdetermination (i.e., number of constraints significantly exceeding the number of parameters). Then, good generalization performance can be expected. This sets the boundaries within which the number of heads and the number of transformers can be chosen. If the role of context in images to be classified can be assumed to be small, it is favorable to use multiple transformers with a low number of heads (such as one or two). In classifying objects whose class may heavily depend on the context within the image (i.e., the meaning of a patch being dependent on other patches), the number of heads is equally important as that of transformers.

- **Summary**: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a micrometer-scale, volumetric imaging modality that has become a clinical standard in ophthalmology. OCT instruments image by raster-scanning a focused light spot across the retina, acquiring sequential cross-sectional images to generate volumetric data. Patient eye motion during the acquisition poses unique challenges: Non-rigid, discontinuous distortions can occur, leading to gaps in data and distorted topographic measurements. We present a new distortion model and a corresponding fully-automatic, reference-free optimization strategy for computational motion correction in orthogonally raster-scanned, retinal OCT volumes. Using a novel, domain-specific spatiotemporal parametrization of forward-warping displacements, eye motion can be corrected continuously for the first time. Parameter estimation with temporal regularization improves robustness and accuracy over previous spatial approaches. We correct each A-scan individually in 3D in a single mapping, including repeated acquisitions used in OCT angiography protocols. Specialized 3D forward image warping reduces median runtime to < 9 s, fast enough for clinical use. We present a quantitative evaluation on 18 subjects with ocular pathology and demonstrate accurate correction during microsaccades. Transverse correction is limited only by ocular tremor, whereas submicron repeatability is achieved axially (0.51 um median of medians), representing a dramatic improvement over previous work. This allows assessing longitudinal changes in focal retinal pathologies as a marker of disease progression or treatment response, and promises to enable multiple new capabilities such as supersampled/super-resolution volume reconstruction and analysis of pathological eye motion occuring in neurological diseases.

- **Summary**: The extraction of contrast-filled vessels from X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) image sequence has important clinical significance for intuitively diagnosis and therapy. In this study, the XCA image sequence is regarded as a 3D tensor input, the vessel layer is regarded as a sparse tensor, and the background layer is regarded as a low-rank tensor. Using tensor nuclear norm (TNN) minimization, a novel method for vessel layer extraction based on tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) is proposed. Furthermore, considering the irregular movement of vessels and the low-frequency dynamic disturbance of surrounding irrelevant tissues, the total variation (TV) regularized spatial-temporal constraint is introduced to smooth the foreground layer. Subsequently, for vessel layer images with uneven contrast distribution, a two-stage region growing (TSRG) method is utilized for vessel enhancement and segmentation. A global threshold method is used as the preprocessing to obtain main branches, and the Radon-Like features (RLF) filter is used to enhance and connect broken minor segments, the final binary vessel mask is constructed by combining the two intermediate results. The visibility of TV-TRPCA algorithm for foreground extraction is evaluated on clinical XCA image sequences and third-party dataset, which can effectively improve the performance of commonly used vessel segmentation algorithms. Based on TV-TRPCA, the accuracy of TSRG algorithm for vessel segmentation is further evaluated. Both qualitative and quantitative results validate the superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: We present a neural network architecture for medical image segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers and colonoscopy polyps. Diabetic foot ulcers are caused by neuropathic and vascular complications of diabetes mellitus. In order to provide a proper diagnosis and treatment, wound care professionals need to extract accurate morphological features from the foot wounds. Using computer-aided systems is a promising approach to extract related morphological features and segment the lesions. We propose a convolution neural network called HarDNet-DFUS by enhancing the backbone and replacing the decoder of HarDNet-MSEG, which was SOTA for colonoscopy polyp segmentation in 2021. For the MICCAI 2022 Diabetic Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (DFUC2022), we train HarDNet-DFUS using the DFUC2022 dataset and increase its robustness by means of five-fold cross validation, Test Time Augmentation, etc. In the validation phase of DFUC2022, HarDNet-DFUS achieved 0.7063 mean dice and was ranked third among all participants. In the final testing phase of DFUC2022, it achieved 0.7287 mean dice and was the first place winner. HarDNet-DFUS also deliver excellent performance for the colonoscopy polyp segmentation task. It achieves 0.924 mean Dice on the famous Kvasir dataset, an improvement of 1.2\% over the original HarDNet-MSEG. The codes are available on https://github.com/kytimmylai/DFUC2022 (for Diabetic Foot Ulcers Segmentation) and https://github.com/YuWenLo/HarDNet-DFUS (for Colonoscopy Polyp Segmentation).

- **Summary**: The traditional Machine Learning (ML) methodology requires to fragment the development and experimental process into disconnected iterations whose feedback is used to guide design or tuning choices. This methodology has multiple efficiency and scalability disadvantages, such as leading to spend significant resources into the creation of multiple trial models that do not contribute to the final solution.The presented work is based on the intuition that defining ML models as modular and extensible artefacts allows to introduce a novel ML development methodology enabling the integration of multiple design and evaluation iterations into the continuous enrichment of a single unbounded intelligent system. We define a novel method for the generation of dynamic multitask ML models as a sequence of extensions and generalizations. We first analyze the capabilities of the proposed method by using the standard ML empirical evaluation methodology. Finally, we propose a novel continuous development methodology that allows to dynamically extend a pre-existing multitask large-scale ML system while analyzing the properties of the proposed method extensions. This results in the generation of an ML model capable of jointly solving 124 image classification tasks achieving state of the art quality with improved size and compute cost.

- **Summary**: With the rise of deep learning in various applications, privacy concerns around the protection of training data has become a critical area of research. Whereas prior studies have focused on privacy risks in single-modal models, we introduce a novel method to assess privacy for multi-modal models, specifically vision-language models like CLIP. The proposed Identity Inference Attack (IDIA) reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.

- **Summary**: Facial 3D Morphable Models are a main computer vision subject with countless applications and have been highly optimized in the last two decades. The tremendous improvements of deep generative networks have created various possibilities for improving such models and have attracted wide interest. Moreover, the recent advances in neural radiance fields, are revolutionising novel-view synthesis of known scenes. In this work, we present a facial 3D Morphable Model, which exploits both of the above, and can accurately model a subject's identity, pose and expression and render it in arbitrary illumination. This is achieved by utilizing a powerful deep style-based generator to overcome two main weaknesses of neural radiance fields, their rigidity and rendering speed. We introduce a style-based generative network that synthesizes in one pass all and only the required rendering samples of a neural radiance field. We create a vast labelled synthetic dataset of facial renders, and train the network on these data, so that it can accurately model and generalize on facial identity, pose and appearance. Finally, we show that this model can accurately be fit to "in-the-wild" facial images of arbitrary pose and illumination, extract the facial characteristics, and be used to re-render the face in controllable conditions.

- **Summary**: We show that combining human prior knowledge with end-to-end learning can improve the robustness of deep neural networks by introducing a part-based model for object classification. We believe that the richer form of annotation helps guide neural networks to learn more robust features without requiring more samples or larger models. Our model combines a part segmentation model with a tiny classifier and is trained end-to-end to simultaneously segment objects into parts and then classify the segmented object. Empirically, our part-based models achieve both higher accuracy and higher adversarial robustness than a ResNet-50 baseline on all three datasets. For instance, the clean accuracy of our part models is up to 15 percentage points higher than the baseline's, given the same level of robustness. Our experiments indicate that these models also reduce texture bias and yield better robustness against common corruptions and spurious correlations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/chawins/adv-part-model.

- **Summary**: We devise deep nearest centroids (DNC), a conceptually elegant yet surprisingly effective network for large-scale visual recognition, by revisiting Nearest Centroids, one of the most classic and simple classifiers. Current deep models learn the classifier in a fully parametric manner, ignoring the latent data structure and lacking simplicity and explainability. DNC instead conducts nonparametric, case-based reasoning; it utilizes sub-centroids of training samples to describe class distributions and clearly explains the classification as the proximity of test data and the class sub-centroids in the feature space. Due to the distance-based nature, the network output dimensionality is flexible, and all the learnable parameters are only for data embedding. That means all the knowledge learnt for ImageNet classification can be completely transferred for pixel recognition learning, under the "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm. Apart from its nested simplicity and intuitive decision-making mechanism, DNC can even possess ad-hoc explainability when the sub-centroids are selected as actual training images that humans can view and inspect. Compared with parametric counterparts, DNC performs better on image classification (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and greatly boots pixel recognition (ADE20K, Cityscapes), with improved transparency and fewer learnable parameters, using various network architectures (ResNet, Swin) and segmentation models (FCN, DeepLabV3, Swin). We feel this work brings fundamental insights into related fields.



### Online Marker-free Extrinsic Camera Calibration using Person Keypoint Detections

- **Summary**: Calibration of multi-camera systems, i.e. determining the relative poses between the cameras, is a prerequisite for many tasks in computer vision and robotics. Camera calibration is typically achieved using offline methods that use checkerboard calibration targets. These methods, however, often are cumbersome and lengthy, considering that a new calibration is required each time any camera pose changes. In this work, we propose a novel, marker-free online method for the extrinsic calibration of multiple smart edge sensors, relying solely on 2D human keypoint detections that are computed locally on the sensor boards from RGB camera images. Our method assumes the intrinsic camera parameters to be known and requires priming with a rough initial estimate of the camera poses. The person keypoint detections from multiple views are received at a central backend where they are synchronized, filtered, and assigned to person hypotheses. We use these person hypotheses to repeatedly solve optimization problems in the form of factor graphs. Given suitable observations of one or multiple persons traversing the scene, the estimated camera poses converge towards a coherent extrinsic calibration within a few minutes. We evaluate our approach in real-world settings and show that the calibration with our method achieves lower reprojection errors compared to a reference calibration generated by an offline method using a traditional calibration target.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we ask whether Vision Transformers (ViTs) can serve as an underlying architecture for improving the adversarial robustness of machine learning models against evasion attacks. While earlier works have focused on improving Convolutional Neural Networks, we show that also ViTs are highly suitable for adversarial training to achieve competitive performance. We achieve this objective using a custom adversarial training recipe, discovered using rigorous ablation studies on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. The canonical training recipe for ViTs recommends strong data augmentation, in part to compensate for the lack of vision inductive bias of attention modules, when compared to convolutions. We show that this recipe achieves suboptimal performance when used for adversarial training. In contrast, we find that omitting all heavy data augmentation, and adding some additional bag-of-tricks ($\varepsilon$-warmup and larger weight decay), significantly boosts the performance of robust ViTs. We show that our recipe generalizes to different classes of ViT architectures and large-scale models on full ImageNet-1k. Additionally, investigating the reasons for the robustness of our models, we show that it is easier to generate strong attacks during training when using our recipe and that this leads to better robustness at test time. Finally, we further study one consequence of adversarial training by proposing a way to quantify the semantic nature of adversarial perturbations and highlight its correlation with the robustness of the model. Overall, we recommend that the community should avoid translating the canonical training recipes in ViTs to robust training and rethink common training choices in the context of adversarial training.

- **Summary**: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has significantly improved productivity in the design and deployment of neural networks (NN). As NAS typically evaluates multiple models by training them partially or completely, the improved productivity comes at the cost of significant carbon footprint. To alleviate this expensive training routine, zero-shot/cost proxies analyze an NN at initialization to generate a score, which correlates highly with its true accuracy. Zero-cost proxies are currently designed by experts conducting multiple cycles of empirical testing on possible algorithms, datasets, and neural architecture design spaces. This experimentation lowers productivity and is an unsustainable approach towards zero-cost proxy design as deep learning use-cases diversify in nature. Additionally, existing zero-cost proxies fail to generalize across neural architecture design spaces. In this paper, we propose a genetic programming framework to automate the discovery of zero-cost proxies for neural architecture scoring. Our methodology efficiently discovers an interpretable and generalizable zero-cost proxy that gives state of the art score-accuracy correlation on all datasets and search spaces of NASBench-201 and Network Design Spaces (NDS). We believe that this research indicates a promising direction towards automatically discovering zero-cost proxies that can work across network architecture design spaces, datasets, and tasks.

- **Summary**: Promising complementarity exists between the texture features of color images and the geometric information of LiDAR point clouds. However, there still present many challenges for efficient and robust feature fusion in the field of 3D object detection. In this paper, first, unstructured 3D point clouds are filled in the 2D plane and 3D point cloud features are extracted faster using projection-aware convolution layers. Further, the corresponding indexes between different sensor signals are established in advance in the data preprocessing, which enables faster cross-modal feature fusion. To address LiDAR points and image pixels misalignment problems, two new plug-and-play fusion modules, LiCamFuse and BiLiCamFuse, are proposed. In LiCamFuse, soft query weights with perceiving the Euclidean distance of bimodal features are proposed. In BiLiCamFuse, the fusion module with dual attention is proposed to deeply correlate the geometric and textural features of the scene. The quantitative results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better feature-level fusion. In addition, the proposed network shows a shorter running time compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: A scene graph is a semantic representation that expresses the objects, attributes, and relationships between objects in a scene. Scene graphs play an important role in many cross modality tasks, as they are able to capture the interactions between images and texts. In this paper, we focus on scene graph modification (SGM), where the system is required to learn how to update an existing scene graph based on a natural language query. Unlike previous approaches that rebuilt the entire scene graph, we frame SGM as a graph expansion task by introducing the incremental structure expanding (ISE). ISE constructs the target graph by incrementally expanding the source graph without changing the unmodified structure. Based on ISE, we further propose a model that iterates between nodes prediction and edges prediction, inferring more accurate and harmonious expansion decisions progressively. In addition, we construct a challenging dataset that contains more complicated queries and larger scene graphs than existing datasets. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model by large margins.

- **Summary**: High-resolution representations are important for vision-based robotic grasping problems. Existing works generally encode the input images into low-resolution representations via sub-networks and then recover high-resolution representations. This will lose spatial information, and errors introduced by the decoder will be more serious when multiple types of objects are considered or objects are far away from the camera. To address these issues, we revisit the design paradigm of CNN for robotic perception tasks. We demonstrate that using parallel branches as opposed to serial stacked convolutional layers will be a more powerful design for robotic visual grasping tasks. In particular, guidelines of neural network design are provided for robotic perception tasks, e.g., high-resolution representation and lightweight design, which respond to the challenges in different manipulation scenarios. We then develop a novel grasping visual architecture referred to as HRG-Net, a parallel-branch structure that always maintains a high-resolution representation and repeatedly exchanges information across resolutions. Extensive experiments validate that these two designs can effectively enhance the accuracy of visual-based grasping and accelerate network training. We show a series of comparative experiments in real physical environments at Youtube: https://youtu.be/Jhlsp-xzHFY.

- **Summary**: Recently vision transformers have been shown to be competitive with convolution-based methods (CNNs) broadly across multiple vision tasks. The less restrictive inductive bias of transformers endows greater representational capacity in comparison with CNNs. However, in the image classification setting this flexibility comes with a trade-off with respect to sample efficiency, where transformers require ImageNet-scale training. This notion has carried over to video where transformers have not yet been explored for video classification in the low-labeled or semi-supervised settings. Our work empirically explores the low data regime for video classification and discovers that, surprisingly, transformers perform extremely well in the low-labeled video setting compared to CNNs. We specifically evaluate video vision transformers across two contrasting video datasets (Kinetics-400 and SomethingSomething-V2) and perform thorough analysis and ablation studies to explain this observation using the predominant features of video transformer architectures. We even show that using just the labeled data, transformers significantly outperform complex semi-supervised CNN methods that leverage large-scale unlabeled data as well. Our experiments inform our recommendation that semi-supervised learning video work should consider the use of video transformers in the future.

- **Summary**: While transformers have begun to dominate many tasks in vision, applying them to large images is still computationally difficult. A large reason for this is that self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which in turn, scales quadratically with the image size. On larger images (e.g., 1080p), over 60% of the total computation in the network is spent solely on creating and applying attention matrices. We take a step toward solving this issue by introducing Hydra Attention, an extremely efficient attention operation for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Paradoxically, this efficiency comes from taking multi-head attention to its extreme: by using as many attention heads as there are features, Hydra Attention is computationally linear in both tokens and features with no hidden constants, making it significantly faster than standard self-attention in an off-the-shelf ViT-B/16 by a factor of the token count. Moreover, Hydra Attention retains high accuracy on ImageNet and, in some cases, actually improves it.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown promising zero-shot generalization in many downstream tasks with properly designed text prompts. Instead of relying on hand-engineered prompts, recent works learn prompts using the training data from downstream tasks. While effective, training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample. For image classification, TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP by 3.6% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require additional task-specific training data. In evaluating cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories, TPT performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.

- **Summary**: Traditional automated metrics for evaluating conditional natural language generation use pairwise comparisons between a single generated text and the best-matching gold-standard ground truth text. When multiple ground truths are available, scores are aggregated using an average or max operation across references. While this approach works well when diversity in the ground truth data (i.e. dispersion of the distribution of conditional texts) can be ascribed to noise, such as in automated speech recognition, it does not allow for robust evaluation in the case where diversity in the ground truths represents signal for the model. In this work we argue that existing metrics are not appropriate for domains such as visual description or summarization where ground truths are semantically diverse, and where the diversity in those captions captures useful additional information about the context. We propose a novel paradigm for multi-candidate evaluation of conditional language generation models, and a new family of metrics that compare the distributions of reference and model-generated caption sets using small sample sets of each. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a case study in visual description: where we show that existing models optimize for single-description quality over diversity, and gain some insights into how sampling methods and temperature impact description quality and diversity.

- **Summary**: We present a systematic study of domain generalization (DG) for tiny neural networks. This problem is critical to on-device machine learning applications but has been overlooked in the literature where research has been merely focused on large models. Tiny neural networks have much fewer parameters and lower complexity and therefore should not be trained the same way as their large counterparts for DG applications. By conducting extensive experiments, we find that knowledge distillation (KD), a well-known technique for model compression, is much better for tackling the on-device DG problem than conventional DG methods. Another interesting observation is that the teacher-student gap on out-of-distribution data is bigger than that on in-distribution data, which highlights the capacity mismatch issue as well as the shortcoming of KD. We further propose a method called out-of-distribution knowledge distillation (OKD) where the idea is to teach the student how the teacher handles out-of-distribution data synthesized via disruptive data augmentation. Without adding any extra parameter to the model -- hence keeping the deployment cost unchanged -- OKD significantly improves DG performance for tiny neural networks in a variety of on-device DG scenarios for image and speech applications. We also contribute a scalable approach for synthesizing visual domain shifts, along with a new suite of DG datasets to complement existing testbeds.

In this paper, we use masked autoencoders for this one-sample learning problem. Empirically, our simple method improves generalization on many visual benchmarks for distribution shifts. Theoretically, we characterize this improvement in terms of the bias-variance trade-off.

- **Summary**: This paper presents OmniVL, a new foundation model to support both image-language and video-language tasks using one universal architecture. It adopts a unified transformer-based visual encoder for both image and video inputs, and thus can perform joint image-language and video-language pretraining. We demonstrate, for the first time, such a paradigm benefits both image and video tasks, as opposed to the conventional one-directional transfer (e.g., use image-language to help video-language). To this end, we propose a decoupled joint pretraining of image-language and video-language to effectively decompose the vision-language modeling into spatial and temporal dimensions and obtain performance boost on both image and video tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel unified vision-language contrastive (UniVLC) loss to leverage image-text, video-text, image-label (e.g., image classification), video-label (e.g., video action recognition) data together, so that both supervised and noisily supervised pretraining data are utilized as much as possible. Without incurring extra task-specific adaptors, OmniVL can simultaneously support visual only tasks (e.g., image classification, video action recognition), cross-modal alignment tasks (e.g., image/video-text retrieval), and multi-modal understanding and generation tasks (e.g., image/video question answering, captioning). We evaluate OmniVL on a wide range of downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results with similar model size and data scale.

- **Summary**: Joint synthesis of images and segmentation masks with generative adversarial networks (GANs) is promising to reduce the effort needed for collecting image data with pixel-wise annotations. However, to learn high-fidelity image-mask synthesis, existing GAN approaches first need a pre-training phase requiring large amounts of image data, which limits their utilization in restricted image domains. In this work, we take a step to reduce this limitation, introducing the task of one-shot image-mask synthesis. We aim to generate diverse images and their segmentation masks given only a single labelled example, and assuming, contrary to previous models, no access to any pre-training data. To this end, inspired by the recent architectural developments of single-image GANs, we introduce our OSMIS model which enables the synthesis of segmentation masks that are precisely aligned to the generated images in the one-shot regime. Besides achieving the high fidelity of generated masks, OSMIS outperforms state-of-the-art single-image GAN models in image synthesis quality and diversity. In addition, despite not using any additional data, OSMIS demonstrates an impressive ability to serve as a source of useful data augmentation for one-shot segmentation applications, providing performance gains that are complementary to standard data augmentation techniques.

- **Summary**: Estimating the relative pose of a new object without prior knowledge is a hard problem, while it is an ability very much needed in robotics and Augmented Reality. We present a method for tracking the 6D motion of objects in RGB video sequences when neither the training images nor the 3D geometry of the objects are available. In contrast to previous works, our method can therefore consider unknown objects in open world instantly, without requiring any prior information or a specific training phase. We consider two architectures, one based on two frames, and the other relying on a Transformer Encoder, which can exploit an arbitrary number of past frames. We train our architectures using only synthetic renderings with domain randomization. Our results on challenging datasets are on par with previous works that require much more information (training images of the target objects, 3D models, and/or depth data).

- **Summary**: Deep learning algorithms for predicting neuroimaging data have shown considerable promise in various applications. Prior work has demonstrated that deep learning models that take advantage of the data's 3D structure can outperform standard machine learning on several learning tasks. However, most prior research in this area has focused on neuroimaging data from adults. Within the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a large longitudinal development study, we examine structural MRI data to predict gender and identify gender-related changes in brain structure. Results demonstrate that gender prediction accuracy is exceptionally high (>97%) with training epochs >200 and that this accuracy increases with age. Brain regions identified as the most discriminative in the task under study include predominantly frontal areas and the temporal lobe. When evaluating gender predictive changes specific to a two-year increase in age, a broader set of visual, cingulate, and insular regions are revealed. Our findings show a robust gender-related structural brain change pattern, even over a small age range. This suggests that it might be possible to study how the brain changes during adolescence by looking at how these changes are related to different behavioral and environmental factors.



### Explicit Tradeoffs between Adversarial and Natural Distributional Robustness

- **Summary**: Several existing works study either adversarial or natural distributional robustness of deep neural networks separately. In practice, however, models need to enjoy both types of robustness to ensure reliability. In this work, we bridge this gap and show that in fact, explicit tradeoffs exist between adversarial and natural distributional robustness. We first consider a simple linear regression setting on Gaussian data with disjoint sets of core and spurious features. In this setting, through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that (i) adversarial training with $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms increases the model reliance on spurious features; (ii) For $\ell_\infty$ adversarial training, spurious reliance only occurs when the scale of the spurious features is larger than that of the core features; (iii) adversarial training can have an unintended consequence in reducing distributional robustness, specifically when spurious correlations are changed in the new test domain. Next, we present extensive empirical evidence, using a test suite of twenty adversarially trained models evaluated on five benchmark datasets (ObjectNet, RIVAL10, Salient ImageNet-1M, ImageNet-9, Waterbirds), that adversarially trained classifiers rely on backgrounds more than their standardly trained counterparts, validating our theoretical results. We also show that spurious correlations in training data (when preserved in the test domain) can improve adversarial robustness, revealing that previous claims that adversarial vulnerability is rooted in spurious correlations are incomplete.

- **Summary**: With deep neural network based solution more readily being incorporated in real-world applications, it has been pressing requirement that predictions by such models, especially in safety-critical environments, be highly accurate and well-calibrated. Although some techniques addressing DNN calibration have been proposed, they are only limited to visual classification applications and in-domain predictions. Unfortunately, very little to no attention is paid towards addressing calibration of DNN-based visual object detectors, that occupy similar space and importance in many decision making systems as their visual classification counterparts. In this work, we study the calibration of DNN-based object detection models, particularly under domain shift. To this end, we first propose a new, plug-and-play, train-time calibration loss for object detection (coined as TCD). It can be used with various application-specific loss functions as an auxiliary loss function to improve detection calibration. Second, we devise a new implicit technique for improving calibration in self-training based domain adaptive detectors, featuring a new uncertainty quantification mechanism for object detection. We demonstrate TCD is capable of enhancing calibration with notable margins (1) across different DNN-based object detection paradigms both in in-domain and out-of-domain predictions, and (2) in different domain-adaptive detectors across challenging adaptation scenarios. Finally, we empirically show that our implicit calibration technique can be used in tandem with TCD during adaptation to further boost calibration in diverse domain shift scenarios.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective tool for compressing deep classification models for edge devices. However, the performance of KD is affected by the large capacity gap between the teacher and student networks. Recent methods have resorted to a multiple teacher assistant (TA) setting for KD, which sequentially decreases the size of the teacher model to relatively bridge the size gap between these models. This paper proposes a new technique called Curriculum Expert Selection for Knowledge Distillation (CES-KD) to efficiently enhance the learning of a compact student under the capacity gap problem. This technique is built upon the hypothesis that a student network should be guided gradually using stratified teaching curriculum as it learns easy (hard) data samples better and faster from a lower (higher) capacity teacher network. Specifically, our method is a gradual TA-based KD technique that selects a single teacher per input image based on a curriculum driven by the difficulty in classifying the image. In this work, we empirically verify our hypothesis and rigorously experiment with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, and ImageNet datasets and show improved accuracy on VGG-like models, ResNets, and WideResNets architectures.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new method to reconstruct 3D objects using a set of volumetric primitives, i.e., superquadrics. The method hierarchically decomposes a target 3D object into pairs of superquadrics recovering finer and finer details. While such hierarchical methods have been studied before, we introduce a new way of splitting the object space using only properties of the predicted superquadrics. The method is trained and evaluated on the ShapeNet dataset. The results of our experiments suggest that reasonable reconstructions can be obtained with the proposed approach for a diverse set of objects with complex geometry.

- **Summary**: We present a learning algorithm for human activity recognition in videos. Our approach is designed for UAV videos, which are mainly acquired from obliquely placed dynamic cameras that contain a human actor along with background motion. Typically, the human actors occupy less than one-tenth of the spatial resolution. Our approach simultaneously harnesses the benefits of frequency domain representations, a classical analysis tool in signal processing, and data driven neural networks. We build a differentiable static-dynamic frequency mask prior to model the salient static and dynamic pixels in the video, crucial for the underlying task of action recognition. We use this differentiable mask prior to enable the neural network to intrinsically learn disentangled feature representations via an identity loss function. Our formulation empowers the network to inherently compute disentangled salient features within its layers. Further, we propose a cost-function encapsulating temporal relevance and spatial content to sample the most important frame within uniformly spaced video segments. We conduct extensive experiments on the UAV Human dataset and the NEC Drone dataset and demonstrate relative improvements of 5.72% - 13.00% over the state-of-the-art and 14.28% - 38.05% over the corresponding baseline model.

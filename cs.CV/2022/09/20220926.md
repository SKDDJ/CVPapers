- **Summary**: Humans constantly interact with daily objects to accomplish tasks. To understand such interactions, computers need to reconstruct these from cameras observing whole-body interaction with scenes. This is challenging due to occlusion between the body and objects, motion blur, depth/scale ambiguities, and the low image resolution of hands and graspable object parts. To make the problem tractable, the community focuses either on interacting hands, ignoring the body, or on interacting bodies, ignoring hands. The GRAB dataset addresses dexterous whole-body interaction but uses marker-based MoCap and lacks images, while BEHAVE captures video of body object interaction but lacks hand detail. We address the limitations of prior work with InterCap, a novel method that reconstructs interacting whole-bodies and objects from multi-view RGB-D data, using the parametric whole-body model SMPL-X and known object meshes. To tackle the above challenges, InterCap uses two key observations: (i) Contact between the hand and object can be used to improve the pose estimation of both. (ii) Azure Kinect sensors allow us to set up a simple multi-view RGB-D capture system that minimizes the effect of occlusion while providing reasonable inter-camera synchronization. With this method we capture the InterCap dataset, which contains 10 subjects (5 males and 5 females) interacting with 10 objects of various sizes and affordances, including contact with the hands or feet. In total, InterCap has 223 RGB-D videos, resulting in 67,357 multi-view frames, each containing 6 RGB-D images. Our method provides pseudo ground-truth body meshes and objects for each video frame. Our InterCap method and dataset fill an important gap in the literature and support many research directions. Our data and code are areavailable for research purposes.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a fast monocular depth estimation method for enabling 3D perception capabilities of low-cost underwater robots. We formulate a novel end-to-end deep visual learning pipeline named UDepth, which incorporates domain knowledge of image formation characteristics of natural underwater scenes. First, we adapt a new input space from raw RGB image space by exploiting underwater light attenuation prior, and then devise a least-squared formulation for coarse pixel-wise depth prediction. Subsequently, we extend this into a domain projection loss that guides the end-to-end learning of UDepth on over 9K RGB-D training samples. UDepth is designed with a computationally light MobileNetV2 backbone and a Transformer-based optimizer for ensuring fast inference rates on embedded systems. By domain-aware design choices and through comprehensive experimental analyses, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art depth estimation performance while ensuring a small computational footprint. Specifically, with 70%-80% less network parameters than existing benchmarks, UDepth achieves comparable and often better depth estimation performance. While the full model offers over 66 FPS (13 FPS) inference rates on a single GPU (CPU core), our domain projection for coarse depth prediction runs at 51.5 FPS rates on single-board NVIDIA Jetson TX2s.

- **Summary**: We study the task of robust feature representations, aiming to generalize well on multiple datasets for action recognition. We build our method on Transformers for its efficacy. Although we have witnessed great progress for video action recognition in the past decade, it remains challenging yet valuable how to train a single model that can perform well across multiple datasets. Here, we propose a novel multi-dataset training paradigm, MultiTrain, with the design of two new loss terms, namely informative loss and projection loss, aiming to learn robust representations for action recognition. In particular, the informative loss maximizes the expressiveness of the feature embedding while the projection loss for each dataset mines the intrinsic relations between classes across datasets. We verify the effectiveness of our method on five challenging datasets, Kinetics-400, Kinetics-700, Moments-in-Time, Activitynet and Something-something-v2 datasets. Extensive experimental results show that our method can consistently improve state-of-the-art performance. Code and models are released.

- **Summary**: The critical goal of gait recognition is to acquire the inter-frame walking habit representation from the gait sequences. The relations between frames, however, have not received adequate attention in comparison to the intra-frame features. In this paper, motivated by optical flow, the bilateral motion-oriented features are proposed, which can allow the classic convolutional structure to have the capability to directly portray gait movement patterns at the feature level. Based on such features, we develop a set of multi-scale temporal representations that force the motion context to be richly described at various levels of temporal resolution. Furthermore, a correction block is devised to eliminate the segmentation noise of silhouettes for getting more precise gait information. Subsequently, the temporal feature set and the spatial features are combined to comprehensively characterize gait processes. Extensive experiments are conducted on CASIA-B and OU-MVLP datasets, and the results achieve an outstanding identification performance, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: In recent years, neuroscientists have been interested to the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) devices. Patients with motor disorders may benefit from BCIs as a means of communication and for the restoration of motor functions. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of most used for evaluating the neuronal activity. In many computer vision applications, deep neural networks (DNN) show significant advantages. Towards to ultimate usage of DNN, we present here a shallow neural network that uses mainly two convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, with relatively few parameters and fast to learn spectral-temporal features from EEG. We compared this models to three other neural network models with different depths applied to a mental arithmetic task using eye-closed state adapted for patients suffering from motor disorders and a decline in visual functions. Experimental results showed that the shallow CNN model outperformed all the other models and achieved the highest classification accuracy of 90.68%. It's also more robust to deal with cross-subject classification issues: only 3% standard deviation of accuracy instead of 15.6% from conventional method.

- **Summary**: Automatic traffic accidents detection has appealed to the machine vision community due to its implications on the development of autonomous intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and importance to traffic safety. Most previous studies on efficient analysis and prediction of traffic accidents, however, have used small-scale datasets with limited coverage, which limits their effect and applicability. Existing datasets in traffic accidents are either small-scale, not from surveillance cameras, not open-sourced, or not built for freeway scenes. Since accidents happened in freeways tend to cause serious damage and are too fast to catch the spot. An open-sourced datasets targeting on freeway traffic accidents collected from surveillance cameras is in great need and of practical importance. In order to help the vision community address these shortcomings, we endeavor to collect video data of real traffic accidents that covered abundant scenes. After integration and annotation by various dimensions, a large-scale traffic accidents dataset named TAD is proposed in this work. Various experiments on image classification, object detection, and video classification tasks, using public mainstream vision algorithms or frameworks are conducted in this work to demonstrate performance of different methods. The proposed dataset together with the experimental results are presented as a new benchmark to improve computer vision research, especially in ITS.

- **Summary**: Steganography and digital watermarking are the tasks of hiding recoverable data in image pixels. Deep neural network (DNN) based image steganography and watermarking techniques are quickly replacing traditional hand-engineered pipelines. DNN based watermarking techniques have drastically improved the message capacity, imperceptibility and robustness of the embedded watermarks. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational overhead of the watermark encoder neural network. In this work, we design the first accelerator platform FastStamp to perform DNN based steganography and digital watermarking of images on hardware. We first propose a parameter efficient DNN model for embedding recoverable bit-strings in image pixels. Our proposed model can match the success metrics of prior state-of-the-art DNN based watermarking methods while being significantly faster and lighter in terms of memory footprint. We then design an FPGA based accelerator framework to further improve the model throughput and power consumption by leveraging data parallelism and customized computation paths. FastStamp allows embedding hardware signatures into images to establish media authenticity and ownership of digital media. Our best design achieves 68 times faster inference as compared to GPU implementations of prior DNN based watermark encoder while consuming less power.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for image denoising via automatically mining accurate structure information. However, most of existing CNNs depend on enlarging depth of designed networks to obtain better denoising performance, which may cause training difficulty. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage image denoising CNN with the wavelet transform (MWDCNN) via three stages, i.e., a dynamic convolutional block (DCB), two cascaded wavelet transform and enhancement blocks (WEBs) and a residual block (RB). DCB uses a dynamic convolution to dynamically adjust parameters of several convolutions for making a tradeoff between denoising performance and computational costs. WEB uses a combination of signal processing technique (i.e., wavelet transformation) and discriminative learning to suppress noise for recovering more detailed information in image denoising. To further remove redundant features, RB is used to refine obtained features for improving denoising effects and reconstruct clean images via improved residual dense architectures. Experimental results show that the proposed MWDCNN outperforms some popular denoising methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose the Generalized Parametric Contrastive Learning (GPaCo/PaCo) which works well on both imbalanced and balanced data. Based on theoretical analysis, we observe that supervised contrastive loss tends to bias high-frequency classes and thus increases the difficulty of imbalanced learning. We introduce a set of parametric class-wise learnable centers to rebalance from an optimization perspective. Further, we analyze our GPaCo/PaCo loss under a balanced setting. Our analysis demonstrates that GPaCo/PaCo can adaptively enhance the intensity of pushing samples of the same class close as more samples are pulled together with their corresponding centers and benefit hard example learning. Experiments on long-tailed benchmarks manifest the new state-of-the-art for long-tailed recognition. On full ImageNet, models from CNNs to vision transformers trained with GPaCo loss show better generalization performance and stronger robustness compared with MAE models. Moreover, GPaCo can be applied to the semantic segmentation task and obvious improvements are observed on the 4 most popular benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have obtained remarkable performance via deep architectures. However, these CNNs often achieve poor robustness for image super-resolution (SR) under complex scenes. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous group SR CNN (HGSRCNN) via leveraging structure information of different types to obtain a high-quality image. Specifically, each heterogeneous group block (HGB) of HGSRCNN uses a heterogeneous architecture containing a symmetric group convolutional block and a complementary convolutional block in a parallel way to enhance internal and external relations of different channels for facilitating richer low-frequency structure information of different types. To prevent appearance of obtained redundant features, a refinement block with signal enhancements in a serial way is designed to filter useless information. To prevent loss of original information, a multi-level enhancement mechanism guides a CNN to achieve a symmetric architecture for promoting expressive ability of HGSRCNN. Besides, a parallel up-sampling mechanism is developed to train a blind SR model. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed HGSRCNN has obtained excellent SR performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

- **Summary**: Cost-maps are used by robotic vehicles to plan collision-free paths. The cost associated with each cell in the map represents the sensed environment information which is often determined manually after several trial-and-error efforts. In off-road environments, due to the presence of several types of features, it is challenging to handcraft the cost values associated with each feature. Moreover, different handcrafted cost values can lead to different paths for the same environment which is not desirable. In this paper, we address the problem of learning the cost-map values from the sensed environment for robust vehicle path planning. We propose a novel framework called as CAMEL using deep learning approach that learns the parameters through demonstrations yielding an adaptive and robust cost-map for path planning. CAMEL has been trained on multi-modal datasets such as RELLIS-3D. The evaluation of CAMEL is carried out on an off-road scene simulator (MAVS) and on field data from IISER-B campus. We also perform realworld implementation of CAMEL on a ground rover. The results shows flexible and robust motion of the vehicle without collisions in unstructured terrains.

- **Summary**: Smart monitoring using three-dimensional (3D) image sensors has been attracting attention in the context of smart cities. In smart monitoring, object detection from point cloud data acquired by 3D image sensors is implemented for detecting moving objects such as vehicles and pedestrians to ensure safety on the road. However, the features of point cloud data are diversified due to the characteristics of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) units used as 3D image sensors or the install position of the 3D image sensors. Although a variety of deep learning (DL) models for object detection from point cloud data have been studied to date, no research has considered how to use multiple DL models in accordance with the features of the point cloud data. In this work, we propose a feature-based model selection framework that creates various DL models by using multiple DL methods and by utilizing training data with pseudo incompleteness generated by two artificial techniques: sampling and noise adding. It selects the most suitable DL model for the object detection task in accordance with the features of the point cloud data acquired in the real environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare the performance of multiple DL models using benchmark datasets created from the KITTI dataset and present example results of object detection obtained through a real outdoor experiment. Depending on the situation, the detection accuracy varies up to 32% between DL models, which confirms the importance of selecting an appropriate DL model according to the situation.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning mammogram classifiers, trained with weakly-labelled images, often rely on global models that produce predictions with limited interpretability, which is a key barrier to their successful translation into clinical practice. On the other hand, prototype-based models improve interpretability by associating predictions with training image prototypes, but they are less accurate than global models and their prototypes tend to have poor diversity. We address these two issues with the proposal of BRAIxProtoPNet++, which adds interpretability to a global model by ensembling it with a prototype-based model. BRAIxProtoPNet++ distills the knowledge of the global model when training the prototype-based model with the goal of increasing the classification accuracy of the ensemble. Moreover, we propose an approach to increase prototype diversity by guaranteeing that all prototypes are associated with different training images. Experiments on weakly-labelled private and public datasets show that BRAIxProtoPNet++ has higher classification accuracy than SOTA global and prototype-based models. Using lesion localisation to assess model interpretability, we show BRAIxProtoPNet++ is more effective than other prototype-based models and post-hoc explanation of global models. Finally, we show that the diversity of the prototypes learned by BRAIxProtoPNet++ is superior to SOTA prototype-based approaches.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel global descriptor termed stable triangle descriptor (STD) for 3D place recognition. For a triangle, its shape is uniquely determined by the length of the sides or included angles. Moreover, the shape of triangles is completely invariant to rigid transformations. Based on this property, we first design an algorithm to efficiently extract local key points from the 3D point cloud and encode these key points into triangular descriptors. Then, place recognition is achieved by matching the side lengths (and some other information) of the descriptors between point clouds. The point correspondence obtained from the descriptor matching pair can be further used in geometric verification, which greatly improves the accuracy of place recognition. In our experiments, we extensively compare our proposed system against other state-of-the-art systems (i.e., M2DP, Scan Context) on public datasets (i.e., KITTI, NCLT, and Complex-Urban) and our self-collected dataset (with a non-repetitive scanning solid-state LiDAR). All the quantitative results show that STD has stronger adaptability and a great improvement in precision over its counterparts. To share our findings and make contributions to the community, we open source our code on our GitHub: https://github.com/hku-mars/STD.



### Self-Supervised Guided Segmentation Framework for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection

- **Summary**: Unsupervised anomaly detection is a challenging task in industrial applications since it is impracticable to collect sufficient anomalous samples. In this paper, a novel Self-Supervised Guided Segmentation Framework (SGSF) is proposed by jointly exploring effective generation method of forged anomalous samples and the normal sample features as the guidance information of segmentation for anomaly detection. Specifically, to ensure that the generated forged anomaly samples are conducive to model training, the Saliency Augmentation Module (SAM) is proposed. SAM introduces a saliency map to generate saliency Perlin noise map, and develops an adaptive segmentation strategy to generate irregular masks in the saliency region. Then, the masks are utilized to generate forged anomalous samples as negative samples for training. Unfortunately, the distribution gap between forged and real anomaly samples makes it difficult for models trained based on forged samples to effectively locate real anomalies. Towards this end, the Self-supervised Guidance Network (SGN) is proposed. It leverages the self-supervised module to extract features that are noise-free and contain normal semantic information as the prior knowledge of the segmentation module. The segmentation module with the knowledge of normal patterns segments out the abnormal regions that are different from the guidance features. To evaluate the effectiveness of SGSF for anomaly detection, extensive experiments are conducted on three anomaly detection datasets. The experimental results show that SGSF achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection results.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction method based on the memory module for visual anomaly detection attempts to narrow the reconstruction error for normal samples while enlarging it for anomalous samples. Unfortunately, the existing memory module is not fully applicable to the anomaly detection task, and the reconstruction error of the anomaly samples remains small. Towards this end, this work proposes a new unsupervised visual anomaly detection method to jointly learn effective normal features and eliminate unfavorable reconstruction errors. Specifically, a novel Partition Memory Bank (PMB) module is proposed to effectively learn and store detailed features with semantic integrity of normal samples. It develops a new partition mechanism and a unique query generation method to preserve the context information and then improves the learning ability of the memory module. The proposed PMB and the skip connection are alternatively explored to make the reconstruction of abnormal samples worse. To obtain more precise anomaly localization results and solve the problem of cumulative reconstruction error, a novel Histogram Error Estimation module is proposed to adaptively eliminate the unfavorable errors by the histogram of the difference image. It improves the anomaly localization performance without increasing the cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for anomaly detection and localization, extensive experiments are conducted on three widely-used anomaly detection datasets. The encouraging performance of the proposed method compared to the recent approaches based on the memory module demonstrates its superiority.

- **Summary**: Crop diseases are a major threat to food security and their rapid identification is important to prevent yield loss. Swift identification of these diseases are difficult due to the lack of necessary infrastructure. Recent advances in computer vision and increasing penetration of smartphones have paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease identification. Most of the plant diseases leave particular artifacts on the foliar structure of the plant. This study was conducted in 2020 at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan to check leaf-based plant disease identification. This study provided a deep neural network-based solution to foliar disease identification and incorporated image quality assessment to select the image of the required quality to perform identification and named it Agricultural Pathologist (Agro Path). The captured image by a novice photographer may contain noise, lack of structure, and blur which result in a failed or inaccurate diagnosis. Moreover, AgroPath model had 99.42% accuracy for foliar disease identification. The proposed addition can be especially useful for application of foliar disease identification in the field of agriculture.

- **Summary**: Can we see it all? Do we know it All? These are questions thrown to human beings in our contemporary society to evaluate our tendency to solve problems. Recent studies have explored several models in object detection; however, most have failed to meet the demand for objectiveness and predictive accuracy, especially in developing and under-developed countries. Consequently, several global security threats have necessitated the development of efficient approaches to tackle these issues. This paper proposes an object detection model for cyber-physical systems known as Smart Surveillance Systems (3s). This research proposes a 2-phase approach, highlighting the advantages of YOLO v3 deep learning architecture in real-time and visual object detection. A transfer learning approach was implemented for this research to reduce training time and computing resources. The dataset utilized for training the model is the MS COCO dataset which contains 328,000 annotated image instances. Deep learning techniques such as Pre-processing, Data pipelining, and detection was implemented to improve efficiency. Compared to other novel research models, the proposed model's results performed exceedingly well in detecting WILD objects in surveillance footages. An accuracy of 99.71% was recorded, with an improved mAP of 61.5.

- **Summary**: Various types of saliency methods have been proposed for explaining black-box classification. In image applications, this means highlighting the part of the image that is most relevant for the current decision. Unfortunately, the different methods may disagree and it can be hard to quantify how representative and faithful the explanation really is. We observe however that several of these methods can be seen as edge cases of a single, more general procedure based on finding a particular path through the classifier's domain. This offers additional geometric interpretation to the existing methods. We demonstrate furthermore that ablation paths can be directly used as a technique of its own right. This is able to compete with literature methods on existing benchmarks, while giving more fine-grained information and better opportunities for validation of the explanations' faithfulness.

- **Summary**: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) helps ophthalmologists assess macular edema, accumulation of fluids, and lesions at microscopic resolution. Quantification of retinal fluids is necessary for OCT-guided treatment management, which relies on a precise image segmentation step. As manual analysis of retinal fluids is a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone task, there is increasing demand for fast and robust automatic solutions. In this study, a new convolutional neural architecture named RetiFluidNet is proposed for multi-class retinal fluid segmentation. The model benefits from hierarchical representation learning of textural, contextual, and edge features using a new self-adaptive dual-attention (SDA) module, multiple self-adaptive attention-based skip connections (SASC), and a novel multi-scale deep self supervision learning (DSL) scheme. The attention mechanism in the proposed SDA module enables the model to automatically extract deformation-aware representations at different levels, and the introduced SASC paths further consider spatial-channel interdependencies for concatenation of counterpart encoder and decoder units, which improve representational capability. RetiFluidNet is also optimized using a joint loss function comprising a weighted version of dice overlap and edge-preserved connectivity-based losses, where several hierarchical stages of multi-scale local losses are integrated into the optimization process. The model is validated based on three publicly available datasets: RETOUCH, OPTIMA, and DUKE, with comparisons against several baselines. Experimental results on the datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed model in retinal OCT fluid segmentation and reveal that the suggested method is more effective than existing state-of-the-art fluid segmentation algorithms in adapting to retinal OCT scans recorded by various image scanning instruments.

- **Summary**: In recent years, real image super-resolution (SR) has achieved promising results due to the development of SR datasets and corresponding real SR methods. In contrast, the field of real video SR is lagging behind, especially for real raw videos. Considering the superiority of raw image SR over sRGB image SR, we construct a real-world raw video SR (Real-RawVSR) dataset and propose a corresponding SR method. We utilize two DSLR cameras and a beam-splitter to simultaneously capture low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) raw videos with 2x, 3x, and 4x magnifications. There are 450 video pairs in our dataset, with scenes varying from indoor to outdoor, and motions including camera and object movements. To our knowledge, this is the first real-world raw VSR dataset. Since the raw video is characterized by the Bayer pattern, we propose a two-branch network, which deals with both the packed RGGB sequence and the original Bayer pattern sequence, and the two branches are complementary to each other. After going through the proposed co-alignment, interaction, fusion, and reconstruction modules, we generate the corresponding HR sRGB sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark real and synthetic video SR methods with either raw or sRGB inputs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zmzhang1998/Real-RawVSR.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the task of Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) where, given an untrimmed video and a natural language sentence query, the goal is to recognize and determine temporal boundaries of action instances in the video described by the query. Recent works tackled this task by improving query inputs with large pre-trained language models (PLM) at the cost of more expensive training. However, the effects of this integration are unclear, as these works also propose improvements in the visual inputs. Therefore, this paper studies the effects of PLMs in TVG and assesses the applicability of parameter-efficient training with NLP adapters. We couple popular PLMs with a selection of existing approaches and test different adapters to reduce the impact of the additional parameters. Our results on three challenging datasets show that, without changing the visual inputs, TVG models greatly benefited from the PLM integration and fine-tuning, stressing the importance of sentence query representation in this task. Furthermore, NLP adapters were an effective alternative to full fine-tuning, even though they were not tailored to our task, allowing PLM integration in larger TVG models and delivering results comparable to SOTA models. Finally, our results shed light on which adapters work best in different scenarios.

- **Summary**: Despite the evolution of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), their performance is surprisingly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters. However, it remains challenging to efficiently explore large hyperparameter search space due to the long training times of modern CNNs. Multi-fidelity optimization enables the exploration of more hyperparameter configurations given budget by early termination of unpromising configurations. However, it often results in selecting a sub-optimal configuration as training with the high-performing configuration typically converges slowly in an early phase. In this paper, we propose Multi-fidelity Optimization with a Recurring Learning rate (MORL) which incorporates CNNs' optimization process into multi-fidelity optimization. MORL alleviates the problem of slow-starter and achieves a more precise low-fidelity approximation. Our comprehensive experiments on general image classification, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning demonstrate the effectiveness of MORL over other multi-fidelity optimization methods such as Successive Halving Algorithm (SHA) and Hyperband. Furthermore, it achieves significant performance improvements over hand-tuned hyperparameter configuration within a practical budget.

- **Summary**: The non-uniform distribution and extremely sparse nature of the LiDAR point cloud (LPC) bring significant challenges to its high-efficient compression. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end, fully-factorized deep framework that encodes the original LPC into an octree structure and hierarchically decomposes the octree entropy model in layers. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical latent variable as side information to encapsulate the sibling and ancestor dependence, which provides sufficient context information for the modelling of point cloud distribution while enabling the parallel encoding and decoding of octree nodes in the same layer. Besides, we propose a residual coding framework for the compression of the latent variable, which explores the spatial correlation of each layer by progressive downsampling, and model the corresponding residual with a fully-factorized entropy model. Furthermore, we propose soft addition and subtraction for residual coding to improve network flexibility. The comprehensive experiment results on the LiDAR benchmark SemanticKITTI and MPEG-specified dataset Ford demonstrates that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among all the previous LPC frameworks. Besides, our end-to-end, fully-factorized framework is proved by experiment to be high-parallelized and time-efficient and saves more than 99.8% of decoding time compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on LPC compression.

- **Summary**: Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have great generalization and prediction capabilities, their functioning does not allow a detailed explanation of their behavior. Opaque deep learning models are increasingly used to make important predictions in critical environments, and the danger is that they make and use predictions that cannot be justified or legitimized. Several eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods that separate explanations from machine learning models have emerged, but have shortcomings in faithfulness to the model actual functioning and robustness. As a result, there is a widespread agreement on the importance of endowing Deep Learning models with explanatory capabilities so that they can themselves provide an answer to why a particular prediction was made. First, we address the problem of the lack of universal criteria for XAI by formalizing what an explanation is. We also introduced a set of axioms and definitions to clarify XAI from a mathematical perspective. Finally, we present the Greybox XAI, a framework that composes a DNN and a transparent model thanks to the use of a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB). We extract a KB from the dataset and use it to train a transparent model (i.e., a logistic regression). An encoder-decoder architecture is trained on RGB images to produce an output similar to the KB used by the transparent model. Once the two models are trained independently, they are used compositionally to form an explainable predictive model. We show how this new architecture is accurate and explainable in several datasets.

- **Summary**: This work presents a deep learning-based plant disease diagnostic system using images of fruits and leaves. Five state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been employed for implementing the system. Hitherto model accuracy has been the focus for such applications and model optimization has not been accounted for the model to be applicable to end-user devices. Two model quantization techniques such as float16 and dynamic range quantization have been applied to the five state-of-the-art CNN architectures. The study shows that the quantized GoogleNet model achieved the size of 0.143 MB with an accuracy of 97%, which is the best candidate model considering the size criterion. The EfficientNet model achieved the size of 4.2MB with an accuracy of 99%, which is the best model considering the performance criterion.

- **Summary**: Successful Artificial Intelligence systems often require numerous labeled data to extract information from document images. In this paper, we investigate the problem of improving the performance of Artificial Intelligence systems in understanding document images, especially in cases where training data is limited. We address the problem by proposing a novel finetuning method using reinforcement learning. Our approach treats the Information Extraction model as a policy network and uses policy gradient training to update the model to maximize combined reward functions that complement the traditional cross-entropy losses. Our experiments on four datasets using labels and expert feedback demonstrate that our finetuning mechanism consistently improves the performance of a state-of-the-art information extractor, especially in the small training data regime.

- **Summary**: Despite its great success, backpropagation has certain limitations that necessitate the investigation of new learning methods. In this study, we present a biologically plausible local learning rule that improves upon Hebb's well-known proposal and discovers unsupervised features by local competitions among neurons. This simple learning rule enables the creation of a forward learning paradigm called activation learning, in which the output activation (sum of the squared output) of the neural network estimates the likelihood of the input patterns, or "learn more, activate more" in simpler terms. For classification on a few small classical datasets, activation learning performs comparably to backpropagation using a fully connected network, and outperforms backpropagation when there are fewer training samples or unpredictable disturbances. Additionally, the same trained network can be used for a variety of tasks, including image generation and completion. Activation learning also achieves state-of-the-art performance on several real-world datasets for anomaly detection. This new learning paradigm, which has the potential to unify supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning and is reasonably more resistant to adversarial attacks, deserves in-depth investigation.

- **Summary**: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) models are widely used to recover linearly mixed nonnegative data. When the data is made of samplings of continuous signals, the factors in NMF can be constrained to be samples of nonnegative rational functions, which allow fairly general models; this is referred to as NMF using rational functions (R-NMF). We first show that, under mild assumptions, R-NMF has an essentially unique factorization unlike NMF, which is crucial in applications where ground-truth factors need to be recovered such as blind source separation problems. Then we present different approaches to solve R-NMF: the R-HANLS, R-ANLS and R-NLS methods. From our tests, no method significantly outperforms the others, and a trade-off should be done between time and accuracy. Indeed, R-HANLS is fast and accurate for large problems, while R-ANLS is more accurate, but also more resources demanding, both in time and memory. R-NLS is very accurate but only for small problems. Moreover, we show that R-NMF outperforms NMF in various tasks including the recovery of semi-synthetic continuous signals, and a classification problem of real hyperspectral signals.

- **Summary**: Hashing that projects data into binary codes has shown extraordinary talents in cross-modal retrieval due to its low storage usage and high query speed. Despite their empirical success on some scenarios, existing cross-modal hashing methods usually fail to cross modality gap when fully-paired data with plenty of labeled information is nonexistent. To circumvent this drawback, motivated by the Divide-and-Conquer strategy, we propose Deep Manifold Hashing (DMH), a novel method of dividing the problem of semi-paired unsupervised cross-modal retrieval into three sub-problems and building one simple yet efficiency model for each sub-problem. Specifically, the first model is constructed for obtaining modality-invariant features by complementing semi-paired data based on manifold learning, whereas the second model and the third model aim to learn hash codes and hash functions respectively. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DMH compared with the state-of-the-art fully-paired and semi-paired unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, great progress has been made to incorporate unlabeled data to overcome the inefficiently supervised problem via semi-supervised learning (SSL). Most state-of-the-art models are based on the idea of pursuing consistent model predictions over unlabeled data toward the input noise, which is called consistency regularization. Nonetheless, there is a lack of theoretical insights into the reason behind its success. To bridge the gap between theoretical and practical results, we propose a worst-case consistency regularization technique for SSL in this paper. Specifically, we first present a generalization bound for SSL consisting of the empirical loss terms observed on labeled and unlabeled training data separately. Motivated by this bound, we derive an SSL objective that minimizes the largest inconsistency between an original unlabeled sample and its multiple augmented variants. We then provide a simple but effective algorithm to solve the proposed minimax problem, and theoretically prove that it converges to a stationary point. Experiments on five popular benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Image clustering is a very useful technique that is widely applied to various areas, including remote sensing. Recently, visual representations by self-supervised learning have greatly improved the performance of image clustering. To further improve the well-trained clustering models, this paper proposes a novel method by first ranking samples within each cluster based on the confidence in their belonging to the current cluster and then using the ranking to formulate a weighted cross-entropy loss to train the model. For ranking the samples, we developed a method for computing the likelihood of samples belonging to the current clusters based on whether they are situated in densely populated neighborhoods, while for training the model, we give a strategy for weighting the ranked samples. We present extensive experimental results that demonstrate that the new technique can be used to improve the State-of-the-Art image clustering models, achieving accuracy performance gains ranging from $2.1\%$ to $15.9\%$. Performing our method on a variety of datasets from remote sensing, we show that our method can be effectively applied to remote--sensing images.

- **Summary**: The design of a safe and reliable Autonomous Driving stack (ADS) is one of the most challenging tasks of our era. These ADS are expected to be driven in highly dynamic environments with full autonomy, and a reliability greater than human beings. In that sense, to efficiently and safely navigate through arbitrarily complex traffic scenarios, ADS must have the ability to forecast the future trajectories of surrounding actors. Current state-of-the-art models are typically based on Recurrent, Graph and Convolutional networks, achieving noticeable results in the context of vehicle prediction. In this paper we explore the influence of attention in generative models for motion prediction, considering both physical and social context to compute the most plausible trajectories. We first encode the past trajectories using a LSTM network, which serves as input to a Multi-Head Self-Attention module that computes the social context. On the other hand, we formulate a weighted interpolation to calculate the velocity and orientation in the last observation frame in order to calculate acceptable target points, extracted from the driveable of the HDMap information, which represents our physical context. Finally, the input of our generator is a white noise vector sampled from a multivariate normal distribution while the social and physical context are its conditions, in order to predict plausible trajectories. We validate our method using the Argoverse Motion Forecasting Benchmark 1.1, achieving competitive unimodal results.

- **Summary**: Successful training of end-to-end deep networks for real motion deblurring requires datasets of sharp/blurred image pairs that are realistic and diverse enough to achieve generalization to real blurred images. Obtaining such datasets remains a challenging task. In this paper, we first review the limitations of existing deblurring benchmark datasets from the perspective of generalization to blurry images in the wild. Secondly, we propose an efficient procedural methodology to generate sharp/blurred image pairs, based on a simple yet effective model for the formation of blurred images. This allows generating virtually unlimited realistic and diverse training pairs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset by training existing deblurring architectures on the simulated pairs and evaluating them across four standard datasets of real blurred images. We observed superior generalization performance for the ultimate task of deblurring real motion-blurred photos of dynamic scenes when training with the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Chapter generation becomes practical technique for online videos nowadays. The chapter breakpoints enable users to quickly find the parts they want and get the summative annotations. However, there is no public method and dataset for this task. To facilitate the research along this direction, we introduce a new dataset called Chapter-Gen, which consists of approximately 10k user-generated videos with annotated chapter information. Our data collection procedure is fast, scalable and does not require any additional manual annotation. On top of this dataset, we design an effective baseline specificlly for video chapters generation task. which captures two aspects of a video,including visual dynamics and narration text. It disentangles local and global video features for localization and title generation respectively. To parse the long video efficiently, a skip sliding window mechanism is designed to localize potential chapters. And a cross attention multi-modal fusion module is developed to aggregate local features for title generation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior results over existing methods which illustrate that the method design for similar task cannot be transfered directly even after fine-tuning. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/czt117/MVCG.

- **Summary**: Noise is ubiquitous during image acquisition. Sufficient denoising is often an important first step for image processing. In recent decades, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used for image denoising. Most DNN-based image denoising methods require a large-scale dataset or focus on supervised settings, in which single/pairs of clean images or a set of noisy images are required. This poses a significant burden on the image acquisition process. Moreover, denoisers trained on datasets of limited scale may incur over-fitting. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a new self-supervised framework for image denoising based on the Tucker low-rank tensor approximation. With the proposed design, we are able to characterize our denoiser with fewer parameters and train it based on a single image, which considerably improves the model generalizability and reduces the cost of data acquisition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy images have been conducted. Empirical results show that our proposed method outperforms existing non-learning-based methods (e.g., low-pass filter, non-local mean), single-image unsupervised denoisers (e.g., DIP, NN+BM3D) evaluated on both in-sample and out-sample datasets. The proposed method even achieves comparable performances with some supervised methods (e.g., DnCNN).

- **Summary**: Understanding spatial and visual information is essential for a navigation agent who follows natural language instructions. The current Transformer-based VLN agents entangle the orientation and vision information, which limits the gain from the learning of each information source. In this paper, we design a neural agent with explicit Orientation and Vision modules. Those modules learn to ground spatial information and landmark mentions in the instructions to the visual environment more effectively. To strengthen the spatial reasoning and visual perception of the agent, we design specific pre-training tasks to feed and better utilize the corresponding modules in our final navigation model. We evaluate our approach on both Room2room (R2R) and Room4room (R4R) datasets and achieve the state of the art results on both benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Performance comparison of supervised machine learning (ML) models are widely done in terms of different confusion matrix based scores obtained on test datasets. However, a dataset comprises several instances having different difficulty levels. Therefore, it is more logical to compare effectiveness of ML models on individual instances instead of comparing scores obtained for the entire dataset. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed for direct comparison of supervised ML models in terms of individual instances within the dataset. A direct comparison matrix called \emph{Prayatul Matrix} is introduced, which accounts for comparative outcome of two ML algorithms on different instances of a dataset. Five different performance measures are designed based on prayatul matrix. Efficacy of the proposed approach as well as designed measures is analyzed with four classification techniques on three datasets. Also analyzed on four large-scale complex image datasets with four deep learning models namely ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, and XceptionNet. Results are evident that the newly designed measure are capable of giving more insight about the comparing ML algorithms, which were impossible with existing confusion matrix based scores like accuracy, precision and recall.

- **Summary**: We propose DeepFusion, a modular multi-modal architecture to fuse lidars, cameras and radars in different combinations for 3D object detection. Specialized feature extractors take advantage of each modality and can be exchanged easily, making the approach simple and flexible. Extracted features are transformed into bird's-eye-view as a common representation for fusion. Spatial and semantic alignment is performed prior to fusing modalities in the feature space. Finally, a detection head exploits rich multi-modal features for improved 3D detection performance. Experimental results for lidar-camera, lidar-camera-radar and camera-radar fusion show the flexibility and effectiveness of our fusion approach. In the process, we study the largely unexplored task of faraway car detection up to 225 meters, showing the benefits of our lidar-camera fusion. Furthermore, we investigate the required density of lidar points for 3D object detection and illustrate implications at the example of robustness against adverse weather conditions. Moreover, ablation studies on our camera-radar fusion highlight the importance of accurate depth estimation.

- **Summary**: Methods have recently been proposed that densely segment 3D volumes into classes using only color images and expert supervision in the form of sparse semantically annotated pixels. While impressive, these methods still require a relatively large amount of supervision and segmenting an object can take several minutes in practice. Such systems typically only optimize their representation on the particular scene they are fitting, without leveraging any prior information from previously seen images. In this paper, we propose to use features extracted with models trained on large existing datasets to improve segmentation performance. We bake this feature representation into a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) by volumetrically rendering feature maps and supervising on features extracted from each input image. We show that by baking this representation into the NeRF, we make the subsequent classification task much easier. Our experiments show that our method achieves higher segmentation accuracy with fewer semantic annotations than existing methods over a wide range of scenes.

- **Summary**: As the methods evolve, inversion is mainly divided into two steps. The first step is Image Embedding, in which an encoder or optimization process embeds images to get the corresponding latent codes. Afterward, the second step aims to refine the inversion and editing results, which we named Result Refinement. Although the second step significantly improves fidelity, perception and editability are almost unchanged, deeply dependent on inverse latent codes attained in the first step. Therefore, a crucial problem is gaining the latent codes with better perception and editability while retaining the reconstruction fidelity. In this work, we first point out that these two characteristics are related to the degree of alignment (or disalignment) of the inverse codes with the synthetic distribution. Then, we propose Latent Space Alignment Inversion Paradigm (LSAP), which consists of evaluation metric and solution for this problem. Specifically, we introduce Normalized Style Space ($\mathcal{S^N}$ space) and $\mathcal{S^N}$ Cosine Distance (SNCD) to measure disalignment of inversion methods. Since our proposed SNCD is differentiable, it can be optimized in both encoder-based and optimization-based embedding methods to conduct a uniform solution. Extensive experiments in various domains demonstrate that SNCD effectively reflects perception and editability, and our alignment paradigm archives the state-of-the-art in both two steps. Code is available on https://github.com/caopulan/GANInverter/tree/main/configs/lsap.

- **Summary**: Existing Score-Based Models (SBMs) can be categorized into constrained SBMs (CSBMs) or unconstrained SBMs (USBMs) according to their parameterization approaches. CSBMs model probability density functions as Boltzmann distributions, and assign their predictions as the negative gradients of some scalar-valued energy functions. On the other hand, USBMs employ flexible architectures capable of directly estimating scores without the need to explicitly model energy functions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the architectural constraints of CSBMs may limit their modeling ability. In addition, we show that USBMs' inability to preserve the property of conservativeness may lead to degraded performance in practice. To address the above issues, we propose Quasi-Conservative Score-Based Models (QCSBMs) for keeping the advantages of both CSBMs and USBMs. Our theoretical derivations demonstrate that the training objective of QCSBMs can be efficiently integrated into the training processes by leveraging the Hutchinson's trace estimator. In addition, our experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and SVHN datasets validate the effectiveness of QCSBMs. Finally, we justify the advantage of QCSBMs using an example of a one-layered autoencoder.

- **Summary**: Functional registration algorithms represent point clouds as functions (e.g. spacial occupancy field) avoiding unreliable correspondence estimation in conventional least-squares registration algorithms. However, existing functional registration algorithms are computationally expensive. Furthermore, the capability of registration with unknown scale is necessary in tasks such as CAD model-based object localization, yet no such support exists in functional registration. In this work, we propose a scale-invariant, linear time complexity functional registration algorithm. We achieve linear time complexity through an efficient approximation of L2-distance between functions using orthonormal basis functions. The use of orthonormal basis functions leads to a formulation that is compatible with least-squares registration. Benefited from the least-square formulation, we use the theory of translation-rotation-invariant measurement to decouple scale estimation and therefore achieve scale-invariant registration. We evaluate the proposed algorithm, named FLS (functional least-squares), on standard 3D registration benchmarks, showing FLS is an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art functional registration algorithm without compromising accuracy and robustness. FLS also outperforms state-of-the-art correspondence-based least-squares registration algorithm on accuracy and robustness, with known and unknown scale. Finally, we demonstrate applying FLS to register point clouds with varying densities and partial overlaps, point clouds from different objects within the same category, and point clouds from real world objects with noisy RGB-D measurements.

- **Summary**: 3D point clouds have attracted increasing attention in architecture, engineering, and construction due to their high-quality object representation and efficient acquisition methods. Consequently, many point cloud feature detection methods have been proposed in the literature to automate some workflows, such as their classification or part segmentation. Nevertheless, the performance of point cloud automated systems significantly lags behind their image counterparts. While part of this failure stems from the irregularity, unstructuredness, and disorder of point clouds, which makes the task of point cloud feature detection significantly more challenging than the image one, we argue that a lack of inspiration from the image domain might be the primary cause of such a gap. Indeed, given the overwhelming success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image feature detection, it seems reasonable to design their point cloud counterparts, but none of the proposed approaches closely resembles them. Specifically, even though many approaches generalise the convolution operation in point clouds, they fail to emulate the CNNs multiple-feature detection and pooling operations. For this reason, we propose a graph convolution-based unit, dubbed Shrinking unit, that can be stacked vertically and horizontally for the design of CNN-like 3D point cloud feature extractors. Given that self, local and global correlations between points in a point cloud convey crucial spatial geometric information, we also leverage them during the feature extraction process. We evaluate our proposal by designing a feature extractor model for the ModelNet-10 benchmark dataset and achieve 90.64% classification accuracy, demonstrating that our innovative idea is effective.

- **Summary**: Successful material selection is critical in designing and manufacturing products for design automation. Designers leverage their knowledge and experience to create high-quality designs by selecting the most appropriate materials through performance, manufacturability, and sustainability evaluation. Intelligent tools can help designers with varying expertise by providing recommendations learned from prior designs. To enable this, we introduce a graph representation learning framework that supports the material prediction of bodies in assemblies. We formulate the material selection task as a node-level prediction task over the assembly graph representation of CAD models and tackle it using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Evaluations over three experimental protocols performed on the Fusion 360 Gallery dataset indicate the feasibility of our approach, achieving a 0.75 top-3 micro-f1 score. The proposed framework can scale to large datasets and incorporate designers' knowledge into the learning process. These capabilities allow the framework to serve as a recommendation system for design automation and a baseline for future work, narrowing the gap between human designers and intelligent design agents.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we empirically study how to make the most of low-resolution frames for efficient video recognition. Existing methods mainly focus on developing compact networks or alleviating temporal redundancy of video inputs to increase efficiency, whereas compressing frame resolution has rarely been considered a promising solution. A major concern is the poor recognition accuracy on low-resolution frames. We thus start by analyzing the underlying causes of performance degradation on low-resolution frames. Our key finding is that the major cause of degradation is not information loss in the down-sampling process, but rather the mismatch between network architecture and input scale. Motivated by the success of knowledge distillation (KD), we propose to bridge the gap between network and input size via cross-resolution KD (ResKD). Our work shows that ResKD is a simple but effective method to boost recognition accuracy on low-resolution frames. Without bells and whistles, ResKD considerably surpasses all competitive methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy on four large-scale benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V2. In addition, we extensively demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art architectures, i.e., 3D-CNNs and Video Transformers, and scalability towards super low-resolution frames. The results suggest ResKD can serve as a general inference acceleration method for state-of-the-art video recognition. Our code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/ResKD.

- **Summary**: Outlier detection tasks have been playing a critical role in AI safety. There has been a great challenge to deal with this task. Observations show that deep neural network classifiers usually tend to incorrectly classify out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs into in-distribution classes with high confidence. Existing works attempt to solve the problem by explicitly imposing uncertainty on classifiers when OOD inputs are exposed to the classifier during training. In this paper, we propose an alternative probabilistic paradigm that is both practically useful and theoretically viable for the OOD detection tasks. Particularly, we impose statistical independence between inlier and outlier data during training, in order to ensure that inlier data reveals little information about OOD data to the deep estimator during training. Specifically, we estimate the statistical dependence between inlier and outlier data through the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), and we penalize such metric during training. We also associate our approach with a novel statistical test during the inference time coupled with our principled motivation. Empirical results show that our method is effective and robust for OOD detection on various benchmarks. In comparison to SOTA models, our approach achieves significant improvement regarding FPR95, AUROC, and AUPR metrics. Code is available: \url{https://github.com/jylins/hood}.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on enhancing the captions generated by image-caption generation systems. We propose an approach for improving caption generation systems by choosing the most closely related output to the image rather than the most likely output produced by the model. Our model revises the language generation output beam search from a visual context perspective. We employ a visual semantic measure in a word and sentence level manner to match the proper caption to the related information in the image. The proposed approach can be applied to any caption system as a post-processing based method.

- **Summary**: Complex wounds usually face partial or total loss of skin thickness, healing by secondary intention. They can be acute or chronic, figuring infections, ischemia and tissue necrosis, and association with systemic diseases. Research institutes around the globe report countless cases, ending up in a severe public health problem, for they involve human resources (e.g., physicians and health care professionals) and negatively impact life quality. This paper presents a new database for automatically categorizing complex wounds with five categories, i.e., non-wound area, granulation, fibrinoid tissue, and dry necrosis, hematoma. The images comprise different scenarios with complex wounds caused by pressure, vascular ulcers, diabetes, burn, and complications after surgical interventions. The dataset, called ComplexWoundDB, is unique because it figures pixel-level classifications from $27$ images obtained in the wild, i.e., images are collected at the patients' homes, labeled by four health professionals. Further experiments with distinct machine learning techniques evidence the challenges in addressing the problem of computer-aided complex wound tissue categorization. The manuscript sheds light on future directions in the area, with a detailed comparison among other databased widely used in the literature.

- **Summary**: Large-scale sound recognition data sets typically consist of acoustic recordings obtained from multimedia libraries. As a consequence, modalities other than audio can often be exploited to improve the outputs of models designed for associated tasks. Frequently, however, not all contents are available for all samples of such a collection: For example, the original material may have been removed from the source platform at some point, and therefore, non-auditory features can no longer be acquired.   We demonstrate that a multi-encoder framework can be employed to deal with this issue by applying this method to attention-based deep learning systems, which are currently part of the state of the art in the domain of sound recognition. More specifically, we show that the proposed model extension can successfully be utilized to incorporate partially available visual information into the operational procedures of such networks, which normally only use auditory features during training and inference. Experimentally, we verify that the considered approach leads to improved predictions in a number of evaluation scenarios pertaining to audio tagging and sound event detection. Additionally, we scrutinize some properties and limitations of the presented technique.

- **Summary**: Multi-agent collaborative perception could significantly upgrade the perception performance by enabling agents to share complementary information with each other through communication. It inevitably results in a fundamental trade-off between perception performance and communication bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a spatial confidence map, which reflects the spatial heterogeneity of perceptual information. It empowers agents to only share spatially sparse, yet perceptually critical information, contributing to where to communicate. Based on this novel spatial confidence map, we propose Where2comm, a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework. Where2comm has two distinct advantages: i) it considers pragmatic compression and uses less communication to achieve higher perception performance by focusing on perceptually critical areas; and ii) it can handle varying communication bandwidth by dynamically adjusting spatial areas involved in communication. To evaluate Where2comm, we consider 3D object detection in both real-world and simulation scenarios with two modalities (camera/LiDAR) and two agent types (cars/drones) on four datasets: OPV2V, V2X-Sim, DAIR-V2X, and our original CoPerception-UAVs. Where2comm consistently outperforms previous methods; for example, it achieves more than $100,000 \times$ lower communication volume and still outperforms DiscoNet and V2X-ViT on OPV2V.

- **Summary**: Detect-and-Avoid (DAA) capabilities are critical for safe operations of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This paper introduces, AirTrack, a real-time vision-only detect and tracking framework that respects the size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints of sUAS systems. Given the low Signal-to-Noise ratios (SNR) of far away aircraft, we propose using full resolution images in a deep learning framework that aligns successive images to remove ego-motion. The aligned images are then used downstream in cascaded primary and secondary classifiers to improve detection and tracking performance on multiple metrics. We show that AirTrack outperforms state-of-the art baselines on the Amazon Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) Dataset. Multiple real world flight tests with a Cessna 182 interacting with general aviation traffic and additional near-collision flight tests with a Bell helicopter flying towards a UAS in a controlled setting showcase that the proposed approach satisfies the newly introduced ASTM F3442/F3442M standard for DAA. Empirical evaluations show that our system has a probability of track of more than 95% up to a range of 700m. Video available at https://youtu.be/H3lL_Wjxjpw .

- **Summary**: We introduce point affiliation into feature upsampling, a notion that describes the affiliation of each upsampled point to a semantic cluster formed by local decoder feature points with semantic similarity. By rethinking point affiliation, we present a generic formulation for generating upsampling kernels. The kernels encourage not only semantic smoothness but also boundary sharpness in the upsampled feature maps. Such properties are particularly useful for some dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. The key idea of our formulation is to generate similarity-aware kernels by comparing the similarity between each encoder feature point and the spatially associated local region of decoder features. In this way, the encoder feature point can function as a cue to inform the semantic cluster of upsampled feature points. To embody the formulation, we further instantiate a lightweight upsampling operator, termed Similarity-Aware Point Affiliation (SAPA), and investigate its variants. SAPA invites consistent performance improvements on a number of dense prediction tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and image matting.

- **Summary**: A geometric graph is a combinatorial graph, endowed with a geometry that is inherited from its embedding in a Euclidean space. Formulation of a meaningful measure of (dis-)similarity in both the combinatorial and geometric structures of two such geometric graphs is a challenging problem in pattern recognition. We study two notions of distance measures for geometric graphs, called the geometric edit distance (GED) and geometric graph distance (GGD). While the former is based on the idea of editing one graph to transform it into the other graph, the latter is inspired by inexact matching of the graphs. For decades, both notions have been lending themselves well as measures of similarity between attributed graphs. If used without any modification, however, they fail to provide a meaningful distance measure for geometric graphs -- even cease to be a metric. We have curated their associated cost functions for the context of geometric graphs. Alongside studying the metric properties of GED and GGD, we investigate how the two notions compare. We further our understanding of the computational aspects of GGD by showing that the distance is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard to compute, even if the graphs are planar and arbitrary cost coefficients are allowed.

- **Summary**: Leveraging multi-modal fusion, especially between camera and LiDAR, has become essential for building accurate and robust 3D object detection systems for autonomous vehicles. Until recently, point decorating approaches, in which point clouds are augmented with camera features, have been the dominant approach in the field. However, these approaches fail to utilize the higher resolution images from cameras. Recent works projecting camera features to the bird's-eye-view (BEV) space for fusion have also been proposed, however they require projecting millions of pixels, most of which only contain background information. In this work, we propose a novel approach Center Feature Fusion (CFF), in which we leverage center-based detection networks in both the camera and LiDAR streams to identify relevant object locations. We then use the center-based detection to identify the locations of pixel features relevant to object locations, a small fraction of the total number in the image. These are then projected and fused in the BEV frame. On the nuScenes dataset, we outperform the LiDAR-only baseline by 4.9% mAP while fusing up to 100x fewer features than other fusion methods.

- **Summary**: The recent development of high-precision subsea optical scanners allows for 3D keypoint detectors and feature descriptors to be leveraged on point cloud scans from subsea environments. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey to identify the best combination of detectors and descriptors to be used in these challenging and novel environments. This paper aims to identify the best detector/descriptor pair using a challenging field dataset collected using a commercial underwater laser scanner. Furthermore, studies have shown that incorporating texture information to extend geometric features adds robustness to feature matching on synthetic datasets. This paper also proposes a novel method of fusing images with underwater laser scans to produce coloured point clouds, which are used to study the effectiveness of 6D point cloud descriptors.

- **Summary**: We explore a data-driven approach for learning to optimize neural networks. We construct a dataset of neural network checkpoints and train a generative model on the parameters. In particular, our model is a conditional diffusion transformer that, given an initial input parameter vector and a prompted loss, error, or return, predicts the distribution over parameter updates that achieve the desired metric. At test time, it can optimize neural networks with unseen parameters for downstream tasks in just one update. We find that our approach successfully generates parameters for a wide range of loss prompts. Moreover, it can sample multimodal parameter solutions and has favorable scaling properties. We apply our method to different neural network architectures and tasks in supervised and reinforcement learning.

- **Summary**: Among various sensors for assisted and autonomous driving systems, automotive radar has been considered as a robust and low-cost solution even in adverse weather or lighting conditions. With the recent development of radar technologies and open-sourced annotated data sets, semantic segmentation with radar signals has become very promising. However, existing methods are either computationally expensive or discard significant amounts of valuable information from raw 3D radar signals by reducing them to 2D planes via averaging. In this work, we introduce ERASE-Net, an Efficient RAdar SEgmentation Network to segment the raw radar signals semantically. The core of our approach is the novel detect-then-segment method for raw radar signals. It first detects the center point of each object, then extracts a compact radar signal representation, and finally performs semantic segmentation. We show that our method can achieve superior performance on radar semantic segmentation task compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) technique. Furthermore, our approach requires up to 20x less computational resources. Finally, we show that the proposed ERASE-Net can be compressed by 40% without significant loss in performance, significantly more than the SOTA network, which makes it a more promising candidate for practical automotive applications.

- **Summary**: A proper parametrization of state transition matrices of linear state-space models (SSMs) followed by standard nonlinearities enables them to efficiently learn representations from sequential data, establishing the state-of-the-art on a large series of long-range sequence modeling benchmarks. In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.

- **Summary**: Embodied agents need to be able to interact in natural language understanding task descriptions and asking appropriate follow up questions to obtain necessary information to be effective at successfully accomplishing tasks for a wide range of users. In this work, we propose a set of dialog acts for modelling such dialogs and annotate the TEACh dataset that includes over 3,000 situated, task oriented conversations (consisting of 39.5k utterances in total) with dialog acts. TEACh-DA is one of the first large scale dataset of dialog act annotations for embodied task completion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of this annotated dataset in training models for tagging the dialog acts of a given utterance, predicting the dialog act of the next response given a dialog history, and use the dialog acts to guide agent's non-dialog behaviour. In particular, our experiments on the TEACh Execution from Dialog History task where the model predicts the sequence of low level actions to be executed in the environment for embodied task completion, demonstrate that dialog acts can improve end task success rate by up to 2 points compared to the system without dialog acts.

- **Summary**: Recent global growth in the interest of smart cities has led to trillions of dollars of investment toward research and development. These connected cities have the potential to create a symbiosis of technology and society and revolutionize the cost of living, safety, ecological sustainability, and quality of life of societies on a world-wide scale. Some key components of the smart city construct are connected smart grids, self-driving cars, federated learning systems, smart utilities, large-scale public transit, and proactive surveillance systems. While exciting in prospect, these technologies and their subsequent integration cannot be attempted without addressing the potential societal impacts of such a high degree of automation and data sharing. Additionally, the feasibility of coordinating so many disparate tasks will require a fast, extensible, unifying framework. To that end, we propose FaRO2, a completely reimagined successor to FaRO1, built from the ground up. FaRO2 affords all of the same functionality as its predecessor, serving as a unified biometric API harness that allows for seamless evaluation, deployment, and simple pipeline creation for heterogeneous biometric software. FaRO2 additionally provides a fully declarative capability for defining and coordinating custom machine learning and sensor pipelines, allowing the distribution of processes across otherwise incompatible hardware and networks. FaRO2 ultimately provides a way to quickly configure, hot-swap, and expand large coordinated or federated systems online without interruptions for maintenance. Because much of the data collected in a smart city contains Personally Identifying Information (PII), FaRO2 also provides built-in tools and layers to ensure secure and encrypted streaming, storage, and access of PII data across distributed systems.

- **Summary**: Most of today's computer vision pipelines are built around deep neural networks, where convolution operations require most of the generally high compute effort. The Winograd convolution algorithm computes convolutions with fewer MACs compared to the standard algorithm, reducing the operation count by a factor of 2.25x for 3x3 convolutions when using the version with 2x2-sized tiles $F_2$. Even though the gain is significant, the Winograd algorithm with larger tile sizes, i.e., $F_4$, offers even more potential in improving throughput and energy efficiency, as it reduces the required MACs by 4x. Unfortunately, the Winograd algorithm with larger tile sizes introduces numerical issues that prevent its use on integer domain-specific accelerators and higher computational overhead to transform input and output data between spatial and Winograd domains.   To unlock the full potential of Winograd $F_4$, we propose a novel tap-wise quantization method that overcomes the numerical issues of using larger tiles, enabling integer-only inference. Moreover, we present custom hardware units that process the Winograd transformations in a power- and area-efficient way, and we show how to integrate such custom modules in an industrial-grade, programmable DSA. An extensive experimental evaluation on a large set of state-of-the-art computer vision benchmarks reveals that the tap-wise quantization algorithm makes the quantized Winograd $F_4$ network almost as accurate as the FP32 baseline. The Winograd-enhanced DSA achieves up to 1.85x gain in energy efficiency and up to 1.83x end-to-end speed-up for state-of-the-art segmentation and detection networks.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing benefits habitat conservation by making monitoring of large areas easier compared to field surveying especially if the remote sensed data can be automatically analyzed. An important aspect of monitoring is classifying and mapping habitat types present in the monitored area. Automatic classification is a difficult task, as classes have fine-grained differences and their distributions are long-tailed and unbalanced. Usually training data used for automatic land cover classification relies on fully annotated segmentation maps, annotated from remote sensed imagery to a fairly high-level taxonomy, i.e., classes such as forest, farmland, or urban area. A challenge with automatic habitat classification is that reliable data annotation requires field-surveys. Therefore, full segmentation maps are expensive to produce, and training data is often sparse, point-like, and limited to areas accessible by foot. Methods for utilizing these limited data more efficiently are needed.   We address these problems by proposing a method for habitat classification and mapping, and apply this method to classify the entire northern Finnish Lapland area into Natura2000 classes. The method is characterized by using finely-grained, sparse, single-pixel annotations collected from the field, combined with large amounts of unannotated data to produce segmentation maps. Supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods are compared, and the benefits of transfer learning from a larger out-of-domain dataset are demonstrated. We propose a \ac{CNN} biased towards center pixel classification ensembled with a random forest classifier, that produces higher quality classifications than the models themselves alone. We show that cropping augmentations, test-time augmentation and semi-supervised learning can help classification even further.

- **Summary**: Performance metrics for medical image segmentation models are used to measure the agreement between the reference annotation and the predicted segmentation. Usually, overlap metrics, such as the Dice, are used as a metric to evaluate the performance of these models in order for results to be comparable. However, there is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and difficulty level of segmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. Common metrics fail to measure the impact of this mismatch, especially for clinical data sets that include low signal pathologies, a difficult segmentation task, and uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations. This limitation may result in ineffective research of machine learning practitioners in designing and optimizing models. Dimensions of evaluating clinical value include consideration of the uncertainty of reference annotations, independence from reference annotation volume size, and evaluation of classification of empty reference annotations. We study how uncertain, small, and empty reference annotations influence the value of metrics for medical image segmentation on an in-house data set regardless of the model. We examine metrics behavior on the predictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify metrics with clinical value. We compare to a public benchmark data set (BraTS 2019) with a high-signal pathology and certain, larger, and no empty reference annotations. We may show machine learning practitioners, how uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations require a rethinking of the evaluation and optimizing procedures. The evaluation code was released to encourage further analysis of this topic. https://github.com/SophieOstmeier/UncertainSmallEmpty.git

- **Summary**: We introduce a new approach to image forensics: placing physical refractive objects, which we call totems, into a scene so as to protect any photograph taken of that scene. Totems bend and redirect light rays, thus providing multiple, albeit distorted, views of the scene within a single image. A defender can use these distorted totem pixels to detect if an image has been manipulated. Our approach unscrambles the light rays passing through the totems by estimating their positions in the scene and using their known geometric and material properties. To verify a totem-protected image, we detect inconsistencies between the scene reconstructed from totem viewpoints and the scene's appearance from the camera viewpoint. Such an approach makes the adversarial manipulation task more difficult, as the adversary must modify both the totem and image pixels in a geometrically consistent manner without knowing the physical properties of the totem. Unlike prior learning-based approaches, our method does not require training on datasets of specific manipulations, and instead uses physical properties of the scene and camera to solve the forensics problem.

- **Summary**: 6-DoF robotic grasping is a long-lasting but unsolved problem. Recent methods utilize strong 3D networks to extract geometric grasping representations from depth sensors, demonstrating superior accuracy on common objects but perform unsatisfactorily on photometrically challenging objects, e.g., objects in transparent or reflective materials. The bottleneck lies in that the surface of these objects can not reflect back accurate depth due to the absorption or refraction of light. In this paper, in contrast to exploiting the inaccurate depth data, we propose the first RGB-only 6-DoF grasping pipeline called MonoGraspNet that utilizes stable 2D features to simultaneously handle arbitrary object grasping and overcome the problems induced by photometrically challenging objects. MonoGraspNet leverages keypoint heatmap and normal map to recover the 6-DoF grasping poses represented by our novel representation parameterized with 2D keypoints with corresponding depth, grasping direction, grasping width, and angle. Extensive experiments in real scenes demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive results in grasping common objects and surpass the depth-based competitor by a large margin in grasping photometrically challenging objects. To further stimulate robotic manipulation research, we additionally annotate and open-source a multi-view and multi-scene real-world grasping dataset, containing 120 objects of mixed photometric complexity with 20M accurate grasping labels.

- **Summary**: Great successes have been achieved using deep learning techniques for image super-resolution (SR) with fixed scales. To increase its real world applicability, numerous models have also been proposed to restore SR images with arbitrary scale factors, including asymmetric ones where images are resized to different scales along horizontal and vertical directions. Though most models are only optimized for the unidirectional upscaling task while assuming a predefined downscaling kernel for low-resolution (LR) inputs, recent models based on Invertible Neural Networks (INN) are able to increase upscaling accuracy significantly by optimizing the downscaling and upscaling cycle jointly. However, limited by the INN architecture, it is constrained to fixed integer scale factors and requires one model for each scale. Without increasing model complexity, a simple and effective invertible arbitrary rescaling network (IARN) is proposed to achieve arbitrary image rescaling by training only one model in this work. Using innovative components like position-aware scale encoding and preemptive channel splitting, the network is optimized to convert the non-invertible rescaling cycle to an effectively invertible process. It is shown to achieve a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in bidirectional arbitrary rescaling without compromising perceptual quality in LR outputs. It is also demonstrated to perform well on tests with asymmetric scales using the same network architecture.

- **Summary**: We introduce VISOR, a new dataset of pixel annotations and a benchmark suite for segmenting hands and active objects in egocentric video. VISOR annotates videos from EPIC-KITCHENS, which comes with a new set of challenges not encountered in current video segmentation datasets. Specifically, we need to ensure both short- and long-term consistency of pixel-level annotations as objects undergo transformative interactions, e.g. an onion is peeled, diced and cooked - where we aim to obtain accurate pixel-level annotations of the peel, onion pieces, chopping board, knife, pan, as well as the acting hands. VISOR introduces an annotation pipeline, AI-powered in parts, for scalability and quality. In total, we publicly release 272K manual semantic masks of 257 object classes, 9.9M interpolated dense masks, 67K hand-object relations, covering 36 hours of 179 untrimmed videos. Along with the annotations, we introduce three challenges in video object segmentation, interaction understanding and long-term reasoning.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models for vision tasks are trained on large datasets under the assumption that there exists a universal representation that can be used to make predictions for all samples. Whereas high complexity models are proven to be capable of learning such representations, a mixture of experts trained on specific subsets of the data can infer the labels more efficiently. However using mixture of experts poses two new problems, namely (i) assigning the correct expert at inference time when a new unseen sample is presented. (ii) Finding the optimal partitioning of the training data, such that the experts rely the least on common features. In Dynamic Routing (DR) a novel architecture is proposed where each layer is composed of a set of experts, however without addressing the two challenges we demonstrate that the model reverts to using the same subset of experts.   In our method, Diversified Dynamic Routing (DivDR) the model is explicitly trained to solve the challenge of finding relevant partitioning of the data and assigning the correct experts in an unsupervised approach. We conduct several experiments on semantic segmentation on Cityscapes and object detection and instance segmentation on MS-COCO showing improved performance over several baselines.

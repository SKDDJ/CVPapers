- **Summary**: Efficient custom pooling techniques that can aggressively trim the dimensions of a feature map and thereby reduce inference compute and memory footprint for resource-constrained computer vision applications have recently gained significant traction. However, prior pooling works extract only the local context of the activation maps, limiting their effectiveness. In contrast, we propose a novel non-local self-attentive pooling method that can be used as a drop-in replacement to the standard pooling layers, such as max/average pooling or strided convolution. The proposed self-attention module uses patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and spatial-channel restoration, followed by sigmoid activation and exponential soft-max. This self-attention mechanism efficiently aggregates dependencies between non-local activation patches during down-sampling. Extensive experiments on standard object classification and detection tasks with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanism over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) pooling techniques. In particular, we surpass the test accuracy of existing pooling techniques on different variants of MobileNet-V2 on ImageNet by an average of 1.2%. With the aggressive down-sampling of the activation maps in the initial layers (providing up to 22x reduction in memory consumption), our approach achieves 1.43% higher test accuracy compared to SOTA techniques with iso-memory footprints. This enables the deployment of our models in memory-constrained devices, such as micro-controllers (without losing significant accuracy), because the initial activation maps consume a significant amount of on-chip memory for high-resolution images required for complex vision tasks. Our proposed pooling method also leverages the idea of channel pruning to further reduce memory footprints.

- **Summary**: Packaged fresh-cut lettuce is widely consumed as a major component of vegetable salad owing to its high nutrition, freshness, and convenience. However, enzymatic browning discoloration on lettuce cut edges significantly reduces product quality and shelf life. While there are many research and breeding efforts underway to minimize browning, the progress is hindered by the lack of a rapid and reliable methodology to evaluate browning. Current methods to identify and quantify browning are either too subjective, labor intensive, or inaccurate. In this paper, we report a deep learning model for lettuce browning prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first-of-its-kind on deep learning for lettuce browning prediction using a pretrained Siamese Quadratic Swin (SQ-Swin) transformer with several highlights. First, our model includes quadratic features in the transformer model which is more powerful to incorporate real-world representations than the linear transformer. Second, a multi-scale training strategy is proposed to augment the data and explore more of the inherent self-similarity of the lettuce images. Third, the proposed model uses a siamese architecture which learns the inter-relations among the limited training samples. Fourth, the model is pretrained on the ImageNet and then trained with the reptile meta-learning algorithm to learn higher-order gradients than a regular one. Experiment results on the fresh-cut lettuce datasets show that the proposed SQ-Swin outperforms the traditional methods and other deep learning-based backbones.

- **Summary**: When using constellation synergy to image large areas for reconnaissance, it is required to achieve the coverage capability requirements with minimal consumption of observation resources to obtain the most optimal constellation observation scheme. With the minimum number of satellites and meeting the real-time ground coverage requirements as the optimization objectives, this paper proposes an optimized design of satellite constellation configuration for full coverage of large-scale regional imaging by using an improved simulated annealing algorithm combined with the real-time coverage evaluation method of hexagonal discretization. The algorithm can adapt to experimental conditions, has good efficiency, and can meet industrial accuracy requirements. The effectiveness and adaptability of the algorithm are tested in simulation applications.

- **Summary**: In unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), directly adapting from the source to the target domain usually suffers significant discrepancies and leads to insufficient alignment. Thus, many UDA works attempt to vanish the domain gap gradually and softly via various intermediate spaces, dubbed domain bridging (DB). However, for dense prediction tasks such as domain adaptive semantic segmentation (DASS), existing solutions have mostly relied on rough style transfer and how to elegantly bridge domains is still under-explored. In this work, we resort to data mixing to establish a deliberated domain bridging (DDB) for DASS, through which the joint distributions of source and target domains are aligned and interacted with each in the intermediate space. At the heart of DDB lies a dual-path domain bridging step for generating two intermediate domains using the coarse-wise and the fine-wise data mixing techniques, alongside a cross-path knowledge distillation step for taking two complementary models trained on generated intermediate samples as 'teachers' to develop a superior 'student' in a multi-teacher distillation manner. These two optimization steps work in an alternating way and reinforce each other to give rise to DDB with strong adaptation power. Extensive experiments on adaptive segmentation tasks with different settings demonstrate that our DDB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: As intensities of MRI volumes are inconsistent across institutes, it is essential to extract universal features of multi-modal MRIs to precisely segment brain tumors. In this concept, we propose a volumetric vision transformer that follows two windowing strategies in attention for extracting fine features and local distributional smoothness (LDS) during model training inspired by virtual adversarial training (VAT) to make the model robust. We trained and evaluated network architecture on the FeTS Challenge 2022 dataset. Our performance on the online validation dataset is as follows: Dice Similarity Score of 81.71%, 91.38% and 85.40%; Hausdorff Distance (95%) of 14.81 mm, 3.93 mm, 11.18 mm for the enhancing tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core, respectively. Overall, the experimental results verify our method's effectiveness by yielding better performance in segmentation accuracy for each tumor sub-region.

- **Summary**: Multi-modality Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) has been routinely used in the assessment of common cancers, such as lung cancer, lymphoma, and melanoma. This is mainly attributed to the fact that PET/CT combines the high sensitivity for tumor detection of PET and anatomical information from CT. In PET/CT image assessment, automatic tumor segmentation is an important step, and in recent years, deep learning based methods have become the state-of-the-art. Unfortunately, existing methods tend to over-segment the tumor regions and include regions such as the normal high uptake organs, inflammation, and other infections. In this study, we introduce a false positive reduction network to overcome this limitation. We firstly introduced a self-supervised pre-trained global segmentation module to coarsely delineate the candidate tumor regions using a self-supervised pre-trained encoder. The candidate tumor regions were then refined by removing false positives via a local refinement module. Our experiments with the MICCAI 2022 Automated Lesion Segmentation in Whole-Body FDG-PET/CT (AutoPET) challenge dataset showed that our method achieved a dice score of 0.9324 with the preliminary testing data and was ranked 1st place in dice on the leaderboard. Our method was also ranked in the top 7 methods on the final testing data, the final ranking will be announced during the 2022 MICCAI AutoPET workshop.

- **Summary**: Color image denoising is frequently encountered in various image processing and computer vision tasks. One traditional strategy is to convert the RGB image to a less correlated color space and denoise each channel of the new space separately. However, such a strategy can not fully exploit the correlated information between channels and is inadequate to obtain satisfactory results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new multi-channel optimization model for color image denoising under the nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm minimization framework. Specifically, based on the block-matching, the color image is decomposed into overlapping RGB patches. For each patch, we stack its similar neighbors to form the corresponding patch matrix. The proposed model is performed on the patch matrix to recover its noise-free version. During the recovery process, a) a weight matrix is introduced to fully utilize the noise difference between channels; b) the singular values are shrunk adaptively without additionally assigning weights. With them, the proposed model can achieve promising results while keeping simplicity. To solve the proposed model, an accurate and effective algorithm is built based on the alternating direction method of multipliers framework. The solution of each updating step can be analytically expressed in closed-from. Rigorous theoretical analysis proves the solution sequences generated by the proposed algorithm converge to their respective stationary points. Experimental results on both synthetic and real noise datasets demonstrate the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: A few lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been recently designed for remote sensing object detection (RSOD). However, most of them simply replace vanilla convolutions with stacked separable convolutions, which may not be efficient due to a lot of precision losses and may not be able to detect oriented bounding boxes (OBB). Also, the existing OBB detection methods are difficult to constrain the shape of objects predicted by CNNs accurately. In this paper, we propose an effective lightweight oriented object detector (LO-Det). Specifically, a channel separation-aggregation (CSA) structure is designed to simplify the complexity of stacked separable convolutions, and a dynamic receptive field (DRF) mechanism is developed to maintain high accuracy by customizing the convolution kernel and its perception range dynamically when reducing the network complexity. The CSA-DRF component optimizes efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Then, a diagonal support constraint head (DSC-Head) component is designed to detect OBBs and constrain their shapes more accurately and stably. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed LO-Det can run very fast even on embedded devices with the competitive accuracy of detecting oriented objects.

- **Summary**: Humans learn continually throughout their lifespan by accumulating diverse knowledge and fine-tuning it for future tasks. When presented with a similar goal, neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting if data distributions across sequential tasks are not stationary over the course of learning. An effective approach to address such continual learning (CL) problems is to use hypernetworks which generate task dependent weights for a target network. However, the continual learning performance of existing hypernetwork based approaches are affected by the assumption of independence of the weights across the layers in order to maintain parameter efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that uses a dependency preserving hypernetwork to generate weights for the target network while also maintaining the parameter efficiency. We propose to use recurrent neural network (RNN) based hypernetwork that can generate layer weights efficiently while allowing for dependencies across them. In addition, we propose novel regularisation and network growth techniques for the RNN based hypernetwork to further improve the continual learning performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted experiments on several image classification continual learning tasks and settings. We found that the proposed methods based on the RNN hypernetworks outperformed the baselines in all these CL settings and tasks.

- **Summary**: Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs), such as dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and West Nile virus, cause over one million deaths globally every year. Because many such diseases are spread by the Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, tracking these larvae becomes critical in mitigating the spread of MBDs. Even as citizen science grows and obtains larger mosquito image datasets, the manual annotation of mosquito images becomes ever more time-consuming and inefficient. Previous research has used computer vision to identify mosquito species, and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has become the de-facto for image classification. However, these models typically require substantial computational resources. This research introduces the application of the Vision Transformer (ViT) in a comparative study to improve image classification on Aedes and Culex larvae. Two ViT models, ViT-Base and CvT-13, and two CNN models, ResNet-18 and ConvNeXT, were trained on mosquito larvae image data and compared to determine the most effective model to distinguish mosquito larvae as Aedes or Culex. Testing revealed that ConvNeXT obtained the greatest values across all classification metrics, demonstrating its viability for mosquito larvae classification. Based on these results, future research includes creating a model specifically designed for mosquito larvae classification by combining elements of CNN and transformer architecture.

- **Summary**: We present a visual and inertial-based terrain classification network (VINet) for robotic navigation over different traversable surfaces. We use a novel navigation-based labeling scheme for terrain classification and generalization on unknown surfaces. Our proposed perception method and adaptive scheduling control framework can make predictions according to terrain navigation properties and lead to better performance on both terrain classification and navigation control on known and unknown surfaces. Our VINet can achieve 98.37% in terms of accuracy under supervised setting on known terrains and improve the accuracy by 8.51% on unknown terrains compared to previous methods. We deploy VINet on a mobile tracked robot for trajectory following and navigation on different terrains, and we demonstrate an improvement of 10.3% compared to a baseline controller in terms of RMSE.

- **Summary**: With the fast development of autonomous driving technologies, there is an increasing demand for high-definition (HD) maps, which provide reliable and robust prior information about the static part of the traffic environments. As one of the important elements in HD maps, road lane centerline is critical for downstream tasks, such as prediction and planning. Manually annotating centerlines for road lanes in HD maps is labor-intensive, expensive and inefficient, severely restricting the wide applications of autonomous driving systems. Previous work seldom explores the lane centerline detection problem due to the complicated topology and severe overlapping issues of lane centerlines. In this paper, we propose a novel method named CenterLineDet to detect lane centerlines for automatic HD map generation. Our CenterLineDet is trained by imitation learning and can effectively detect the graph of centerlines with vehicle-mounted sensors (i.e., six cameras and one LiDAR) through iterations. Due to the use of the DETR-like transformer network, CenterLineDet can handle complicated graph topology, such as lane intersections. The proposed approach is evaluated on the large-scale public dataset NuScenes. The superiority of our CenterLineDet is demonstrated by the comparative results. Our code, supplementary materials, and video demonstrations are available at \href{https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/projects/CenterLineDet/}{https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/projects/CenterLineDet/}.

- **Summary**: Adversarial Training (AT), which is commonly accepted as one of the most effective approaches defending against adversarial examples, can largely harm the standard performance, thus has limited usefulness on industrial-scale production and applications. Surprisingly, this phenomenon is totally opposite in Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, where AT can even benefit for generalization. We notice the merit of AT in NLP tasks could derive from the discrete and symbolic input space. For borrowing the advantage from NLP-style AT, we propose Discrete Adversarial Training (DAT). DAT leverages VQGAN to reform the image data to discrete text-like inputs, i.e. visual words. Then it minimizes the maximal risk on such discrete images with symbolic adversarial perturbations. We further give an explanation from the perspective of distribution to demonstrate the effectiveness of DAT. As a plug-and-play technique for enhancing the visual representation, DAT achieves significant improvement on multiple tasks including image classification, object detection and self-supervised learning. Especially, the model pre-trained with Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) and fine-tuned by our DAT without extra data can get 31.40 mCE on ImageNet-C and 32.77% top-1 accuracy on Stylized-ImageNet, building the new state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers have shown excellent performance in computer vision tasks. As the computation cost of their self-attention mechanism is expensive, recent works tried to replace the self-attention mechanism in vision transformers with convolutional operations, which is more efficient with built-in inductive bias. However, these efforts either ignore multi-level features or lack dynamic prosperity, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Multi-level Attention mechanism (DMA), which captures different patterns of input images by multiple kernel sizes and enables input-adaptive weights with a gating mechanism. Based on DMA, we present an efficient backbone network named DMFormer. DMFormer adopts the overall architecture of vision transformers, while replacing the self-attention mechanism with our proposed DMA. Extensive experimental results on ImageNet-1K and ADE20K datasets demonstrated that DMFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, which outperforms similar-sized vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

- **Summary**: Generating precise class-aware pseudo ground-truths, a.k.a, class activation maps (CAMs), is essential for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. The original CAM method usually produces incomplete and inaccurate localization maps. To tackle with this issue, this paper proposes an Expansion and Shrinkage scheme based on the offset learning in the deformable convolution, to sequentially improve the recall and precision of the located object in the two respective stages. In the Expansion stage, an offset learning branch in a deformable convolution layer, referred as "expansion sampler" seeks for sampling increasingly less discriminative object regions, driven by an inverse supervision signal that maximizes image-level classification loss. The located more complete object in the Expansion stage is then gradually narrowed down to the final object region during the Shrinkage stage. In the Shrinkage stage, the offset learning branch of another deformable convolution layer, referred as "shrinkage sampler", is introduced to exclude the false positive background regions attended in the Expansion stage to improve the precision of the localization maps. We conduct various experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 to well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Code will be made publicly available here https://github.com/TyroneLi/ESOL_WSSS.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation methods that require 1\% or fewer labels, hoping to realize almost the same performance as fully supervised approaches, which recently, have attracted extensive research attention. A typical solution in this framework is to use self-training or pseudo labeling to mine the supervision from the point cloud itself, but ignore the critical information from images. In fact, cameras widely exist in LiDAR scenarios and this complementary information seems to be greatly important for 3D applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality weakly supervised method for 3D segmentation, incorporating complementary information from unlabeled images. Basically, we design a dual-branch network equipped with an active labeling strategy, to maximize the power of tiny parts of labels and directly realize 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Afterwards, we establish a cross-modal self-training framework in an Expectation-Maximum (EM) perspective, which iterates between pseudo labels estimation and parameters updating. In the M-Step, we propose a cross-modal association learning to mine complementary supervision from images by reinforcing the cycle-consistency between 3D points and 2D superpixels. In the E-step, a pseudo label self-rectification mechanism is derived to filter noise labels thus providing more accurate labels for the networks to get fully trained. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method even outperforms the state-of-the-art fully supervised competitors with less than 1\% actively selected annotations.

- **Summary**: In low-level video analyses, effective representations are important to derive the correspondences between video frames. These representations have been learned in a self-supervised fashion from unlabeled images or videos, using carefully designed pretext tasks in some recent studies. However, the previous work concentrates on either spatial-discriminative features or temporal-repetitive features, with little attention to the synergy between spatial and temporal cues. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-then-temporal self-supervised learning method. Specifically, we firstly extract spatial features from unlabeled images via contrastive learning, and secondly enhance the features by exploiting the temporal cues in unlabeled videos via reconstructive learning. In the second step, we design a global correlation distillation loss to ensure the learning not to forget the spatial cues, and a local correlation distillation loss to combat the temporal discontinuity that harms the reconstruction. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, as established by the experimental results on a series of correspondence-based video analysis tasks. Also, we performed ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of the two-step design as well as the distillation losses.

- **Summary**: Deep reinforcement learning policies, despite their outstanding efficiency in simulated visual control tasks, have shown disappointing ability to generalize across disturbances in the input training images. Changes in image statistics or distracting background elements are pitfalls that prevent generalization and real-world applicability of such control policies. We elaborate on the intuition that a good visual policy should be able to identify which pixels are important for its decision, and preserve this identification of important sources of information across images. This implies that training of a policy with small generalization gap should focus on such important pixels and ignore the others. This leads to the introduction of saliency-guided Q-networks (SGQN), a generic method for visual reinforcement learning, that is compatible with any value function learning method. SGQN vastly improves the generalization capability of Soft Actor-Critic agents and outperforms existing stateof-the-art methods on the Deepmind Control Generalization benchmark, setting a new reference in terms of training efficiency, generalization gap, and policy interpretability.

- **Summary**: Notwithstanding the prominent performance achieved in various applications, point cloud recognition models have often suffered from natural corruptions and adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we delve into boosting the general robustness of point cloud recognition models and propose Point-Cloud Contrastive Adversarial Training (PointCAT). The main intuition of PointCAT is encouraging the target recognition model to narrow the decision gap between clean point clouds and corrupted point clouds. Specifically, we leverage a supervised contrastive loss to facilitate the alignment and uniformity of the hypersphere features extracted by the recognition model, and design a pair of centralizing losses with the dynamic prototype guidance to avoid these features deviating from their belonging category clusters. To provide the more challenging corrupted point clouds, we adversarially train a noise generator along with the recognition model from the scratch, instead of using gradient-based attack as the inner loop like previous adversarial training methods. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed PointCAT outperforms the baseline methods and dramatically boosts the robustness of different point cloud recognition models, under a variety of corruptions including isotropic point noises, the LiDAR simulated noises, random point dropping and adversarial perturbations.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have shown that detectors based on deep models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, even in the black-box scenario where the attacker cannot access the model information. Most existing attack methods aim to minimize the true positive rate, which often shows poor attack performance, as another sub-optimal bounding box may be detected around the attacked bounding box to be the new true positive one. To settle this challenge, we propose to minimize the true positive rate and maximize the false positive rate, which can encourage more false positive objects to block the generation of new true positive bounding boxes. It is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOP) problem, of which the generic algorithm can search the Pareto-optimal. However, our task has more than two million decision variables, leading to low searching efficiency. Thus, we extend the standard Genetic Algorithm with Random Subset selection and Divide-and-Conquer, called GARSDC, which significantly improves the efficiency. Moreover, to alleviate the sensitivity to population quality in generic algorithms, we generate a gradient-prior initial population, utilizing the transferability between different detectors with similar backbones. Compared with the state-of-art attack methods, GARSDC decreases by an average 12.0 in the mAP and queries by about 1000 times in extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: Tracking the players and the ball in team sports is key to analyse the performance or to enhance the game watching experience with augmented reality. When the only sources for this data are broadcast videos, sports-field registration systems are required to estimate the homography and re-project the ball or the players from the image space to the field space. This paper describes a new basketball court registration framework in the context of the MMSports 2022 camera calibration challenge. The method is based on the estimation by an encoder-decoder network of the positions of keypoints sampled with perspective-aware constraints. The regression of the basket positions and heavy data augmentation techniques make the model robust to different arenas. Ablation studies show the positive effects of our contributions on the challenge test set. Our method divides the mean squared error by 4.7 compared to the challenge baseline.

- **Summary**: Inferring the timing and amplitude of perturbations in epidemiological systems from their stochastically spread low-resolution outcomes is as relevant as challenging. It is a requirement for current approaches to overcome the need to know the details of the perturbations to proceed with the analyses. However, the general problem of connecting epidemiological curves with the underlying incidence lacks the highly effective methodology present in other inverse problems, such as super-resolution and dehazing from computer vision. Here, we develop an unsupervised physics-informed convolutional neural network approach in reverse to connect death records with incidence that allows the identification of regime changes at single-day resolution. Applied to COVID-19 data with proper regularization and model-selection criteria, the approach can identify the implementation and removal of lockdowns and other nonpharmaceutical interventions with 0.93-day accuracy over the time span of a year.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel learning-based framework that combines the local accuracy of contrastive learning with the global consistency of geometric approaches, for robust non-rigid matching. We first observe that while contrastive learning can lead to powerful point-wise features, the learned correspondences commonly lack smoothness and consistency, owing to the purely combinatorial nature of the standard contrastive losses. To overcome this limitation we propose to boost contrastive feature learning with two types of smoothness regularization that inject geometric information into correspondence learning. With this novel combination in hand, the resulting features are both highly discriminative across individual points, and, at the same time, lead to robust and consistent correspondences, through simple proximity queries. Our framework is general and is applicable to local feature learning in both the 3D and 2D domains. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments on a wide range of challenging matching benchmarks, including 3D non-rigid shape correspondence and 2D image keypoint matching.

- **Summary**: It is challenging to remove rain-steaks from a single rainy image because the rain steaks are spatially varying in the rainy image. This problem is studied in this paper by combining conventional image processing techniques and deep learning based techniques. An improved weighted guided image filter (iWGIF) is proposed to extract high frequency information from a rainy image. The high frequency information mainly includes rain steaks and noise, and it can guide the rain steaks aware deep convolutional neural network (RSADCNN) to pay more attention to rain steaks. The efficiency and explain-ability of RSADNN are improved. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images in terms of both qualitative and quantitative measures. It is useful for autonomous navigation in raining conditions.

- **Summary**: While self-supervised learning techniques are often used to mining implicit knowledge from unlabeled data via modeling multiple views, it is unclear how to perform effective representation learning in a complex and inconsistent context. To this end, we propose a methodology, specifically consistency and complementarity network (CoCoNet), which avails of strict global inter-view consistency and local cross-view complementarity preserving regularization to comprehensively learn representations from multiple views. On the global stage, we reckon that the crucial knowledge is implicitly shared among views, and enhancing the encoder to capture such knowledge from data can improve the discriminability of the learned representations. Hence, preserving the global consistency of multiple views ensures the acquisition of common knowledge. CoCoNet aligns the probabilistic distribution of views by utilizing an efficient discrepancy metric measurement based on the generalized sliced Wasserstein distance. Lastly on the local stage, we propose a heuristic complementarity-factor, which joints cross-view discriminative knowledge, and it guides the encoders to learn not only view-wise discriminability but also cross-view complementary information. Theoretically, we provide the information-theoretical-based analyses of our proposed CoCoNet. Empirically, to investigate the improvement gains of our approach, we conduct adequate experimental validations, which demonstrate that CoCoNet outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods by a significant margin proves that such implicit consistency and complementarity preserving regularization can enhance the discriminability of latent representations.

- **Summary**: We propose WS-DINO as a novel framework to use weak label information in learning phenotypic representations from high-content fluorescent images of cells. Our model is based on a knowledge distillation approach with a vision transformer backbone (DINO), and we use this as a benchmark model for our study. Using WS-DINO, we fine-tuned with weak label information available in high-content microscopy screens (treatment and compound) and achieve state-of-the-art performance in not-same-compound mechanism of action prediction on the BBBC021 dataset (98%), and not-same-compound-and-batch performance (96%) using the compound as the weak label. Our method bypasses single cell cropping as a pre-processing step, and using self-attention maps we show that the model learns structurally meaningful phenotypic profiles.

- **Summary**: Most of the existing semantic segmentation approaches with image-level class labels as supervision, highly rely on the initial class activation map (CAM) generated from the standard classification network. In this paper, a novel "Progressive Patch Learning" approach is proposed to improve the local details extraction of the classification, producing the CAM better covering the whole object rather than only the most discriminative regions as in CAMs obtained in conventional classification models. "Patch Learning" destructs the feature maps into patches and independently processes each local patch in parallel before the final aggregation. Such a mechanism enforces the network to find weak information from the scattered discriminative local parts, achieving enhanced local details sensitivity. "Progressive Patch Learning" further extends the feature destruction and patch learning to multi-level granularities in a progressive manner. Cooperating with a multi-stage optimization strategy, such a "Progressive Patch Learning" mechanism implicitly provides the model with the feature extraction ability across different locality-granularities. As an alternative to the implicit multi-granularity progressive fusion approach, we additionally propose an explicit method to simultaneously fuse features from different granularities in a single model, further enhancing the CAM quality on the full object coverage. Our proposed method achieves outstanding performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset e.g., with 69.6$% mIoU on the test set), which surpasses most existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. Code will be made publicly available here https://github.com/TyroneLi/PPL_WSSS.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is the key to deploying models safely in the open world. For OOD detection, collecting sufficient in-distribution (ID) labeled data is usually more time-consuming and costly than unlabeled data. When ID labeled data is limited, the previous OOD detection methods are no longer superior due to their high dependence on the amount of ID labeled data. Based on limited ID labeled data and sufficient unlabeled data, we define a new setting called Weakly-Supervised Out-of-Distribution Detection (WSOOD). To solve the new problem, we propose an effective method called Topological Structure Learning (TSL). Firstly, TSL uses a contrastive learning method to build the initial topological structure space for ID and OOD data. Secondly, TSL mines effective topological connections in the initial topological space. Finally, based on limited ID labeled data and mined topological connections, TSL reconstructs the topological structure in a new topological space to increase the separability of ID and OOD instances. Extensive studies on several representative datasets show that TSL remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art, verifying the validity and robustness of our method in the new setting of WSOOD.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional (3D) images, such as CT, MRI, and PET, are common in medical imaging applications and important in clinical diagnosis. Semantic ambiguity is a typical feature of many medical image labels. It can be caused by many factors, such as the imaging properties, pathological anatomy, and the weak representation of the binary masks, which brings challenges to accurate 3D segmentation. In 2D medical images, using soft masks instead of binary masks generated by image matting to characterize lesions can provide rich semantic information, describe the structural characteristics of lesions more comprehensively, and thus benefit the subsequent diagnoses and analyses. In this work, we introduce image matting into the 3D scenes to describe the lesions in 3D medical images. The study of image matting in 3D modality is limited, and there is no high-quality annotated dataset related to 3D matting, therefore slowing down the development of data-driven deep-learning-based methods. To address this issue, we constructed the first 3D medical matting dataset and convincingly verified the validity of the dataset through quality control and downstream experiments in lung nodules classification. We then adapt the four selected state-of-the-art 2D image matting algorithms to 3D scenes and further customize the methods for CT images. Also, we propose the first end-to-end deep 3D matting network and implement a solid 3D medical image matting benchmark, which will be released to encourage further research.

- **Summary**: There has been growing research interest in using deep learning based method to achieve fully automated segmentation of lesion in Positron emission tomography computed tomography(PET CT) scans for the prognosis of various cancers. Recent advances in the medical image segmentation shows the nnUNET is feasible for diverse tasks. However, lesion segmentation in the PET images is not straightforward, because lesion and physiological uptake has similar distribution patterns. The Distinction of them requires extra structural information in the CT images. The present paper introduces a nnUNet based method for the lesion segmentation task. The proposed model is designed on the basis of the joint 2D and 3D nnUNET architecture to predict lesions across the whole body. It allows for automated segmentation of potential lesions. We evaluate the proposed method in the context of AutoPet Challenge, which measures the lesion segmentation performance in the metrics of dice score, false-positive volume and false-negative volume.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction has been a long-standing problem in intelligent systems like autonomous driving and robot navigation. Models trained on large-scale benchmarks have made significant progress in improving prediction accuracy. However, the importance on efficiency for real-time applications has been less emphasized. This paper proposes an attention-based graph model, named GATraj, which achieves a good balance of prediction accuracy and inference speed. We use attention mechanisms to model the spatial-temporal dynamics of agents, such as pedestrians or vehicles, and a graph convolutional network to model their interactions. Additionally, a Laplacian mixture decoder is implemented to mitigate mode collapse and generate diverse multimodal predictions for each agent. GATraj achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance at a much higher speed when tested on the ETH/UCY datasets for pedestrian trajectories, and good performance at about 100 Hz inference speed when tested on the nuScenes dataset for autonomous driving. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze the probability estimation of the Laplacian mixture decoder and compare it with a Gaussian mixture decoder for predicting different multimodalities. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module in GATraj. The code is released at https://github.com/mengmengliu1998/GATraj.

- **Summary**: Most classical SLAM systems rely on the static scene assumption, which limits their applicability in real world scenarios. Recent SLAM frameworks have been proposed to simultaneously track the camera and moving objects. However they are often unable to estimate the canonical pose of the objects and exhibit a low object tracking accuracy. To solve this problem we propose TwistSLAM++, a semantic, dynamic, SLAM system that fuses stereo images and LiDAR information. Using semantic information, we track potentially moving objects and associate them to 3D object detections in LiDAR scans to obtain their pose and size. Then, we perform registration on consecutive object scans to refine object pose estimation. Finally, object scans are used to estimate the shape of the object and constrain map points to lie on the estimated surface within the BA. We show on classical benchmarks that this fusion approach based on multimodal information improves the accuracy of object tracking.

- **Summary**: Numerous applications require robots to operate in environments shared with other agents, such as humans or other robots. However, such shared scenes are typically subject to different kinds of long-term semantic scene changes. The ability to model and predict such changes is thus crucial for robot autonomy. In this work, we formalize the task of semantic scene variability estimation and identify three main varieties of semantic scene change: changes in the position of an object, its semantic state, or the composition of a scene as a whole. To represent this variability, we propose the Variable Scene Graph (VSG), which augments existing 3D Scene Graph (SG) representations with the variability attribute, representing the likelihood of discrete long-term change events. We present a novel method, DeltaVSG, to estimate the variability of VSGs in a supervised fashion. We evaluate our method on the 3RScan long-term dataset, showing notable improvements in this novel task over existing approaches. Our method DeltaVSG achieves an accuracy of 77.1% and a recall of 72.3%, often mimicking human intuition about how indoor scenes change over time. We further show the utility of VSG prediction in the task of active robotic change detection, speeding up task completion by 66.0% compared to a scene-change-unaware planner. We make our code available as open-source.

- **Summary**: Active inference is a first principles approach for understanding the brain in particular, and sentient agents in general, with the single imperative of minimizing free energy. As such, it provides a computational account for modelling artificial intelligent agents, by defining the agent's generative model and inferring the model parameters, actions and hidden state beliefs. However, the exact specification of the generative model and the hidden state space structure is left to the experimenter, whose design choices influence the resulting behaviour of the agent. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to learn a hidden state space structure purely from data, alleviating the experimenter from this tedious design task, but resulting in an entangled, non-interpreteable state space. In this paper, we hypothesize that such a learnt, entangled state space does not necessarily yield the best model in terms of free energy, and that enforcing different factors in the state space can yield a lower model complexity. In particular, we consider the problem of 3D object representation, and focus on different instances of the ShapeNet dataset. We propose a model that factorizes object shape, pose and category, while still learning a representation for each factor using a deep neural network. We show that models, with best disentanglement properties, perform best when adopted by an active agent in reaching preferred observations.

- **Summary**: As a successful approach to self-supervised learning, contrastive learning aims to learn invariant information shared among distortions of the input sample. While contrastive learning has yielded continuous advancements in sampling strategy and architecture design, it still remains two persistent defects: the interference of task-irrelevant information and sample inefficiency, which are related to the recurring existence of trivial constant solutions. From the perspective of dimensional analysis, we find out that the dimensional redundancy and dimensional confounder are the intrinsic issues behind the phenomena, and provide experimental evidence to support our viewpoint. We further propose a simple yet effective approach MetaMask, short for the dimensional Mask learned by Meta-learning, to learn representations against dimensional redundancy and confounder. MetaMask adopts the redundancy-reduction technique to tackle the dimensional redundancy issue and innovatively introduces a dimensional mask to reduce the gradient effects of specific dimensions containing the confounder, which is trained by employing a meta-learning paradigm with the objective of improving the performance of masked representations on a typical self-supervised task. We provide solid theoretical analyses to prove MetaMask can obtain tighter risk bounds for downstream classification compared to typical contrastive methods. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been a vital protocol for migrating information learned from a labeled source domain to facilitate the implementation in an unlabeled heterogeneous target domain. Although UDA is typically jointly trained on data from both domains, accessing the labeled source domain data is often restricted, due to concerns over patient data privacy or intellectual property. To sidestep this, we propose "off-the-shelf (OS)" UDA (OSUDA), aimed at image segmentation, by adapting an OS segmentor trained in a source domain to a target domain, in the absence of source domain data in adaptation. Toward this goal, we aim to develop a novel batch-wise normalization (BN) statistics adaptation framework. In particular, we gradually adapt the domain-specific low-order BN statistics, e.g., mean and variance, through an exponential momentum decay strategy, while explicitly enforcing the consistency of the domain shareable high-order BN statistics, e.g., scaling and shifting factors, via our optimization objective. We also adaptively quantify the channel-wise transferability to gauge the importance of each channel, via both low-order statistics divergence and a scaling factor.~Furthermore, we incorporate unsupervised self-entropy minimization into our framework to boost performance alongside a novel queued, memory-consistent self-training strategy to utilize the reliable pseudo label for stable and efficient unsupervised adaptation. We evaluated our OSUDA-based framework on both cross-modality and cross-subtype brain tumor segmentation and cardiac MR to CT segmentation tasks. Our experimental results showed that our memory consistent OSUDA performs better than existing source-relaxed UDA methods and yields similar performance to UDA methods with source data.

- **Summary**: The quality of microscopy images often suffers from optical aberrations. These aberrations and their associated point spread functions have to be quantitatively estimated to restore aberrated images. The recent state-of-the-art method PhaseNet, based on a convolutional neural network, can quantify aberrations accurately but is limited to images of point light sources, e.g. fluorescent beads. In this research, we describe an extension of PhaseNet enabling its use on 3D images of biological samples. To this end, our method incorporates object-specific information into the simulated images used for training the network. Further, we add a Python-based restoration of images via Richardson-Lucy deconvolution. We demonstrate that the deconvolution with the predicted PSF can not only remove the simulated aberrations but also improve the quality of the real raw microscopic images with unknown residual PSF. We provide code for fast and convenient prediction and correction of aberrations.

- **Summary**: This work represents the experimental and development process of system facial expression recognition and facial stress analysis algorithms for an immersive digital learning platform. The system retrieves from users web camera and evaluates it using artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. The ANN output signals can be used to score and improve the learning process. Adapting an ANN to a new system can require a significant implementation effort or the need to repeat the ANN training. There are also limitations related to the minimum hardware required to run an ANN. To overpass these constraints, some possible implementations of facial expression recognition and facial stress analysis algorithms in real-time systems are presented. The implementation of the new solution has made it possible to improve the accuracy in the recognition of facial expressions and also to increase their response speed. Experimental results showed that using the developed algorithms allow to detect the heart rate with better rate in comparison with social equipment.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel end-to-end RGB-D SLAM, iDF-SLAM, which adopts a feature-based deep neural tracker as the front-end and a NeRF-style neural implicit mapper as the back-end. The neural implicit mapper is trained on-the-fly, while though the neural tracker is pretrained on the ScanNet dataset, it is also finetuned along with the training of the neural implicit mapper. Under such a design, our iDF-SLAM is capable of learning to use scene-specific features for camera tracking, thus enabling lifelong learning of the SLAM system. Both the training for the tracker and the mapper are self-supervised without introducing ground truth poses. We test the performance of our iDF-SLAM on the Replica and ScanNet datasets and compare the results to the two recent NeRF-based neural SLAM systems. The proposed iDF-SLAM demonstrates state-of-the-art results in terms of scene reconstruction and competitive performance in camera tracking.

- **Summary**: Detecting dangerous traffic agents in videos captured by vehicle-mounted dashboard cameras (dashcams) is essential to facilitate safe navigation in a complex environment. Accident-related videos are just a minor portion of the driving video big data, and the transient pre-accident processes are highly dynamic and complex. Besides, risky and non-risky traffic agents can be similar in their appearance. These make risky object localization in the driving video particularly challenging. To this end, this paper proposes an attention-guided multistream feature fusion network (AM-Net) to localize dangerous traffic agents from dashcam videos. Two Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks use object bounding box and optical flow features extracted from consecutive video frames to capture spatio-temporal cues for distinguishing dangerous traffic agents. An attention module coupled with the GRUs learns to attend to the traffic agents relevant to an accident. Fusing the two streams of features, AM-Net predicts the riskiness scores of traffic agents in the video. In supporting this study, the paper also introduces a benchmark dataset called Risky Object Localization (ROL). The dataset contains spatial, temporal, and categorical annotations with the accident, object, and scene-level attributes. The proposed AM-Net achieves a promising performance of 85.73% AUC on the ROL dataset. Meanwhile, the AM-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art for video anomaly detection by 6.3% AUC on the DoTA dataset. A thorough ablation study further reveals AM-Net's merits by evaluating the contributions of its different components.

- **Summary**: In video analysis, background models have many applications such as background/foreground separation, change detection, anomaly detection, tracking, and more. However, while learning such a model in a video captured by a static camera is a fairly-solved task, in the case of a Moving-camera Background Model (MCBM), the success has been far more modest due to algorithmic and scalability challenges that arise due to the camera motion. Thus, existing MCBMs are limited in their scope and their supported camera-motion types. These hurdles also impeded the employment, in this unsupervised task, of end-to-end solutions based on deep learning (DL). Moreover, existing MCBMs usually model the background either on the domain of a typically-large panoramic image or in an online fashion. Unfortunately, the former creates several problems, including poor scalability, while the latter prevents the recognition and leveraging of cases where the camera revisits previously-seen parts of the scene. This paper proposes a new method, called DeepMCBM, that eliminates all the aforementioned issues and achieves state-of-the-art results. Concretely, first we identify the difficulties associated with joint alignment of video frames in general and in a DL setting in particular. Next, we propose a new strategy for joint alignment that lets us use a spatial transformer net with neither a regularization nor any form of specialized (and non-differentiable) initialization. Coupled with an autoencoder conditioned on unwarped robust central moments (obtained from the joint alignment), this yields an end-to-end regularization-free MCBM that supports a broad range of camera motions and scales gracefully. We demonstrate DeepMCBM's utility on a variety of videos, including ones beyond the scope of other methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/DeepMCBM .

- **Summary**: Low-light image enhancement is a classical computer vision problem aiming to recover normal-exposure images from low-light images. However, convolutional neural networks commonly used in this field are good at sampling low-frequency local structural features in the spatial domain, which leads to unclear texture details of the reconstructed images. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel module using the Fourier coefficients, which can recover high-quality texture details under the constraint of semantics in the frequency phase and supplement the spatial domain. In addition, we design a simple and efficient module for the image spatial domain using dilated convolutions with different receptive fields to alleviate the loss of detail caused by frequent downsampling. We integrate the above parts into an end-to-end dual branch network and design a novel loss committee and an adaptive fusion module to guide the network to flexibly combine spatial and frequency domain features to generate more pleasing visual effects. Finally, we evaluate the proposed network on public benchmarks. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms many existing state-of-the-art ones, showing outstanding performance and potential.

- **Summary**: The traffic video data has become a critical factor in confining the state of traffic congestion due to the recent advancements in computer vision. This work proposes a unique technique for traffic video classification using a color-coding scheme before training the traffic data in a Deep convolutional neural network. At first, the video data is transformed into an imagery data set; then, the vehicle detection is performed using the You Only Look Once algorithm. A color-coded scheme has been adopted to transform the imagery dataset into a binary image dataset. These binary images are fed to a Deep Convolutional Neural Network. Using the UCSD dataset, we have obtained a classification accuracy of 98.2%.

- **Summary**: Learning a single static convolutional kernel in each convolutional layer is the common training paradigm of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead, recent research in dynamic convolution shows that learning a linear combination of $n$ convolutional kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions can significantly improve the accuracy of light-weight CNNs, while maintaining efficient inference. However, we observe that existing works endow convolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension (regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other three dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the output channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired by this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more generalized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of research. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a parallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels along all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a drop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many CNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets show that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN backbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g., 3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet family on the ImageNet dataset. Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior to other attention modules for modulating the output features or the convolutional weights.

- **Summary**: Place recognition is an important component for autonomous vehicles to achieve loop closing or global localization. In this paper, we tackle the problem of place recognition based on sequential 3D LiDAR scans obtained by an onboard LiDAR sensor. We propose a transformer-based network named SeqOT to exploit the temporal and spatial information provided by sequential range images generated from the LiDAR data. It uses multi-scale transformers to generate a global descriptor for each sequence of LiDAR range images in an end-to-end fashion. During online operation, our SeqOT finds similar places by matching such descriptors between the current query sequence and those stored in the map. We evaluate our approach on four datasets collected with different types of LiDAR sensors in different environments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR-based place recognition methods and generalizes well across different environments. Furthermore, our method operates online faster than the frame rate of the sensor. The implementation of our method is released as open source at: https://github.com/BIT-MJY/SeqOT.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an attack method to block scrambled face images, particularly Encryption-then-Compression (EtC) applied images by utilizing the existing powerful StyleGAN encoder and decoder for the first time. Instead of reconstructing identical images as plain ones from encrypted images, we focus on recovering styles that can reveal identifiable information from the encrypted images. The proposed method trains an encoder by using plain and encrypted image pairs with a particular training strategy. While state-of-the-art attack methods cannot recover any perceptual information from EtC images, the proposed method discloses personally identifiable information such as hair color, skin color, eyeglasses, gender, etc. Experiments were carried out on the CelebA dataset, and results show that reconstructed images have some perceptual similarities compared to plain images.

- **Summary**: Can we train a hybrid discriminative-generative model within a single network? This question has recently been answered in the affirmative, introducing the field of Joint Energy-based Model (JEM), which achieves high classification accuracy and image generation quality simultaneously. Despite recent advances, there remain two performance gaps: the accuracy gap to the standard softmax classifier, and the generation quality gap to state-of-the-art generative models. In this paper, we introduce a variety of training techniques to bridge the accuracy gap and the generation quality gap of JEM. 1) We incorporate a recently proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) framework to train JEM, which promotes the energy landscape smoothness and the generalizability of JEM. 2) We exclude data augmentation from the maximum likelihood estimate pipeline of JEM, and mitigate the negative impact of data augmentation to image generation quality. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our SADA-JEM achieves state-of-the-art performances and outperforms JEM in image classification, image generation, calibration, out-of-distribution detection and adversarial robustness by a notable margin.

- **Summary**: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging from different camera devices causes challenging domain shifts and can cause a severe drop in accuracy for machine learning models. In this work, we introduce a minimal noise adaptation method based on a singular value decomposition (SVDNA) to overcome the domain gap between target domains from three different device manufacturers in retinal OCT imaging. Our method utilizes the difference in noise structure to successfully bridge the domain gap between different OCT devices and transfer the style from unlabeled target domain images to source images for which manual annotations are available. We demonstrate how this method, despite its simplicity, compares or even outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods for semantic segmentation on a public OCT dataset. SVDNA can be integrated with just a few lines of code into the augmentation pipeline of any network which is in contrast to many state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods which often need to change the underlying model architecture or train a separate style transfer model. The full code implementation for SVDNA is available at https://github.com/ValentinKoch/SVDNA.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a dataset for training and evaluating methods for 6D pose estimation of hand-held tools in task demonstrations captured by a standard RGB camera. Despite the significant progress of 6D pose estimation methods, their performance is usually limited for heavily occluded objects, which is a common case in imitation learning, where the object is typically partially occluded by the manipulating hand. Currently, there is a lack of datasets that would enable the development of robust 6D pose estimation methods for these conditions. To overcome this problem, we collect a new dataset (Imitrob) aimed at 6D pose estimation in imitation learning and other applications where a human holds a tool and performs a task. The dataset contains image sequences of nine different tools and twelve manipulation tasks with two camera viewpoints, four human subjects, and left/right hand. Each image is accompanied by an accurate ground truth measurement of the 6D object pose obtained by the HTC Vive motion tracking device. The use of the dataset is demonstrated by training and evaluating a recent 6D object pose estimation method (DOPE) in various setups.

- **Summary**: 3D lane detection is an integral part of autonomous driving systems. Previous CNN and Transformer-based methods usually first generate a bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature map from the front view image, and then use a sub-network with BEV feature map as input to predict 3D lanes. Such approaches require an explicit view transformation between BEV and front view, which itself is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose CurveFormer, a single-stage Transformer-based method that directly calculates 3D lane parameters and can circumvent the difficult view transformation step. Specifically, we formulate 3D lane detection as a curve propagation problem by using curve queries. A 3D lane query is represented by a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. In this way, queries with curve representation in Transformer decoder iteratively refine the 3D lane detection results. Moreover, a curve cross-attention module is introduced to compute the similarities between curve queries and image features. Additionally, a context sampling module that can capture more relative image features of a curve query is provided to further boost the 3D lane detection performance. We evaluate our method for 3D lane detection on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning allows AI systems to learn effective representations from large amounts of data using tasks that do not require costly labeling. Mode collapse, i.e., the model producing identical representations for all inputs, is a central problem to many self-supervised learning approaches, making self-supervised tasks, such as matching distorted variants of the inputs, ineffective. In this article, we argue that a straightforward application of information maximization among alternative latent representations of the same input naturally solves the collapse problem and achieves competitive empirical results. We propose a self-supervised learning method, CorInfoMax, that uses a second-order statistics-based mutual information measure that reflects the level of correlation among its arguments. Maximizing this correlative information measure between alternative representations of the same input serves two purposes: (1) it avoids the collapse problem by generating feature vectors with non-degenerate covariances; (2) it establishes relevance among alternative representations by increasing the linear dependence among them. An approximation of the proposed information maximization objective simplifies to a Euclidean distance-based objective function regularized by the log-determinant of the feature covariance matrix. The regularization term acts as a natural barrier against feature space degeneracy. Consequently, beyond avoiding complete output collapse to a single point, the proposed approach also prevents dimensional collapse by encouraging the spread of information across the whole feature space. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CorInfoMax achieves better or competitive performance results relative to the state-of-the-art SSL approaches.

- **Summary**: Class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation (CiSS) is presently a highly researched field which aims at updating a semantic segmentation model by sequentially learning new semantic classes. A major challenge in CiSS is overcoming the effects of catastrophic forgetting, which describes the sudden drop of accuracy on previously learned classes after the model is trained on a new set of classes. Despite latest advances in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, the underlying causes of forgetting specifically in CiSS are not well understood. Therefore, in a set of experiments and representational analyses, we demonstrate that the semantic shift of the background class and a bias towards new classes are the major causes of forgetting in CiSS. Furthermore, we show that both causes mostly manifest themselves in deeper classification layers of the network, while the early layers of the model are not affected. Finally, we demonstrate how both causes are effectively mitigated utilizing the information contained in the background, with the help of knowledge distillation and an unbiased cross-entropy loss.

- **Summary**: The field of continual deep learning is an emerging field and a lot of progress has been made. However, concurrently most of the approaches are only tested on the task of image classification, which is not relevant in the field of intelligent vehicles. Only recently approaches for class-incremental semantic segmentation were proposed. However, all of those approaches are based on some form of knowledge distillation. At the moment there are no investigations on replay-based approaches that are commonly used for object recognition in a continual setting. At the same time while unsupervised domain adaption for semantic segmentation gained a lot of traction, investigations regarding domain-incremental learning in an continual setting is not well-studied. Therefore, the goal of our work is to evaluate and adapt established solutions for continual object recognition to the task of semantic segmentation and to provide baseline methods and evaluation protocols for the task of continual semantic segmentation. We firstly introduce evaluation protocols for the class- and domain-incremental segmentation and analyze selected approaches. We show that the nature of the task of semantic segmentation changes which methods are most effective in mitigating forgetting compared to image classification. Especially, in class-incremental learning knowledge distillation proves to be a vital tool, whereas in domain-incremental learning replay methods are the most effective method.

- **Summary**: We present a novel collection of news articles originating from fake and real news media sources for the analysis and prediction of news virality. Unlike existing fake news datasets which either contain claims or news article headline and body, in this collection each article is supported with a Facebook engagement count which we consider as an indicator of the article virality. In addition we also provide the article description and thumbnail image with which the article was shared on Facebook. These images were automatically annotated with object tags and color attributes. Using cloud based vision analysis tools, thumbnail images were also analyzed for faces and detected faces were annotated with facial attributes. We empirically investigate the use of this collection on an example task of article virality prediction.

- **Summary**: Although a substantial amount of studies is dedicated to morph detection, most of them fail to generalize for morph faces outside of their training paradigm. Moreover, recent morph detection methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we intend to learn a morph detection model with high generalization to a wide range of morphing attacks and high robustness against different adversarial attacks. To this aim, we develop an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to benefit from their capabilities simultaneously. To improve the robust accuracy of the ensemble model, we employ multi-perturbation adversarial training and generate adversarial examples with high transferability for several single models. Our exhaustive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed robust ensemble model generalizes to several morphing attacks and face datasets. In addition, we validate that our robust ensemble model gain better robustness against several adversarial attacks while outperforming the state-of-the-art studies.

- **Summary**: 3D tooth segmentation is an important task for digital orthodontics. Several Deep Learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth segmentation from 3D dental models or intraoral scans. These methods require annotated 3D intraoral scans. Manually annotating 3D intraoral scans is a laborious task. One approach is to devise self-supervision methods to reduce the manual labeling effort. Compared to other types of point cloud data like scene point cloud or shape point cloud data, 3D tooth point cloud data has a very regular structure and a strong shape prior. We look at how much representative information can be learnt from a single 3D intraoral scan. We evaluate this quantitatively with the help of ten different methods of which six are generic point cloud segmentation methods whereas the other four are tooth segmentation specific methods. Surprisingly, we find that with a single 3D intraoral scan training, the Dice score can be as high as 0.86 whereas the full training set gives Dice score of 0.94. We conclude that the segmentation methods can learn a great deal of information from a single 3D tooth point cloud scan under suitable conditions e.g. data augmentation. We are the first to quantitatively evaluate and demonstrate the representation learning capability of Deep Learning methods from a single 3D intraoral scan. This can enable building self-supervision methods for tooth segmentation under extreme data limitation scenario by leveraging the available data to the fullest possible extent.

- **Summary**: Sharing information between connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) fundamentally improves the performance of collaborative object detection for self-driving. However, CAVs still have uncertainties on object detection due to practical challenges, which will affect the later modules in self-driving such as planning and control. Hence, uncertainty quantification is crucial for safety-critical systems such as CAVs. Our work is the first to estimate the uncertainty of collaborative object detection. We propose a novel uncertainty quantification method, called Double-M Quantification, which tailors a moving block bootstrap (MBB) algorithm with direct modeling of the multivariant Gaussian distribution of each corner of the bounding box. Our method captures both the epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty with one inference pass based on the offline Double-M training process. And it can be used with different collaborative object detectors. Through experiments on the comprehensive collaborative perception dataset, we show that our Double-M method achieves more than 4X improvement on uncertainty score and more than 3% accuracy improvement, compared with the state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods. Our code is public on https://coperception.github.io/double-m-quantification.

- **Summary**: In this work, we focus on improving the captions generated by image-caption generation systems. We propose a novel re-ranking approach that leverages visual-semantic measures to identify the ideal caption that maximally captures the visual information in the image. Our re-ranker utilizes the Belief Revision framework (Blok et al., 2003) to calibrate the original likelihood of the top-n captions by explicitly exploiting the semantic relatedness between the depicted caption and the visual context. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of our approach, where we observe that our re-ranker can enhance the performance of a typical image-captioning system without the necessity of any additional training or fine-tuning.



### Weakly Supervised Medical Image Segmentation With Soft Labels and Noise Robust Loss

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning algorithms have led to significant benefits for solving many medical image analysis problems. Training deep learning models commonly requires large datasets with expert-labeled annotations. However, acquiring expert-labeled annotation is not only expensive but also is subjective, error-prone, and inter-/intra- observer variability introduces noise to labels. This is particularly a problem when using deep learning models for segmenting medical images due to the ambiguous anatomical boundaries. Image-based medical diagnosis tools using deep learning models trained with incorrect segmentation labels can lead to false diagnoses and treatment suggestions. Multi-rater annotations might be better suited to train deep learning models with small training sets compared to single-rater annotations. The aim of this paper was to develop and evaluate a method to generate probabilistic labels based on multi-rater annotations and anatomical knowledge of the lesion features in MRI and a method to train segmentation models using probabilistic labels using normalized active-passive loss as a "noise-tolerant loss" function. The model was evaluated by comparing it to binary ground truth for 17 knees MRI scans for clinical segmentation and detection of bone marrow lesions (BML). The proposed method successfully improved precision 14, recall 22, and Dice score 8 percent compared to a binary cross-entropy loss function. Overall, the results of this work suggest that the proposed normalized active-passive loss using soft labels successfully mitigated the effects of noisy labels.

- **Summary**: We propose a new strategy to improve the accuracy and robustness of image classification. First, we train a baseline CNN model. Then, we identify challenging regions in the feature space by identifying all misclassified samples, and correctly classified samples with low confidence values. These samples are then used to train a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). Next, the VAE is used to generate synthetic images. Finally, the generated synthetic images are used in conjunction with the original labeled images to train a new model in a semi-supervised fashion. Empirical results on benchmark datasets such as STL10 and CIFAR-100 show that the synthetically generated samples can further diversify the training data, leading to improvement in image classification in comparison with the fully supervised baseline approaches using only the available data.

- **Summary**: Oysters play a pivotal role in the bay living ecosystem and are considered the living filters for the ocean. In recent years, oyster reefs have undergone major devastation caused by commercial over-harvesting, requiring preservation to maintain ecological balance. The foundation of this preservation is to estimate the oyster density which requires accurate oyster detection. However, systems for accurate oyster detection require large datasets obtaining which is an expensive and labor-intensive task in underwater environments. To this end, we present a novel method to mathematically model oysters and render images of oysters in simulation to boost the detection performance with minimal real data. Utilizing our synthetic data along with real data for oyster detection, we obtain up to 35.1% boost in performance as compared to using only real data with our OysterNet network. We also improve the state-of-the-art by 12.7%. This shows that using underlying geometrical properties of objects can help to enhance recognition task accuracy on limited datasets successfully and we hope more researchers adopt such a strategy for hard-to-obtain datasets.

- **Summary**: We study the performance of CLAIRE -- a diffeomorphic multi-node, multi-GPU image-registration algorithm, and software -- in large-scale biomedical imaging applications with billions of voxels. At such resolutions, most existing software packages for diffeomorphic image registration are prohibitively expensive. As a result, practitioners first significantly downsample the original images and then register them using existing tools. Our main contribution is an extensive analysis of the impact of downsampling on registration performance. We study this impact by comparing full-resolution registrations obtained with CLAIRE to lower-resolution registrations for synthetic and real-world imaging datasets. Our results suggest that registration at full resolution can yield a superior registration quality -- but not always. For example, downsampling a synthetic image from $1024^3$ to $256^3$ decreases the Dice coefficient from 92% to 79%. However, the differences are less pronounced for noisy or low-contrast high-resolution images. CLAIRE allows us not only to register images of clinically relevant size in a few seconds but also to register images at unprecedented resolution in a reasonable time. The highest resolution considered is CLARITY images of size $2816\times3016\times1162$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on image registration quality at such resolutions.

- **Summary**: Recently, the vision transformer and its variants have played an increasingly important role in both monocular and multi-view human pose estimation. Considering image patches as tokens, transformers can model the global dependencies within the entire image or across images from other views. However, global attention is computationally expensive. As a consequence, it is difficult to scale up these transformer-based methods to high-resolution features and many views.   In this paper, we propose the token-Pruned Pose Transformer (PPT) for 2D human pose estimation, which can locate a rough human mask and performs self-attention only within selected tokens. Furthermore, we extend our PPT to multi-view human pose estimation. Built upon PPT, we propose a new cross-view fusion strategy, called human area fusion, which considers all human foreground pixels as corresponding candidates. Experimental results on COCO and MPII demonstrate that our PPT can match the accuracy of previous pose transformer methods while reducing the computation. Moreover, experiments on Human 3.6M and Ski-Pose demonstrate that our Multi-view PPT can efficiently fuse cues from multiple views and achieve new state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: As LiDAR sensors have become ubiquitous, the need for an efficient LiDAR data compression algorithm has increased. Modern LiDARs produce gigabytes of scan data per hour and are often used in applications with limited compute, bandwidth, and storage resources.   We present a fast, lossless compression algorithm for LiDAR range and attribute scan sequences including multiple-return range, signal, reflectivity, and ambient infrared. Our algorithm -- dubbed "Jiffy" -- achieves substantial compression by exploiting spatiotemporal redundancy and sparsity. Speed is accomplished by maximizing use of single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) instructions. In autonomous driving, infrastructure monitoring, drone inspection, and handheld mapping benchmarks, the Jiffy algorithm consistently outcompresses competing lossless codecs while operating at speeds in excess of 65M points/sec on a single core. In a typical autonomous vehicle use case, single-threaded Jiffy achieves 6x compression of centimeter-precision range scans at 500+ scans per second. To ensure reproducibility and enable adoption, the software is freely available as an open source library.

- **Summary**: The growing public concerns on data privacy in face recognition can be greatly addressed by the federated learning (FL) paradigm. However, conventional FL methods perform poorly due to the uniqueness of the task: broadcasting class centers among clients is crucial for recognition performances but leads to privacy leakage. To resolve the privacy-utility paradox, this work proposes PrivacyFace, a framework largely improves the federated learning face recognition via communicating auxiliary and privacy-agnostic information among clients. PrivacyFace mainly consists of two components: First, a practical Differentially Private Local Clustering (DPLC) mechanism is proposed to distill sanitized clusters from local class centers. Second, a consensus-aware recognition loss subsequently encourages global consensuses among clients, which ergo results in more discriminative features. The proposed framework is mathematically proved to be differentially private, introducing a lightweight overhead as well as yielding prominent performance boosts (\textit{e.g.}, +9.63\% and +10.26\% for TAR@FAR=1e-4 on IJB-B and IJB-C respectively). Extensive experiments and ablation studies on a large-scale dataset have demonstrated the efficacy and practicability of our method.

- **Summary**: Attentive Neural Process (ANP) improves the fitting ability of Neural Process (NP) and improves its prediction accuracy, but the higher time complexity of the model imposes a limitation on the length of the input sequence. Inspired by models such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE), we propose Patch Attentive Neural Process (PANP) using image patches as input and improve the structure of deterministic paths based on ANP, which allows the model to extract image features more accurately and efficiently reconstruction.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel solution for constructing line features modeling each catenary curve present within a series of points representing multiple catenary curves. The solution can be applied to extract power lines from lidar point clouds, which can then be used in downstream applications like creating digital twin geospatial models and evaluating the encroachment of vegetation. This paper offers an example of how the results obtained by the proposed solution could be used to assess vegetation growth near transmission power lines based on freely available lidar data for the City of Utrecht, Netherlands [1].

- **Summary**: In this paper, a novel approach via embedded tensor manifold regularization for 2D+3D facial expression recognition (FERETMR) is proposed. Firstly, 3D tensors are constructed from 2D face images and 3D face shape models to keep the structural information and correlations. To maintain the local structure (geometric information) of 3D tensor samples in the low-dimensional tensors space during the dimensionality reduction, the $\ell_0$-norm of the core tensors and a tensor manifold regularization scheme embedded on core tensors are adopted via a low-rank truncated Tucker decomposition on the generated tensors. As a result, the obtained factor matrices will be used for facial expression classification prediction. To make the resulting tensor optimization more tractable, $\ell_1$-norm surrogate is employed to relax $\ell_0$-norm and hence the resulting tensor optimization problem has a nonsmooth objective function due to the $\ell_1$-norm and orthogonal constraints from the orthogonal Tucker decomposition. To efficiently tackle this tensor optimization problem, we establish the first-order optimality condition in terms of stationary points, and then design a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm with convergence analysis and the computational complexity. Numerical results on BU-3DFE database and Bosphorus databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Field of view (FoV) prediction is critical in 360-degree video multicast, which is a key component of the emerging Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Most of the current prediction methods combining saliency detection and FoV information neither take into account that the distortion of projected 360-degree videos can invalidate the weight sharing of traditional convolutional networks, nor do they adequately consider the difficulty of obtaining complete multi-user FoV information, which degrades the prediction performance. This paper proposes a spherical convolution-empowered FoV prediction method, which is a multi-source prediction framework combining salient features extracted from 360-degree video with limited FoV feedback information. A spherical convolution neural network (CNN) is used instead of a traditional two-dimensional CNN to eliminate the problem of weight sharing failure caused by video projection distortion. Specifically, salient spatial-temporal features are extracted through a spherical convolution-based saliency detection model, after which the limited feedback FoV information is represented as a time-series model based on a spherical convolution-empowered gated recurrent unit network. Finally, the extracted salient video features are combined to predict future user FoVs. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is better than other prediction methods.

- **Summary**: Efficient and effective attacks are crucial for reliable evaluation of defenses, and also for developing robust models. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack has been demonstrated to be one of the most successful adversarial attacks. However, the effect of the standard PGD attack can be easily weakened by rescaling the logits, while the original decision of every input will not be changed. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose Scale-Invariant Adversarial Attack (SI-PGD), which utilizes the angle between the features in the penultimate layer and the weights in the softmax layer to guide the generation of adversaries. The cosine angle matrix is used to learn angularly discriminative representation and will not be changed with the rescaling of logits, thus making SI-PGD attack to be stable and effective. We evaluate our attack against multiple defenses and show improved performance when compared with existing attacks. Further, we propose Scale-Invariant (SI) adversarial defense mechanism based on the cosine angle matrix, which can be embedded into the popular adversarial defenses. The experimental results show the defense method with our SI mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance among multi-step and single-step defenses.

- **Summary**: White matter parcellation classifies tractography streamlines into clusters or anatomically meaningful tracts to enable quantification and visualization. Most parcellation methods focus on the deep white matter (DWM), while fewer methods address the superficial white matter (SWM) due to its complexity. We propose a deep-learning-based framework, Superficial White Matter Analysis (SupWMA), that performs an efficient and consistent parcellation of 198 SWM clusters from whole-brain tractography. A point-cloud-based network is modified for our SWM parcellation task, and supervised contrastive learning enables more discriminative representations between plausible streamlines and outliers. We perform evaluation on a large tractography dataset with ground truth labels and on three independently acquired testing datasets from individuals across ages and health conditions. Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, SupWMA obtains a highly consistent and accurate SWM parcellation result. In addition, the computational speed of SupWMA is much faster than other methods.

- **Summary**: Hand-held light field (LF) cameras have unique advantages in computer vision such as 3D scene reconstruction and depth estimation. However, the related applications are limited by the ultra-small baseline, e.g., leading to the extremely low depth resolution in reconstruction. To solve this problem, we propose to rectify LF to obtain a large baseline. Specifically, the proposed method aligns two LFs captured by two hand-held LF cameras with a random relative pose, and extracts the corresponding row-aligned sub-aperture images (SAIs) to obtain an LF with a large baseline. For an accurate rectification, a method for pose estimation is also proposed, where the relative rotation and translation between the two LF cameras are estimated. The proposed pose estimation minimizes the degree of freedom (DoF) in the LF-point-LF-point correspondence model and explicitly solves this model in a linear way. The proposed pose estimation outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by providing more accurate results to support rectification. The significantly improved depth resolution in 3D reconstruction demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed LF rectification.

- **Summary**: Airway segmentation is critical for virtual bronchoscopy and computer-aided pulmonary disease analysis. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to delineate the bronchial tree. However, the segmentation results of the CNN-based methods usually include many discontinuous branches, which need manual repair in clinical use. A major reason for the breakages is that the appearance of the airway wall can be affected by the lung disease as well as the adjacency of the vessels, while the network tends to overfit to these special patterns in the training set. To learn robust features for these areas, we design a multi-branch framework that adopts the geodesic distance transform to capture the intensity changes between airway lumen and wall. Another reason for the breakages is the intra-class imbalance. Since the volume of the peripheral bronchi may be much smaller than the large branches in an input patch, the common segmentation loss is not sensitive to the breakages among the distal branches. Therefore, in this paper, a breakage-sensitive regularization term is designed and can be easily combined with other loss functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly available datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our framework can detect more branches while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Computing the matrix square root and its inverse in a differentiable manner is important in a variety of computer vision tasks. Previous methods either adopt the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to explicitly factorize the matrix or use the Newton-Schulz iteration (NS iteration) to derive the approximate solution. However, both methods are not computationally efficient enough in either the forward pass or the backward pass. In this paper, we propose two more efficient variants to compute the differentiable matrix square root and the inverse square root. For the forward propagation, one method is to use Matrix Taylor Polynomial (MTP), and the other method is to use Matrix Pad\'e Approximants (MPA). The backward gradient is computed by iteratively solving the continuous-time Lyapunov equation using the matrix sign function. A series of numerical tests show that both methods yield considerable speed-up compared with the SVD or the NS iteration. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of our methods in several real-world applications, including de-correlated batch normalization, second-order vision transformer, global covariance pooling for large-scale and fine-grained recognition, attentive covariance pooling for video recognition, and neural style transfer. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods can also achieve competitive and even slightly better performances.

- **Summary**: Differing from the well-developed horizontal object detection area whereby the computing-friendly IoU based loss is readily adopted and well fits with the detection metrics. In contrast, rotation detectors often involve a more complicated loss based on SkewIoU which is unfriendly to gradient-based training. In this paper, we propose an effective approximate SkewIoU loss based on Gaussian modeling and Gaussian product, which mainly consists of two items. The first term is a scale-insensitive center point loss, which is used to quickly narrow the distance between the center points of the two bounding boxes. In the distance-independent second term, the product of the Gaussian distributions is adopted to inherently mimic the mechanism of SkewIoU by its definition, and show its alignment with the SkewIoU loss at trend-level within a certain distance (i.e. within 9 pixels). This is in contrast to recent Gaussian modeling based rotation detectors e.g. GWD loss and KLD loss that involve a human-specified distribution distance metric which require additional hyperparameter tuning that vary across datasets and detectors. The resulting new loss called KFIoU loss is easier to implement and works better compared with exact SkewIoU loss, thanks to its full differentiability and ability to handle the non-overlapping cases. We further extend our technique to the 3-D case which also suffers from the same issues as 2-D. Extensive results on various public datasets (2-D/3-D, aerial/text/face images) with different base detectors show the effectiveness of our approach.



### Rebalancing Batch Normalization for Exemplar-based Class-Incremental Learning

- **Summary**: Batch Normalization (BN) and its variants has been extensively studied for neural nets in various computer vision tasks, but relatively little work has been dedicated to studying the effect of BN in continual learning. To that end, we develop a new update patch for BN, particularly tailored for the exemplar-based class-incremental learning (CIL). The main issue of BN in CIL is the imbalance of training data between current and past tasks in a mini-batch, which makes the empirical mean and variance as well as the learnable affine transformation parameters of BN heavily biased toward the current task -- contributing to the forgetting of past tasks. While one of the recent BN variants has been developed for "online" CIL, in which the training is done with a single epoch, we show that their method does not necessarily bring gains for "offline" CIL, in which a model is trained with multiple epochs on the imbalanced training data. The main reason for the ineffectiveness of their method lies in not fully addressing the data imbalance issue, especially in computing the gradients for learning the affine transformation parameters of BN. Accordingly, our new hyperparameter-free variant, dubbed as Task-Balanced BN (TBBN), is proposed to more correctly resolve the imbalance issue by making a horizontally-concatenated task-balanced batch using both reshape and repeat operations during training. Based on our experiments on class incremental learning of CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and five dissimilar task datasets, we demonstrate that our TBBN, which works exactly the same as the vanilla BN in the inference time, is easily applicable to most existing exemplar-based offline CIL algorithms and consistently outperforms other BN variants.

- **Summary**: Conventional social media platforms usually downscale the HR images to restrict their resolution to a specific size for saving transmission/storage cost, which leads to the super-resolution (SR) being highly ill-posed. Recent invertible image downscaling methods jointly model the downscaling/upscaling problems and achieve significant improvements. However, they only consider fixed integer scale factors that cannot downscale HR images with various resolutions to meet the resolution restriction of social media platforms. In this paper, we propose a scale-Arbitrary Invertible image Downscaling Network (AIDN), to natively downscale HR images with arbitrary scale factors. Meanwhile, the HR information is embedded in the downscaled low-resolution (LR) counterparts in a nearly imperceptible form such that our AIDN can also restore the original HR images solely from the LR images. The key to supporting arbitrary scale factors is our proposed Conditional Resampling Module (CRM) that conditions the downscaling/upscaling kernels and sampling locations on both scale factors and image content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our AIDN achieves top performance for invertible downscaling with both arbitrary integer and non-integer scale factors. Code will be released upon publication.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel matrix-encoding method that is particularly convenient for neural networks to make predictions in a privacy-preserving manner using homomorphic encryption. Based on this encoding method, we implement a convolutional neural network for handwritten image classification over encryption. For two matrices $A$ and $B$ to perform homomorphic multiplication, the main idea behind it, in a simple version, is to encrypt matrix $A$ and the transpose of matrix $B$ into two ciphertexts respectively. With additional operations, the homomorphic matrix multiplication can be calculated over encrypted matrices efficiently. For the convolution operation, we in advance span each convolution kernel to a matrix space of the same size as the input image so as to generate several ciphertexts, each of which is later used together with the ciphertext encrypting input images for calculating some of the final convolution results. We accumulate all these intermediate results and thus complete the convolution operation.   In a public cloud with 40 vCPUs, our convolutional neural network implementation on the MNIST testing dataset takes $\sim$ 287 seconds to compute ten likelihoods of 32 encrypted images of size $28 \times 28$ simultaneously. The data owner only needs to upload one ciphertext ($\sim 19.8$ MB) encrypting these 32 images to the public cloud.

- **Summary**: The existence of completely aligned and paired multi-modal neuroimaging data has proved its effectiveness in the diagnosis of brain diseases. However, collecting the full set of well-aligned and paired data is impractical, since the practical difficulties may include high cost, long time acquisition, image corruption, and privacy issues. Previously, the misaligned unpaired neuroimaging data (termed as MUD) are generally treated as noisy label. However, such a noisy label-based method fail to accomplish well when misaligned data occurs distortions severely. For example, the angle of rotation is different. In this paper, we propose a novel federated self-supervised learning (FedMed) for brain image synthesis. An affine transform loss (ATL) was formulated to make use of severely distorted images without violating privacy legislation for the hospital. We then introduce a new data augmentation procedure for self-supervised training and fed it into three auxiliary heads, namely auxiliary rotation, auxiliary translation and auxiliary scaling heads. The proposed method demonstrates the advanced performance in both the quality of our synthesized results under a severely misaligned and unpaired data setting, and better stability than other GAN-based algorithms. The proposed method also reduces the demand for deformable registration while encouraging to leverage the misaligned and unpaired data. Experimental results verify the outstanding performance of our learning paradigm compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: It is known that the decomposition in low-rank and sparse matrices (\textbf{L+S} for short) can be achieved by several Robust PCA techniques. Besides the low rankness, the local smoothness (\textbf{LSS}) is a vitally essential prior for many real-world matrix data such as hyperspectral images and surveillance videos, which makes such matrices have low-rankness and local smoothness properties at the same time. This poses an interesting question: Can we make a matrix decomposition in terms of \textbf{L\&LSS +S } form exactly? To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new RPCA model based on three-dimensional correlated total variation regularization (3DCTV-RPCA for short) by fully exploiting and encoding the prior expression underlying such joint low-rank and local smoothness matrices. Specifically, using a modification of Golfing scheme, we prove that under some mild assumptions, the proposed 3DCTV-RPCA model can decompose both components exactly, which should be the first theoretical guarantee among all such related methods combining low rankness and local smoothness. In addition, by utilizing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we propose an efficient ADMM algorithm with a solid convergence guarantee for solving the resulting optimization problem. Finally, a series of experiments on both simulations and real applications are carried out to demonstrate the general validity of the proposed 3DCTV-RPCA model.

- **Summary**: Previous vision-language pre-training models mainly construct multi-modal inputs with tokens and objects (pixels) followed by performing cross-modality interaction between them. We argue that the input of only tokens and object features limits high-level semantic alignment like phrase-to-region grounding. Meanwhile, multi-level alignments are inherently consistent and able to facilitate the representation learning synergistically. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to learn Multi-level semantic alignment for Vision-language Pre-TRaining (MVPTR). In MVPTR, we follow the nested structure of both modalities to introduce concepts as high-level semantics. To ease the learning from multi-modal multi-level inputs, our framework is split into two stages, the first stage focuses on intra-modality multi-level representation learning, the second enforces interactions across modalities via both coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic alignment tasks. In addition to the commonly used image-text matching and masked language model tasks, we introduce a masked concept recovering task in the first stage to enhance the concept representation learning, and two more tasks in the second stage to explicitly encourage multi-level alignments across modalities.

- **Summary**: Conventional image compression methods typically aim at pixel-level consistency while ignoring the performance of downstream AI tasks.To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Semantic-Assisted Image Compression method (SAIC), which can maintain semantic-level consistency to enable high performance of downstream AI tasks.To this end, we train the compression network using semantic-level loss function. In particular, semantic-level loss is measured using gradient-based semantic weights mechanism (GSW). GSW directly consider downstream AI tasks' perceptual results. Then, this paper proposes a semantic-level distortion evaluation metric to quantify the amount of semantic information retained during the compression process. Experimental results show that the proposed SAIC method can retain more semantic-level information and achieve better performance of downstream AI tasks compared to the traditional deep learning-based method and the advanced perceptual method at the same compression ratio.

- **Summary**: Humans excel at continually learning from an ever-changing environment whereas it remains a challenge for deep neural networks which exhibit catastrophic forgetting. The complementary learning system (CLS) theory suggests that the interplay between rapid instance-based learning and slow structured learning in the brain is crucial for accumulating and retaining knowledge. Here, we propose CLS-ER, a novel dual memory experience replay (ER) method which maintains short-term and long-term semantic memories that interact with the episodic memory. Our method employs an effective replay mechanism whereby new knowledge is acquired while aligning the decision boundaries with the semantic memories. CLS-ER does not utilize the task boundaries or make any assumption about the distribution of the data which makes it versatile and suited for "general continual learning". Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks as well as more realistic general continual learning settings.

- **Summary**: We propose a new technique for recognition of dumb person hand gesture in real world environment. In this technique, the hand image containing the gesture is preprocessed and then hand region is segmented by convergent the RGB color image to L.a.b color space. Only few statistical features are used to classify the segmented image to different classes. Artificial Neural Network is trained in sequential manner using one against all. When the system gets trained, it becomes capable of recognition of each class in parallel manner. The result of proposed technique is much better than existing techniques.

- **Summary**: Chromatic dispersion is a common problem to degrade the system resolution in optical coherence tomography (OCT). This study is to develop a deep learning network for automated dispersion compensation (ADC-Net) in OCT. The ADC-Net is based on a redesigned UNet architecture which employs an encoder-decoder pipeline. The input section encompasses partially compensated OCT B-scans with individual retinal layers optimized. Corresponding output is a fully compensated OCT B-scans with all retinal layers optimized. Two numeric parameters, i.e., peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index metric computed at multiple scales (MS-SSIM), were used for objective assessment of the ADC-Net performance. Comparative analysis of training models, including single, three, five, seven and nine input channels were implemented. The five-input channels implementation was observed as the optimal mode for ADC-Net training to achieve robust dispersion compensation in OCT

- **Summary**: Pedestrian crossing prediction has been a topic of active research, resulting in many new algorithmic solutions. While measuring the overall progress of those solutions over time tends to be more and more established due to the new publicly available benchmark and standardized evaluation procedures, knowing how well existing predictors react to unseen data remains an unanswered question. This evaluation is imperative as serviceable crossing behavior predictors should be set to work in various scenarii without compromising pedestrian safety due to misprediction. To this end, we conduct a study based on direct cross-dataset evaluation. Our experiments show that current state-of-the-art pedestrian behavior predictors generalize poorly in cross-dataset evaluation scenarii, regardless of their robustness during a direct training-test set evaluation setting. In the light of what we observe, we argue that the future of pedestrian crossing prediction, e.g. reliable and generalizable implementations, should not be about tailoring models, trained with very little available data, and tested in a classical train-test scenario with the will to infer anything about their behavior in real life. It should be about evaluating models in a cross-dataset setting while considering their uncertainty estimates under domain shift.

- **Summary**: Prior studies using graph neural networks (GNNs) for image classification have focused on graphs generated from a regular grid of pixels or similar-sized superpixels. In the latter, a single target number of superpixels is defined for an entire dataset irrespective of differences across images and their intrinsic multiscale structure. On the contrary, this study investigates image classification using graphs generated from an image-specific number of multiscale superpixels. We propose WaveMesh, a new wavelet-based superpixeling algorithm, where the number and sizes of superpixels in an image are systematically computed based on its content. WaveMesh superpixel graphs are structurally different from similar-sized superpixel graphs. We use SplineCNN, a state-of-the-art network for image graph classification, to compare WaveMesh and similar-sized superpixels. Using SplineCNN, we perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets under three local-pooling settings: 1) no pooling, 2) GraclusPool, and 3) WavePool, a novel spatially heterogeneous pooling scheme tailored to WaveMesh superpixels. Our experiments demonstrate that SplineCNN learns from multiscale WaveMesh superpixels on-par with similar-sized superpixels. In all WaveMesh experiments, GraclusPool performs poorer than no pooling / WavePool, indicating that poor choice of pooling can result in inferior performance while learning from multiscale superpixels.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a Neural Architecture Search strategy based on self supervision and semi-supervised learning for the task of semantic segmentation. Our approach builds an optimized neural network (NN) model for this task by jointly solving a jigsaw pretext task discovered with self-supervised learning over unlabeled training data, and, exploiting the structure of the unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning. The search of the architecture of the NN model is performed by dynamic routing using a gradient descent algorithm. Experiments on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate that the discovered neural network is more efficient than a state-of-the-art hand-crafted NN model with four times less floating operations.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a machine learning based approach is introduced to estimate pendubot angular position from its captured images. Initially, a baseline algorithm is introduced to estimate the angle using conventional image processing techniques. The baseline algorithm performs well for the cases that the pendubot is not moving fast. However, when moving quickly due to a free fall, the pendubot appears as a blurred object in the captured image in a way that the baseline algorithm fails to estimate the angle. Consequently, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based algorithm is introduced to cope with this challenge. The approach relies on the concept of transfer learning to allow the training of the DNN on a very small fine-tuning dataset. The base algorithm is used to create the ground truth labels of the fine-tuning dataset. Experimental results on the held-out evaluation set show that the proposed approach achieves a median absolute error of 0.02 and 0.06 degrees for the sharp and blurry images respectively.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel method for training deep neural networks that are capable of interpolation, that is, driving the empirical loss to zero. At each iteration, our method constructs a stochastic approximation of the learning objective. The approximation, known as a bundle, is a pointwise maximum of linear functions. Our bundle contains a constant function that lower bounds the empirical loss. This enables us to compute an automatic adaptive learning rate, thereby providing an accurate solution. In addition, our bundle includes linear approximations computed at the current iterate and other linear estimates of the DNN parameters. The use of these additional approximations makes our method significantly more robust to its hyperparameters. Based on its desirable empirical properties, we term our method Bundle Optimisation for Robust and Accurate Training (BORAT). In order to operationalise BORAT, we design a novel algorithm for optimising the bundle approximation efficiently at each iteration. We establish the theoretical convergence of BORAT in both convex and non-convex settings. Using standard publicly available data sets, we provide a thorough comparison of BORAT to other single hyperparameter optimisation algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate BORAT matches the state-of-the-art generalisation performance for these methods and is the most robust.

- **Summary**: We show that Contrastive Learning (CL) under a broad family of loss functions (including InfoNCE) has a unified formulation of coordinate-wise optimization on the network parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ and pairwise importance $\alpha$, where the \emph{max player} $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ learns representation for contrastiveness, and the \emph{min player} $\alpha$ puts more weights on pairs of distinct samples that share similar representations. The resulting formulation, called $\alpha$-CL, unifies not only various existing contrastive losses, which differ by how sample-pair importance $\alpha$ is constructed, but also is able to extrapolate to give novel contrastive losses beyond popular ones, opening a new avenue of contrastive loss design. These novel losses yield comparable (or better) performance on CIFAR10, STL-10 and CIFAR-100 than classic InfoNCE. Furthermore, we also analyze the max player in detail: we prove that with fixed $\alpha$, max player is equivalent to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for deep linear network, and almost all local minima are global and rank-1, recovering optimal PCA solutions. Finally, we extend our analysis on max player to 2-layer ReLU networks, showing that its fixed points can have higher ranks.

- **Summary**: The practical success of overparameterized neural networks has motivated the recent scientific study of interpolating methods, which perfectly fit their training data. Certain interpolating methods, including neural networks, can fit noisy training data without catastrophically bad test performance, in defiance of standard intuitions from statistical learning theory. Aiming to explain this, a body of recent work has studied benign overfitting, a phenomenon where some interpolating methods approach Bayes optimality, even in the presence of noise. In this work we argue that while benign overfitting has been instructive and fruitful to study, many real interpolating methods like neural networks do not fit benignly: modest noise in the training set causes nonzero (but non-infinite) excess risk at test time, implying these models are neither benign nor catastrophic but rather fall in an intermediate regime. We call this intermediate regime tempered overfitting, and we initiate its systematic study. We first explore this phenomenon in the context of kernel (ridge) regression (KR) by obtaining conditions on the ridge parameter and kernel eigenspectrum under which KR exhibits each of the three behaviors. We find that kernels with powerlaw spectra, including Laplace kernels and ReLU neural tangent kernels, exhibit tempered overfitting. We then empirically study deep neural networks through the lens of our taxonomy, and find that those trained to interpolation are tempered, while those stopped early are benign. We hope our work leads to a more refined understanding of overfitting in modern learning.

- **Summary**: Pathological diagnosis relies on the visual inspection of histologically stained thin tissue specimens, where different types of stains are applied to bring contrast to and highlight various desired histological features. However, the destructive histochemical staining procedures are usually irreversible, making it very difficult to obtain multiple stains on the same tissue section. Here, we demonstrate a virtual stain transfer framework via a cascaded deep neural network (C-DNN) to digitally transform hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue images into other types of histological stains. Unlike a single neural network structure which only takes one stain type as input to digitally output images of another stain type, C-DNN first uses virtual staining to transform autofluorescence microscopy images into H&E and then performs stain transfer from H&E to the domain of the other stain in a cascaded manner. This cascaded structure in the training phase allows the model to directly exploit histochemically stained image data on both H&E and the target special stain of interest. This advantage alleviates the challenge of paired data acquisition and improves the image quality and color accuracy of the virtual stain transfer from H&E to another stain. We validated the superior performance of this C-DNN approach using kidney needle core biopsy tissue sections and successfully transferred the H&E-stained tissue images into virtual PAS (periodic acid-Schiff) stain. This method provides high-quality virtual images of special stains using existing, histochemically stained slides and creates new opportunities in digital pathology by performing highly accurate stain-to-stain transformations.

- **Summary**: Existing temporal action detection (TAD) methods rely on generating an overwhelmingly large number of proposals per video. This leads to complex model designs due to proposal generation and/or per-proposal action instance evaluation and the resultant high computational cost. In this work, for the first time, we propose a proposal-free Temporal Action detection model with Global Segmentation mask (TAGS). Our core idea is to learn a global segmentation mask of each action instance jointly at the full video length. The TAGS model differs significantly from the conventional proposal-based methods by focusing on global temporal representation learning to directly detect local start and end points of action instances without proposals. Further, by modeling TAD holistically rather than locally at the individual proposal level, TAGS needs a much simpler model architecture with lower computational cost. Extensive experiments show that despite its simpler design, TAGS outperforms existing TAD methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks. Importantly, it is ~ 20x faster to train and ~1.6x more efficient for inference. Our PyTorch implementation of TAGS is available at https://github.com/sauradip/TAGS .

- **Summary**: Current object detectors typically have a feature pyramid (FP) module for multi-level feature fusion (MFF) which aims to mitigate the gap between features from different levels and form a comprehensive object representation to achieve better detection performance. However, they usually require heavy cross-level connections or iterative refinement to obtain better MFF result, making them complicated in structure and inefficient in computation. To address these issues, we propose a novel and efficient context modeling mechanism that can help existing FPs deliver better MFF results while reducing the computational costs effectively. In particular, we introduce a novel insight that comprehensive contexts can be decomposed and condensed into two types of representations for higher efficiency. The two representations include a locally concentrated representation and a globally summarized representation, where the former focuses on extracting context cues from nearby areas while the latter extracts key representations of the whole image scene as global context cues. By collecting the condensed contexts, we employ a Transformer decoder to investigate the relations between them and each local feature from the FP and then refine the MFF results accordingly. As a result, we obtain a simple and light-weight Transformer-based Context Condensation (TCC) module, which can boost various FPs and lower their computational costs simultaneously. Extensive experimental results on the challenging MS COCO dataset show that TCC is compatible to four representative FPs and consistently improves their detection accuracy by up to 7.8 % in terms of average precision and reduce their complexities by up to around 20% in terms of GFLOPs, helping them achieve state-of-the-art performance more efficiently. Code will be released.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have greatly promoted the performance of single image super-resolution (SISR). Conventional methods still resort to restoring the single high-resolution (HR) solution only based on the input of image modality. However, the image-level information is insufficient to predict adequate details and photo-realistic visual quality facing large upscaling factors (x8, x16). In this paper, we propose a new perspective that regards the SISR as a semantic image detail enhancement problem to generate semantically reasonable HR image that are faithful to the ground truth. To enhance the semantic accuracy and the visual quality of the reconstructed image, we explore the multi-modal fusion learning in SISR by proposing a Text-Guided Super-Resolution (TGSR) framework, which can effectively utilize the information from the text and image modalities. Different from existing methods, the proposed TGSR could generate HR image details that match the text descriptions through a coarse-to-fine process. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effect of the TGSR, which exploits the text reference to recover realistic images.

- **Summary**: While the abuse of deepfake technology has caused serious concerns recently, how to detect deepfake videos is still a challenge due to the high photo-realistic synthesis of each frame. Existing image-level approaches often focus on single frame and ignore the spatiotemporal cues hidden in deepfake videos, resulting in poor generalization and robustness. The key of a video-level detector is to fully exploit the spatiotemporal inconsistency distributed in local facial regions across different frames in deepfake videos. Inspired by that, this paper proposes a simple yet effective patch-level approach to facilitate deepfake video detection via spatiotemporal dropout transformer. The approach reorganizes each input video into bag of patches that is then fed into a vision transformer to achieve robust representation. Specifically, a spatiotemporal dropout operation is proposed to fully explore patch-level spatiotemporal cues and serve as effective data augmentation to further enhance model's robustness and generalization ability. The operation is flexible and can be easily plugged into existing vision transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against 25 state-of-the-arts with impressive robustness, generalizability, and representation ability.

- **Summary**: Deploying Machine learning (ML) on milliwatt-scale edge devices (tinyML) is gaining popularity due to recent breakthroughs in ML and Internet of Things (IoT). Most tinyML research focuses on model compression techniques that trade accuracy (and model capacity) for compact models to fit into the KB-sized tiny-edge devices. In this paper, we show how such models can be enhanced by the addition of an early exit intermediate classifier. If the intermediate classifier exhibits sufficient confidence in its prediction, the network exits early thereby, resulting in considerable savings in time. Although early exit classifiers have been proposed in previous work, these previous proposals focus on large networks, making their techniques suboptimal/impractical for tinyML applications. Our technique is optimized specifically for tiny-CNN sized models. In addition, we present a method to alleviate the effect of network overthinking by leveraging the representations learned by the early exit. We evaluate T-RecX on three CNNs from the MLPerf tiny benchmark suite for image classification, keyword spotting and visual wake word detection tasks. Our results show that T-RecX 1) improves the accuracy of baseline network, 2) achieves 31.58% average reduction in FLOPS in exchange for one percent accuracy across all evaluated models. Furthermore, we show that our methods consistently outperform popular prior works on the tiny-CNNs we evaluate.

- **Summary**: Recent studies of deep learning based stereo image super-resolution (StereoSR) have promoted the development of StereoSR. However, existing StereoSR models mainly concentrate on improving quantitative evaluation metrics and neglect the visual quality of super-resolved stereo images. To improve the perceptual performance, this paper proposes the first perception-oriented stereo image super-resolution approach by exploiting the feedback, provided by the evaluation on the perceptual quality of StereoSR results. To provide accurate guidance for the StereoSR model, we develop the first special stereo image super-resolution quality assessment (StereoSRQA) model, and further construct a StereoSRQA database. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our StereoSR approach significantly improves the perceptual quality and enhances the reliability of stereo images for disparity estimation.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel framework for continuous facial motion deblurring that restores the continuous sharp moment latent in a single motion-blurred face image via a moment control factor. Although a motion-blurred image is the accumulated signal of continuous sharp moments during the exposure time, most existing single image deblurring approaches aim to restore a fixed number of frames using multiple networks and training stages. To address this problem, we propose a continuous facial motion deblurring network based on GAN (CFMD-GAN), which is a novel framework for restoring the continuous moment latent in a single motion-blurred face image with a single network and a single training stage. To stabilize the network training, we train the generator to restore continuous moments in the order determined by our facial motion-based reordering process (FMR) utilizing domain-specific knowledge of the face. Moreover, we propose an auxiliary regressor that helps our generator produce more accurate images by estimating continuous sharp moments. Furthermore, we introduce a control-adaptive (ContAda) block that performs spatially deformable convolution and channel-wise attention as a function of the control factor. Extensive experiments on the 300VW datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework generates a various number of continuous output frames by varying the moment control factor. Compared with the recent single-to-single image deblurring networks trained with the same 300VW training set, the proposed method show the superior performance in restoring the central sharp frame in terms of perceptual metrics, including LPIPS, FID and Arcface identity distance. The proposed method outperforms the existing single-to-video deblurring method for both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.

- **Summary**: Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) have achieved the SOTA FID results in unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I). However, we notice that existing methods totally ignore the training data in the source domain, leading to sub-optimal solutions for unpaired I2I. To this end, we propose energy-guided stochastic differential equations (EGSDE) that employs an energy function pretrained on both the source and target domains to guide the inference process of a pretrained SDE for realistic and faithful unpaired I2I. Building upon two feature extractors, we carefully design the energy function such that it encourages the transferred image to preserve the domain-independent features and discard domain-specific ones. Further, we provide an alternative explanation of the EGSDE as a product of experts, where each of the three experts (corresponding to the SDE and two feature extractors) solely contributes to faithfulness or realism. Empirically, we compare EGSDE to a large family of baselines on three widely-adopted unpaired I2I tasks under four metrics. EGSDE not only consistently outperforms existing SBDMs-based methods in almost all settings but also achieves the SOTA realism results without harming the faithful performance. Furthermore, EGSDE allows for flexible trade-offs between realism and faithfulness and we improve the realism results further (e.g., FID of 51.04 in Cat to Dog and FID of 50.43 in Wild to Dog on AFHQ) by tuning hyper-parameters.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based source dehazing methods trained on synthetic datasets have achieved remarkable performance but suffer from dramatic performance degradation on real hazy images due to domain shift. Although certain Domain Adaptation (DA) dehazing methods have been presented, they inevitably require access to the source dataset to reduce the gap between the source synthetic and target real domains. To address these issues, we present a novel Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) image dehazing paradigm, in which only a well-trained source model and an unlabeled target real hazy dataset are available. Specifically, we devise the Domain Representation Normalization (DRN) module to make the representation of real hazy domain features match that of the synthetic domain to bridge the gaps. With our plug-and-play DRN module, unlabeled real hazy images can adapt existing well-trained source networks. Besides, the unsupervised losses are applied to guide the learning of the DRN module, which consists of frequency losses and physical prior losses. Frequency losses provide structure and style constraints, while the prior loss explores the inherent statistic property of haze-free images. Equipped with our DRN module and unsupervised loss, existing source dehazing models are able to dehaze unlabeled real hazy images. Extensive experiments on multiple baselines demonstrate the validity and superiority of our method visually and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt the model trained on the labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. In this paper, we present Prototypical Contrast Adaptation (ProCA), a simple and efficient contrastive learning method for unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation. Previous domain adaptation methods merely consider the alignment of the intra-class representational distributions across various domains, while the inter-class structural relationship is insufficiently explored, resulting in the aligned representations on the target domain might not be as easily discriminated as done on the source domain anymore. Instead, ProCA incorporates inter-class information into class-wise prototypes, and adopts the class-centered distribution alignment for adaptation. By considering the same class prototypes as positives and other class prototypes as negatives to achieve class-centered distribution alignment, ProCA achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical domain adaptation tasks, {\em i.e., GTA5 $\to$ Cityscapes \text{and} SYNTHIA $\to$ Cityscapes}.

- **Summary**: Indian vehicle number plates have wide variety in terms of size, font, script and shape. Development of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) solutions is therefore challenging, necessitating a diverse dataset to serve as a collection of examples. However, a comprehensive dataset of Indian scenario is missing, thereby, hampering the progress towards publicly available and reproducible ANPR solutions. Many countries have invested efforts to develop comprehensive ANPR datasets like Chinese City Parking Dataset (CCPD) for China and Application-oriented License Plate (AOLP) dataset for US. In this work, we release an expanding dataset presently consisting of 1.5k images and a scalable and reproducible procedure of enhancing this dataset towards development of ANPR solution for Indian conditions. We have leveraged this dataset to explore an End-to-End (E2E) ANPR architecture for Indian scenario which was originally proposed for Chinese Vehicle number-plate recognition based on the CCPD dataset. As we customized the architecture for our dataset, we came across insights, which we have discussed in this paper. We report the hindrances in direct reusability of the model provided by the authors of CCPD because of the extreme diversity in Indian number plates and differences in distribution with respect to the CCPD dataset. An improvement of 42.86% was observed in LP detection after aligning the characteristics of Indian dataset with Chinese dataset. In this work, we have also compared the performance of the E2E number-plate detection model with YOLOv5 model, pre-trained on COCO dataset and fine-tuned on Indian vehicle images. Given that the number Indian vehicle images used for fine-tuning the detection module and yolov5 were same, we concluded that it is more sample efficient to develop an ANPR solution for Indian conditions based on COCO dataset rather than CCPD dataset.

- **Summary**: Existing automatic data augmentation (DA) methods either ignore updating DA's parameters according to the target model's state during training or adopt update strategies that are not effective enough. In this work, we design a novel data augmentation strategy called "Universal Adaptive Data Augmentation" (UADA). Different from existing methods, UADA would adaptively update DA's parameters according to the target model's gradient information during training: given a pre-defined set of DA operations, we randomly decide types and magnitudes of DA operations for every data batch during training, and adaptively update DA's parameters along the gradient direction of the loss concerning DA's parameters. In this way, UADA can increase the training loss of the target networks, and the target networks would learn features from harder samples to improve the generalization. Moreover, UADA is very general and can be utilized in numerous tasks, e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments with various models are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, tiny-ImageNet, Cityscapes, and VOC07+12 to prove the significant performance improvements brought by UADA.

- **Summary**: With video-level labels, weakly supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) applies a localization-by-classification paradigm to detect and classify the action in untrimmed videos. Due to the characteristic of classification, class-specific background snippets are inevitably mis-activated to improve the discriminability of the classifier in WTAL. To alleviate the disturbance of background, existing methods try to enlarge the discrepancy between action and background through modeling background snippets with pseudo-snippet-level annotations, which largely rely on artificial hypotheticals. Distinct from the previous works, we present an adversarial learning strategy to break the limitation of mining pseudo background snippets. Concretely, the background classification loss forces the whole video to be regarded as the background by a background gradient reinforcement strategy, confusing the recognition model. Reversely, the foreground(action) loss guides the model to focus on action snippets under such conditions. As a result, competition between the two classification losses drives the model to boost its ability for action modeling. Simultaneously, a novel temporal enhancement network is designed to facilitate the model to construct temporal relation of affinity snippets based on the proposed strategy, for further improving the performance of action localization. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.



### Deep Point-to-Plane Registration by Efficient Backpropagation for Error Minimizing Function

- **Summary**: Traditional algorithms of point set registration minimizing point-to-plane distances often achieve a better estimation of rigid transformation than those minimizing point-to-point distances. Nevertheless, recent deep-learning-based methods minimize the point-to-point distances. In contrast to these methods, this paper proposes the first deep-learning-based approach to point-to-plane registration. A challenging part of this problem is that a typical solution for point-to-plane registration requires an iterative process of accumulating small transformations obtained by minimizing a linearized energy function. The iteration significantly increases the size of the computation graph needed for backpropagation and can slow down both forward and backward network evaluations. To solve this problem, we consider the estimated rigid transformation as a function of input point clouds and derive its analytic gradients using the implicit function theorem. The analytic gradient that we introduce is independent of how the error minimizing function (i.e., the rigid transformation) is obtained, thus allowing us to calculate both the rigid transformation and its gradient efficiently. We implement the proposed point-to-plane registration module over several previous methods that minimize point-to-point distances and demonstrate that the extensions outperform the base methods even with point clouds with noise and low-quality point normals estimated with local point distributions.

- **Summary**: The cotton boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boheman is a serious pest to the U.S. cotton industry that has cost more than 16 billion USD in damages since it entered the United States from Mexico in the late 1800s. This pest has been nearly eradicated; however, southern part of Texas still faces this issue and is always prone to the pest reinfestation each year due to its sub-tropical climate where cotton plants can grow year-round. Volunteer cotton (VC) plants growing in the fields of inter-seasonal crops, like corn, can serve as hosts to these pests once they reach pin-head square stage (5-6 leaf stage) and therefore need to be detected, located, and destroyed or sprayed . In this paper, we present a study to detect VC plants in a corn field using YOLOv3 on three band aerial images collected by unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The two-fold objectives of this paper were : (i) to determine whether YOLOv3 can be used for VC detection in a corn field using RGB (red, green, and blue) aerial images collected by UAS and (ii) to investigate the behavior of YOLOv3 on images at three different scales (320 x 320, S1; 416 x 416, S2; and 512 x 512, S3 pixels) based on average precision (AP), mean average precision (mAP) and F1-score at 95% confidence level. No significant differences existed for mAP among the three scales, while a significant difference was found for AP between S1 and S3 (p = 0.04) and S2 and S3 (p = 0.02). A significant difference was also found for F1-score between S2 and S3 (p = 0.02). The lack of significant differences of mAP at all the three scales indicated that the trained YOLOv3 model can be used on a computer vision-based remotely piloted aerial application system (RPAAS) for VC detection and spray application in near real-time.

- **Summary**: Small subgraphs (graphlets) are important features to describe fundamental units of a large network. The calculation of the subgraph frequency distributions has a wide application in multiple domains including biology and engineering. Unfortunately due to the inherent complexity of this task, most of the existing methods are computationally intensive and inefficient. In this work, we propose GNNS, a novel representational learning framework that utilizes graph neural networks to sample subgraphs efficiently for estimating their frequency distribution. Our framework includes an inference model and a generative model that learns hierarchical embeddings of nodes, subgraphs, and graph types. With the learned model and embeddings, subgraphs are sampled in a highly scalable and parallel way and the frequency distribution estimation is then performed based on these sampled subgraphs. Eventually, our methods achieve comparable accuracy and a significant speedup by three orders of magnitude compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: End-to-end text spotting has attached great attention recently due to its benefits on global optimization and high maintainability for real applications. However, the input scale has always been a tough trade-off since recognizing a small text instance usually requires enlarging the whole image, which brings high computational costs. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a novel cost-efficient Dynamic Low-resolution Distillation (DLD) text spotting framework, which aims to infer images in different small but recognizable resolutions and achieve a better balance between accuracy and efficiency. Concretely, we adopt a resolution selector to dynamically decide the input resolutions for different images, which is constraint by both inference accuracy and computational cost. Another sequential knowledge distillation strategy is conducted on the text recognition branch, making the low-res input obtains comparable performance to a high-res image. The proposed method can be optimized end-to-end and adopted in any current text spotting framework to improve the practicability. Extensive experiments on several text spotting benchmarks show that the proposed method vastly improves the usability of low-res models.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the outcomes of a contest organized to evaluate methods for the online recognition of heterogeneous gestures from sequences of 3D hand poses. The task is the detection of gestures belonging to a dictionary of 16 classes characterized by different pose and motion features. The dataset features continuous sequences of hand tracking data where the gestures are interleaved with non-significant motions. The data have been captured using the Hololens 2 finger tracking system in a realistic use-case of mixed reality interaction. The evaluation is based not only on the detection performances but also on the latency and the false positives, making it possible to understand the feasibility of practical interaction tools based on the algorithms proposed. The outcomes of the contest's evaluation demonstrate the necessity of further research to reduce recognition errors, while the computational cost of the algorithms proposed is sufficiently low.

- **Summary**: Image resolution, or in general, image quality, plays an essential role in the performance of today's face recognition systems. To address this problem, we propose a novel combination of the popular triplet loss to improve robustness against image resolution via fine-tuning of existing face recognition models. With octuplet loss, we leverage the relationship between high-resolution images and their synthetically down-sampled variants jointly with their identity labels. Fine-tuning several state-of-the-art approaches with our method proves that we can significantly boost performance for cross-resolution (high-to-low resolution) face verification on various datasets without meaningfully exacerbating the performance on high-to-high resolution images. Our method applied on the FaceTransformer network achieves 95.12% face verification accuracy on the challenging XQLFW dataset while reaching 99.73% on the LFW database. Moreover, the low-to-low face verification accuracy benefits from our method. We release our code to allow seamless integration of the octuplet loss into existing frameworks.

- **Summary**: Detectingandsegmentingobjectswithinwholeslideimagesis essential in computational pathology workflow. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is appealing to such annotation-heavy tasks. Despite the extensive benchmarks in natural images for dense tasks, such studies are, unfortunately, absent in current works for pathology. Our paper intends to narrow this gap. We first benchmark representative SSL methods for dense prediction tasks in pathology images. Then, we propose concept contrastive learning (ConCL), an SSL framework for dense pre-training. We explore how ConCL performs with concepts provided by different sources and end up with proposing a simple dependency-free concept generating method that does not rely on external segmentation algorithms or saliency detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConCL over previous state-of-the-art SSL methods across different settings. Along our exploration, we distll several important and intriguing components contributing to the success of dense pre-training for pathology images. We hope this work could provide useful data points and encourage the community to conduct ConCL pre-training for problems of interest. Code is available.

- **Summary**: In this paper, two semi-supervised appearance based loop closure detection technique, HGCN-FABMAP and HGCN-BoW are introduced. Furthermore an extension to the current state of the art localization SLAM algorithm, ORB-SLAM, is presented. The proposed HGCN-FABMAP method is implemented in an off-line manner incorporating Bayesian probabilistic schema for loop detection decision making. Specifically, we let a Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN) to operate over the SURF features graph space, and perform vector quantization part of the SLAM procedure. This part previously was performed in an unsupervised manner using algorithms like HKmeans, kmeans++,..etc. The main Advantage of using HGCN, is that it scales linearly in number of graph edges. Experimental results shows that HGCN-FABMAP algorithm needs far more cluster centroids than HGCN-ORB, otherwise it fails to detect loop closures. Therefore we consider HGCN-ORB to be more efficient in terms of memory consumption, also we conclude the superiority of HGCN-BoW and HGCN-FABMAP with respect to other algorithms.

- **Summary**: Recently, automatically extracting information from visually rich documents (e.g., tickets and resumes) has become a hot and vital research topic due to its widespread commercial value. Most existing methods divide this task into two subparts: the text reading part for obtaining the plain text from the original document images and the information extraction part for extracting key contents. These methods mainly focus on improving the second, while neglecting that the two parts are highly correlated. This paper proposes a unified end-to-end information extraction framework from visually rich documents, where text reading and information extraction can reinforce each other via a well-designed multi-modal context block. Specifically, the text reading part provides multi-modal features like visual, textual and layout features. The multi-modal context block is developed to fuse the generated multi-modal features and even the prior knowledge from the pre-trained language model for better semantic representation. The information extraction part is responsible for generating key contents with the fused context features. The framework can be trained in an end-to-end trainable manner, achieving global optimization. What is more, we define and group visually rich documents into four categories across two dimensions, the layout and text type. For each document category, we provide or recommend the corresponding benchmarks, experimental settings and strong baselines for remedying the problem that this research area lacks the uniform evaluation standard. Extensive experiments on four kinds of benchmarks (from fixed layout to variable layout, from full-structured text to semi-unstructured text) are reported, demonstrating the proposed method's effectiveness. Data, source code and models are available.

- **Summary**: Single-pixel imaging (SPI) is a novel imaging technique whose working principle is based on the compressive sensing (CS) theory. In SPI, data is obtained through a series of compressive measurements and the corresponding image is reconstructed. Typically, the reconstruction algorithm such as basis pursuit relies on the sparsity assumption in images. However, recent advances in deep learning have found its uses in reconstructing CS images. Despite showing a promising result in simulations, it is often unclear how such an algorithm can be implemented in an actual SPI setup. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of deep learning on the reconstruction of SPI images in conjunction with block compressive sensing (BCS). We also proposed a novel reconstruction model based on convolutional neural networks that outperforms other competitive CS reconstruction algorithms. Besides, by incorporating BCS in our deep learning model, we were able to reconstruct images of any size above a certain smallest image size. In addition, we show that our model is capable of reconstructing images obtained from an SPI setup while being priorly trained on natural images, which can be vastly different from the SPI images. This opens up opportunity for the feasibility of pretrained deep learning models for CS reconstructions of images from various domain areas.

- **Summary**: Expandable networks have demonstrated their advantages in dealing with catastrophic forgetting problem in incremental learning. Considering that different tasks may need different structures, recent methods design dynamic structures adapted to different tasks via sophisticated skills. Their routine is to search expandable structures first and then train on the new tasks, which, however, breaks tasks into multiple training stages, leading to suboptimal or overmuch computational cost. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable adaptively expandable network named E2-AEN, which dynamically generates lightweight structures for new tasks without any accuracy drop in previous tasks. Specifically, the network contains a serial of powerful feature adapters for augmenting the previously learned representations to new tasks, and avoiding task interference. These adapters are controlled via an adaptive gate-based pruning strategy which decides whether the expanded structures can be pruned, making the network structure dynamically changeable according to the complexity of the new tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel sparsity-activation regularization to encourage the model to learn discriminative features with limited parameters. E2-AEN reduces cost and can be built upon any feed-forward architectures in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on both classification (i.e., CIFAR and VDD) and detection (i.e., COCO, VOC and ICCV2021 SSLAD challenge) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves the new remarkable results.

- **Summary**: Video frame synthesis, which consists of interpolation and extrapolation, is an essential video processing technique that can be applied to various scenarios. However, most existing methods cannot handle small objects or large motion well, especially in high-resolution videos such as 4K videos. To eliminate such limitations, we introduce a neighbor correspondence matching (NCM) algorithm for flow-based frame synthesis. Since the current frame is not available in video frame synthesis, NCM is performed in a current-frame-agnostic fashion to establish multi-scale correspondences in the spatial-temporal neighborhoods of each pixel. Based on the powerful motion representation capability of NCM, we further propose to estimate intermediate flows for frame synthesis in a heterogeneous coarse-to-fine scheme. Specifically, the coarse-scale module is designed to leverage neighbor correspondences to capture large motion, while the fine-scale module is more computationally efficient to speed up the estimation process. Both modules are trained progressively to eliminate the resolution gap between training dataset and real-world videos. Experimental results show that NCM achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. In addition, NCM can be applied to various practical scenarios such as video compression to achieve better performance.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of point clouds, aiming to assign each point a semantic category, is critical to 3D scene understanding.Despite of significant advances in recent years, most of existing methods still suffer from either the object-level misclassification or the boundary-level ambiguity. In this paper, we present a robust semantic segmentation network by deeply exploring the geometry of point clouds, dubbed GeoSegNet. Our GeoSegNet consists of a multi-geometry based encoder and a boundary-guided decoder. In the encoder, we develop a new residual geometry module from multi-geometry perspectives to extract object-level features. In the decoder, we introduce a contrastive boundary learning module to enhance the geometric representation of boundary points. Benefiting from the geometric encoder-decoder modeling, our GeoSegNet can infer the segmentation of objects effectively while making the intersections (boundaries) of two or more objects clear. Experiments show obvious improvements of our method over its competitors in terms of the overall segmentation accuracy and object boundary clearness.

- **Summary**: Commercial visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems have been gaining attention as cost-effective, off-the-shelf six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) ego-motion tracking methods for estimating accurate and consistent camera pose data, in addition to their ability to operate without external localization from motion capture or global positioning systems. It is unclear from existing results, however, which commercial VIO platforms are the most stable, consistent, and accurate in terms of state estimation for indoor and outdoor robotic applications. We assess four popular proprietary VIO systems (Apple ARKit, Google ARCore, Intel RealSense T265, and Stereolabs ZED 2) through a series of both indoor and outdoor experiments where we show their positioning stability, consistency, and accuracy. We present our complete results as a benchmark comparison for the research community.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel approach to multimodal sensor fusion for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) which takes advantage of learning using privileged information (LUPI). We address two major shortcomings of standard multimodal approaches, limited area coverage and reduced reliability. Our new framework fuses the concept of modality hallucination with triplet learning to train a model with different modalities to handle missing sensors at inference time. We evaluate the proposed model on inertial data from a wearable accelerometer device, using RGB videos and skeletons as privileged modalities, and show an improvement of accuracy of an average 6.6% on the UTD-MHAD dataset and an average 5.5% on the Berkeley MHAD dataset, reaching a new state-of-the-art for inertial-only classification accuracy on these datasets. We validate our framework through several ablation studies.

- **Summary**: We propose to tackle the multiview photometric stereo problem using an extension of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), conditioned on light source direction. The geometric part of our neural representation predicts surface normal direction, allowing us to reason about local surface reflectance. The appearance part of our neural representation is decomposed into a neural bidirectional reflectance function (BRDF), learnt as part of the fitting process, and a shadow prediction network (conditioned on light source direction) allowing us to model the apparent BRDF. This balance of learnt components with inductive biases based on physical image formation models allows us to extrapolate far from the light source and viewer directions observed during training. We demonstrate our approach on a multiview photometric stereo benchmark and show that competitive performance can be obtained with the neural density representation of a NeRF.

- **Summary**: Ovarian cancer is one of the most harmful gynecological diseases. Detecting ovarian tumors in early stage with computer-aided techniques can efficiently decrease the mortality rate. With the improvement of medical treatment standard, ultrasound images are widely applied in clinical treatment. However, recent notable methods mainly focus on single-modality ultrasound ovarian tumor segmentation or recognition, which means there still lacks researches on exploring the representation capability of multi-modality ultrasound ovarian tumor images. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound (MMOTU) image dataset containing 1469 2d ultrasound images and 170 contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) images with pixel-wise and global-wise annotations. Based on MMOTU, we mainly focus on unsupervised cross-domain semantic segmentation task. To solve the domain shift problem, we propose a feature alignment based architecture named Dual-Scheme Domain-Selected Network (DS2Net). Specifically, we first design source-encoder and target-encoder to extract two-style features of source and target images. Then, we propose Domain-Distinct Selected Module (DDSM) and Domain-Universal Selected Module (DUSM) to extract the distinct and universal features in two styles (source-style or target-style). Finally, we fuse these two kinds of features and feed them into the source-decoder and target-decoder to generate final predictions. Extensive comparison experiments and analysis on MMOTU image dataset show that DS2Net can boost the segmentation performance for bidirectional cross-domain adaptation of 2d ultrasound images and CEUS images. Our proposed dataset and code are all available at https://github.com/cv516Buaa/MMOTU_DS2Net.

- **Summary**: Most existing few-shot learning (FSL) methods require a large amount of labeled data in meta-training, which is a major limit. To reduce the requirement of labels, a semi-supervised meta-training (SSMT) setting has been proposed for FSL, which includes only a few labeled samples and numbers of unlabeled samples in base classes. However, existing methods under this setting require class-aware sample selection from the unlabeled set, which violates the assumption of unlabeled set. In this paper, we propose a practical semi-supervised meta-training setting with truly unlabeled data to facilitate the applications of FSL in realistic scenarios. To better utilize both the labeled and truly unlabeled data, we propose a simple and effective meta-training framework, called pseudo-labeling based meta-learning (PLML). Firstly, we train a classifier via common semi-supervised learning (SSL) and use it to obtain the pseudo-labels of unlabeled data. Then we build few-shot tasks from labeled and pseudo-labeled data and design a novel finetuning method with feature smoothing and noise suppression to better learn the FSL model from noise labels. Surprisingly, through extensive experiments across two FSL datasets, we find that this simple meta-training framework effectively prevents the performance degradation of various FSL models under limited labeled data, and also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SSMT models. Besides, benefiting from meta-training, our method also improves two representative SSL algorithms as well.

- **Summary**: The idea of using computers to read medical scans was introduced as early as 1966. However, limits to machine learning technology meant progress was slow initially. The Alexnet breakthrough in 2012 sparked new interest in the topic, which resulted in the release of 100s of medical AI solutions on the market. In spite of success for some diseases and modalities, many challenges remain. Research typically focuses on the development of specific applications or techniques, clinical evaluation, or meta analysis of clinical studies or techniques through surveys or challenges. However, limited attention has been given to the development process of improving real world performance. In this tutorial, we address the latter and discuss some techniques to conduct the development process in order to make this as efficient as possible.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose DEXTER, an end to end system to extract information from tables present in medical health documents, such as electronic health records (EHR) and explanation of benefits (EOB). DEXTER consists of four sub-system stages: i) table detection ii) table type classification iii) cell detection; and iv) cell content extraction. We propose a two-stage transfer learning-based approach using CDeC-Net architecture along with Non-Maximal suppression for table detection. We design a conventional computer vision-based approach for table type classification and cell detection using parameterized kernels based on image size for detecting rows and columns. Finally, we extract the text from the detected cells using pre-existing OCR engine Tessaract. To evaluate our system, we manually annotated a sample of the real-world medical dataset (referred to as Meddata) consisting of wide variations of documents (in terms of appearance) covering different table structures, such as bordered, partially bordered, borderless, or coloured tables. We experimentally show that DEXTER outperforms the commercially available Amazon Textract and Microsoft Azure Form Recognizer systems on the annotated real-world medical dataset

- **Summary**: Due to the scarcity of dense pixel-level semantic annotations for images recorded in adverse visual conditions, there has been a keen interest in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for the semantic segmentation of such images. UDA adapts models trained on normal conditions to the target adverse-condition domains. Meanwhile, multiple datasets with driving scenes provide corresponding images of the same scenes across multiple conditions, which can serve as a form of weak supervision for domain adaptation. We propose Refign, a generic extension to self-training-based UDA methods which leverages these cross-domain correspondences. Refign consists of two steps: (1) aligning the normal-condition image to the corresponding adverse-condition image using an uncertainty-aware dense matching network, and (2) refining the adverse prediction with the normal prediction using an adaptive label correction mechanism. We design custom modules to streamline both steps and set the new state of the art for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on several adverse-condition benchmarks, including ACDC and Dark Zurich. The approach introduces no extra training parameters, minimal computational overhead -- during training only -- and can be used as a drop-in extension to improve any given self-training-based UDA method.

- **Summary**: Object detection using single point supervision has received increasing attention over the years. However, the performance gap between point supervised object detection (PSOD) and bounding box supervised detection remains large. In this paper, we attribute such a large performance gap to the failure of generating high-quality proposal bags which are crucial for multiple instance learning (MIL). To address this problem, we introduce a lightweight alternative to the off-the-shelf proposal (OTSP) method and thereby create the Point-to-Box Network (P2BNet), which can construct an inter-objects balanced proposal bag by generating proposals in an anchor-like way. By fully investigating the accurate position information, P2BNet further constructs an instance-level bag, avoiding the mixture of multiple objects. Finally, a coarse-to-fine policy in a cascade fashion is utilized to improve the IoU between proposals and ground-truth (GT). Benefiting from these strategies, P2BNet is able to produce high-quality instance-level bags for object detection. P2BNet improves the mean average precision (AP) by more than 50% relative to the previous best PSOD method on the MS COCO dataset. It also demonstrates the great potential to bridge the performance gap between point supervised and bounding-box supervised detectors. The code will be released at github.com/ucas-vg/P2BNet.

- **Summary**: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in a variety of motor dysfunction symptoms, including tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. The diagnosis of PD mainly relies on clinical experience rather than a definite medical test, and the diagnostic accuracy is only about 73-84% since it is challenged by the subjective opinions or experiences of different medical experts. Therefore, an efficient and interpretable automatic PD diagnosis system is valuable for supporting clinicians with more robust diagnostic decision-making. To this end, we propose to classify Parkinson's tremor since it is one of the most predominant symptoms of PD with strong generalizability. Different from other computer-aided time and resource-consuming Parkinson's Tremor (PT) classification systems that rely on wearable sensors, we propose SPAPNet, which only requires consumer-grade non-intrusive video recording of camera-facing human movements as input to provide undiagnosed patients with low-cost PT classification results as a PD warning sign. For the first time, we propose to use a novel attention module with a lightweight pyramidal channel-squeezing-fusion architecture to extract relevant PT information and filter the noise efficiently. This design aids in improving both classification performance and system interpretability. Experimental results show that our system outperforms state-of-the-arts by achieving a balanced accuracy of 90.9% and an F1-score of 90.6% in classifying PT with the non-PT class.



### iColoriT: Towards Propagating Local Hint to the Right Region in Interactive Colorization by Leveraging Vision Transformer

- **Summary**: Point-interactive image colorization aims to colorize grayscale images when a user provides the colors for specific locations. It is essential for point-interactive colorization methods to appropriately propagate user-provided colors (i.e., user hints) in the entire image to obtain a reasonably colorized image with minimal user effort. However, existing approaches often produce partially colorized results due to the inefficient design of stacking convolutional layers to propagate hints to distant relevant regions. To address this problem, we present iColoriT, a novel point-interactive colorization Vision Transformer capable of propagating user hints to relevant regions, leveraging the global receptive field of Transformers. The self-attention mechanism of Transformers enables iColoriT to selectively colorize relevant regions with only a few local hints. Our approach colorizes images in real-time by utilizing pixel shuffling, an efficient upsampling technique that replaces the decoder architecture. Also, in order to mitigate the artifacts caused by pixel shuffling with large upsampling ratios, we present the local stabilizing layer. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach highly outperforms existing methods for point-interactive colorization, producing accurately colorized images with a user's minimal effort.

- **Summary**: Many biological and medical tasks require the delineation of 3D curvilinear structures such as blood vessels and neurites from image volumes. This is typically done using neural networks trained by minimizing voxel-wise loss functions that do not capture the topological properties of these structures. As a result, the connectivity of the recovered structures is often wrong, which lessens their usefulness. In this paper, we propose to improve the 3D connectivity of our results by minimizing a sum of topology-aware losses on their 2D projections. This suffices to increase the accuracy and to reduce the annotation effort required to provide the required annotated training data.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep dictionary learning (DDL)has attracted a great amount of attention due to its effectiveness for representation learning and visual recognition.~However, most existing methods focus on unsupervised deep dictionary learning, failing to further explore the category information.~To make full use of the category information of different samples, we propose a novel deep dictionary learning model with an intra-class constraint (DDLIC) for visual classification. Specifically, we design the intra-class compactness constraint on the intermediate representation at different levels to encourage the intra-class representations to be closer to each other, and eventually the learned representation becomes more discriminative.~Unlike the traditional DDL methods, during the classification stage, our DDLIC performs a layer-wise greedy optimization in a similar way to the training stage. Experimental results on four image datasets show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Most state-of-the-art instance-level human parsing models adopt two-stage anchor-based detectors and, therefore, cannot avoid the heuristic anchor box design and the lack of analysis on a pixel level. To address these two issues, we have designed an instance-level human parsing network which is anchor-free and solvable on a pixel level. It consists of two simple sub-networks: an anchor-free detection head for bounding box predictions and an edge-guided parsing head for human segmentation. The anchor-free detector head inherits the pixel-like merits and effectively avoids the sensitivity of hyper-parameters as proved in object detection applications. By introducing the part-aware boundary clue, the edge-guided parsing head is capable to distinguish adjacent human parts from among each other up to 58 parts in a single human instance, even overlapping instances. Meanwhile, a refinement head integrating box-level score and part-level parsing quality is exploited to improve the quality of the parsing results. Experiments on two multiple human parsing datasets (i.e., CIHP and LV-MHP-v2.0) and one video instance-level human parsing dataset (i.e., VIP) show that our method achieves the best global-level and instance-level performance over state-of-the-art one-stage top-down alternatives.

- **Summary**: Nonunion is one of the challenges faced by orthopedics clinics for the technical difficulties and high costs in photographing interosseous capillaries. Segmenting vessels and filling capillaries are critical in understanding the obstacles encountered in capillary growth. However, existing datasets for blood vessel segmentation mainly focus on the large blood vessels of the body, and the lack of labeled capillary image datasets greatly limits the methodological development and applications of vessel segmentation and capillary filling. Here, we present a benchmark dataset, named IFCIS-155, consisting of 155 2D capillary images with segmentation boundaries and vessel fillings annotated by biomedical experts, and 19 large-scale, high-resolution 3D capillary images. To obtain better images of interosseous capillaries, we leverage state-of-the-art immunofluorescence imaging techniques to highlight the rich vascular morphology of interosseous capillaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the dataset and the benchmarking deep learning models (\eg UNet/UNet++ and the modified UNet/UNet++). Our work offers a benchmark dataset for training deep learning models for capillary image segmentation and provides a potential tool for future capillary research. The IFCIS-155 dataset and code are all publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ncclabsustech/IFCIS-55}.

- **Summary**: High-quality calibrated uncertainty estimates are crucial for numerous real-world applications, especially for deep learning-based deployed ML systems. While Bayesian deep learning techniques allow uncertainty estimation, training them with large-scale datasets is an expensive process that does not always yield models competitive with non-Bayesian counterparts. Moreover, many of the high-performing deep learning models that are already trained and deployed are non-Bayesian in nature and do not provide uncertainty estimates. To address these issues, we propose BayesCap that learns a Bayesian identity mapping for the frozen model, allowing uncertainty estimation. BayesCap is a memory-efficient method that can be trained on a small fraction of the original dataset, enhancing pretrained non-Bayesian computer vision models by providing calibrated uncertainty estimates for the predictions without (i) hampering the performance of the model and (ii) the need for expensive retraining the model from scratch. The proposed method is agnostic to various architectures and tasks. We show the efficacy of our method on a wide variety of tasks with a diverse set of architectures, including image super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and crucial application such as medical image translation. Moreover, we apply the derived uncertainty estimates to detect out-of-distribution samples in critical scenarios like depth estimation in autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Binary neural network (BNN) provides a promising solution to deploy parameter-intensive deep single image super-resolution (SISR) models onto real devices with limited storage and computational resources. To achieve comparable performance with the full-precision counterpart, most existing BNNs for SISR mainly focus on compensating the information loss incurred by binarizing weights and activations in the network through better approximations to the binarized convolution. In this study, we revisit the difference between BNNs and their full-precision counterparts and argue that the key for good generalization performance of BNNs lies on preserving a complete full-precision information flow as well as an accurate gradient flow passing through each binarized convolution layer. Inspired by this, we propose to introduce a full-precision skip connection or its variant over each binarized convolution layer across the entire network, which can increase the forward expressive capability and the accuracy of back-propagated gradient, thus enhancing the generalization performance. More importantly, such a scheme is applicable to any existing BNN backbones for SISR without introducing any additional computation cost. To testify its efficacy, we evaluate it using four different backbones for SISR on four benchmark datasets and report obviously superior performance over existing BNNs and even some 4-bit competitors.

- **Summary**: Expanding an existing tourist photo from a partially captured scene to a full scene is one of the desired experiences for photography applications. Although photo extrapolation has been well studied, it is much more challenging to extrapolate a photo (i.e., selfie) from a narrow field of view to a wider one while maintaining a similar visual style. In this paper, we propose a factorized neural re-rendering model to produce photorealistic novel views from cluttered outdoor Internet photo collections, which enables the applications including controllable scene re-rendering, photo extrapolation and even extrapolated 3D photo generation. Specifically, we first develop a novel factorized re-rendering pipeline to handle the ambiguity in the decomposition of geometry, appearance and illumination. We also propose a composited training strategy to tackle the unexpected occlusion in Internet images. Moreover, to enhance photo-realism when extrapolating tourist photographs, we propose a novel realism augmentation process to complement appearance details, which automatically propagates the texture details from a narrow captured photo to the extrapolated neural rendered image. The experiments and photo editing examples on outdoor scenes demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in both photo-realism and downstream applications.

- **Summary**: Video streams are delivered continuously to save the cost of storage and device memory. Real-time denoising algorithms are typically adopted on the user device to remove the noise involved during the shooting and transmission of video streams. However, sliding-window-based methods feed multiple input frames for a single output and lack computation efficiency. Recent multi-output inference works propagate the bidirectional temporal feature with a parallel or recurrent framework, which either suffers from performance drops on the temporal edges of clips or can not achieve online inference. In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional Streaming Video Denoising (BSVD) framework, to achieve high-fidelity real-time denoising for streaming videos with both past and future temporal receptive fields. The bidirectional temporal fusion for online inference is considered not applicable in the MoViNet. However, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Buffer Block as the core module of our BSVD, which makes it possible during our pipeline-style inference. In addition, our method is concise and flexible to be utilized in both non-blind and blind video denoising. We compare our model with various state-of-the-art video denoising models qualitatively and quantitatively on synthetic and real noise. Our method outperforms previous methods in terms of restoration fidelity and runtime. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ChenyangQiQi/BSVD

- **Summary**: Despite a growing recognition of the importance of insurgent group structure on conflict outcomes, there is very little empirical research thereon. Though this problem is rooted in the inaccessibility of data on militant group structure, insurgents frequently publish large volumes of image data on the internet. In this paper, I develop a new methodology that leverages this abundant but underutilized source of data by automating the creation of a social network graph based on co-appearance in photographs using deep learning. Using a trove of 19,115 obituary images published online by the PKK, a Kurdish militant group in Turkey, I demonstrate that an individual's centrality in the resulting co-appearance network is closely correlated with their rank in the insurgent group.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to densely track certain designated objects in videos. One of the main challenges in this task is the existence of background distractors that appear similar to the target objects. We propose three novel strategies to suppress such distractors: 1) a spatio-temporally diversified template construction scheme to obtain generalized properties of the target objects; 2) a learnable distance-scoring function to exclude spatially-distant distractors by exploiting the temporal consistency between two consecutive frames; 3) swap-and-attach augmentation to force each object to have unique features by providing training samples containing entangled objects. On all public benchmark datasets, our model achieves a comparable performance to contemporary state-of-the-art approaches, even with real-time performance. Qualitative results also demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods. We believe our approach will be widely used for future VOS research.

Our framework first learns implicit surface templates representing the coarse clothing topology, and then employs the templates to guide the generation of point sets which further capture pose-dependent clothing deformations such as wrinkles. Our pipeline incorporates the merits of both implicit and explicit representations, namely, the ability to handle varying topology and the ability to efficiently capture fine details. We also propose diffused skinning to facilitate template training especially for loose clothing, and projection-based pose-encoding to extract pose information from mesh templates without predefined UV map or connectivity. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jsnln/fite.

- **Summary**: We present AutoMerge, a LiDAR data processing framework for assembling a large number of map segments into a complete map. Traditional large-scale map merging methods are fragile to incorrect data associations, and are primarily limited to working only offline. AutoMerge utilizes multi-perspective fusion and adaptive loop closure detection for accurate data associations, and it uses incremental merging to assemble large maps from individual trajectory segments given in random order and with no initial estimations. Furthermore, after assembling the segments, AutoMerge performs fine matching and pose-graph optimization to globally smooth the merged map. We demonstrate AutoMerge on both city-scale merging (120km) and campus-scale repeated merging (4.5km x 8). The experiments show that AutoMerge (i) surpasses the second- and third- best methods by 14% and 24% recall in segment retrieval, (ii) achieves comparable 3D mapping accuracy for 120 km large-scale map assembly, (iii) and it is robust to temporally-spaced revisits. To the best of our knowledge, AutoMerge is the first mapping approach that can merge hundreds of kilometers of individual segments without the aid of GPS.

- **Summary**: Context-aware STR methods typically use internal autoregressive (AR) language models (LM). Inherent limitations of AR models motivated two-stage methods which employ an external LM. The conditional independence of the external LM on the input image may cause it to erroneously rectify correct predictions, leading to significant inefficiencies. Our method, PARSeq, learns an ensemble of internal AR LMs with shared weights using Permutation Language Modeling. It unifies context-free non-AR and context-aware AR inference, and iterative refinement using bidirectional context. Using synthetic training data, PARSeq achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in STR benchmarks (91.9% accuracy) and more challenging datasets. It establishes new SOTA results (96.0% accuracy) when trained on real data. PARSeq is optimal on accuracy vs parameter count, FLOPS, and latency because of its simple, unified structure and parallel token processing. Due to its extensive use of attention, it is robust on arbitrarily-oriented text which is common in real-world images.

- **Summary**: The deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices is hindered by the substantial gap between performance requirements and available processing power. While recent research has made significant strides in developing pruning methods to build a sparse network for reducing the computing overhead of DNNs, there remains considerable accuracy loss, especially at high pruning ratios. We find that the architectures designed for dense networks by differentiable architecture search methods are ineffective when pruning mechanisms are applied to them. The main reason is that the current method does not support sparse architectures in their search space and uses a search objective that is made for dense networks and does not pay any attention to sparsity. In this paper, we propose a new method to search for sparsity-friendly neural architectures. We do this by adding two new sparse operations to the search space and modifying the search objective. We propose two novel parametric SparseConv and SparseLinear operations in order to expand the search space to include sparse operations. In particular, these operations make a flexible search space due to using sparse parametric versions of linear and convolution operations. The proposed search objective lets us train the architecture based on the sparsity of the search space operations. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that our search architectures outperform those used in the stateof-the-art sparse networks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In terms of performance and hardware effectiveness, DASS increases the accuracy of the sparse version of MobileNet-v2 from 73.44% to 81.35% (+7.91% improvement) with 3.87x faster inference time.

- **Summary**: Data imbalance between common and rare diseases during model training often causes intelligent diagnosis systems to have biased predictions towards common diseases. The state-of-the-art approaches apply a two-stage learning framework to alleviate the class-imbalance issue, where the first stage focuses on training of a general feature extractor and the second stage focuses on fine-tuning the classifier head for class rebalancing. However, existing two-stage approaches do not consider the fine-grained property between different diseases, often causing the first stage less effective for medical image classification than for natural image classification tasks. In this study, we propose embedding metric learning into the first stage of the two-stage framework specially to help the feature extractor learn to extract more discriminative feature representations. Extensive experiments mainly on three medical image datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms existing onestage and two-stage approaches, suggesting that metric learning can be used as an effective plug-in component in the two-stage framework for fine-grained class-imbalanced image classification tasks.

- **Summary**: We present ObjectBox, a novel single-stage anchor-free and highly generalizable object detection approach. As opposed to both existing anchor-based and anchor-free detectors, which are more biased toward specific object scales in their label assignments, we use only object center locations as positive samples and treat all objects equally in different feature levels regardless of the objects' sizes or shapes. Specifically, our label assignment strategy considers the object center locations as shape- and size-agnostic anchors in an anchor-free fashion, and allows learning to occur at all scales for every object. To support this, we define new regression targets as the distances from two corners of the center cell location to the four sides of the bounding box. Moreover, to handle scale-variant objects, we propose a tailored IoU loss to deal with boxes with different sizes. As a result, our proposed object detector does not need any dataset-dependent hyperparameters to be tuned across datasets. We evaluate our method on MS-COCO 2017 and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets, and compare our results to state-of-the-art methods. We observe that ObjectBox performs favorably in comparison to prior works. Furthermore, we perform rigorous ablation experiments to evaluate different components of our method. Our code is available at: https://github.com/MohsenZand/ObjectBox.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we mainly focus on the problem of how to learn additional feature representations for few-shot image classification through pretext tasks (e.g., rotation or color permutation and so on). This additional knowledge generated by pretext tasks can further improve the performance of few-shot learning (FSL) as it differs from human-annotated supervision (i.e., class labels of FSL tasks). To solve this problem, we present a plug-in Hierarchical Tree Structure-aware (HTS) method, which not only learns the relationship of FSL and pretext tasks, but more importantly, can adaptively select and aggregate feature representations generated by pretext tasks to maximize the performance of FSL tasks. A hierarchical tree constructing component and a gated selection aggregating component is introduced to construct the tree structure and find richer transferable knowledge that can rapidly adapt to novel classes with a few labeled images. Extensive experiments show that our HTS can significantly enhance multiple few-shot methods to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Language models are defined over a finite set of inputs, which creates a vocabulary bottleneck when we attempt to scale the number of supported languages. Tackling this bottleneck results in a trade-off between what can be represented in the embedding matrix and computational issues in the output layer. This paper introduces PIXEL, the Pixel-based Encoder of Language, which suffers from neither of these issues. PIXEL is a pretrained language model that renders text as images, making it possible to transfer representations across languages based on orthographic similarity or the co-activation of pixels. PIXEL is trained to reconstruct the pixels of masked patches instead of predicting a distribution over tokens. We pretrain the 86M parameter PIXEL model on the same English data as BERT and evaluate on syntactic and semantic tasks in typologically diverse languages, including various non-Latin scripts. We find that PIXEL substantially outperforms BERT on syntactic and semantic processing tasks on scripts that are not found in the pretraining data, but PIXEL is slightly weaker than BERT when working with Latin scripts. Furthermore, we find that PIXEL is more robust than BERT to orthographic attacks and linguistic code-switching, further confirming the benefits of modelling language with pixels.

- **Summary**: Accurate three-dimensional perception is a fundamental task in several computer vision applications. Recently, commercial RGB-depth (RGB-D) cameras have been widely adopted as single-view depth-sensing devices owing to their efficient depth-sensing abilities. However, the depth quality of most RGB-D sensors remains insufficient owing to the inherent noise from a single-view environment. Recently, several studies have focused on the single-view depth enhancement of RGB-D cameras. Recent research has proposed deep-learning-based approaches that typically train networks using high-quality supervised depth datasets, which indicates that the quality of the ground-truth (GT) depth dataset is a top-most important factor for accurate system; however, such high-quality GT datasets are difficult to obtain. In this study, we developed a novel method for high-quality GT depth generation based on an RGB-D stream dataset. First, we defined consecutive depth frames in a local spatial region as a local frame set. Then, the depth frames were aligned to a certain frame in the local frame set using an unsupervised point cloud registration scheme. The registration parameters were trained based on an overfit-training scheme, which was primarily used to construct a single GT depth image for each frame set. The final GT depth dataset was constructed using several local frame sets, and each local frame set was trained independently. The primary advantage of this study is that a high-quality GT depth dataset can be constructed under various scanning environments using only the RGB-D stream dataset. Moreover, our proposed method can be used as a new benchmark GT dataset for accurate performance evaluations. We evaluated our GT dataset on previously benchmarked GT depth datasets and demonstrated that our method is superior to state-of-the-art depth enhancement frameworks.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal fusion approaches aim to integrate information from different data sources. Unlike natural datasets, such as in audio-visual applications, where samples consist of "paired" modalities, data in healthcare is often collected asynchronously. Hence, requiring the presence of all modalities for a given sample is not realistic for clinical tasks and significantly limits the size of the dataset during training. In this paper, we propose MedFuse, a conceptually simple yet promising LSTM-based fusion module that can accommodate uni-modal as well as multi-modal input. We evaluate the fusion method and introduce new benchmark results for in-hospital mortality prediction and phenotype classification, using clinical time-series data in the MIMIC-IV dataset and corresponding chest X-ray images in MIMIC-CXR. Compared to more complex multi-modal fusion strategies, MedFuse provides a performance improvement by a large margin on the fully paired test set. It also remains robust across the partially paired test set containing samples with missing chest X-ray images. We release our code for reproducibility and to enable the evaluation of competing models in the future.



### Adversarial Attacks on Monocular Pose Estimation

- **Summary**: Advances in deep learning have resulted in steady progress in computer vision with improved accuracy on tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, thus presenting a challenge in reliable deployment. Two of the prominent tasks in 3D scene-understanding for robotics and advanced drive assistance systems are monocular depth and pose estimation, often learned together in an unsupervised manner. While studies evaluating the impact of adversarial attacks on monocular depth estimation exist, a systematic demonstration and analysis of adversarial perturbations against pose estimation are lacking. We show how additive imperceptible perturbations can not only change predictions to increase the trajectory drift but also catastrophically alter its geometry. We also study the relation between adversarial perturbations targeting monocular depth and pose estimation networks, as well as the transferability of perturbations to other networks with different architectures and losses. Our experiments show how the generated perturbations lead to notable errors in relative rotation and translation predictions and elucidate vulnerabilities of the networks.

- **Summary**: While audio-visual speech models can yield superior performance and robustness compared to audio-only models, their development and adoption are hindered by the lack of labeled and unlabeled audio-visual data and the cost to deploy one model per modality. In this paper, we present u-HuBERT, a self-supervised pre-training framework that can leverage both multimodal and unimodal speech with a unified masked cluster prediction objective. By utilizing modality dropout during pre-training, we demonstrate that a single fine-tuned model can achieve performance on par or better than the state-of-the-art modality-specific models. Moreover, our model fine-tuned only on audio can perform well with audio-visual and visual speech input, achieving zero-shot modality generalization for multiple speech processing tasks. In particular, our single model yields 1.2%/1.4%/27.2% speech recognition word error rate on LRS3 with audio-visual/audio/visual input.

### Convolutional Bypasses Are Better Vision Transformer Adapters

- **Summary**: The pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has been widely adopted in computer vision. But as the size of Vision Transformer (ViT) grows exponentially, the full finetuning becomes prohibitive in view of the heavier storage overhead. Motivated by parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) on language transformers, recent studies attempt to insert lightweight adaptation modules (e.g., adapter layers or prompt tokens) to pretrained ViT and only finetune these modules while the pretrained weights are frozen. However, these modules were originally proposed to finetune language models and did not take into account the prior knowledge specifically for visual tasks. In this paper, we propose to construct Convolutional Bypasses (Convpass) in ViT as adaptation modules, introducing only a small amount (less than 0.5% of model parameters) of trainable parameters to adapt the large ViT. Different from other PETL methods, Convpass benefits from the hard-coded inductive bias of convolutional layers and thus is more suitable for visual tasks, especially in the low-data regime. Experimental results on VTAB-1K benchmark and few-shot learning datasets show that Convpass outperforms current language-oriented adaptation modules, demonstrating the necessity to tailor vision-oriented adaptation modules for adapting vision models.

- **Summary**: Existing temporal action detection (TAD) methods rely on a large number of training data with segment-level annotations. Collecting and annotating such a training set is thus highly expensive and unscalable. Semi-supervised TAD (SS-TAD) alleviates this problem by leveraging unlabeled videos freely available at scale. However, SS-TAD is also a much more challenging problem than supervised TAD, and consequently much under-studied. Prior SS-TAD methods directly combine an existing proposal-based TAD method and a SSL method. Due to their sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification design, they are prone to proposal error propagation. To overcome this limitation, in this work we propose a novel Semi-supervised Temporal action detection model based on PropOsal-free Temporal mask (SPOT) with a parallel localization (mask generation) and classification architecture. Such a novel design effectively eliminates the dependence between localization and classification by cutting off the route for error propagation in-between. We further introduce an interaction mechanism between classification and localization for prediction refinement, and a new pretext task for self-supervised model pre-training. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show that our SPOT outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, often by a large margin. The PyTorch implementation of SPOT is available at https://github.com/sauradip/SPOT

  Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we study a problem of egocentric scene understanding, i.e., predicting depths and surface normals from an egocentric image. Egocentric scene understanding poses unprecedented challenges: (1) due to large head movements, the images are taken from non-canonical viewpoints (i.e., tilted images) where existing models of geometry prediction do not apply; (2) dynamic foreground objects including hands constitute a large proportion of visual scenes. These challenges limit the performance of the existing models learned from large indoor datasets, such as ScanNet and NYUv2, which comprise predominantly upright images of static scenes. We present a multimodal spatial rectifier that stabilizes the egocentric images to a set of reference directions, which allows learning a coherent visual representation. Unlike unimodal spatial rectifier that often produces excessive perspective warp for egocentric images, the multimodal spatial rectifier learns from multiple directions that can minimize the impact of the perspective warp. To learn visual representations of the dynamic foreground objects, we present a new dataset called EDINA (Egocentric Depth on everyday INdoor Activities) that comprises more than 500K synchronized RGBD frames and gravity directions. Equipped with the multimodal spatial rectifier and the EDINA dataset, our proposed method on single-view depth and surface normal estimation significantly outperforms the baselines not only on our EDINA dataset, but also on other popular egocentric datasets, such as First Person Hand Action (FPHA) and EPIC-KITCHENS.

- **Summary**: We present a unified method, termed Unicorn, that can simultaneously solve four tracking problems (SOT, MOT, VOS, MOTS) with a single network using the same model parameters. Due to the fragmented definitions of the object tracking problem itself, most existing trackers are developed to address a single or part of tasks and overspecialize on the characteristics of specific tasks. By contrast, Unicorn provides a unified solution, adopting the same input, backbone, embedding, and head across all tracking tasks. For the first time, we accomplish the great unification of the tracking network architecture and learning paradigm. Unicorn performs on-par or better than its task-specific counterparts in 8 tracking datasets, including LaSOT, TrackingNet, MOT17, BDD100K, DAVIS16-17, MOTS20, and BDD100K MOTS. We believe that Unicorn will serve as a solid step towards the general vision model. Code is available at https://github.com/MasterBin-IIAU/Unicorn.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning is a representation learning method performed by contrasting a sample to other similar samples so that they are brought closely together, forming clusters in the feature space. The learning process is typically conducted using a two-stage training architecture, and it utilizes the contrastive loss (CL) for its feature learning. Contrastive learning has been shown to be quite successful in handling imbalanced datasets, in which some classes are overrepresented while some others are underrepresented. However, previous studies have not specifically modified CL for imbalanced datasets. In this work, we introduce an asymmetric version of CL, referred to as ACL, in order to directly address the problem of class imbalance. In addition, we propose the asymmetric focal contrastive loss (AFCL) as a further generalization of both ACL and focal contrastive loss (FCL). Results on the FMNIST and ISIC 2018 imbalanced datasets show that AFCL is capable of outperforming CL and FCL in terms of both weighted and unweighted classification accuracies. In the appendix, we provide a full axiomatic treatment on entropy, along with complete proofs.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a low-cost and highly accurate ECG-monitoring system intended for personalized early arrhythmia detection for wearable mobile sensors. Earlier supervised approaches for personalized ECG monitoring require both abnormal and normal heartbeats for the training of the dedicated classifier. However, in a real-world scenario where the personalized algorithm is embedded in a wearable device, such training data is not available for healthy people with no cardiac disorder history. In this study, (i) we propose a null space analysis on the healthy signal space obtained via sparse dictionary learning, and investigate how a simple null space projection or alternatively regularized least squares-based classification methods can reduce the computational complexity, without sacrificing the detection accuracy, when compared to sparse representation-based classification. (ii) Then we introduce a sparse representation-based domain adaptation technique in order to project other existing users' abnormal and normal signals onto the new user's signal space, enabling us to train the dedicated classifier without having any abnormal heartbeat of the new user. Therefore, zero-shot learning can be achieved without the need for synthetic abnormal heartbeat generation. An extensive set of experiments performed on the benchmark MIT-BIH ECG dataset shows that when this domain adaptation-based training data generator is used with a simple 1-D CNN classifier, the method outperforms the prior work by a significant margin. (iii) Then, by combining (i) and (ii), we propose an ensemble classifier that further improves the performance. This approach for zero-shot arrhythmia detection achieves an average accuracy level of 98.2% and an F1-Score of 92.8%. Finally, a personalized energy-efficient ECG monitoring scheme is proposed using the above-mentioned innovations.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, image-to-image translation methods, are the state of the art for the enhancement of natural images. Even if they usually show high performance in terms of accuracy, they often suffer from several limitations such as the generation of artifacts and the scalability to high resolutions. Moreover, their main drawback is the completely black-box approach that does not allow to provide the final user with any insight about the enhancement processes applied. In this paper we present a path planning algorithm which provides a step-by-step explanation of the output produced by state of the art enhancement methods, overcoming black-box limitation. This algorithm, called eXIE, uses a variant of the A* algorithm to emulate the enhancement process of another method through the application of an equivalent sequence of enhancing operators. We applied eXIE to explain the output of several state-of-the-art models trained on the Five-K dataset, obtaining sequences of enhancing operators able to produce very similar results in terms of performance and overcoming the huge limitation of poor interpretability of the best performing algorithms.

- **Summary**: This work aims at advancing temporal action detection (TAD) using an encoder-decoder framework with action queries, similar to DETR, which has shown great success in object detection. However, the framework suffers from several problems if directly applied to TAD: the insufficient exploration of inter-query relation in the decoder, the inadequate classification training due to a limited number of training samples, and the unreliable classification scores at inference. To this end, we first propose a relational attention mechanism in the decoder, which guides the attention among queries based on their relations. Moreover, we propose two losses to facilitate and stabilize the training of action classification. Lastly, we propose to predict the localization quality of each action query at inference in order to distinguish high-quality queries. The proposed method, named ReAct, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14, with much lower computational costs than previous methods. Besides, extensive ablation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of each proposed component. The code is available at https://github.com/sssste/React.

- **Summary**: Human relighting is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Existing works either require expensive one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) captured data using light stage or cannot freely change the viewpoints of the rendered body. In this work, we propose a principled framework, Relighting4D, that enables free-viewpoints relighting from only human videos under unknown illuminations. Our key insight is that the space-time varying geometry and reflectance of the human body can be decomposed as a set of neural fields of normal, occlusion, diffuse, and specular maps. These neural fields are further integrated into reflectance-aware physically based rendering, where each vertex in the neural field absorbs and reflects the light from the environment. The whole framework can be learned from videos in a self-supervised manner, with physically informed priors designed for regularization. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our framework is capable of relighting dynamic human actors with free-viewpoints.

- **Summary**: Though impressive performance has been achieved in specific visual realms (e.g. faces, dogs, and places), an omni-vision representation generalizing to many natural visual domains is highly desirable. But, existing benchmarks are biased and inefficient to evaluate the omni-vision representation -- these benchmarks either only include several specific realms, or cover most realms at the expense of subsuming numerous datasets that have extensive realm overlapping. In this paper, we propose Omni-Realm Benchmark (OmniBenchmark). It includes 21 realm-wise datasets with 7,372 concepts and 1,074,346 images. Without semantic overlapping, these datasets cover most visual realms comprehensively and meanwhile efficiently. In addition, we propose a new supervised contrastive learning framework, namely Relational Contrastive learning (ReCo), for a better omni-vision representation. Beyond pulling two instances from the same concept closer -- the typical supervised contrastive learning framework -- ReCo also pulls two instances from the same semantic realm closer, encoding the semantic relation between concepts, and facilitating omni-vision representation learning. We benchmark ReCo and other advances in omni-vision representation studies that are different in architectures (from CNNs to transformers) and in learning paradigms (from supervised learning to self-supervised learning) on OmniBenchmark. We illustrate the superior of ReCo to other supervised contrastive learning methods and reveal multiple practical observations to facilitate future research.

- **Summary**: We propose a new method for fine-grained few-shot recognition via deep object parsing. In our framework, an object is made up of K distinct parts and for each part, we learn a dictionary of templates, which is shared across all instances and categories. An object is parsed by estimating the locations of these K parts and a set of active templates that can reconstruct the part features. We recognize test instances by comparing its active templates and the relative geometry of its part locations against those of the presented few-shot instances. Our method is end-to-end trainable to learn part templates on-top of a convolutional backbone. To combat visual distortions such as orientation, pose and size, we learn templates at multiple scales, and at test-time parse and match instances across these scales. We show that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art, and by virtue of parsing enjoys interpretability as well.

- **Summary**: We present XMem, a video object segmentation architecture for long videos with unified feature memory stores inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model. Prior work on video object segmentation typically only uses one type of feature memory. For videos longer than a minute, a single feature memory model tightly links memory consumption and accuracy. In contrast, following the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, we develop an architecture that incorporates multiple independent yet deeply-connected feature memory stores: a rapidly updated sensory memory, a high-resolution working memory, and a compact thus sustained long-term memory. Crucially, we develop a memory potentiation algorithm that routinely consolidates actively used working memory elements into the long-term memory, which avoids memory explosion and minimizes performance decay for long-term prediction. Combined with a new memory reading mechanism, XMem greatly exceeds state-of-the-art performance on long-video datasets while being on par with state-of-the-art methods (that do not work on long videos) on short-video datasets.

### Bootstrapped Masked Autoencoders for Vision BERT Pretraining

- **Summary**: We propose bootstrapped masked autoencoders (BootMAE), a new approach for vision BERT pretraining. BootMAE improves the original masked autoencoders (MAE) with two core designs: 1) momentum encoder that provides online feature as extra BERT prediction targets; 2) target-aware decoder that tries to reduce the pressure on the encoder to memorize target-specific information in BERT pretraining. The first design is motivated by the observation that using a pretrained MAE to extract the features as the BERT prediction target for masked tokens can achieve better pretraining performance. Therefore, we add a momentum encoder in parallel with the original MAE encoder, which bootstraps the pretraining performance by using its own representation as the BERT prediction target. In the second design, we introduce target-specific information (e.g., pixel values of unmasked patches) from the encoder directly to the decoder to reduce the pressure on the encoder of memorizing the target-specific information. Thus, the encoder focuses on semantic modeling, which is the goal of BERT pretraining, and does not need to waste its capacity in memorizing the information of unmasked tokens related to the prediction target. Through extensive experiments, our BootMAE achieves $84.2\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B backbone, outperforming MAE by $+0.8\%$ under the same pre-training epochs. BootMAE also gets $+1.0$ mIoU improvements on semantic segmentation on ADE20K and $+1.3$ box AP, $+1.4$ mask AP improvement on object detection and segmentation on COCO dataset.

- **Summary**: Deep clustering has recently attracted significant attention. Despite the remarkable progress, most of the previous deep clustering works still suffer from two limitations. First, many of them focus on some distribution-based clustering loss, lacking the ability to exploit sample-wise (or augmentation-wise) relationships via contrastive learning. Second, they often neglect the indirect sample-wise structure information, overlooking the rich possibilities of multi-scale neighborhood structure learning. In view of this, this paper presents a new deep clustering approach termed Image clustering with contrastive learning and multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (IcicleGCN), which bridges the gap between convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional network (GCN) as well as the gap between contrastive learning and multi-scale neighborhood structure learning for the image clustering task. The proposed IcicleGCN framework consists of four main modules, namely, the CNN-based backbone, the Instance Similarity Module (ISM), the Joint Cluster Structure Learning and Instance reconstruction Module (JC-SLIM), and the Multi-scale GCN module (M-GCN). Specifically, with two random augmentations performed on each image, the backbone network with two weight-sharing views is utilized to learn the representations for the augmented samples, which are then fed to ISM and JC-SLIM for instance-level and cluster-level contrastive learning, respectively. Further, to enforce multi-scale neighborhood structure learning, two streams of GCNs and an auto-encoder are simultaneously trained via (i) the layer-wise interaction with representation fusion and (ii) the joint self-adaptive learning that ensures their last-layer output distributions to be consistent. Experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate the superior clustering performance of IcicleGCN over the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: We present AiTLAS: Benchmark Arena -- an open-source benchmark suite for evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for image classification in Earth Observation (EO). To this end, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of more than 500 models derived from ten different state-of-the-art architectures and compare them to a variety of multi-class and multi-label classification tasks from 22 datasets with different sizes and properties. In addition to models trained entirely on these datasets, we benchmark models trained in the context of transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained model variants, as it is typically performed in practice. All presented approaches are general and can be easily extended to many other remote sensing image classification tasks not considered in this study. To ensure reproducibility and facilitate better usability and further developments, all of the experimental resources including the trained models, model configurations, and processing details of the datasets (with their corresponding splits used for training and evaluating the models) are publicly available on the repository: https://github.com/biasvariancelabs/aitlas-arena

- **Summary**: Lipschitz Bound Estimation is an effective method of regularizing deep neural networks to make them robust against adversarial attacks. This is useful in a variety of applications ranging from reinforcement learning to autonomous systems. In this paper, we highlight the significant gap in obtaining a non-trivial Lipschitz bound certificate for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and empirically support it with extensive graphical analysis. We also show that unrolling Convolutional layers or Toeplitz matrices can be employed to convert Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to a Fully Connected Network. Further, we propose a simple algorithm to show the existing 20x-50x gap in a particular data distribution between the actual lipschitz constant and the obtained tight bound. We also ran sets of thorough experiments on various network architectures and benchmark them on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. All these proposals are supported by extensive testing, graphs, histograms and comparative analysis.

- **Summary**: We are interested in estimating the uncertainties of deep neural networks, which play an important role in many scientific and engineering problems. In this paper, we present a striking new finding that an ensemble of neural networks with the same weight initialization, trained on datasets that are shifted by a constant bias gives rise to slightly inconsistent trained models, where the differences in predictions are a strong indicator of epistemic uncertainties. Using the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we demonstrate that this phenomena occurs in part because the NTK is not shift-invariant. Since this is achieved via a trivial input transformation, we show that this behavior can therefore be approximated by training a single neural network -- using a technique that we call $\Delta-$UQ -- that estimates uncertainty around prediction by marginalizing out the effect of the biases during inference. We show that $\Delta-$UQ's uncertainty estimates are superior to many of the current methods on a variety of benchmarks -- outlier rejection, calibration under distribution shift, and sequential design optimization of black box functions. Code for $\Delta-$UQ can be accessed at https://github.com/LLNL/DeltaUQ

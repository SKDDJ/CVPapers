- **Summary**: The adversarial attack can force a CNN-based model to produce an incorrect output by craftily manipulating human-imperceptible input. Exploring such perturbations can help us gain a deeper understanding of the vulnerability of neural networks, and provide robustness to deep learning against miscellaneous adversaries. Despite extensive studies focusing on the robustness of image, audio, and NLP, works on adversarial examples of visual object tracking -- especially in a black-box manner -- are quite lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial attack method to generate noises for single object tracking under black-box settings, where perturbations are merely added on initial frames of tracking sequences, which is difficult to be noticed from the perspective of a whole video clip. Specifically, we divide our algorithm into three components and exploit reinforcement learning for localizing important frame patches precisely while reducing unnecessary computational queries overhead. Compared to existing techniques, our method requires fewer queries on initialized frames of a video to manipulate competitive or even better attack performance. We test our algorithm in both long-term and short-term datasets, including OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three mainstream types of trackers: discrimination, Siamese-based, and reinforcement learning-based trackers.

- **Summary**: The Class Activation Map (CAM) lookup of a neural network tells us to which regions the neural network focuses when it makes a decision. In the past, the CAM search method was dependent upon a specific internal module of the network. It has specific constraints on the structure of the neural network. To make the search of CAM have generality and high performance. We propose a learning-based algorithm, namely Multiple Dynamic Masks (MDM). It is based on a public cognition that only active features of a picture related to classification will affect the classification results of the neural network, and other features will hardly affect the classification results of the network. The mask generated by MDM conforms to the above cognition. It trains mask vectors of different sizes by constraining mask values and activating consistency, then it uses stacking masks of different scale to generate CAM that can balance spatial information and semantic information. Comparing the results of MDM with those of the recent advanced CAM search method, the performance of MDM has reached the state of the art results. We applied the MDM method to the interpretable neural networks ProtoPNet and XProtoNet, which improved the performance of model in the explainable prototype search. Finally, we visualized the CAM generation effect of MDM on neural networks of different architectures, verifying the generality of the MDM method.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised pre-training methods for large vision models have shown to enhance performance on downstream supervised tasks. Developing similar techniques for satellite imagery presents significant opportunities as unlabelled data is plentiful and the inherent temporal and multi-spectral structure provides avenues to further improve existing pre-training strategies. In this paper, we present SatMAE, a pre-training framework for temporal or multi-spectral satellite imagery based on Masked Autoencoder (MAE). To leverage temporal information, we include a temporal embedding along with independently masking image patches across time. In addition, we demonstrate that encoding multi-spectral data as groups of bands with distinct spectral positional encodings is beneficial. Our approach yields strong improvements over previous state-of-the-art techniques, both in terms of supervised learning performance on benchmark datasets (up to $\uparrow$ 7%), and transfer learning performance on downstream remote sensing tasks, including land cover classification (up to $\uparrow$ 14%) and semantic segmentation.

  detect humans in RGBD data
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We address the problem of people detection in RGB-D data where we leverage depth information to develop a region-of-interest (ROI) selection method that provides proposals to two color and depth CNNs. To combine the detections produced by the two CNNs, we propose a novel fusion approach based on the characteristics of depth images. We also present a new depth-encoding scheme, which not only encodes depth images into three channels but also enhances the information for classification. We conduct experiments on a publicly available RGB-D people dataset and show that our approach outperforms the baseline models that only use RGB data.

- **Summary**: Sketching is an intuitive and effective way for content creation. While significant progress has been made for photorealistic image generation by using generative adversarial networks, it remains challenging to take a fine-grained control on synthetic content. The instance normalization layer, which is widely adopted in existing image translation networks, washes away details in the input sketch and leads to loss of precise control on the desired shape of the generated face images. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the effect of instance normalization on generating photorealistic face images from hand-drawn sketches. We first introduce a visualization approach to analyze the feature embedding for sketches with a group of specific changes. Based on the visual analysis, we modify the instance normalization layers in the baseline image translation model. We elaborate a new set of hand-drawn sketches with 11 categories of specially designed changes and conduct extensive experimental analysis. The results and user studies demonstrate that our method markedly improve the quality of synthesized images and the conformance with user intention.

- **Summary**: ImageNet trained PyTorch models are generally preferred as the off-the-shelf models for direct use or for initialisation in most computer vision tasks. In this paper, we simply test a representative set of these convolution and transformer based models under many simple image transformations like horizontal shifting, vertical shifting, scaling, rotation, presence of Gaussian noise, cutout, horizontal flip and vertical flip and report the performance drop caused by such transformations. We find that even simple transformations like rotating the image by 10{\deg} or zooming in by 20% can reduce the top-1 accuracy of models like ResNet152 by 1%+.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a novel image retouching method by modeling the retouching process as performing a sequence of newly introduced trainable neural color operators. The neural color operator mimics the behavior of traditional color operators and learns pixelwise color transformation while its strength is controlled by a scalar. To reflect the homomorphism property of color operators, we employ equivariant mapping and adopt an encoder-decoder structure which maps the non-linear color transformation to a much simpler transformation (i.e., translation) in a high dimensional space. The scalar strength of each neural color operator is predicted using CNN based strength predictors by analyzing global image statistics. Overall, our method is rather lightweight and offers flexible controls. Experiments and user studies on public datasets show that our method consistently achieves the best results compared with SOTA methods in both quantitative measures and visual qualities.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: While category-level 9DoF object pose estimation has emerged recently, previous correspondence-based or direct regression methods are both limited in accuracy due to the huge intra-category variances in object shape and color, etc. Orthogonal to them, this work presents a category-level object pose and size refiner CATRE, which is able to iteratively enhance pose estimate from point clouds to produce accurate results. Given an initial pose estimate, CATRE predicts a relative transformation between the initial pose and ground truth by means of aligning the partially observed point cloud and an abstract shape prior. In specific, we propose a novel disentangled architecture being aware of the inherent distinctions between rotation and translation/size estimation. Extensive experiments show that our approach remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods on REAL275, CAMERA25, and LM benchmarks up to a speed of ~85.32Hz, and achieves competitive results on category-level tracking. We further demonstrate that CATRE can perform pose refinement on unseen category. Code and trained models are available.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly sensitive to imperceptible malicious perturbations, known as adversarial attacks. Following the discovery of this vulnerability in real-world imaging and vision applications, the associated safety concerns have attracted vast research attention, and many defense techniques have been developed. Most of these defense methods rely on adversarial training (AT) -- training the classification network on images perturbed according to a specific threat model, which defines the magnitude of the allowed modification. Although AT leads to promising results, training on a specific threat model fails to generalize to other types of perturbations. A different approach utilizes a preprocessing step to remove the adversarial perturbation from the attacked image. In this work, we follow the latter path and aim to develop a technique that leads to robust classifiers across various realizations of threat models. To this end, we harness the recent advances in stochastic generative modeling, and means to leverage these for sampling from conditional distributions. Our defense relies on an addition of Gaussian i.i.d noise to the attacked image, followed by a pretrained diffusion process -- an architecture that performs a stochastic iterative process over a denoising network, yielding a high perceptual quality denoised outcome. The obtained robustness with this stochastic preprocessing step is validated through extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing that our method outperforms the leading defense methods under various threat models.

  Applications, 18, 2, Article 46 (May 2021),23 pages
- **Summary**: Rapid progress and superior performance have been achieved for skeleton-based action recognition recently. In this article, we investigate this problem under a cross-dataset setting, which is a new, pragmatic, and challenging task in real-world scenarios. Following the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) paradigm, the action labels are only available on a source dataset, but unavailable on a target dataset in the training stage. Different from the conventional adversarial learning-based approaches for UDA, we utilize a self-supervision scheme to reduce the domain shift between two skeleton-based action datasets. Our inspiration is drawn from Cubism, an art genre from the early 20th century, which breaks and reassembles the objects to convey a greater context. By segmenting and permuting temporal segments or human body parts, we design two self-supervised learning classification tasks to explore the temporal and spatial dependency of a skeleton-based action and improve the generalization ability of the model. We conduct experiments on six datasets for skeleton-based action recognition, including three large-scale datasets (NTU RGB+D, PKU-MMD, and Kinetics) where new cross-dataset settings and benchmarks are established. Extensive results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes of our model and all the compared methods are available at https://github.com/shanice-l/st-cubism.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The spread of COVID-19 has brought a huge disaster to the world, and the automatic segmentation of infection regions can help doctors to make diagnosis quickly and reduce workload. However, there are several challenges for the accurate and complete segmentation, such as the scattered infection area distribution, complex background noises, and blurred segmentation boundaries. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel network for automatic COVID-19 lung infection segmentation from CT images, named BCS-Net, which considers the boundary, context, and semantic attributes. The BCS-Net follows an encoder-decoder architecture, and more designs focus on the decoder stage that includes three progressively Boundary-Context-Semantic Reconstruction (BCSR) blocks. In each BCSR block, the attention-guided global context (AGGC) module is designed to learn the most valuable encoder features for decoder by highlighting the important spatial and boundary locations and modeling the global context dependence. Besides, a semantic guidance (SG) unit generates the semantic guidance map to refine the decoder features by aggregating multi-scale high-level features at the intermediate resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing competitors both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Video frame interpolation (VFI) serves as a useful tool for many video processing applications. Recently, it has also been applied in the video compression domain for enhancing both conventional video codecs and learning-based compression architectures. While there has been an increased focus on the development of enhanced frame interpolation algorithms in recent years, the perceptual quality assessment of interpolated content remains an open field of research. In this paper, we present a bespoke full reference video quality metric for VFI, FloLPIPS, that builds on the popular perceptual image quality metric, LPIPS, which captures the perceptual degradation in extracted image feature space. In order to enhance the performance of LPIPS for evaluating interpolated content, we re-designed its spatial feature aggregation step by using the temporal distortion (through comparing optical flows) to weight the feature difference maps. Evaluated on the BVI-VFI database, which contains 180 test sequences with various frame interpolation artefacts, FloLPIPS shows superior correlation performance (with statistical significance) with subjective ground truth over 12 popular quality assessors. To facilitate further research in VFI quality assessment, our code is publicly available at https://danier97.github.io/FloLPIPS.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To create and evaluate the accuracy of an artificial intelligence Deep learning platform (ORAiCLE) capable of using only retinal fundus images to predict both an individuals overall 5 year cardiovascular risk (CVD) and the relative contribution of the component risk factors that comprise this risk. Methods: We used 165,907 retinal images from a database of 47,236 patient visits. Initially, each image was paired with biometric data age, ethnicity, sex, presence and duration of diabetes a HDL/LDL ratios as well as any CVD event wtihin 5 years of the retinal image acquisition. A risk score based on Framingham equations was calculated. The real CVD event rate was also determined for the individuals and overall population. Finally, ORAiCLE was trained using only age, ethnicity, sex plus retinal images. Results: Compared to Framingham-based score, ORAiCLE was up to 12% more accurate in prediciting cardiovascular event in he next 5-years, especially for the highest risk group of people. The reliability and accuracy of each of the restrictive models was suboptimal to ORAiCLE performance ,indicating that it was using data from both sets of data to derive its final results. Conclusion: Retinal photography is inexpensive and only minimal training is required to acquire them as fully automated, inexpensive camera systems are now widely available. As such, AI-based CVD risk algorithms such as ORAiCLE promise to make CV health screening more accurate, more afforadable and more accessible for all. Furthermore, ORAiCLE unique ability to assess the relative contribution of the components that comprise an individuals overall risk would inform treatment decisions based on the specific needs of an individual, thereby increasing the likelihood of positive health outcomes.

- **Summary**: Existing learning-based methods for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) are heavily dependent on large amounts of annotated training data, and usually suffer from a severe performance degradation when encountering the domain/distribution shift problem. Thanks to the development of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), some works attempt to transfer the knowledge from a label-sufficient source domain to a label-free target domain under domain shift with UDA. However, it requires the coexistence of source and target data, which might be impractical for source data due to the privacy or storage issues. In this paper, we take the first step towards the source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) in a simple yet efficient manner for BIQA to tackle the domain shift without access to the source data. Specifically, we cast the quality assessment task as a rating distribution prediction problem. Based on the intrinsic properties of BIQA, we present a group of well-designed self-supervised objectives to guide the adaptation of the BN affine parameters towards the target domain. Among them, minimizing the prediction entropy and maximizing the batch prediction diversity aim to encourage more confident results while avoiding the trivial solution. Besides, based on the observation that the IQA rating distribution of single image follows the Gaussian distribution, we apply Gaussian regularization to the predicted rating distribution to make it more consistent with the nature of human scoring. Extensive experimental results under cross-domain scenarios demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method to mitigate the domain shift.

- **Summary**: Recently, the image-wise implicit neural representation of videos, NeRV, has gained popularity for its promising results and swift speed compared to regular pixel-wise implicit representations. However, the redundant parameters within the network structure can cause a large model size when scaling up for desirable performance. The key reason of this phenomenon is the coupled formulation of NeRV, which outputs the spatial and temporal information of video frames directly from the frame index input. In this paper, we propose E-NeRV, which dramatically expedites NeRV by decomposing the image-wise implicit neural representation into separate spatial and temporal context. Under the guidance of this new formulation, our model greatly reduces the redundant model parameters, while retaining the representation ability. We experimentally find that our method can improve the performance to a large extent with fewer parameters, resulting in a more than $8\times$ faster speed on convergence.

- **Summary**: Despite the demonstrated editing capacity in the latent space of a pretrained GAN model, inverting real-world images is stuck in a dilemma that the reconstruction cannot be faithful to the original input. The main reason for this is that the distributions between training and real-world data are misaligned, and because of that, it is unstable of GAN inversion for real image editing. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN prior based editing framework to tackle the out-of-domain inversion problem with a composition-decomposition paradigm. In particular, during the phase of composition, we introduce a differential activation module for detecting semantic changes from a global perspective, \ie, the relative gap between the features of edited and unedited images. With the aid of the generated Diff-CAM mask, a coarse reconstruction can intuitively be composited by the paired original and edited images. In this way, the attribute-irrelevant regions can be survived in almost whole, while the quality of such an intermediate result is still limited by an unavoidable ghosting effect. Consequently, in the decomposition phase, we further present a GAN prior based deghosting network for separating the final fine edited image from the coarse reconstruction. Extensive experiments exhibit superiorities over the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The robustness and flexibility of our method is also validated on both scenarios of single attribute and multi-attribute manipulations.

- **Summary**: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently reached state-of-the-art Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) performance. However, recent research has shown that typical CNNs' learning performance is limited since they are homogeneous networks with a simple (linear) neuron model. With their heterogeneous network structure incorporating non-linear neurons, Operational Neural Networks (ONNs) have recently been proposed to address this drawback. Self-ONNs are self-organized variations of ONNs with the generative neuron model that can generate any non-linear function using the Taylor approximation. In this study, in order to improve the state-of-the-art performance level in HTR, the 2D Self-organized ONNs (Self-ONNs) in the core of a novel network model are proposed. Moreover, deformable convolutions, which have recently been demonstrated to tackle variations in the writing styles better, are utilized in this study. The results over the IAM English dataset and HADARA80P Arabic dataset show that the proposed model with the operational layers of Self-ONNs significantly improves Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER). Compared with its counterpart CNNs, Self-ONNs reduce CER and WER by 1.2% and 3.4 % in the HADARA80P and 0.199% and 1.244% in the IAM dataset. The results over the benchmark IAM demonstrate that the proposed model with the operational layers of Self-ONNs outperforms recent deep CNN models by a significant margin while the use of Self-ONNs with deformable convolutions demonstrates exceptional results.

- **Summary**: The deep learning literature is continuously updated with new architectures and training techniques. However, weight initialization is overlooked by most recent research, despite some intriguing findings regarding random weights. On the other hand, recent works have been approaching Network Science to understand the structure and dynamics of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) after training. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the centrality of neurons in randomly initialized networks. We show that a higher neuronal strength variance may decrease performance, while a lower neuronal strength variance usually improves it. A new method is then proposed to rewire neuronal connections according to a preferential attachment (PA) rule based on their strength, which significantly reduces the strength variance of layers initialized by common methods. In this sense, PA rewiring only reorganizes connections, while preserving the magnitude and distribution of the weights. We show through an extensive statistical analysis in image classification that performance is improved in most cases, both during training and testing, when using both simple and complex architectures and learning schedules. Our results show that, aside from the magnitude, the organization of the weights is also relevant for better initialization of deep ANNs.

- **Summary**: Large-scale Vision-and-Language (V+L) pre-training for representation learning has proven to be effective in boosting various downstream V+L tasks. However, when it comes to the fashion domain, existing V+L methods are inadequate as they overlook the unique characteristics of both the fashion V+L data and downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel fashion-focused V+L representation learning framework, dubbed as FashionViL. It contains two novel fashion-specific pre-training tasks designed particularly to exploit two intrinsic attributes with fashion V+L data. First, in contrast to other domains where a V+L data point contains only a single image-text pair, there could be multiple images in the fashion domain. We thus propose a Multi-View Contrastive Learning task for pulling closer the visual representation of one image to the compositional multimodal representation of another image+text. Second, fashion text (e.g., product description) often contains rich fine-grained concepts (attributes/noun phrases). To exploit this, a Pseudo-Attributes Classification task is introduced to encourage the learned unimodal (visual/textual) representations of the same concept to be adjacent. Further, fashion V+L tasks uniquely include ones that do not conform to the common one-stream or two-stream architectures (e.g., text-guided image retrieval). We thus propose a flexible, versatile V+L model architecture consisting of a modality-agnostic Transformer so that it can be flexibly adapted to any downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that our FashionViL achieves a new state of the art across five downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/BrandonHanx/mmf.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework, On-Demand MOtion Generation (ODMO), for generating realistic and diverse long-term 3D human motion sequences conditioned only on action types with an additional capability of customization. ODMO shows improvements over SOTA approaches on all traditional motion evaluation metrics when evaluated on three public datasets (HumanAct12, UESTC, and MoCap). Furthermore, we provide both qualitative evaluations and quantitative metrics demonstrating several first-known customization capabilities afforded by our framework, including mode discovery, interpolation, and trajectory customization. These capabilities significantly widen the spectrum of potential applications of such motion generation models. The novel on-demand generative capabilities are enabled by innovations in both the encoder and decoder architectures: (i) Encoder: Utilizing contrastive learning in low-dimensional latent space to create a hierarchical embedding of motion sequences, where not only the codes of different action types form different groups, but within an action type, codes of similar inherent patterns (motion styles) cluster together, making them readily discoverable; (ii) Decoder: Using a hierarchical decoding strategy where the motion trajectory is reconstructed first and then used to reconstruct the whole motion sequence. Such an architecture enables effective trajectory control. Our code is released on the Github page: https://github.com/roychowdhuryresearch/ODMO

- **Summary**: Many successful methods developed for medical image analysis that are based on machine learning use supervised learning approaches, which often require large datasets annotated by experts to achieve high accuracy. However, medical data annotation is time-consuming and expensive, especially for segmentation tasks. To solve the problem of learning with limited labeled medical image data, an alternative deep learning training strategy based on self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled MRI scans is proposed in this work. Our pretraining approach first, randomly applies different distortions to random areas of unlabeled images and then predicts the type of distortions and loss of information. To this aim, an improved version of Mask-RCNN architecture has been adapted to localize the distortion location and recover the original image pixels. The effectiveness of the proposed method for segmentation tasks in different pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios is evaluated based on the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset. Using this self-supervised pretraining method improved the Dice score by 20% compared to training from scratch. The proposed self-supervised learning is simple, effective, and suitable for different ranges of medical image analysis tasks including anomaly detection, segmentation, and classification.

- **Summary**: As a common security tool, visible watermarking has been widely applied to protect copyrights of digital images. However, recent works have shown that visible watermarks can be removed by DNNs without damaging their host images. Such watermark-removal techniques pose a great threat to the ownership of images. Inspired by the vulnerability of DNNs on adversarial perturbations, we propose a novel defence mechanism by adversarial machine learning for good. From the perspective of the adversary, blind watermark-removal networks can be posed as our target models; then we actually optimize an imperceptible adversarial perturbation on the host images to proactively attack against watermark-removal networks, dubbed Watermark Vaccine. Specifically, two types of vaccines are proposed. Disrupting Watermark Vaccine (DWV) induces to ruin the host image along with watermark after passing through watermark-removal networks. In contrast, Inerasable Watermark Vaccine (IWV) works in another fashion of trying to keep the watermark not removed and still noticeable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our DWV/IWV in preventing watermark removal, especially on various watermark removal networks.

- **Summary**: Existing temporal action detection (TAD) methods rely on large training data including segment-level annotations, limited to recognizing previously seen classes alone during inference. Collecting and annotating a large training set for each class of interest is costly and hence unscalable. Zero-shot TAD (ZS-TAD) resolves this obstacle by enabling a pre-trained model to recognize any unseen action classes. Meanwhile, ZS-TAD is also much more challenging with significantly less investigation. Inspired by the success of zero-shot image classification aided by vision-language (ViL) models such as CLIP, we aim to tackle the more complex TAD task. An intuitive method is to integrate an off-the-shelf proposal detector with CLIP style classification. However, due to the sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification design, it is prone to localization error propagation. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a novel zero-Shot Temporal Action detection model via Vision-LanguagE prompting (STALE). Such a novel design effectively eliminates the dependence between localization and classification by breaking the route for error propagation in-between. We further introduce an interaction mechanism between classification and localization for improved optimization. Extensive experiments on standard ZS-TAD video benchmarks show that our STALE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives. Besides, our model also yields superior results on supervised TAD over recent strong competitors. The PyTorch implementation of STALE is available at https://github.com/sauradip/STALE.



### Mind the Gap: Polishing Pseudo labels for Accurate Semi-supervised Object Detection

- **Summary**: Exploiting pseudo labels (e.g., categories and bounding boxes) of unannotated objects produced by a teacher detector have underpinned much of recent progress in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, due to the limited generalization capacity of the teacher detector caused by the scarce annotations, the produced pseudo labels often deviate from ground truth, especially those with relatively low classification confidences, thus limiting the generalization performance of SSOD. To mitigate this problem, we propose a dual pseudo-label polishing framework for SSOD. Instead of directly exploiting the pseudo labels produced by the teacher detector, we take the first attempt at reducing their deviation from ground truth using dual polishing learning, where two differently structured polishing networks are elaborately developed and trained using synthesized paired pseudo labels and the corresponding ground truth for categories and bounding boxes on the given annotated objects, respectively. By doing this, both polishing networks can infer more accurate pseudo labels for unannotated objects through sufficiently exploiting their context knowledge based on the initially produced pseudo labels, and thus improve the generalization performance of SSOD. Moreover, such a scheme can be seamlessly plugged into the existing SSOD framework for joint end-to-end learning. In addition, we propose to disentangle the polished pseudo categories and bounding boxes of unannotated objects for separate category classification and bounding box regression in SSOD, which enables introducing more unannotated objects during model training and thus further improve the performance. Experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: Chinese characters carry a wealth of morphological and semantic information; therefore, the semantic enhancement of the morphology of Chinese characters has drawn significant attention. The previous methods were intended to directly extract information from a whole Chinese character image, which usually cannot capture both global and local information simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a stroke-based autoencoder(SAE), to model the sophisticated morphology of Chinese characters with the self-supervised method. Following its canonical writing order, we first represent a Chinese character as a series of stroke images with a fixed writing order, and then our SAE model is trained to reconstruct this stroke image sequence. This pre-trained SAE model can predict the stroke image series for unseen characters, as long as their strokes or radicals appeared in the training set. We have designed two contrasting SAE architectures on different forms of stroke images. One is fine-tuned on existing stroke-based method for zero-shot recognition of handwritten Chinese characters, and the other is applied to enrich the Chinese word embeddings from their morphological features. The experimental results validate that after pre-training, our SAE architecture outperforms other existing methods in zero-shot recognition and enhances the representation of Chinese characters with their abundant morphological and semantic information.

- **Summary**: We introduce BusyBoard, a toy-inspired robot learning environment that leverages a diverse set of articulated objects and inter-object functional relations to provide rich visual feedback for robot interactions. Based on this environment, we introduce a learning framework, BusyBot, which allows an agent to jointly acquire three fundamental capabilities (interaction, reasoning, and planning) in an integrated and self-supervised manner. With the rich sensory feedback provided by BusyBoard, BusyBot first learns a policy to efficiently interact with the environment; then with data collected using the policy, BusyBot reasons the inter-object functional relations through a causal discovery network; and finally by combining the learned interaction policy and relation reasoning skill, the agent is able to perform goal-conditioned manipulation tasks. We evaluate BusyBot in both simulated and real-world environments, and validate its generalizability to unseen objects and relations. Video is available at https://youtu.be/EJ98xBJZ9ek.

- **Summary**: Under low-light environment, handheld photography suffers from severe camera shake under long exposure settings. Although existing deblurring algorithms have shown promising performance on well-exposed blurry images, they still cannot cope with low-light snapshots. Sophisticated noise and saturation regions are two dominating challenges in practical low-light deblurring. In this work, we propose a novel non-blind deblurring method dubbed image and feature space Wiener deconvolution network (INFWIDE) to tackle these problems systematically. In terms of algorithm design, INFWIDE proposes a two-branch architecture, which explicitly removes noise and hallucinates saturated regions in the image space and suppresses ringing artifacts in the feature space, and integrates the two complementary outputs with a subtle multi-scale fusion network for high quality night photograph deblurring. For effective network training, we design a set of loss functions integrating a forward imaging model and backward reconstruction to form a close-loop regularization to secure good convergence of the deep neural network. Further, to optimize INFWIDE's applicability in real low-light conditions, a physical-process-based low-light noise model is employed to synthesize realistic noisy night photographs for model training. Taking advantage of the traditional Wiener deconvolution algorithm's physically driven characteristics and arisen deep neural network's representation ability, INFWIDE can recover fine details while suppressing the unpleasant artifacts during deblurring. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Imputation of missing images via source-to-target modality translation can improve diversity in medical imaging protocols. A pervasive approach for synthesizing target images involves one-shot mapping through generative adversarial networks (GAN). Yet, GAN models that implicitly characterize the image distribution can suffer from limited sample fidelity. Here, we propose a novel method based on adversarial diffusion modeling, SynDiff, for improved performance in medical image translation. To capture a direct correlate of the image distribution, SynDiff leverages a conditional diffusion process that progressively maps noise and source images onto the target image. For fast and accurate image sampling during inference, large diffusion steps are taken with adversarial projections in the reverse diffusion direction. To enable training on unpaired datasets, a cycle-consistent architecture is devised with coupled diffusive and non-diffusive modules that bilaterally translate between two modalities. Extensive assessments are reported on the utility of SynDiff against competing GAN and diffusion models in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT translation. Our demonstrations indicate that SynDiff offers quantitatively and qualitatively superior performance against competing baselines.

- **Summary**: Neural networks are known to produce over-confident predictions on input images, even when these images are out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This limits the applications of neural network models in real-world scenarios, where OOD samples exist. Many existing approaches identify the OOD instances via exploiting various cues, such as finding irregular patterns in the feature space, logits space, gradient space or the raw space of images. In contrast, this paper proposes a simple Test-time Linear Training (ETLT) method for OOD detection. Empirically, we find that the probabilities of input images being out-of-distribution are surprisingly linearly correlated to the features extracted by neural networks. To be specific, many state-of-the-art OOD algorithms, although designed to measure reliability in different ways, actually lead to OOD scores mostly linearly related to their image features. Thus, by simply learning a linear regression model trained from the paired image features and inferred OOD scores at test-time, we can make a more precise OOD prediction for the test instances. We further propose an online variant of the proposed method, which achieves promising performance and is more practical in real-world applications. Remarkably, we improve FPR95 from $51.37\%$ to $12.30\%$ on CIFAR-10 datasets with maximum softmax probability as the base OOD detector. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the efficacy of ETLT for OOD detection task.

- **Summary**: Contrastive-based self-supervised learning methods achieved great success in recent years. However, self-supervision requires extremely long training epochs (e.g., 800 epochs for MoCo v3) to achieve promising results, which is unacceptable for the general academic community and hinders the development of this topic. This work revisits the momentum-based contrastive learning frameworks and identifies the inefficiency in which two augmented views generate only one positive pair. We propose Fast-MoCo - a novel framework that utilizes combinatorial patches to construct multiple positive pairs from two augmented views, which provides abundant supervision signals that bring significant acceleration with neglectable extra computational cost. Fast-MoCo trained with 100 epochs achieves 73.5% linear evaluation accuracy, similar to MoCo v3 (ResNet-50 backbone) trained with 800 epochs. Extra training (200 epochs) further improves the result to 75.1%, which is on par with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on several downstream tasks also confirm the effectiveness of Fast-MoCo.

- **Summary**: Life-long learning aims at learning a sequence of tasks without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. However, the involved training data may not be life-long legitimate due to privacy or copyright reasons. In practical scenarios, for instance, the model owner may wish to enable or disable the knowledge of specific tasks or specific samples from time to time. Such flexible control over knowledge transfer, unfortunately, has been largely overlooked in previous incremental or decremental learning methods, even at a problem-setup level. In this paper, we explore a novel learning scheme, termed as Learning wIth Recoverable Forgetting (LIRF), that explicitly handles the task- or sample-specific knowledge removal and recovery. Specifically, LIRF brings in two innovative schemes, namely knowledge deposit and withdrawal, which allow for isolating user-designated knowledge from a pre-trained network and injecting it back when necessary. During the knowledge deposit process, the specified knowledge is extracted from the target network and stored in a deposit module, while the insensitive or general knowledge of the target network is preserved and further augmented. During knowledge withdrawal, the taken-off knowledge is added back to the target network. The deposit and withdraw processes only demand for a few epochs of finetuning on the removal data, ensuring both data and time efficiency. We conduct experiments on several datasets, and demonstrate that the proposed LIRF strategy yields encouraging results with gratifying generalization capability.

- **Summary**: Brain vessel image segmentation can be used as a promising biomarker for better prevention and treatment of different diseases. One successful approach is to consider the segmentation as an image-to-image translation task and perform a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to learn a transformation between two distributions. In this paper, we present a novel multi-view approach, MLP-GAN, which splits a 3D volumetric brain vessel image into three different dimensional 2D images (i.e., sagittal, coronal, axial) and then feed them into three different 2D cGANs. The proposed MLP-GAN not only alleviates the memory issue which exists in the original 3D neural networks but also retains 3D spatial information. Specifically, we utilize U-Net as the backbone for our generator and redesign the pattern of skip connection integrated with the MLP-Mixer which has attracted lots of attention recently. Our model obtains the ability to capture cross-patch information to learn global information with the MLP-Mixer. Extensive experiments are performed on the public brain vessel dataset that show our MLP-GAN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We release our code at https://github.com/bxie9/MLP-GAN

- **Summary**: Histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) play a very important role in clinical studies and serve as the gold standard for many cancer diagnoses. However, generating automatic tools for processing WSIs is challenging due to their enormous sizes. Currently, to deal with this issue, conventional methods rely on a multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy to process a WSI at patch level. Although effective, such methods are computationally expensive, because tiling a WSI into patches takes time and does not explore the spatial relations between these tiles. To tackle these limitations, we propose a locally supervised learning framework which processes the entire slide by exploring the entire local and global information that it contains. This framework divides a pre-trained network into several modules and optimizes each module locally using an auxiliary model. We also introduce a random feature reconstruction unit (RFR) to preserve distinguishing features during training and improve the performance of our method by 1% to 3%. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and LKS, highlight the superiority of our method on different classification tasks. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL methods by 2% to 5% in accuracy, while being 7 to 10 times faster. Additionally, when dividing it into eight modules, our method requires as little as 20% of the total gpu memory required by end-to-end training.

- **Summary**: Providing invariances in a given learning task conveys a key inductive bias that can lead to sample-efficient learning and good generalisation, if correctly specified. However, the ideal invariances for many problems of interest are often not known, which has led both to a body of engineering lore as well as attempts to provide frameworks for invariance learning. However, invariance learning is expensive and data intensive for popular neural architectures. We introduce the notion of amortizing invariance learning. In an up-front learning phase, we learn a low-dimensional manifold of feature extractors spanning invariance to different transformations using a hyper-network. Then, for any problem of interest, both model and invariance learning are rapid and efficient by fitting a low-dimensional invariance descriptor an output head. Empirically, this framework can identify appropriate invariances in different downstream tasks and lead to comparable or better test performance than conventional approaches. Our HyperInvariance framework is also theoretically appealing as it enables generalisation-bounds that provide an interesting new operating point in the trade-off between model fit and complexity.

- **Summary**: Surface defect detection is an extremely crucial step to ensure the quality of industrial products. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on encoder-decoder architecture have achieved tremendous success in various defect detection tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution, they commonly exhibit a limitation in explicitly modeling long-range interactions, critical for pixel-wise defect detection in complex cases, e.g., cluttered background and illegible pseudo-defects. Recent transformers are especially skilled at learning global image dependencies but with limited local structural information necessary for detailed defect location. To overcome the above limitations, we propose an efficient hybrid transformer architecture, termed Defect Transformer (DefT), for surface defect detection, which incorporates CNN and transformer into a unified model to capture local and non-local relationships collaboratively. Specifically, in the encoder module, a convolutional stem block is firstly adopted to retain more detailed spatial information. Then, the patch aggregation blocks are used to generate multi-scale representation with four hierarchies, each of them is followed by a series of DefT blocks, which respectively include a locally position-aware block for local position encoding, a lightweight multi-pooling self-attention to model multi-scale global contextual relationships with good computational efficiency, and a convolutional feed-forward network for feature transformation and further location information learning. Finally, a simple but effective decoder module is proposed to gradually recover spatial details from the skip connections in the encoder. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our method compared with other CNN- and transformer-based networks.

- **Summary**: Recent successful adversarial attacks on face recognition show that, despite the remarkable progress of face recognition models, they are still far behind the human intelligence for perception and recognition. It reveals the vulnerability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as state-of-the-art building block for face recognition models against adversarial examples, which can cause certain consequences for secure systems. Gradient-based adversarial attacks are widely studied before and proved to be successful against face recognition models. However, finding the optimized perturbation per each face needs to submitting the significant number of queries to the target model. In this paper, we propose recursive adversarial attack on face recognition using automatic face warping which needs extremely limited number of queries to fool the target model. Instead of a random face warping procedure, the warping functions are applied on specific detected regions of face like eyebrows, nose, lips, etc. We evaluate the robustness of proposed method in the decision-based black-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model parameters and gradients, but hard-label predictions and confidence scores are provided by the target model.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training (AT) defends deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. One challenge that limits its practical application is the performance degradation on clean samples. A major bottleneck identified by previous works is the widely used batch normalization (BN), which struggles to model the different statistics of clean and adversarial training samples in AT. Although the dominant approach is to extend BN to capture this mixture of distribution, we propose to completely eliminate this bottleneck by removing all BN layers in AT. Our normalizer-free robust training (NoFrost) method extends recent advances in normalizer-free networks to AT for its unexplored advantage on handling the mixture distribution challenge. We show that NoFrost achieves adversarial robustness with only a minor sacrifice on clean sample accuracy. On ImageNet with ResNet50, NoFrost achieves $74.06\%$ clean accuracy, which drops merely $2.00\%$ from standard training. In contrast, BN-based AT obtains $59.28\%$ clean accuracy, suffering a significant $16.78\%$ drop from standard training. In addition, NoFrost achieves a $23.56\%$ adversarial robustness against PGD attack, which improves the $13.57\%$ robustness in BN-based AT. We observe better model smoothness and larger decision margins from NoFrost, which make the models less sensitive to input perturbations and thus more robust. Moreover, when incorporating more data augmentations into NoFrost, it achieves comprehensive robustness against multiple distribution shifts. Code and pre-trained models are public at https://github.com/amazon-research/normalizer-free-robust-training.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a tightly-coupled SLAM system fused with RGB, Depth, IMU and structured plane information. Traditional sparse points based SLAM systems always maintain a mass of map points to model the environment. Huge number of map points bring us a high computational complexity, making it difficult to be deployed on mobile devices. On the other hand, planes are common structures in man-made environment especially in indoor environments. We usually can use a small number of planes to represent a large scene. So the main purpose of this article is to decrease the high complexity of sparse points based SLAM. We build a lightweight back-end map which consists of a few planes and map points to achieve efficient bundle adjustment (BA) with an equal or better accuracy. We use homography constraints to eliminate the parameters of numerous plane points in the optimization and reduce the complexity of BA. We separate the parameters and measurements in homography and point-to-plane constraints and compress the measurements part to further effectively improve the speed of BA. We also integrate the plane information into the whole system to realize robust planar feature extraction, data association, and global consistent planar reconstruction. Finally, we perform an ablation study and compare our method with similar methods in simulation and real environment data. Our system achieves obvious advantages in accuracy and efficiency. Even if the plane parameters are involved in the optimization, we effectively simplify the back-end map by using planar structures. The global bundle adjustment is nearly 2 times faster than the sparse points based SLAM algorithm.

- **Summary**: Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods are typically benchmarked on training sets with balanced class distributions. However, in real-world applications, it is common for the training sets to have long-tailed distributions. In this work, we first demonstrate that existing OOD detection methods commonly suffer from significant performance degradation when the training set is long-tail distributed. Through analysis, we posit that this is because the models struggle to distinguish the minority tail-class in-distribution samples, from the true OOD samples, making the tail classes more prone to be falsely detected as OOD. To solve this problem, we propose Partial and Asymmetric Supervised Contrastive Learning (PASCL), which explicitly encourages the model to distinguish between tail-class in-distribution samples and OOD samples. To further boost in-distribution classification accuracy, we propose Auxiliary Branch Finetuning, which uses two separate branches of BN and classification layers for anomaly detection and in-distribution classification, respectively. The intuition is that in-distribution and OOD anomaly data have different underlying distributions. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art method by $1.29\%$, $1.45\%$, $0.69\%$ anomaly detection false positive rate (FPR) and $3.24\%$, $4.06\%$, $7.89\%$ in-distribution classification accuracy on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT, respectively.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) regresses a neural parameterized scene by differentially rendering multi-view images with ground-truth supervision. However, when interpolating novel views, NeRF often yields inconsistent and visually non-smooth geometric results, which we consider as a generalization gap between seen and unseen views. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have demonstrated the promise of advanced robust data augmentations, either random or learned, in enhancing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. Inspired by that, we propose Augmented NeRF (Aug-NeRF), which for the first time brings the power of robust data augmentations into regularizing the NeRF training. Particularly, our proposal learns to seamlessly blend worst-case perturbations into three distinct levels of the NeRF pipeline with physical grounds, including (1) the input coordinates, to simulate imprecise camera parameters at image capture; (2) intermediate features, to smoothen the intrinsic feature manifold; and (3) pre-rendering output, to account for the potential degradation factors in the multi-view image supervision. Extensive results demonstrate that Aug-NeRF effectively boosts NeRF performance in both novel view synthesis (up to 1.5dB PSNR gain) and underlying geometry reconstruction. Furthermore, thanks to the implicit smooth prior injected by the triple-level augmentations, Aug-NeRF can even recover scenes from heavily corrupted images, a highly challenging setting untackled before. Our codes are available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/Aug-NeRF.

- **Summary**: The prediction of human gaze behavior is important for building human-computer interactive systems that can anticipate a user's attention. Computer vision models have been developed to predict the fixations made by people as they search for target objects. But what about when the image has no target? Equally important is to know how people search when they cannot find a target, and when they would stop searching. In this paper, we propose the first data-driven computational model that addresses the search-termination problem and predicts the scanpath of search fixations made by people searching for targets that do not appear in images. We model visual search as an imitation learning problem and represent the internal knowledge that the viewer acquires through fixations using a novel state representation that we call Foveated Feature Maps (FFMs). FFMs integrate a simulated foveated retina into a pretrained ConvNet that produces an in-network feature pyramid, all with minimal computational overhead. Our method integrates FFMs as the state representation in inverse reinforcement learning. Experimentally, we improve the state of the art in predicting human target-absent search behavior on the COCO-Search18 dataset

- **Summary**: Portuguese man-of-war (PMW) is a gelatinous organism with long tentacles capable of causing severe burns, thus leading to negative impacts on human activities, such as tourism and fishing. There is a lack of information about the spatio-temporal dynamics of this species. Therefore, the use of alternative methods for collecting data can contribute to their monitoring. Given the widespread use of social networks and the eye-catching look of PMW, Instagram posts can be a promising data source for monitoring. The first task to follow this approach is to identify posts that refer to PMW. This paper reports on the use of convolutional neural networks for PMW images classification, in order to automate the recognition of Instagram posts. We created a suitable dataset, and trained three different neural networks: VGG-16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, with and without a pre-trained step with the ImageNet dataset. We analyzed their results using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. The pre-trained ResNet50 network presented the best results, obtaining 94% of accuracy and 95% of precision, recall, and F1 score. These results show that convolutional neural networks can be very effective for recognizing PMW images from the Instagram social media.

- **Summary**: Existing RGB-D SOD methods mainly rely on a symmetric two-stream CNN-based network to extract RGB and depth channel features separately. However, there are two problems with the symmetric conventional network structure: first, the ability of CNN in learning global contexts is limited; second, the symmetric two-stream structure ignores the inherent differences between modalities. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based asymmetric network (TANet) to tackle the issues mentioned above. We employ the powerful feature extraction capability of Transformer (PVTv2) to extract global semantic information from RGB data and design a lightweight CNN backbone (LWDepthNet) to extract spatial structure information from depth data without pre-training. The asymmetric hybrid encoder (AHE) effectively reduces the number of parameters in the model while increasing speed without sacrificing performance. Then, we design a cross-modal feature fusion module (CMFFM), which enhances and fuses RGB and depth features with each other. Finally, we add edge prediction as an auxiliary task and propose an edge enhancement module (EEM) to generate sharper contours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over 14 state-of-the-art RGB-D methods on six public datasets. Our code will be released at https://github.com/lc012463/TANet.

- **Summary**: Learning point clouds is challenging due to the lack of connectivity information, i.e., edges. Although existing edge-aware methods can improve the performance by modeling edges, how edges contribute to the improvement is unclear. In this study, we propose a method that automatically learns to enhance/suppress edges while keeping the its working mechanism clear. First, we theoretically figure out how edge enhancement/suppression works. Second, we experimentally verify the edge enhancement/suppression behavior. Third, we empirically show that this behavior improves performance. In general, we observe that the proposed method achieves competitive performance in point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Modeling the local surface geometry is challenging in 3D point cloud understanding due to the lack of connectivity information. Most prior works model local geometry using various convolution operations. We observe that the convolution can be equivalently decomposed as a weighted combination of a local and a global component. With this observation, we explicitly decouple these two components so that the local one can be enhanced and facilitate the learning of local surface geometry. Specifically, we propose Laplacian Unit (LU), a simple yet effective architectural unit that can enhance the learning of local geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that networks equipped with LUs achieve competitive or superior performance on typical point cloud understanding tasks. Moreover, through establishing connections between the mean curvature flow, a further investigation of LU based on curvatures is made to interpret the adaptive smoothing and sharpening effect of LU. The code will be available.

- **Summary**: We design a fast car detection and tracking algorithm for traffic monitoring fisheye video mounted on crossroads. We use ICIP 2020 VIP Cup dataset and adopt YOLOv5 as the object detection base model. The nighttime video of this dataset is very challenging, and the detection accuracy (AP50) of the base model is about 54%. We design a reliable car detection and tracking algorithm based on the concept of bounding box propagation among frames, which provides 17.9 percentage points (pp) and 6.2 pp. accuracy improvement over the base model for the nighttime and daytime videos, respectively. To speed up, the grayscale frame difference is used for the intermediate frames in a segment, which can double the processing speed.

- **Summary**: Face authentication systems require a robust anti-spoofing module as they can be deceived by fabricating spoof images of authorized users. Most recent face anti-spoofing methods rely on optimized architectures and training objectives to alleviate the distribution shift between train and test users. However, in real online scenarios, past data from a user contains valuable information that could be used to alleviate the distribution shift. We thus introduce OAP (Online Adaptive Personalization): a lightweight solution which can adapt the model online using unlabeled data. OAP can be applied on top of most anti-spoofing methods without the need to store original biometric images. Through experimental evaluation on the SiW dataset, we show that OAP improves recognition performance of existing methods on both single video setting and continual setting, where spoof videos are interleaved with live ones to simulate spoofing attacks. We also conduct ablation studies to confirm the design choices for our solution.

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a multi-modal multi-correlation learning framework targeting at the task of audio-visual speech separation. Although previous efforts have been extensively put on combining audio and visual modalities, most of them solely adopt a straightforward concatenation of audio and visual features. To exploit the real useful information behind these two modalities, we define two key correlations which are: (1) identity correlation (between timbre and facial attributes); (2) phonetic correlation (between phoneme and lip motion). These two correlations together comprise the complete information, which shows a certain superiority in separating target speaker's voice especially in some hard cases, such as the same gender or similar content. For implementation, contrastive learning or adversarial training approach is applied to maximize these two correlations. Both of them work well, while adversarial training shows its advantage by avoiding some limitations of contrastive learning. Compared with previous research, our solution demonstrates clear improvement on experimental metrics without additional complexity. Further analysis reveals the validity of the proposed architecture and its good potential for future extension.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of GAN, face forgery technologies have been heavily abused. Achieving accurate face forgery detection is imminent. Inspired by remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) that PPG signal corresponds to the periodic change of skin color caused by heartbeat in face videos, we observe that despite the inevitable loss of PPG signal during the forgery process, there is still a mixture of PPG signals in the forgery video with a unique rhythmic pattern depending on its generation method. Motivated by this key observation, we propose a framework for face forgery detection and categorization consisting of: 1) a Spatial-Temporal Filtering Network (STFNet) for PPG signals filtering, and 2) a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Network (STINet) for constraint and interaction of PPG signals. Moreover, with insight into the generation of forgery methods, we further propose intra-source and inter-source blending to boost the performance of the framework. Overall, extensive experiments have proved the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for Mars exploration. Mars terrain segmentation is an important Martian vision task, which is the base of rover autonomous planning and safe driving. However, existing deep-learning-based terrain segmentation methods face two problems: one is the lack of sufficient detailed and high-confidence annotations, and the other is the over-reliance of models on annotated training data. In this paper, we address these two problems from the perspective of joint data and method design. We first present a new Mars terrain segmentation dataset which contains 6K high-resolution images and is sparsely annotated based on confidence, ensuring the high quality of labels. Then to learn from this sparse data, we propose a representation-learning-based framework for Mars terrain segmentation, including a self-supervised learning stage (for pre-training) and a semi-supervised learning stage (for fine-tuning). Specifically, for self-supervised learning, we design a multi-task mechanism based on the masked image modeling (MIM) concept to emphasize the texture information of images. For semi-supervised learning, since our dataset is sparsely annotated, we encourage the model to excavate the information of unlabeled area in each image by generating and utilizing pseudo-labels online. We name our dataset and method Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Segmentation for Mars (S$^{5}$Mars). Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art approaches and improve terrain segmentation performance by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Referring Video Object Segmentation (R-VOS) is a challenging task that aims to segment an object in a video based on a linguistic expression. Most existing R-VOS methods have a critical assumption: the object referred to must appear in the video. This assumption, which we refer to as semantic consensus, is often violated in real-world scenarios, where the expression may be queried against false videos. In this work, we highlight the need for a robust R-VOS model that can handle semantic mismatches. Accordingly, we propose an extended task called Robust R-VOS, which accepts unpaired video-text inputs. We tackle this problem by jointly modeling the primary R-VOS problem and its dual (text reconstruction). A structural text-to-text cycle constraint is introduced to discriminate semantic consensus between video-text pairs and impose it in positive pairs, thereby achieving multi-modal alignment from both positive and negative pairs. Our structural constraint effectively addresses the challenge posed by linguistic diversity, overcoming the limitations of previous methods that relied on the point-wise constraint. A new evaluation dataset, R\textsuperscript{2}-Youtube-VOSis constructed to measure the model robustness. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on R-VOS benchmarks, Ref-DAVIS17 and Ref-Youtube-VOS, and also our R\textsuperscript{2}-Youtube-VOS~dataset.

- **Summary**: Existing evaluation metrics for Person Re-Identification (Person ReID) models focus on system-wide performance. However, our studies reveal weaknesses due to the uneven data distributions among cameras and different camera properties that expose the ReID system to exploitation. In this work, we raise the long-ignored ReID problem of camera performance imbalance and collect a real-world privacy-aware dataset from 38 cameras to assist the study of the imbalance issue. We propose new metrics to quantify camera performance imbalance and further propose the Adversarial Pairwise Reverse Attention (APRA) Module to guide the model learning the camera invariant feature with a novel pairwise attention inversion mechanism.

- **Summary**: The assessment of general movements (GMs) in infants is a useful tool in the early diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, its evaluation in clinical practice relies on visual inspection by experts, and an automated solution is eagerly awaited. Recently, video-based GMs classification has attracted attention, but this approach would be strongly affected by irrelevant information, such as background clutter in the video. Furthermore, for reliability, it is necessary to properly extract the spatiotemporal features of infants during GMs. In this study, we propose an automated GMs classification method, which consists of preprocessing networks that remove unnecessary background information from GMs videos and adjust the infant's body position, and a subsequent motion classification network based on a two-stream structure. The proposed method can efficiently extract the essential spatiotemporal features for GMs classification while preventing overfitting to irrelevant information for different recording environments. We validated the proposed method using videos obtained from 100 infants. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several baseline models and the existing methods.

- **Summary**: Automatic generation of medical reports from X-ray images can assist radiologists to perform the time-consuming and yet important reporting task. Yet, achieving clinically accurate generated reports remains challenging. Modeling the underlying abnormalities using the knowledge graph approach has been found promising in enhancing the clinical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel fined-grained knowledge graph structure called an attributed abnormality graph (ATAG). The ATAG consists of interconnected abnormality nodes and attribute nodes, allowing it to better capture the abnormality details. In contrast to the existing methods where the abnormality graph was constructed manually, we propose a methodology to automatically construct the fine-grained graph structure based on annotations, medical reports in X-ray datasets, and the RadLex radiology lexicon. We then learn the ATAG embedding using a deep model with an encoder-decoder architecture for the report generation. In particular, graph attention networks are explored to encode the relationships among the abnormalities and their attributes. A gating mechanism is adopted and integrated with various decoders for the generation. We carry out extensive experiments based on the benchmark datasets, and show that the proposed ATAG-based deep model outperforms the SOTA methods by a large margin and can improve the clinical accuracy of the generated reports.

- **Summary**: Automatic snake species recognition is important because it has vast potential to help lower deaths and disabilities caused by snakebites. We introduce our solution in SnakeCLEF 2022 for fine-grained snake species recognition on a heavy long-tailed class distribution. First, a network architecture is designed to extract and fuse features from multiple modalities, i.e. photograph from visual modality and geographic locality information from language modality. Then, logit adjustment based methods are studied to relieve the impact caused by the severe class imbalance. Next, a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning method is proposed to make full use of the dataset, including both labeled training data and unlabeled testing data. Finally, post processing strategies, such as multi-scale and multi-crop test-time-augmentation, location filtering and model ensemble, are employed for better performance. With an ensemble of several different models, a private score 82.65%, ranking the 3rd, is achieved on the final leaderboard.

- **Summary**: 3D part segmentation is an essential step in advanced CAM/CAD workflow. Precise 3D segmentation contributes to lower defective rate of work-pieces produced by the manufacturing equipment (such as computer controlled CNCs), thereby improving work efficiency and attaining the attendant economic benefits. A large class of existing works on 3D model segmentation are mostly based on fully-supervised learning, which trains the AI models with large, annotated datasets. However, the disadvantage is that the resulting models from the fully-supervised learning methodology are highly reliant on the completeness of the available dataset, and its generalization ability is relatively poor to new unknown segmentation types (i.e. further additional novel classes). In this work, we propose and develop a noteworthy few-shot learning-based approach for effective part segmentation in CAM/CAD; and this is designed to significantly enhance its generalization ability and flexibly adapt to new segmentation tasks by using only relatively rather few samples. As a result, it not only reduces the requirements for the usually unattainable and exhaustive completeness of supervision datasets, but also improves the flexibility for real-world applications. As further improvement and innovation, we additionally adopt the transform net and the center loss block in the network. These characteristics serve to improve the comprehension for 3D features of the various possible instances of the whole work-piece and ensure the close distribution of the same class in feature space.

- **Summary**: For digitizing or indexing physical documents, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the process of extracting textual information from scanned documents, is a vital technology. When a document is visually damaged or contains non-textual elements, existing technologies can yield poor results, as erroneous detection results can greatly affect the quality of OCR. In this paper we present a detection network dubbed BusiNet aimed at OCR of business documents. Business documents often include sensitive information and as such they cannot be uploaded to a cloud service for OCR. BusiNet was designed to be fast and light so it could run locally preventing privacy issues. Furthermore, BusiNet is built to handle scanned document corruption and noise using a specialized synthetic dataset. The model is made robust to unseen noise by employing adversarial training strategies. We perform an evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrating the usefulness and broad applicability of our model.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of deep learning has made a great progress in image segmentation, one of the fundamental tasks of computer vision. However, the current segmentation algorithms mostly rely on the availability of pixel-level annotations, which are often expensive, tedious, and laborious. To alleviate this burden, the past years have witnessed an increasing attention in building label-efficient, deep-learning-based image segmentation algorithms. This paper offers a comprehensive review on label-efficient image segmentation methods. To this end, we first develop a taxonomy to organize these methods according to the supervision provided by different types of weak labels (including no supervision, inexact supervision, incomplete supervision and inaccurate supervision) and supplemented by the types of segmentation problems (including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation). Next, we summarize the existing label-efficient image segmentation methods from a unified perspective that discusses an important question: how to bridge the gap between weak supervision and dense prediction -- the current methods are mostly based on heuristic priors, such as cross-pixel similarity, cross-label constraint, cross-view consistency, and cross-image relation. Finally, we share our opinions about the future research directions for label-efficient deep image segmentation.

- **Summary**: We present a motion segmentation guided convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for high dynamic range (HDR) image deghosting. First, we segment the moving regions in the input sequence using a CNN. Then, we merge static and moving regions separately with different fusion networks and combine fused features to generate the final ghost-free HDR image. Our motion segmentation guided HDR fusion approach offers significant advantages over existing HDR deghosting methods. First, by segmenting the input sequence into static and moving regions, our proposed approach learns effective fusion rules for various challenging saturation and motion types. Second, we introduce a novel memory network that accumulates the necessary features required to generate plausible details in the saturated regions. The proposed method outperforms nine existing state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets and generates visually pleasing ghost-free HDR results. We also present a large-scale motion segmentation dataset of 3683 varying exposure images to benefit the research community.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been broadly utilized to improve the models' adaptation ability in general computer vision. However, different from the natural images, there exist huge semantic gaps for the nuclei from different categories in histopathology images. It is still under-explored how could we build generalized UDA models for precise segmentation or classification of nuclei instances across different datasets. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network, namely Category-Aware feature alignment and Pseudo-Labelling Network (CAPL-Net) for UDA nuclei instance segmentation and classification. Specifically, we first propose a category-level feature alignment module with dynamic learnable trade-off weights. Second, we propose to facilitate the model performance on the target data via self-supervised training with pseudo labels based on nuclei-level prototype features. Comprehensive experiments on cross-domain nuclei instance segmentation and classification tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods with a remarkable margin.

- **Summary**: Scene segmentation and classification (SSC) serve as a critical step towards the field of video structuring analysis. Intuitively, jointly learning of these two tasks can promote each other by sharing common information. However, scene segmentation concerns more on the local difference between adjacent shots while classification needs the global representation of scene segments, which probably leads to the model dominated by one of the two tasks in the training phase. In this paper, from an alternate perspective to overcome the above challenges, we unite these two tasks into one task by a new form of predicting shots link: a link connects two adjacent shots, indicating that they belong to the same scene or category. To the end, we propose a general One Stage Multimodal Sequential Link Framework (OS-MSL) to both distinguish and leverage the two-fold semantics by reforming the two learning tasks into a unified one. Furthermore, we tailor a specific module called DiffCorrNet to explicitly extract the information of differences and correlations among shots. Extensive experiments on a brand-new large scale dataset collected from real-world applications, and MovieScenes are conducted. Both the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method against strong baselines.

- **Summary**: Existing optical flow estimators usually employ the network architectures typically designed for image classification as the encoder to extract per-pixel features. However, due to the natural difference between the tasks, the architectures designed for image classification may be sub-optimal for flow estimation. To address this issue, we propose a neural architecture search method named FlowNAS to automatically find the better encoder architecture for flow estimation task. We first design a suitable search space including various convolutional operators and construct a weight-sharing super-network for efficiently evaluating the candidate architectures. Then, for better training the super-network, we propose Feature Alignment Distillation, which utilizes a well-trained flow estimator to guide the training of super-network. Finally, a resource-constrained evolutionary algorithm is exploited to find an optimal architecture (i.e., sub-network). Experimental results show that the discovered architecture with the weights inherited from the super-network achieves 4.67\% F1-all error on KITTI, an 8.4\% reduction of RAFT baseline, surpassing state-of-the-art handcrafted models GMA and AGFlow, while reducing the model complexity and latency. The source code and trained models will be released in https://github.com/VDIGPKU/FlowNAS.

- **Summary**: Reliable automatic classification of colonoscopy images is of great significance in assessing the stage of colonic lesions and formulating appropriate treatment plans. However, it is challenging due to uneven brightness, location variability, inter-class similarity, and intra-class dissimilarity, affecting the classification accuracy. To address the above issues, we propose a Fourier-based Frequency Complex Network (FFCNet) for colon disease classification in this study. Specifically, FFCNet is a novel complex network that enables the combination of complex convolutional networks with frequency learning to overcome the loss of phase information caused by real convolution operations. Also, our Fourier transform transfers the average brightness of an image to a point in the spectrum (the DC component), alleviating the effects of uneven brightness by decoupling image content and brightness. Moreover, the image patch scrambling module in FFCNet generates random local spectral blocks, empowering the network to learn long-range and local diseasespecific features and improving the discriminative ability of hard samples. We evaluated the proposed FFCNet on an in-house dataset with 2568 colonoscopy images, showing our method achieves high performance outperforming previous state-of-the art methods with an accuracy of 86:35% and an accuracy of 4.46% higher than the backbone.

- **Summary**: Having access to accurate game state information is of utmost importance for any artificial intelligence task including game-playing, testing, player modeling, and procedural content generation. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques have shown to be capable of inferring accurate game state information from the high-dimensional pixel input of game footage into compressed latent representations. Contrastive Learning is a popular SSL paradigm where the visual understanding of the game's images comes from contrasting dissimilar and similar game states defined by simple image augmentation methods. In this study, we introduce a new game scene augmentation technique -- named GameCLR -- that takes advantage of the game-engine to define and synthesize specific, highly-controlled renderings of different game states, thereby, boosting contrastive learning performance. We test our GameCLR technique on images of the CARLA driving simulator environment and compare it against the popular SimCLR baseline SSL method. Our results suggest that GameCLR can infer the game's state information from game footage more accurately compared to the baseline. Our proposed approach allows us to conduct game artificial intelligence research by directly utilizing screen pixels as input.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore a novel and ambitious knowledge-transfer task, termed Knowledge Factorization~(KF). The core idea of KF lies in the modularization and assemblability of knowledge: given a pretrained network model as input, KF aims to decompose it into several factor networks, each of which handles only a dedicated task and maintains task-specific knowledge factorized from the source network. Such factor networks are task-wise disentangled and can be directly assembled, without any fine-tuning, to produce the more competent combined-task networks. In other words, the factor networks serve as Lego-brick-like building blocks, allowing us to construct customized networks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, each factor network comprises two modules, a common-knowledge module that is task-agnostic and shared by all factor networks, alongside with a task-specific module dedicated to the factor network itself. We introduce an information-theoretic objective, InfoMax-Bottleneck~(IMB), to carry out KF by optimizing the mutual information between the learned representations and input. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that, the derived factor networks yield gratifying performances on not only the dedicated tasks but also disentanglement, while enjoying much better interpretability and modularity. Moreover, the learned common-knowledge representations give rise to impressive results on transfer learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Adamdad/KnowledgeFactor.

- **Summary**: In this work we present our real-time egocentric body segmentation algorithm. Our algorithm achieves a frame rate of 66 fps for an input resolution of 640x480, thanks to our shallow network inspired in Thundernet's architecture. Besides, we put a strong emphasis on the variability of the training data. More concretely, we describe the creation process of our Egocentric Bodies (EgoBodies) dataset, composed of almost 10,000 images from three datasets, created both from synthetic methods and real capturing. We conduct experiments to understand the contribution of the individual datasets; compare Thundernet model trained with EgoBodies with simpler and more complex previous approaches and discuss their corresponding performance in a real-life setup in terms of segmentation quality and inference times. The described trained semantic segmentation algorithm is already integrated in an end-to-end system for Mixed Reality (MR), making it possible for users to see his/her own body while being immersed in a MR scene.

- **Summary**: Transferring knowledge from task-agnostic pre-trained deep models for downstream tasks is an important topic in computer vision research. Along with the growth of computational capacity, we now have open-source vision-language pre-trained models in large scales of the model architecture and amount of data. In this study, we focus on transferring knowledge for video classification tasks. Conventional methods randomly initialize the linear classifier head for vision classification, but they leave the usage of the text encoder for downstream visual recognition tasks undiscovered. In this paper, we revise the role of the linear classifier and replace the classifier with the different knowledge from pre-trained model. We utilize the well-pretrained language model to generate good semantic target for efficient transferring learning. The empirical study shows that our method improves both the performance and the training speed of video classification, with a negligible change in the model. Our simple yet effective tuning paradigm achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficient training on various video recognition scenarios, i.e., zero-shot, few-shot, general recognition. In particular, our paradigm achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 87.8% on Kinetics-400, and also surpasses previous methods by 20~50% absolute top-1 accuracy under zero-shot, few-shot settings on five popular video datasets.

- **Summary**: Understanding the internal physiological changes accompanying the aging process is an important aspect of medical image interpretation, with the expected changes acting as a baseline when reporting abnormal findings. Deep learning has recently been demonstrated to allow the accurate estimation of patient age from chest X-rays, and shows potential as a health indicator and mortality predictor. In this paper we present a novel comparative study of the relative performance of radiologists versus state-of-the-art deep learning models on two tasks: (a) patient age estimation from a single chest X-ray, and (b) ranking of two time-separated images of the same patient by age. We train our models with a heterogeneous database of 1.8M chest X-rays with ground truth patient ages and investigate the limitations on model accuracy imposed by limited training data and image resolution, and demonstrate generalisation performance on public data. To explore the large performance gap between the models and humans on these age-prediction tasks compared with other radiological reporting tasks seen in the literature, we incorporate our age prediction model into a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) allowing visualisation of the semantic features identified by the prediction model as significant to age prediction, comparing the identified features with those relied on by clinicians.

- **Summary**: Recent works on image harmonization solve the problem as a pixel-wise image translation task via large autoencoders. They have unsatisfactory performances and slow inference speeds when dealing with high-resolution images. In this work, we observe that adjusting the input arguments of basic image filters, e.g., brightness and contrast, is sufficient for humans to produce realistic images from the composite ones. Hence, we frame image harmonization as an image-level regression problem to learn the arguments of the filters that humans use for the task. We present a Harmonizer framework for image harmonization. Unlike prior methods that are based on black-box autoencoders, Harmonizer contains a neural network for filter argument prediction and several white-box filters (based on the predicted arguments) for image harmonization. We also introduce a cascade regressor and a dynamic loss strategy for Harmonizer to learn filter arguments more stably and precisely. Since our network only outputs image-level arguments and the filters we used are efficient, Harmonizer is much lighter and faster than existing methods. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Harmonizer surpasses existing methods notably, especially with high-resolution inputs. Finally, we apply Harmonizer to video harmonization, which achieves consistent results across frames and 56 fps at 1080P resolution.

- **Summary**: The traceability of granite blocks consists in identifying each block with a finite number of color bands which represent a numerical code. This code has to be read several times throughout the manufacturing process, but its accuracy is subject to human errors, leading to cause faults in the traceability system. A computer vision system is presented to address this problem through color detection and the decryption of the associated code. The system developed makes use of color space transformations, and several thresholds for the isolation of the colors. Computer vision methods are implemented, along with contour detection procedures for color identification. Lastly, the analysis of geometrical features is used to decrypt the color code captured. The proposed algorithm is trained on a set of 109 pictures taken in different environmental conditions and validated on a set of 21 images. The outcome shows promising results with an accuracy rate of 75.00% in the validation process.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to predict unseen classes whose samples have never appeared during training. One of the most effective and widely used semantic information for zero-shot image classification are attributes which are annotations for class-level visual characteristics. However, the current methods often fail to discriminate those subtle visual distinctions between images due to not only the shortage of fine-grained annotations, but also the attribute imbalance and co-occurrence. In this paper, we present a transformer-based end-to-end ZSL method named DUET, which integrates latent semantic knowledge from the pre-trained language models (PLMs) via a self-supervised multi-modal learning paradigm. Specifically, we (1) developed a cross-modal semantic grounding network to investigate the model's capability of disentangling semantic attributes from the images; (2) applied an attribute-level contrastive learning strategy to further enhance the model's discrimination on fine-grained visual characteristics against the attribute co-occurrence and imbalance; (3) proposed a multi-task learning policy for considering multi-model objectives. We find that our DUET can achieve state-of-the-art performance on three standard ZSL benchmarks and a knowledge graph equipped ZSL benchmark. Its components are effective and its predictions are interpretable.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation on driving-scene images is vital for autonomous driving. Although encouraging performance has been achieved on daytime images, the performance on nighttime images are less satisfactory due to the insufficient exposure and the lack of labeled data. To address these issues, we present an add-on module called dual image-adaptive learnable filters (DIAL-Filters) to improve the semantic segmentation in nighttime driving conditions, aiming at exploiting the intrinsic features of driving-scene images under different illuminations. DIAL-Filters consist of two parts, including an image-adaptive processing module (IAPM) and a learnable guided filter (LGF). With DIAL-Filters, we design both unsupervised and supervised frameworks for nighttime driving-scene segmentation, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the IAPM module consists of a small convolutional neural network with a set of differentiable image filters, where each image can be adaptively enhanced for better segmentation with respect to the different illuminations. The LGF is employed to enhance the output of segmentation network to get the final segmentation result. The DIAL-Filters are light-weight and efficient and they can be readily applied for both daytime and nighttime images. Our experiments show that DAIL-Filters can significantly improve the supervised segmentation performance on ACDC_Night and NightCity datasets, while it demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised nighttime semantic segmentation on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving testbeds.

- **Summary**: In this report, we propose a video-language pretraining (VLP) based solution \cite{kevin2022egovlp} for the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Multi-Instance Retrieval (MIR) challenge. Especially, we exploit the recently released Ego4D dataset \cite{grauman2021ego4d} to pioneer Egocentric VLP from pretraining dataset, pretraining objective, and development set. Based on the above three designs, we develop a pretrained video-language model that is able to transfer its egocentric video-text representation to MIR benchmark. Furthermore, we devise an adaptive multi-instance max-margin loss to effectively fine-tune the model and equip the dual-softmax technique for reliable inference. Our best single model obtains strong performance on the challenge test set with 47.39% mAP and 61.44% nDCG. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/EgoVLP.

- **Summary**: We present a new solution to the fine-grained retrieval of clean CAD models from a large-scale database in order to recover detailed object shape geometries for RGBD scans. Unlike previous work simply indexing into a moderately small database using an object shape descriptor and accepting the top retrieval result, we argue that in the case of a large-scale database a more accurate model may be found within a neighborhood of the descriptor. More importantly, we propose that the distinctiveness deficiency of shape descriptors at the instance level can be compensated by a geometry-based re-ranking of its neighborhood. Our approach first leverages the discriminative power of learned representations to distinguish between different categories of models and then uses a novel robust point set distance metric to re-rank the CAD neighborhood, enabling fine-grained retrieval in a large shape database. Evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that our geometry-based re-ranking is a conceptually simple but highly effective method that can lead to a significant improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Generally pre-training and long-time training computation are necessary for obtaining a good-performance text detector based on deep networks. In this paper, we present a new scene text detection network (called FANet) with a Fast convergence speed and Accurate text localization. The proposed FANet is an end-to-end text detector based on transformer feature learning and normalized Fourier descriptor modeling, where the Fourier Descriptor Proposal Network and Iterative Text Decoding Network are designed to efficiently and accurately identify text proposals. Additionally, a Dense Matching Strategy and a well-designed loss function are also proposed for optimizing the network performance. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed FANet can achieve the SOTA performance with fewer training epochs and no pre-training. When we introduce additional data for pre-training, the proposed FANet can achieve SOTA performance on MSRATD500, CTW1500 and TotalText. The ablation experiments also verify the effectiveness of our contributions.

- **Summary**: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and become a health crisis faced by humanity since first reported. Radiology imaging technologies such as computer tomography (CT) and chest X-ray imaging (CXR) are effective tools for diagnosing COVID-19. However, in CT and CXR images, the infected area occupies only a small part of the image. Some common deep learning methods that integrate large-scale receptive fields may cause the loss of image detail, resulting in the omission of the region of interest (ROI) in COVID-19 images and are therefore not suitable for further processing. To this end, we propose a deep spatial pyramid pooling (D-SPP) module to integrate contextual information over different resolutions, aiming to extract information under different scales of COVID-19 images effectively. Besides, we propose a COVID-19 infection detection (CID) module to draw attention to the lesion area and remove interference from irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on four CT and CXR datasets have shown that our method produces higher accuracy of detecting COVID-19 lesions in CT and CXR images. It can be used as a computer-aided diagnosis tool to help doctors effectively diagnose and screen for COVID-19.

- **Summary**: To facilitate video denoising research, we construct a compelling dataset, namely, "Practical Video Denoising Dataset" (PVDD), containing 200 noisy-clean dynamic video pairs in both sRGB and RAW format. Compared with existing datasets consisting of limited motion information, PVDD covers dynamic scenes with varying and natural motion. Different from datasets using primarily Gaussian or Poisson distributions to synthesize noise in the sRGB domain, PVDD synthesizes realistic noise from the RAW domain with a physically meaningful sensor noise model followed by ISP processing. Moreover, we also propose a new video denoising framework, called Recurrent Video Denoising Transformer (RVDT), which can achieve SOTA performance on PVDD and other current video denoising benchmarks. RVDT consists of both spatial and temporal transformer blocks to conduct denoising with long-range operations on the spatial dimension and long-term propagation on the temporal dimension. Especially, RVDT exploits the attention mechanism to implement the bi-directional feature propagation with both implicit and explicit temporal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) models trained on PVDD achieve superior denoising performance on many challenging real-world videos than on models trained on other existing datasets; 2) trained on the same dataset, our proposed RVDT can have better denoising performance than other types of networks.

- **Summary**: We propose a concise representation of videos that encode perceptually meaningful features into graphs. With this representation, we aim to leverage the large amount of redundancies in videos and save computations. First, we construct superpixel-based graph representations of videos by considering superpixels as graph nodes and create spatial and temporal connections between adjacent superpixels. Then, we leverage Graph Convolutional Networks to process this representation and predict the desired output. As a result, we are able to train models with much fewer parameters, which translates into short training periods and a reduction in computation resource requirements. A comprehensive experimental study on the publicly available datasets Kinetics-400 and Charades shows that the proposed method is highly cost-effective and uses limited commodity hardware during training and inference. It reduces the computational requirements 10-fold while achieving results that are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We believe that the proposed approach is a promising direction that could open the door to solving video understanding more efficiently and enable more resource limited users to thrive in this research field.

  (CVPR), 2022
- **Summary**: Recognizing discriminative details such as eyes and beaks is important for distinguishing fine-grained classes since they have similar overall appearances. In this regard, we introduce Task Discrepancy Maximization (TDM), a simple module for fine-grained few-shot classification. Our objective is to localize the class-wise discriminative regions by highlighting channels encoding distinct information of the class. Specifically, TDM learns task-specific channel weights based on two novel components: Support Attention Module (SAM) and Query Attention Module (QAM). SAM produces a support weight to represent channel-wise discriminative power for each class. Still, since the SAM is basically only based on the labeled support sets, it can be vulnerable to bias toward such support set. Therefore, we propose QAM which complements SAM by yielding a query weight that grants more weight to object-relevant channels for a given query image. By combining these two weights, a class-wise task-specific channel weight is defined. The weights are then applied to produce task-adaptive feature maps more focusing on the discriminative details. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of TDM and its complementary benefits with prior methods in fine-grained few-shot classification.

- **Summary**: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly prevalent and requires clinical specialists to diagnose. It is known that an individual's viewing behavior, reflected in their eye movements, is directly related to attentional mechanisms and higher-order cognitive processes. We therefore explore whether ADHD can be detected based on recorded eye movements together with information about the video stimulus in a free-viewing task. To this end, we develop an end-to-end deep learning-based sequence model which we pre-train on a related task for which more data are available. We find that the method is in fact able to detect ADHD and outperforms relevant baselines. We investigate the relevance of the input features in an ablation study. Interestingly, we find that the model's performance is closely related to the content of the video, which provides insights for future experimental designs.

- **Summary**: While fine-tuning pre-trained networks has become a popular way to train image segmentation models, such backbone networks for image segmentation are frequently pre-trained using image classification source datasets, e.g., ImageNet. Though image classification datasets could provide the backbone networks with rich visual features and discriminative ability, they are incapable of fully pre-training the target model (i.e., backbone+segmentation modules) in an end-to-end manner. The segmentation modules are left to random initialization in the fine-tuning process due to the lack of segmentation labels in classification datasets. In our work, we propose a method that leverages Pseudo Semantic Segmentation Labels (PSSL), to enable the end-to-end pre-training for image segmentation models based on classification datasets. PSSL was inspired by the observation that the explanation results of classification models, obtained through explanation algorithms such as CAM, SmoothGrad and LIME, would be close to the pixel clusters of visual objects. Specifically, PSSL is obtained for each image by interpreting the classification results and aggregating an ensemble of explanations queried from multiple classifiers to lower the bias caused by single models. With PSSL for every image of ImageNet, the proposed method leverages a weighted segmentation learning procedure to pre-train the segmentation network en masse. Experiment results show that, with ImageNet accompanied by PSSL as the source dataset, the proposed end-to-end pre-training strategy successfully boosts the performance of various segmentation models, i.e., PSPNet-ResNet50, DeepLabV3-ResNet50, and OCRNet-HRNetW18, on a number of segmentation tasks, such as CamVid, VOC-A, VOC-C, ADE20K, and CityScapes, with significant improvements.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently emerged as a new generation of low-power deep neural networks, which is suitable to be implemented on low-power mobile/edge devices. As such devices have limited memory storage, neural pruning on SNNs has been widely explored in recent years. Most existing SNN pruning works focus on shallow SNNs (2~6 layers), however, deeper SNNs (>16 layers) are proposed by state-of-the-art SNN works, which is difficult to be compatible with the current SNN pruning work. To scale up a pruning technique towards deep SNNs, we investigate Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) which states that dense networks contain smaller subnetworks (i.e., winning tickets) that achieve comparable performance to the dense networks. Our studies on LTH reveal that the winning tickets consistently exist in deep SNNs across various datasets and architectures, providing up to 97% sparsity without huge performance degradation. However, the iterative searching process of LTH brings a huge training computational cost when combined with the multiple timesteps of SNNs. To alleviate such heavy searching cost, we propose Early-Time (ET) ticket where we find the important weight connectivity from a smaller number of timesteps. The proposed ET ticket can be seamlessly combined with a common pruning techniques for finding winning tickets, such as Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) and Early-Bird (EB) tickets. Our experiment results show that the proposed ET ticket reduces search time by up to 38% compared to IMP or EB methods. Code is available at Github.

- **Summary**: Generative model-based motion prediction techniques have recently realized predicting controlled human motions, such as predicting multiple upper human body motions with similar lower-body motions. However, to achieve this, the state-of-the-art methods require either subsequently learning mapping functions to seek similar motions or training the model repetitively to enable control over the desired portion of body. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn disentangled representations for controllable human motion prediction. Our network involves a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) architecture to model full-body human motion, and an extra CVAE path to learn only the corresponding partial-body (e.g., lower-body) motion. Specifically, the inductive bias imposed by the extra CVAE path encourages two latent variables in two paths to respectively govern separate representations for each partial-body motion. With a single training, our model is able to provide two types of controls for the generated human motions: (i) strictly controlling one portion of human body and (ii) adaptively controlling the other portion, by sampling from a pair of latent spaces. Additionally, we extend and adapt a sampling strategy to our trained model to diversify the controllable predictions. Our framework also potentially allows new forms of control by flexibly customizing the input for the extra CVAE path. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach is capable of predicting state-of-the-art controllable human motions both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Data has become the most valuable resource in today's world. With the massive proliferation of data-driven algorithms, such as deep learning-based approaches, the availability of data is of great interest. In this context, high-quality training, validation and testing datasets are particularly needed. Volumetric data is a very important resource in medicine, as it ranges from disease diagnoses to therapy monitoring. When the dataset is sufficient, models can be trained to help doctors with these tasks. Unfortunately, there are scenarios and applications where large amounts of data is unavailable. For example, in the medical field, rare diseases and privacy issues can lead to restricted data availability. In non-medical fields, the high cost of obtaining a sufficient amount of high-quality data can also be a concern. A solution to these problems can be the generation of synthetic data to perform data augmentation in combination with other more traditional methods of data augmentation. Therefore, most of the publications on 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are within the medical domain. The existence of mechanisms to generate realistic synthetic data is a good asset to overcome this challenge, especially in healthcare, as the data must be of good quality and close to reality, i.e. realistic, and without privacy issues. In this review, we provide a summary of works that generate realistic 3D synthetic data using GANs. We therefore outline GAN-based methods in these areas with common architectures, advantages and disadvantages. We present a novel taxonomy, evaluations, challenges and research opportunities to provide a holistic overview of the current state of GANs in medicine and other fields.

- **Summary**: Neural network quantization aims to transform high-precision weights and activations of a given neural network into low-precision weights/activations for reduced memory usage and computation, while preserving the performance of the original model. However, extreme quantization (1-bit weight/1-bit activations) of compactly-designed backbone architectures (e.g., MobileNets) often used for edge-device deployments results in severe performance degeneration. This paper proposes a novel Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that can effectively alleviate performance degeneration even with extreme quantization by focusing on the inter-weight dependencies, between the weights within each layer and across consecutive layers. To minimize the quantization impact of each weight on others, we perform an orthonormal transformation of the weights at each layer by training an input-dependent correlation matrix and importance vector, such that each weight is disentangled from the others. Then, we quantize the weights based on their importance to minimize the loss of the information from the original weights/activations. We further perform progressive layer-wise quantization from the bottom layer to the top, so that quantization at each layer reflects the quantized distributions of weights and activations at previous layers. We validate the effectiveness of our method on various benchmark datasets against strong neural quantization baselines, demonstrating that it alleviates the performance degeneration on ImageNet and successfully preserves the full-precision model performance on CIFAR-100 with compact backbone networks.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have shown remarkable progress in GANs based on implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that produces an RGB value given its (x, y) coordinate. They represent an image as a continuous version of the underlying 2D signal instead of a 2D array of pixels, which opens new horizons for GAN applications (e.g., zero-shot super-resolution, image outpainting). However, training existing approaches require a heavy computational cost proportional to the image resolution, since they compute an MLP operation for every (x, y) coordinate. To alleviate this issue, we propose a multi-stage patch-based training, a novel and scalable approach that can train INR-based GANs with a flexible computational cost regardless of the image resolution. Specifically, our method allows to generate and discriminate by patch to learn the local details of the image and learn global structural information by a novel reconstruction loss to enable efficient GAN training. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances baseline models in GPU memory while maintaining FIDs at a reasonable level.

- **Summary**: Recent studies show deep neural networks (DNNs) are extremely vulnerable to the elaborately designed adversarial examples. Adversarial learning with those adversarial examples has been proved as one of the most effective methods to defend against such an attack. At present, most existing adversarial examples generation methods are based on first-order gradients, which can hardly further improve models' robustness, especially when facing second-order adversarial attacks. Compared with first-order gradients, second-order gradients provide a more accurate approximation of the loss landscape with respect to natural examples. Inspired by this, our work crafts second-order adversarial examples and uses them to train DNNs. Nevertheless, second-order optimization involves time-consuming calculation for Hessian-inverse. We propose an approximation method through transforming the problem into an optimization in the Krylov subspace, which remarkably reduce the computational complexity to speed up the training procedure. Extensive experiments conducted on the MINIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that our adversarial learning with second-order adversarial examples outperforms other fisrt-order methods, which can improve the model robustness against a wide range of attacks.

- **Summary**: We have seen a great progress in video action recognition in recent years. There are several models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and some recent transformer based approaches which provide top performance on existing benchmarks. In this work, we perform a large-scale robustness analysis of these existing models for video action recognition. We focus on robustness against real-world distribution shift perturbations instead of adversarial perturbations. We propose four different benchmark datasets, HMDB51-P, UCF101-P, Kinetics400-P, and SSv2-P to perform this analysis. We study robustness of six state-of-the-art action recognition models against 90 different perturbations. The study reveals some interesting findings, 1) transformer based models are consistently more robust compared to CNN based models, 2) Pretraining improves robustness for Transformer based models more than CNN based models, and 3) All of the studied models are robust to temporal perturbations for all datasets but SSv2; suggesting the importance of temporal information for action recognition varies based on the dataset and activities. Next, we study the role of augmentations in model robustness and present a real-world dataset, UCF101-DS, which contains realistic distribution shifts, to further validate some of these findings. We believe this study will serve as a benchmark for future research in robust video action recognition.

- **Summary**: Event cameras have recently gained in popularity as they hold strong potential to complement regular cameras in situations of high dynamics or challenging illumination. An important problem that may benefit from the addition of an event camera is given by Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). However, in order to ensure progress on event-inclusive multi-sensor SLAM, novel benchmark sequences are needed. Our contribution is the first complete set of benchmark datasets captured with a multi-sensor setup containing an event-based stereo camera, a regular stereo camera, multiple depth sensors, and an inertial measurement unit. The setup is fully hardware-synchronized and underwent accurate extrinsic calibration. All sequences come with ground truth data captured by highly accurate external reference devices such as a motion capture system. Individual sequences include both small and large-scale environments, and cover the specific challenges targeted by dynamic vision sensors.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision applications. However, these models have considerable storage and computational overheads, making their deployment and efficient inference on edge devices challenging. Quantization is a promising approach to reducing model complexity, and the dyadic arithmetic pipeline can allow the quantized models to perform efficient integer-only inference. Unfortunately, dyadic arithmetic is based on the homogeneity condition in convolutional neural networks, which is not applicable to the non-linear components in ViTs, making integer-only inference of ViTs an open issue. In this paper, we propose I-ViT, an integer-only quantization scheme for ViTs, to enable ViTs to perform the entire computational graph of inference with integer arithmetic and bit-shifting, and without any floating-point arithmetic. In I-ViT, linear operations (e.g., MatMul and Dense) follow the integer-only pipeline with dyadic arithmetic, and non-linear operations (e.g., Softmax, GELU, and LayerNorm) are approximated by the proposed light-weight integer-only arithmetic methods. More specifically, I-ViT applies the proposed Shiftmax and ShiftGELU, which are designed to use integer bit-shifting to approximate the corresponding floating-point operations. We evaluate I-ViT on various benchmark models and the results show that integer-only INT8 quantization achieves comparable (or even slightly higher) accuracy to the full-precision (FP) baseline. Furthermore, we utilize TVM for practical hardware deployment on the GPU's integer arithmetic units, achieving 3.72$\sim$4.11$\times$ inference speedup compared to the FP model. Code of both Pytorch and TVM is released at https://github.com/zkkli/I-ViT.

- **Summary**: This work presents a novel method for predicting vehicle trajectories in highway scenarios using efficient bird's eye view representations and convolutional neural networks. Vehicle positions, motion histories, road configuration, and vehicle interactions are easily included in the prediction model using basic visual representations. The U-net model has been selected as the prediction kernel to generate future visual representations of the scene using an image-to-image regression approach. A method has been implemented to extract vehicle positions from the generated graphical representations to achieve subpixel resolution. The method has been trained and evaluated using the PREVENTION dataset, an on-board sensor dataset. Different network configurations and scene representations have been evaluated. This study found that U-net with 6 depth levels using a linear terminal layer and a Gaussian representation of the vehicles is the best performing configuration. The use of lane markings was found to produce no improvement in prediction performance. The average prediction error is 0.47 and 0.38 meters and the final prediction error is 0.76 and 0.53 meters for longitudinal and lateral coordinates, respectively, for a predicted trajectory length of 2.0 seconds. The prediction error is up to 50% lower compared to the baseline method.

- **Summary**: Time-lapse image sequences offer visually compelling insights into dynamic processes that are too slow to observe in real time. However, playing a long time-lapse sequence back as a video often results in distracting flicker due to random effects, such as weather, as well as cyclic effects, such as the day-night cycle. We introduce the problem of disentangling time-lapse sequences in a way that allows separate, after-the-fact control of overall trends, cyclic effects, and random effects in the images, and describe a technique based on data-driven generative models that achieves this goal. This enables us to "re-render" the sequences in ways that would not be possible with the input images alone. For example, we can stabilize a long sequence to focus on plant growth over many months, under selectable, consistent weather.   Our approach is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) that are conditioned with the time coordinate of the time-lapse sequence. Our architecture and training procedure are designed so that the networks learn to model random variations, such as weather, using the GAN's latent space, and to disentangle overall trends and cyclic variations by feeding the conditioning time label to the model using Fourier features with specific frequencies.   We show that our models are robust to defects in the training data, enabling us to amend some of the practical difficulties in capturing long time-lapse sequences, such as temporary occlusions, uneven frame spacing, and missing frames.

- **Summary**: The contextual information is critical for various computer vision tasks, previous works commonly design plug-and-play modules and structural losses to effectively extract and aggregate the global context. These methods utilize fine-label to optimize the model but ignore that fine-trained features are also precious training resources, which can introduce preferable distribution to hard pixels (i.e., misclassified pixels). Inspired by contrastive learning in unsupervised paradigm, we apply the contrastive loss in a supervised manner and re-design the loss function to cast off the stereotype of unsupervised learning (e.g., imbalance of positives and negatives, confusion of anchors computing). To this end, we propose Positive-Negative Equal contrastive loss (PNE loss), which increases the latent impact of positive embedding on the anchor and treats the positive as well as negative sample pairs equally. The PNE loss can be directly plugged right into existing semantic segmentation frameworks and leads to excellent performance with neglectable extra computational costs. We utilize a number of classic segmentation methods (e.g., DeepLabV3, HRNetV2, OCRNet, UperNet) and backbone (e.g., ResNet, HRNet, Swin Transformer) to conduct comprehensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets (e.g., Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff and ADE20K). Our code will be publicly available soon.

- **Summary**: Intestinal parasitic infections, as a leading causes of morbidity worldwide, still lacks time-saving, high-sensitivity and user-friendly examination method. The development of deep learning technique reveals its broad application potential in biological image. In this paper, we apply several object detectors such as YOLOv5 and variant cascadeRCNNs to automatically discriminate parasitic eggs in microscope images. Through specially-designed optimization including raw data augmentation, model ensemble, transfer learning and test time augmentation, our model achieves excellent performance on challenge dataset. In addition, our model trained with added noise gains a high robustness against polluted input, which further broaden its applicability in practice.



### Dynamic Contrastive Distillation for Image-Text Retrieval

- **Summary**: Although the vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) equipped cross-modal image-text retrieval (ITR) has achieved remarkable progress in the past two years, it suffers from a major drawback: the ever-increasing size of VLP models restricts its deployment to real-world search scenarios (where the high latency is unacceptable). To alleviate this problem, we present a novel plug-in dynamic contrastive distillation (DCD) framework to compress the large VLP models for the ITR task. Technically, we face the following two challenges: 1) the typical uni-modal metric learning approach is difficult to directly apply to the cross-modal tasks, due to the limited GPU memory to optimize too many negative samples during handling cross-modal fusion features. 2) it is inefficient to static optimize the student network from different hard samples, which have different effects on distillation learning and student network optimization. We try to overcome these challenges from two points. First, to achieve multi-modal contrastive learning, and balance the training costs and effects, we propose to use a teacher network to estimate the difficult samples for students, making the students absorb the powerful knowledge from pre-trained teachers, and master the knowledge from hard samples. Second, to dynamic learn from hard sample pairs, we propose dynamic distillation to dynamically learn samples of different difficulties, from the perspective of better balancing the difficulty of knowledge and students' self-learning ability. We successfully apply our proposed DCD strategy to two state-of-the-art vision-language pretrained models, i.e. ViLT and METER. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our DCD framework. Encouragingly, we can speed up the inference at least 129$\times$ compared to the existing ITR models.

- **Summary**: Successful data representation is a fundamental factor in machine learning based medical imaging analysis. Deep Learning (DL) has taken an essential role in robust representation learning. However, the inability of deep models to generalize to unseen data can quickly overfit intricate patterns. Thereby, we can conveniently implement strategies to aid deep models in discovering useful priors from data to learn their intrinsic properties. Our model, which we call a dual role network (DRN), uses a dependency maximization approach based on Least Squared Mutual Information (LSMI). The LSMI leverages dependency measures to ensure representation invariance and local smoothness. While prior works have used information theory measures like mutual information, known to be computationally expensive due to a density estimation step, our LSMI formulation alleviates the issues of intractable mutual information estimation and can be used to approximate it. Experiments on CT based COVID-19 Detection and COVID-19 Severity Detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Current methods for LIDAR semantic segmentation are not robust enough for real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving, since it is closed-set and static. The closed-set assumption makes the network only able to output labels of trained classes, even for objects never seen before, while a static network cannot update its knowledge base according to what it has seen. Therefore, in this work, we propose the open-world semantic segmentation task for LIDAR point clouds, which aims to 1) identify both old and novel classes using open-set semantic segmentation, and 2) gradually incorporate novel objects into the existing knowledge base using incremental learning without forgetting old classes. For this purpose, we propose a REdundAncy cLassifier (REAL) framework to provide a general architecture for both the open-set semantic segmentation and incremental learning problems. The experimental results show that REAL can simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance in the open-set semantic segmentation task on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets, and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem with a large margin during incremental learning.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation in cataract surgery has a wide range of applications contributing to surgical outcome enhancement and clinical risk reduction. However, the varying issues in segmenting the different relevant structures in these surgeries make the designation of a unique network quite challenging. This paper proposes a semantic segmentation network, termed DeepPyramid, that can deal with these challenges using three novelties: (1) a Pyramid View Fusion module which provides a varying-angle global view of the surrounding region centering at each pixel position in the input convolutional feature map; (2) a Deformable Pyramid Reception module which enables a wide deformable receptive field that can adapt to geometric transformations in the object of interest; and (3) a dedicated Pyramid Loss that adaptively supervises multi-scale semantic feature maps. Combined, we show that these modules can effectively boost semantic segmentation performance, especially in the case of transparency, deformability, scalability, and blunt edges in objects. We demonstrate that our approach performs at a state-of-the-art level and outperforms a number of existing methods with a large margin (3.66% overall improvement in intersection over union compared to the best rival approach).

- **Summary**: Most anomaly detection (AD) models are learned using only normal samples in an unsupervised way, which may result in ambiguous decision boundary and insufficient discriminability. In fact, a few anomaly samples are often available in real-world applications, the valuable knowledge of known anomalies should also be effectively exploited. However, utilizing a few known anomalies during training may cause another issue that the model may be biased by those known anomalies and fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. In this paper, we tackle supervised anomaly detection, i.e., we learn AD models using a few available anomalies with the objective to detect both the seen and unseen anomalies. We propose a novel explicit boundary guided semi-push-pull contrastive learning mechanism, which can enhance model's discriminability while mitigating the bias issue. Our approach is based on two core designs: First, we find an explicit and compact separating boundary as the guidance for further feature learning. As the boundary only relies on the normal feature distribution, the bias problem caused by a few known anomalies can be alleviated. Second, a boundary guided semi-push-pull loss is developed to only pull the normal features together while pushing the abnormal features apart from the separating boundary beyond a certain margin region. In this way, our model can form a more explicit and discriminative decision boundary to distinguish known and also unseen anomalies from normal samples more effectively.

- **Summary**: We formulate a physics-informed compressed sensing (PICS) method for the reconstruction of velocity fields from noisy and sparse phase-contrast magnetic resonance signals. The method solves an inverse Navier-Stokes boundary value problem, which permits us to jointly reconstruct and segment the velocity field, and at the same time infer hidden quantities such as the hydrodynamic pressure and the wall shear stress. Using a Bayesian framework, we regularize the problem by introducing a priori information about the unknown parameters in the form of Gaussian random fields. This prior information is updated using the Navier-Stokes problem, an energy-based segmentation functional, and by requiring that the reconstruction is consistent with the $k$-space signals. We create an algorithm that solves this reconstruction problem, and test it for noisy and sparse $k$-space signals of the flow through a converging nozzle. We find that the method is capable of reconstructing and segmenting the velocity fields from sparsely-sampled (15% $k$-space coverage), low ($\sim$$10$) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, and that the reconstructed velocity field compares well with that derived from fully-sampled (100% $k$-space coverage) high ($>40$) SNR signals of the same flow.

- **Summary**: Tumor segmentation is a fundamental step for radiotherapy treatment planning. To define an accurate segmentation of the primary tumor (GTVp) of oropharyngeal cancer patients (OPC), simultaneous assessment of different image modalities is needed, and each image volume is explored slice-by-slice from different orientations. Moreover, the manual fixed boundary of segmentation neglects the spatial uncertainty known to occur in tumor delineation. This study proposes a novel automatic deep learning (DL) model to assist radiation oncologists in a slice-by-slice adaptive GTVp segmentation on registered FDG PET/CT images. We included 138 OPC patients treated with (chemo)radiation in our institute. Our DL framework exploits both inter and intra-slice context. Sequences of 3 consecutive 2D slices of concatenated FDG PET/CT images and GTVp contours were used as input. A 3-fold cross validation was performed three times, training on sequences extracted from the Axial (A), Sagittal (S), and Coronal (C) plane of 113 patients. Since consecutive sequences in a volume contain overlapping slices, each slice resulted in three outcome predictions that were averaged. In the A, S, and C planes, the output shows areas with different probabilities of predicting the tumor. The performance of the models was assessed on 25 patients at different probability thresholds using the mean Dice Score Coefficient (DSC). Predictions were the closest to the ground truth at a probability threshold of 0.9 (DSC of 0.70 in the A, 0.77 in the S, and 0.80 in the C plane). The promising results of the proposed DL model show that the probability maps on registered FDG PET/CT images could guide radiation oncologists in a slice-by-slice adaptive GTVp segmentation.

- **Summary**: The world has suffered from COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) for the last two years, causing much damage and change in people's daily lives. Thus, automated detection of COVID-19 utilizing deep learning on chest computed tomography (CT) scans became promising, which helps correct diagnosis efficiently. Recently, transformer-based COVID-19 detection method on CT is proposed to utilize 3D information in CT volume. However, its sampling method for selecting slices is not optimal. To leverage rich 3D information in CT volume, we propose a transformer-based COVID-19 detection using a novel data curation and adaptive sampling method using gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM). To train the model which consists of CNN layer, followed by transformer architecture, we first executed data curation based on lung segmentation and utilized the entropy of GLCM value of every slice in CT volumes to select important slices for the prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed method improve the detection performance with large margin without much difficult modification to the model.

- **Summary**: With the development of computer technology, various models have emerged in artificial intelligence. The transformer model has been applied to the field of computer vision (CV) after its success in natural language processing (NLP). Radiologists continue to face multiple challenges in today's rapidly evolving medical field, such as increased workload and increased diagnostic demands. Although there are some conventional methods for lung cancer detection before, their accuracy still needs to be improved, especially in realistic diagnostic scenarios. This paper creatively proposes a segmentation method based on efficient transformer and applies it to medical image analysis. The algorithm completes the task of lung cancer classification and segmentation by analyzing lung cancer data, and aims to provide efficient technical support for medical staff. In addition, we evaluated and compared the results in various aspects. For the classification mission, the max accuracy of Swin-T by regular training and Swin-B in two resolutions by pre-training can be up to 82.3%. For the segmentation mission, we use pre-training to help the model improve the accuracy of our experiments. The accuracy of the three models reaches over 95%. The experiments demonstrate that the algorithm can be well applied to lung cancer classification and segmentation missions.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based Self-supervised Representation Learning methods learn generic features from unlabeled datasets for providing useful network initialization parameters for downstream tasks. Recently, self-supervised learning based upon masking local surface patches for 3D point cloud data has been under-explored. In this paper, we propose masked Autoencoders in 3D point cloud representation learning (abbreviated as MAE3D), a novel autoencoding paradigm for self-supervised learning. We first split the input point cloud into patches and mask a portion of them, then use our Patch Embedding Module to extract the features of unmasked patches. Secondly, we employ patch-wise MAE3D Transformers to learn both local features of point cloud patches and high-level contextual relationships between patches and complete the latent representations of masked patches. We use our Point Cloud Reconstruction Module with multi-task loss to complete the incomplete point cloud as a result. We conduct self-supervised pre-training on ShapeNet55 with the point cloud completion pre-text task and fine-tune the pre-trained model on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN (PB\_T50\_RS, the hardest variant). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the local features extracted by our MAE3D from point cloud patches are beneficial for downstream classification tasks, soundly outperforming state-of-the-art methods ($93.4\%$ and $86.2\%$ classification accuracy, respectively).

- **Summary**: Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous technique for training deep neural networks that accelerates their convergence to reach higher accuracy. However, we demonstrate that BN comes with a fundamental drawback: it incentivizes the model to rely on low-variance features that are highly specific to the training (in-domain) data, hurting generalization performance on out-of-domain examples. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon by first showing that removing BN layers across a wide range of architectures leads to lower out-of-domain and corruption errors at the cost of higher in-domain errors. We then propose Counterbalancing Teacher (CT), a method which leverages a frozen copy of the same model without BN as a teacher to enforce the student network's learning of robust representations by substantially adapting its weights through a consistency loss function. This regularization signal helps CT perform well in unforeseen data shifts, even without information from the target domain as in prior works. We theoretically show in an overparameterized linear regression setting why normalization leads to a model's reliance on such in-domain features, and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of CT by outperforming several baselines on robustness benchmarks such as CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and VLCS.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful models able to synthesize data samples closely resembling the distribution of real data, yet the diversity of those generated samples is limited due to the so-called mode collapse phenomenon observed in GANs. Especially prone to mode collapse are conditional GANs, which tend to ignore the input noise vector and focus on the conditional information. Recent methods proposed to mitigate this limitation increase the diversity of generated samples, yet they reduce the performance of the models when similarity of samples is required. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel method to selectively increase the diversity of GAN-generated samples. By adding a simple, yet effective regularization to the training loss function we encourage the generator to discover new data modes for inputs related to diverse outputs while generating consistent samples for the remaining ones. More precisely, we maximise the ratio of distances between generated images and input latent vectors scaling the effect according to the diversity of samples for a given conditional input. We show the superiority of our method in a synthetic benchmark as well as a real-life scenario of simulating data from the Zero Degree Calorimeter of ALICE experiment in LHC, CERN.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new method for internal replay that modulates the frequency of rehearsal based on the depth of the network. While replay strategies mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, recent works on generative replay show that performing the rehearsal only on the deeper layers of the network improves the performance in continual learning. However, the generative approach introduces additional computational overhead, limiting its applications. Motivated by the observation that earlier layers of neural networks forget less abruptly, we propose to update network layers with varying frequency using intermediate-level features during replay. This reduces the computational burden by omitting computations for both deeper layers of the generator and earlier layers of the main model. We name our method Progressive Latent Replay and show that it outperforms Internal Replay while using significantly fewer resources.

- **Summary**: In recent years, an abundance of feature attribution methods for explaining neural networks have been developed. Especially in the field of computer vision, many methods for generating saliency maps providing pixel attributions exist. However, their explanations often contradict each other and it is not clear which explanation to trust. A natural solution to this problem is the aggregation of multiple explanations. We present and compare different pixel-based aggregation schemes with the goal of generating a new explanation, whose fidelity to the model's decision is higher than each individual explanation. Using methods from the field of Bayesian Optimization, we incorporate the variance between the individual explanations into the aggregation process. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multiple normalization techniques on ensemble aggregation.

- **Summary**: This paper tackles the problem of human motion prediction, consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences. State-of-the-art approaches provide good results, however, they rely on deep learning architectures of arbitrary complexity, such as Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN), Transformers or Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN), typically requiring multiple training stages and more than 2 million parameters. In this paper, we show that, after combining with a series of standard practices, such as applying Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT), predicting residual displacement of joints and optimizing velocity as an auxiliary loss, a light-weight network based on multi-layer perceptrons(MLPs) with only 0.14 million parameters can surpass the state-of-the-art performance. An exhaustive evaluation on the Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW datasets shows that our method, named siMLPe, consistently outperforms all other approaches. We hope that our simple method could serve as a strong baseline for the community and allow re-thinking of the human motion prediction problem.

- **Summary**: Using search engines for web image retrieval is a tempting alternative to manual curation when creating an image dataset, but their main drawback remains the proportion of incorrect (noisy) samples retrieved. These noisy samples have been evidenced by previous works to be a mixture of in-distribution (ID) samples, assigned to the incorrect category but presenting similar visual semantics to other classes in the dataset, and out-of-distribution (OOD) images, which share no semantic correlation with any category from the dataset. The latter are, in practice, the dominant type of noisy images retrieved. To tackle this noise duality, we propose a two stage algorithm starting with a detection step where we use unsupervised contrastive feature learning to represent images in a feature space. We find that the alignment and uniformity principles of contrastive learning allow OOD samples to be linearly separated from ID samples on the unit hypersphere. We then spectrally embed the unsupervised representations using a fixed neighborhood size and apply an outlier sensitive clustering at the class level to detect the clean and OOD clusters as well as ID noisy outliers. We finally train a noise robust neural network that corrects ID noise to the correct category and utilizes OOD samples in a guided contrastive objective, clustering them to improve low-level features. Our algorithm improves the state-of-the-art results on synthetic noise image datasets as well as real-world web-crawled data. Our work is fully reproducible github.com/PaulAlbert31/SNCF.

- **Summary**: Visual relations form the basis of understanding our compositional world, as relationships between visual objects capture key information in a scene. It is then advantageous to learn relations automatically from the data, as learning with predefined labels cannot capture all possible relations. However, current relation learning methods typically require supervision, and are not designed to generalize to scenes with more complicated relational structures than those seen during training. Here, we introduce ViRel, a method for unsupervised discovery and learning of Visual Relations with graph-level analogy. In a setting where scenes within a task share the same underlying relational subgraph structure, our learning method of contrasting isomorphic and non-isomorphic graphs discovers the relations across tasks in an unsupervised manner. Once the relations are learned, ViRel can then retrieve the shared relational graph structure for each task by parsing the predicted relational structure. Using a dataset based on grid-world and the Abstract Reasoning Corpus, we show that our method achieves above 95% accuracy in relation classification, discovers the relation graph structure for most tasks, and further generalizes to unseen tasks with more complicated relational structures.

- **Summary**: Computed tomography (CT) imaging could be very practical for diagnosing various diseases. However, the nature of the CT images is even more diverse since the resolution and number of the slices of a CT scan are determined by the machine and its settings. Conventional deep learning models are hard to tickle such diverse data since the essential requirement of the deep neural network is the consistent shape of the input data. In this paper, we propose a novel, effective, two-step-wise approach to tickle this issue for COVID-19 symptom classification thoroughly. First, the semantic feature embedding of each slice for a CT scan is extracted by conventional backbone networks. Then, we proposed a long short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer-based sub-network to deal with temporal feature learning, leading to spatiotemporal feature representation learning. In this fashion, the proposed two-step LSTM model could prevent overfitting, as well as increase performance. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the proposed two-step method not only shows excellent performance but also could be compensated for each other. More specifically, the two-step LSTM model has a lower false-negative rate, while the 2-step Swin model has a lower false-positive rate. In summary, it is suggested that the model ensemble could be adopted for more stable and promising performance in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a new approach for model acceleration by exploiting spatial sparsity in visual data. We observe that the final prediction in vision Transformers is only based on a subset of the most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input to accelerate vision Transformers. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. While the framework is inspired by our observation of the sparse attention in vision Transformers, we find the idea of adaptive and asymmetric computation can be a general solution for accelerating various architectures. We extend our method to hierarchical models including CNNs and hierarchical vision Transformers as well as more complex dense prediction tasks that require structured feature maps by formulating a more generic dynamic spatial sparsification framework with progressive sparsification and asymmetric computation for different spatial locations. By applying lightweight fast paths to less informative features and using more expressive slow paths to more important locations, we can maintain the structure of feature maps while significantly reducing the overall computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on various modern architectures and different visual recognition tasks. Our results clearly demonstrate that dynamic spatial sparsification offers a new and more effective dimension for model acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/raoyongming/DynamicViT

- **Summary**: Obtaining 3D object representations is important for creating photo-realistic simulations and for collecting AR and VR assets. Neural fields have shown their effectiveness in learning a continuous volumetric representation of a scene from 2D images, but acquiring object representations from these models with weak supervision remains an open challenge. In this paper we introduce LaTeRF, a method for extracting an object of interest from a scene given 2D images of the entire scene, known camera poses, a natural language description of the object, and a set of point-labels of object and non-object points in the input images. To faithfully extract the object from the scene, LaTeRF extends the NeRF formulation with an additional `objectness' probability at each 3D point. Additionally, we leverage the rich latent space of a pre-trained CLIP model combined with our differentiable object renderer, to inpaint the occluded parts of the object. We demonstrate high-fidelity object extraction on both synthetic and real-world datasets and justify our design choices through an extensive ablation study.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that gradually deprives the patient of cognitive function and can end in death. With the advancement of technology today, it is possible to detect Alzheimer's disease through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. So that MRI is the technique most often used for the diagnosis and analysis of the progress of Alzheimer's disease. With this technology, image recognition in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be achieved automatically using machine learning. Although machine learning has many advantages, currently the use of deep learning is more widely applied because it has stronger learning capabilities and is more suitable for solving image recognition problems. However, there are still several challenges that must be faced to implement deep learning, such as the need for large datasets, requiring large computing resources, and requiring careful parameter setting to prevent overfitting or underfitting. In responding to the challenge of classifying Alzheimer's disease using deep learning, this study propose the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method with the Residual Network 18 Layer (ResNet-18) architecture. To overcome the need for a large and balanced dataset, transfer learning from ImageNet is used and weighting the loss function values so that each class has the same weight. And also in this study conducted an experiment by changing the network activation function to a mish activation function to increase accuracy. From the results of the tests that have been carried out, the accuracy of the model is 88.3 % using transfer learning, weighted loss and the mish activation function. This accuracy value increases from the baseline model which only gets an accuracy of 69.1 %.

- **Summary**: Aiming to restore the original intensity of shadow regions in an image and make them compatible with the remaining non-shadow regions without a trace, shadow removal is a very challenging problem that benefits many downstream image/video-related tasks. Recently, transformers have shown their strong capability in various applications by capturing global pixel interactions and this capability is highly desirable in shadow removal. However, applying transformers to promote shadow removal is non-trivial for the following two reasons: 1) The patchify operation is not suitable for shadow removal due to irregular shadow shapes; 2) shadow removal only needs one-way interaction from the non-shadow region to the shadow region instead of the common two-way interactions among all pixels in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-region transformer, namely CRFormer, for shadow removal which differs from existing transformers by only considering the pixel interactions from the non-shadow region to the shadow region without splitting images into patches. This is achieved by a carefully designed region-aware cross-attention operation that can aggregate the recovered shadow region features conditioned on the non-shadow region features. Extensive experiments on ISTD, AISTD, SRD, and Video Shadow Removal datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We present PVO, a novel panoptic visual odometry framework to achieve more comprehensive modeling of the scene motion, geometry, and panoptic segmentation information. Our PVO models visual odometry (VO) and video panoptic segmentation (VPS) in a unified view, which makes the two tasks mutually beneficial. Specifically, we introduce a panoptic update module into the VO Module with the guidance of image panoptic segmentation. This Panoptic-Enhanced VO Module can alleviate the impact of dynamic objects in the camera pose estimation with a panoptic-aware dynamic mask. On the other hand, the VO-Enhanced VPS Module also improves the segmentation accuracy by fusing the panoptic segmentation result of the current frame on the fly to the adjacent frames, using geometric information such as camera pose, depth, and optical flow obtained from the VO Module. These two modules contribute to each other through recurrent iterative optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PVO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual odometry and video panoptic segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Correctness of instance segmentation constitutes counting the number of objects, correctly localizing all predictions and classifying each localized prediction. Average Precision is the de-facto metric used to measure all these constituents of segmentation. However, this metric does not penalize duplicate predictions in the high-recall range, and cannot distinguish instances that are localized correctly but categorized incorrectly. This weakness has inadvertently led to network designs that achieve significant gains in AP but also introduce a large number of false positives. We therefore cannot rely on AP to choose a model that provides an optimal tradeoff between false positives and high recall. To resolve this dilemma, we review alternative metrics in the literature and propose two new measures to explicitly measure the amount of both spatial and categorical duplicate predictions. We also propose a Semantic Sorting and NMS module to remove these duplicates based on a pixel occupancy matching scheme. Experiments show that modern segmentation networks have significant gains in AP, but also contain a considerable amount of duplicates. Our Semantic Sorting and NMS can be added as a plug-and-play module to mitigate hedged predictions and preserve AP.

- **Summary**: We address the challenging task of human reaction generation, which aims to generate a corresponding reaction based on an input action. Most of the existing works do not focus on generating and predicting the reaction and cannot generate the motion when only the action is given as input. To address this limitation, we propose a novel interaction Transformer (InterFormer) consisting of a Transformer network with both temporal and spatial attention. Specifically, temporal attention captures the temporal dependencies of the motion of both characters and of their interaction, while spatial attention learns the dependencies between the different body parts of each character and those which are part of the interaction. Moreover, we propose using graphs to increase the performance of spatial attention via an interaction distance module that helps focus on nearby joints from both characters. Extensive experiments on the SBU interaction, K3HI, and DuetDance datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of InterFormer. Our method is general and can be used to generate more complex and long-term interactions. We also provide videos of generated reactions and the code with pre-trained models at https://github.com/CRISTAL-3DSAM/InterFormer

- **Summary**: Video anomaly analysis is a core task actively pursued in the field of computer vision, with applications extending to real-world crime detection in surveillance footage. In this work, we address the task of human-related crime classification. In our proposed approach, the human body in video frames, represented as skeletal joints trajectories, is used as the main source of exploration. First, we introduce the significance of extending the ground truth labels for HR-Crime dataset and hence, propose a supervised and unsupervised methodology to generate trajectory-level ground truth labels. Next, given the availability of the trajectory-level ground truth, we introduce a trajectory-based crime classification framework. Ablation studies are conducted with various architectures and feature fusion strategies for the representation of the human trajectories. The conducted experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the task and pave the path for further research in the field.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the strong ties between vision and language, the two intimate human sensing and communication modalities, our paper aims to explore the generation of 3D human full-body motions from texts, as well as its reciprocal task, shorthanded for text2motion and motion2text, respectively. To tackle the existing challenges, especially to enable the generation of multiple distinct motions from the same text, and to avoid the undesirable production of trivial motionless pose sequences, we propose the use of motion token, a discrete and compact motion representation. This provides one level playing ground when considering both motions and text signals, as the motion and text tokens, respectively. Moreover, our motion2text module is integrated into the inverse alignment process of our text2motion training pipeline, where a significant deviation of synthesized text from the input text would be penalized by a large training loss; empirically this is shown to effectively improve performance. Finally, the mappings in-between the two modalities of motions and texts are facilitated by adapting the neural model for machine translation (NMT) to our context. This autoregressive modeling of the distribution over discrete motion tokens further enables non-deterministic production of pose sequences, of variable lengths, from an input text. Our approach is flexible, could be used for both text2motion and motion2text tasks. Empirical evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on both tasks over a variety of state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Heart rate measuring based on remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) plays an important role in health caring, which estimates heart rate from facial video in a non-contact, less-constrained way. End-to-end neural network is a main branch of rPPG-based heart rate estimation methods, whose trait is recovering rPPG signal containing sufficient heart rate message from original facial video directly. However, there exists some easily neglected problems on relevant datasets which thwarting the efficient training of end-to-end methods, such as uncertain temporal delay and indefinite envelope shape of label waves. Although many novel and powerful networks are proposed, hitherto there are no systematic research digging into these problems. In this paper, from perspective of common intrinsic rhythm periodical self-similarity results from cardiac activities, we propose a comprehensive methodology, Boost Your Heartbeat Estimation (BYHE), including new label representations, corresponding network adjustments and loss functions. BYHE can be easily grafted on current end-to-end network and boost its training efficiency. By applying our methodology, we can save tremendous time without conducting laborious handworks, such as label wave alignment which is necessary for previous end-to-end methods, and meanwhile enhance the utilization on datasets. According to our experiments, BYHE can leverage classical end-to-end network to reach competitive performance against those state-of-the-art methods on mostly used datasets. Such improvement indicates selecting perspicuous and efficient label representation is also a promising direction towards better remote physiological signal measurement.

- **Summary**: Action in video usually involves the interaction of human with objects. Action labels are typically composed of various combinations of verbs and nouns, but we may not have training data for all possible combinations. In this paper, we aim to improve the generalization ability of the compositional action recognition model to novel verbs or novel nouns that are unseen during training time, by leveraging the power of knowledge graphs. Previous work utilizes verb-noun compositional action nodes in the knowledge graph, making it inefficient to scale since the number of compositional action nodes grows quadratically with respect to the number of verbs and nouns. To address this issue, we propose our approach: Disentangled Action Recognition with Knowledge-bases (DARK), which leverages the inherent compositionality of actions. DARK trains a factorized model by first extracting disentangled feature representations for verbs and nouns, and then predicting classification weights using relations in external knowledge graphs. The type constraint between verb and noun is extracted from external knowledge bases and finally applied when composing actions. DARK has better scalability in the number of objects and verbs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Charades dataset. We further propose a new benchmark split based on the Epic-kitchen dataset which is an order of magnitude bigger in the numbers of classes and samples, and benchmark various models on this benchmark.

- **Summary**: The recent focus on Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (FG-SBIR) has shifted towards generalising a model to new categories without any training data from them. In real-world applications, however, a trained FG-SBIR model is often applied to both new categories and different human sketchers, i.e., different drawing styles. Although this complicates the generalisation problem, fortunately, a handful of examples are typically available, enabling the model to adapt to the new category/style. In this paper, we offer a novel perspective -- instead of asking for a model that generalises, we advocate for one that quickly adapts, with just very few samples during testing (in a few-shot manner). To solve this new problem, we introduce a novel model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework with several key modifications: (1) As a retrieval task with a margin-based contrastive loss, we simplify the MAML training in the inner loop to make it more stable and tractable. (2) The margin in our contrastive loss is also meta-learned with the rest of the model. (3) Three additional regularisation losses are introduced in the outer loop, to make the meta-learned FG-SBIR model more effective for category/style adaptation. Extensive experiments on public datasets suggest a large gain over generalisation and zero-shot based approaches, and a few strong few-shot baselines.

- **Summary**: Given a small training data set and a learning algorithm, how much more data is necessary to reach a target validation or test performance? This question is of critical importance in applications such as autonomous driving or medical imaging where collecting data is expensive and time-consuming. Overestimating or underestimating data requirements incurs substantial costs that could be avoided with an adequate budget. Prior work on neural scaling laws suggest that the power-law function can fit the validation performance curve and extrapolate it to larger data set sizes. We find that this does not immediately translate to the more difficult downstream task of estimating the required data set size to meet a target performance. In this work, we consider a broad class of computer vision tasks and systematically investigate a family of functions that generalize the power-law function to allow for better estimation of data requirements. Finally, we show that incorporating a tuned correction factor and collecting over multiple rounds significantly improves the performance of the data estimators. Using our guidelines, practitioners can accurately estimate data requirements of machine learning systems to gain savings in both development time and data acquisition costs.

- **Summary**: Quantitative ultrasound, e.g., speed-of-sound (SoS) in tissues, provides information about tissue properties that have diagnostic value. Recent studies showed the possibility of extracting SoS information from pulse-echo ultrasound raw data (a.k.a. RF data) using deep neural networks that are fully trained on simulated data. These methods take sensor domain data, i.e., RF data, as input and train a network in an end-to-end fashion to learn the implicit mapping between the RF data domain and SoS domain. However, such networks are prone to overfitting to simulated data which results in poor performance and instability when tested on measured data. We propose a novel method for SoS mapping employing learned representations from two linked autoencoders. We test our approach on simulated and measured data acquired from human breast mimicking phantoms. We show that SoS mapping is possible using linked autoencoders. The proposed method has a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.39% on the simulated data. On the measured data, the predictions of the proposed method are close to the expected values with MAPE of 1.1%. Compared to an end-to-end trained network, the proposed method shows higher stability and reproducibility.

- **Summary**: Image Captioning is a current research task to describe the image content using the objects and their relationships in the scene. To tackle this task, two important research areas converge, artificial vision, and natural language processing. In Image Captioning, as in any computational intelligence task, the performance metrics are crucial for knowing how well (or bad) a method performs. In recent years, it has been observed that classical metrics based on n-grams are insufficient to capture the semantics and the critical meaning to describe the content in an image. Looking to measure how well or not the set of current and more recent metrics are doing, in this article, we present an evaluation of several kinds of Image Captioning metrics and a comparison between them using the well-known MS COCO dataset. The metrics were selected from the most used in prior works, they are those based on $n$-grams as BLEU, SacreBLEU, METEOR, ROGUE-L, CIDEr, SPICE, and those based on embeddings, such as BERTScore and CLIPScore. For this, we designed two scenarios; 1) a set of artificially build captions with several qualities, and 2) a comparison of some state-of-the-art Image Captioning methods. Interesting findings were found trying to answer the questions: Are the current metrics helping to produce high-quality captions? How do actual metrics compare to each other? What are the metrics really measuring?

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based classification of rare anemia disorders is challenged by the lack of training data and instance-level annotations. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has shown to be an effective solution, yet it suffers from low accuracy and limited explainability. Although the inclusion of attention mechanisms has addressed these issues, their effectiveness highly depends on the amount and diversity of cells in the training samples. Consequently, the poor machine learning performance on rare anemia disorder classification from blood samples remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose an interpretable pooling method for MIL to address these limitations. By benefiting from instance-level information of negative bags (i.e., homogeneous benign cells from healthy individuals), our approach increases the contribution of anomalous instances. We show that our strategy outperforms standard MIL classification algorithms and provides a meaningful explanation behind its decisions. Moreover, it can denote anomalous instances of rare blood diseases that are not seen during the training phase.

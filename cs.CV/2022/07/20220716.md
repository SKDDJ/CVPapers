- **Summary**: Adversarial training, as one of the most effective defense methods against adversarial attacks, tends to learn an inclusive decision boundary to increase the robustness of deep learning models. However, due to the large and unnecessary increase in the margin along adversarial directions, adversarial training causes heavy cross-over between natural examples and adversarial examples, which is not conducive to balancing the trade-off between robustness and natural accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training scheme to achieve a better trade-off between robustness and natural accuracy. It aims to learn a moderate-inclusive decision boundary, which means that the margins of natural examples under the decision boundary are moderate. We call this scheme Moderate-Margin Adversarial Training (MMAT), which generates finer-grained adversarial examples to mitigate the cross-over problem. We also take advantage of logits from a teacher model that has been well-trained to guide the learning of our model. Finally, MMAT achieves high natural accuracy and robustness under both black-box and white-box attacks. On SVHN, for example, state-of-the-art robustness and natural accuracy are achieved.

- **Summary**: Constructing high-quality character image datasets is challenging because real-world images are often affected by image degradation. There are limitations when applying current image restoration methods to such real-world character images, since (i) the categories of noise in character images are different from those in general images; (ii) real-world character images usually contain more complex image degradation, e.g., mixed noise at different noise levels. To address these problems, we propose a real-world character restoration network (RCRN) to effectively restore degraded character images, where character skeleton information and scale-ensemble feature extraction are utilized to obtain better restoration performance. The proposed method consists of a skeleton extractor (SENet) and a character image restorer (CiRNet). SENet aims to preserve the structural consistency of the character and normalize complex noise. Then, CiRNet reconstructs clean images from degraded character images and their skeletons. Due to the lack of benchmarks for real-world character image restoration, we constructed a dataset containing 1,606 character images with real-world degradation to evaluate the validity of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that RCRN outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Prior literature on adversarial attack methods has mainly focused on attacking with and defending against a single threat model, e.g., perturbations bounded in Lp ball. However, multiple threat models can be combined into composite perturbations. One such approach, composite adversarial attack (CAA), not only expands the perturbable space of the image, but also may be overlooked by current modes of robustness evaluation. This paper demonstrates how CAA's attack order affects the resulting image, and provides real-time inferences of different models, which will facilitate users' configuration of the parameters of the attack level and their rapid evaluation of model prediction. A leaderboard to benchmark adversarial robustness against CAA is also introduced.

- **Summary**: Degraded images commonly exist in the general sources of character images, leading to unsatisfactory character recognition results. Existing methods have dedicated efforts to restoring degraded character images. However, the denoising results obtained by these methods do not appear to improve character recognition performance. This is mainly because current methods only focus on pixel-level information and ignore critical features of a character, such as its glyph, resulting in character-glyph damage during the denoising process. In this paper, we introduce a novel generic framework based on glyph fusion and attention mechanisms, i.e., CharFormer, for precisely recovering character images without changing their inherent glyphs. Unlike existing frameworks, CharFormer introduces a parallel target task for capturing additional information and injecting it into the image denoising backbone, which will maintain the consistency of character glyphs during character image denoising. Moreover, we utilize attention-based networks for global-local feature interaction, which will help to deal with blind denoising and enhance denoising performance. We compare CharFormer with state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of CharFormer quantitatively and qualitatively.



### Learning Granularity-Unified Representations for Text-to-Image Person Re-identification

- **Summary**: Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) aims to search for pedestrian images of an interested identity via textual descriptions. It is challenging due to both rich intra-modal variations and significant inter-modal gaps. Existing works usually ignore the difference in feature granularity between the two modalities, i.e., the visual features are usually fine-grained while textual features are coarse, which is mainly responsible for the large inter-modal gaps. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework based on transformers to learn granularity-unified representations for both modalities, denoted as LGUR. LGUR framework contains two modules: a Dictionary-based Granularity Alignment (DGA) module and a Prototype-based Granularity Unification (PGU) module. In DGA, in order to align the granularities of two modalities, we introduce a Multi-modality Shared Dictionary (MSD) to reconstruct both visual and textual features. Besides, DGA has two important factors, i.e., the cross-modality guidance and the foreground-centric reconstruction, to facilitate the optimization of MSD. In PGU, we adopt a set of shared and learnable prototypes as the queries to extract diverse and semantically aligned features for both modalities in the granularity-unified feature space, which further promotes the ReID performance. Comprehensive experiments show that our LGUR consistently outperforms state-of-the-arts by large margins on both CUHK-PEDES and ICFG-PEDES datasets. Code will be released at https://github.com/ZhiyinShao-H/LGUR.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methodology contributes a lot to the development of hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis community. However, it also makes HSI analysis systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To this end, we propose a masked spatial-spectral autoencoder (MSSA) in this paper under self-supervised learning theory, for enhancing the robustness of HSI analysis systems. First, a masked sequence attention learning module is conducted to promote the inherent robustness of HSI analysis systems along spectral channel. Then, we develop a graph convolutional network with learnable graph structure to establish global pixel-wise combinations.In this way, the attack effect would be dispersed by all the related pixels among each combination, and a better defense performance is achievable in spatial aspect.Finally, to improve the defense transferability and address the problem of limited labelled samples, MSSA employs spectra reconstruction as a pretext task and fits the datasets in a self-supervised manner.Comprehensive experiments over three benchmarks verify the effectiveness of MSSA in comparison with the state-of-the-art hyperspectral classification methods and representative adversarial defense strategies.

- **Summary**: This paper tackles the task of uncalibrated photometric stereo for 3D object reconstruction, where both the object shape, object reflectance, and lighting directions are unknown. This is an extremely difficult task, and the challenge is further compounded with the existence of the well-known generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity in photometric stereo. Previous methods to resolve this ambiguity either rely on an overly simplified reflectance model, or assume special light distribution. We propose a new method that jointly optimizes object shape, light directions, and light intensities, all under general surfaces and lights assumptions. The specularities are used explicitly to solve uncalibrated photometric stereo via a neural inverse rendering process. We gradually fit specularities from shiny to rough using novel progressive specular bases. Our method leverages a physically based rendering equation by minimizing the reconstruction error on a per-object-basis. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in light estimation and shape recovery on real-world datasets.



### Bagging Regional Classification Activation Maps for Weakly Supervised Object Localization

- **Summary**: Classification activation map (CAM), utilizing the classification structure to generate pixel-wise localization maps, is a crucial mechanism for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). However, CAM directly uses the classifier trained on image-level features to locate objects, making it prefers to discern global discriminative factors rather than regional object cues. Thus only the discriminative locations are activated when feeding pixel-level features into this classifier. To solve this issue, this paper elaborates a plug-and-play mechanism called BagCAMs to better project a well-trained classifier for the localization task without refining or re-training the baseline structure. Our BagCAMs adopts a proposed regional localizer generation (RLG) strategy to define a set of regional localizers and then derive them from a well-trained classifier. These regional localizers can be viewed as the base learner that only discerns region-wise object factors for localization tasks, and their results can be effectively weighted by our BagCAMs to form the final localization map. Experiments indicate that adopting our proposed BagCAMs can improve the performance of baseline WSOL methods to a great extent and obtains state-of-the-art performance on three WSOL benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel queries with only a few support samples through leveraging prior knowledge from a base dataset. In this paper, we consider the domain shift problem in FSL and aim to address the domain gap between the support set and the query set. Different from previous cross-domain FSL work (CD-FSL) that considers the domain shift between base and novel classes, the new problem, termed cross-domain cross-set FSL (CDSC-FSL), requires few-shot learners not only to adapt to the new domain, but also to be consistent between different domains within each novel class. To this end, we propose a novel approach, namely stabPA, to learn prototypical compact and cross-domain aligned representations, so that the domain shift and few-shot learning can be addressed simultaneously. We evaluate our approach on two new CDCS-FSL benchmarks built from the DomainNet and Office-Home datasets respectively. Remarkably, our approach outperforms multiple elaborated baselines by a large margin, e.g., improving 5-shot accuracy by 6.0 points on average on DomainNet.

- **Summary**: Multivariate long sequence time-series forecasting (M-LSTF) is a practical but challenging problem. Unlike traditional timer-series forecasting tasks, M-LSTF tasks are more challenging from two aspects: 1) M-LSTF models need to learn time-series patterns both within and between multiple time features; 2) Under the rolling forecasting setting, the similarity between two consecutive training samples increases with the increasing prediction length, which makes models more prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose a generalizable memory-driven Transformer to target M-LSTF problems. Specifically, we first propose a global-level memory component to drive the forecasting procedure by integrating multiple time-series features. In addition, we adopt a progressive fashion to train our model to increase its generalizability, in which we gradually introduce Bernoulli noises to training samples. Extensive experiments have been performed on five different datasets across multiple fields. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can be seamlessly plugged into varying Transformer-based models to improve their performances up to roughly 30%. Particularly, this is the first work to specifically focus on the M-LSTF tasks to the best of our knowledge.

- **Summary**: We propose an effective Structural Prior guided Generative Adversarial Transformer (SPGAT) to solve low-light image enhancement. Our SPGAT mainly contains a generator with two discriminators and a structural prior estimator (SPE). The generator is based on a U-shaped Transformer which is used to explore non-local information for better clear image restoration. The SPE is used to explore useful structures from images to guide the generator for better structural detail estimation. To generate more realistic images, we develop a new structural prior guided adversarial learning method by building the skip connections between the generator and discriminators so that the discriminators can better discriminate between real and fake features. Finally, we propose a parallel windows-based Swin Transformer block to aggregate different level hierarchical features for high-quality image restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SPGAT performs favorably against recent state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Text-Video retrieval is a task of great practical value and has received increasing attention, among which learning spatial-temporal video representation is one of the research hotspots. The video encoders in the state-of-the-art video retrieval models usually directly adopt the pre-trained vision backbones with the network structure fixed, they therefore can not be further improved to produce the fine-grained spatial-temporal video representation. In this paper, we propose Token Shift and Selection Network (TS2-Net), a novel token shift and selection transformer architecture, which dynamically adjusts the token sequence and selects informative tokens in both temporal and spatial dimensions from input video samples. The token shift module temporally shifts the whole token features back-and-forth across adjacent frames, to preserve the complete token representation and capture subtle movements. Then the token selection module selects tokens that contribute most to local spatial semantics. Based on thorough experiments, the proposed TS2-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on major text-video retrieval benchmarks, including new records on MSRVTT, VATEX, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo.

- **Summary**: Recently many plug-and-play self-attention modules (SAMs) are proposed to enhance the model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In general, previous works ignore where to plug in the SAMs since they connect the SAMs individually with each block of the entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental computational cost and the number of parameters with the growth of network depth. However, we empirically find and verify some counterintuitive phenomena that: (a) Connecting the SAMs to all the blocks may not always bring the largest performance boost, and connecting to partial blocks would be even better; (b) Adding the SAMs to a CNN may not always bring a performance boost, and instead it may even harm the performance of the original CNN backbone. Therefore, we articulate and demonstrate the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Self-attention Networks: a full self-attention network contains a subnetwork with sparse self-attention connections that can (1) accelerate inference, (2) reduce extra parameter increment, and (3) maintain accuracy. In addition to the empirical evidence, this hypothesis is also supported by our theoretical evidence. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective reinforcement-learning-based method to search the ticket, i.e., the connection scheme that satisfies the three above-mentioned conditions. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets and popular self-attention networks show the effectiveness of our method. Besides, our experiments illustrate that our searched ticket has the capacity of transferring to some vision tasks, e.g., crowd counting and segmentation.



### TransGrasp: Grasp Pose Estimation of a Category of Objects by Transferring Grasps from Only One Labeled Instance

- **Summary**: Grasp pose estimation is an important issue for robots to interact with the real world. However, most of existing methods require exact 3D object models available beforehand or a large amount of grasp annotations for training. To avoid these problems, we propose TransGrasp, a category-level grasp pose estimation method that predicts grasp poses of a category of objects by labeling only one object instance. Specifically, we perform grasp pose transfer across a category of objects based on their shape correspondences and propose a grasp pose refinement module to further fine-tune grasp pose of grippers so as to ensure successful grasps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on achieving high-quality grasps with the transferred grasp poses. Our code is available at https://github.com/yanjh97/TransGrasp.

- **Summary**: In the past decade, object detection tasks are defined mostly by large public datasets. However, building object detection datasets is not scalable due to inefficient image collecting and labeling. Furthermore, most labels are still in the form of bounding boxes, which provide much less information than the real human visual system. In this paper, we present a method to synthesize object-in-scene images, which can preserve the objects' detailed features without bringing irrelevant information. In brief, given a set of images containing a target object, our algorithm first trains a model to find an approximate center of the object as an anchor, then makes an outline regression to estimate its boundary, and finally blends the object into a new scene. Our result shows that in the synthesized image, the boundaries of objects blend very well with the background. Experiments also show that SOTA segmentation models work well with our synthesized data.



### CLOSE: Curriculum Learning On the Sharing Extent Towards Better One-shot NAS

- **Summary**: One-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely used to discover architectures due to its efficiency. However, previous studies reveal that one-shot performance estimations of architectures might not be well correlated with their performances in stand-alone training because of the excessive sharing of operation parameters (i.e., large sharing extent) between architectures. Thus, recent methods construct even more over-parameterized supernets to reduce the sharing extent. But these improved methods introduce a large number of extra parameters and thus cause an undesirable trade-off between the training costs and the ranking quality. To alleviate the above issues, we propose to apply Curriculum Learning On Sharing Extent (CLOSE) to train the supernet both efficiently and effectively. Specifically, we train the supernet with a large sharing extent (an easier curriculum) at the beginning and gradually decrease the sharing extent of the supernet (a harder curriculum). To support this training strategy, we design a novel supernet (CLOSENet) that decouples the parameters from operations to realize a flexible sharing scheme and adjustable sharing extent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLOSE can obtain a better ranking quality across different computational budget constraints than other one-shot supernets, and is able to discover superior architectures when combined with various search strategies.

- **Summary**: Reliable and stable 6D pose estimation of uncooperative space objects plays an essential role in on-orbit servicing and debris removal missions. Considering that the pose estimator is sensitive to background interference, this paper proposes a counterfactual analysis framework named CASpaceNet to complete robust 6D pose estimation of the spaceborne targets under complicated background. Specifically, conventional methods are adopted to extract the features of the whole image in the factual case. In the counterfactual case, a non-existent image without the target but only the background is imagined. Side effect caused by background interference is reduced by counterfactual analysis, which leads to unbiased prediction in final results. In addition, we also carry out lowbit-width quantization for CA-SpaceNet and deploy part of the framework to a Processing-In-Memory (PIM) accelerator on FPGA. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. To our best knowledge, this paper applies causal inference and network quantization to the 6D pose estimation of space-borne targets for the first time.

- **Summary**: Since RANSAC, a great deal of research has been devoted to improving both its accuracy and run-time. Still, only a few methods aim at recognizing invalid minimal samples early, before the often expensive model estimation and quality calculation are done. To this end, we propose NeFSAC, an efficient algorithm for neural filtering of motion-inconsistent and poorly-conditioned minimal samples. We train NeFSAC to predict the probability of a minimal sample leading to an accurate relative pose, only based on the pixel coordinates of the image correspondences. Our neural filtering model learns typical motion patterns of samples which lead to unstable poses, and regularities in the possible motions to favour well-conditioned and likely-correct samples. The novel lightweight architecture implements the main invariants of minimal samples for pose estimation, and a novel training scheme addresses the problem of extreme class imbalance. NeFSAC can be plugged into any existing RANSAC-based pipeline. We integrate it into USAC and show that it consistently provides strong speed-ups even under extreme train-test domain gaps - for example, the model trained for the autonomous driving scenario works on PhotoTourism too. We tested NeFSAC on more than 100k image pairs from three publicly available real-world datasets and found that it leads to one order of magnitude speed-up, while often finding more accurate results than USAC alone.

- **Summary**: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a very active area of Deep Learning research where it is heavily used as a pre-training method for classification and other tasks. However, the rapid pace of advancements in this area comes at a price: training pipelines vary significantly across papers, which presents a potentially crucial confounding factor. Here, we show that, indeed, the choice of hyperparameters and data augmentation strategies can have a dramatic impact on performance. To shed light on these neglected factors and help maximize the power of SSL, we hyperparameterize these components and optimize them with Bayesian optimization, showing improvements across multiple datasets for the SimSiam SSL approach. Realizing the importance of data augmentations for SSL, we also introduce a new automated data augmentation algorithm, GroupAugment, which considers groups of augmentations and optimizes the sampling across groups. In contrast to algorithms designed for supervised learning, GroupAugment achieved consistently high linear evaluation accuracy across all datasets we considered. Overall, our results indicate the importance and likely underestimated role of data augmentation for SSL.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Building a universal Video-Language model for solving various video understanding tasks (\emph{e.g.}, text-video retrieval, video question answering) is an open challenge to the machine learning field. Towards this goal, most recent works build the model by stacking uni-modal and cross-modal feature encoders and train it with pair-wise contrastive pre-text tasks. Though offering attractive generality, the resulted models have to compromise between efficiency and performance. They mostly adopt different architectures to deal with different downstream tasks. We find this is because the pair-wise training cannot well \emph{align} and \emph{fuse} features from different modalities. We then introduce \textbf{Clover}\textemdash a Correlated Video-Language pre-training method\textemdash towards a universal Video-Language model for solving multiple video understanding tasks with neither performance nor efficiency compromise. It improves cross-modal feature alignment and fusion via a novel tri-modal alignment pre-training task. Additionally, we propose to enhance the tri-modal alignment via incorporating learning from semantic masked samples and a new pair-wise ranking loss. Clover establishes new state-of-the-arts on multiple downstream tasks, including three retrieval tasks for both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, and eight video question answering tasks. Codes and pre-trained models will be released at \url{https://github.com/LeeYN-43/Clover}.

- **Summary**: Feature pyramid network (FPN) is one of the key components for object detectors. However, there is a long-standing puzzle for researchers that the detection performance of large-scale objects are usually suppressed after introducing FPN. To this end, this paper first revisits FPN in the detection framework and reveals the nature of the success of FPN from the perspective of optimization. Then, we point out that the degraded performance of large-scale objects is due to the arising of improper back-propagation paths after integrating FPN. It makes each level of the backbone network only has the ability to look at the objects within a certain scale range. Based on these analysis, two feasible strategies are proposed to enable each level of the backbone to look at all objects in the FPN-based detection frameworks. Specifically, one is to introduce auxiliary objective functions to make each backbone level directly receive the back-propagation signals of various-scale objects during training. The other is to construct the feature pyramid in a more reasonable way to avoid the irrational back-propagation paths. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark validate the soundness of our analysis and the effectiveness of our methods. Without bells and whistles, we demonstrate that our method achieves solid improvements (more than 2%) on various detection frameworks: one-stage, two-stage, anchor-based, anchor-free and transformer-based detectors.

- **Summary**: Data-driven approaches to assist operating room (OR) workflow analysis depend on large curated datasets that are time consuming and expensive to collect. On the other hand, we see a recent paradigm shift from supervised learning to self-supervised and/or unsupervised learning approaches that can learn representations from unlabeled datasets. In this paper, we leverage the unlabeled data captured in robotic surgery ORs and propose a novel way to fuse the multi-modal data for a single video frame or image. Instead of producing different augmentations (or 'views') of the same image or video frame which is a common practice in self-supervised learning, we treat the multi-modal data as different views to train the model in an unsupervised manner via clustering. We compared our method with other state of the art methods and results show the superior performance of our approach on surgical video activity recognition and semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation, visual odometry (VO), and bird's-eye-view (BEV) scene layout estimation present three critical tasks for driving scene perception, which is fundamental for motion planning and navigation in autonomous driving. Though they are complementary to each other, prior works usually focus on each individual task and rarely deal with all three tasks together. A naive way is to accomplish them independently in a sequential or parallel manner, but there are many drawbacks, i.e., 1) the depth and VO results suffer from the inherent scale ambiguity issue; 2) the BEV layout is directly predicted from the front-view image without using any depth-related information, although the depth map contains useful geometry clues for inferring scene layouts. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a novel joint perception framework named JPerceiver, which can simultaneously estimate scale-aware depth and VO as well as BEV layout from a monocular video sequence. It exploits the cross-view geometric transformation (CGT) to propagate the absolute scale from the road layout to depth and VO based on a carefully-designed scale loss. Meanwhile, a cross-view and cross-modal transfer (CCT) module is devised to leverage the depth clues for reasoning road and vehicle layout through an attention mechanism. JPerceiver can be trained in an end-to-end multi-task learning way, where the CGT scale loss and CCT module promote inter-task knowledge transfer to benefit feature learning of each task. Experiments on Argoverse, Nuscenes and KITTI show the superiority of JPerceiver over existing methods on all the above three tasks in terms of accuracy, model size, and inference speed.

- **Summary**: Human identification is a key requirement for many applications in everyday life, such as personalized services, automatic surveillance, continuous authentication, and contact tracing during pandemics, etc. This work studies the problem of cross-modal human re-identification (ReID), in response to the regular human movements across camera-allowed regions (e.g., streets) and camera-restricted regions (e.g., offices) deployed with heterogeneous sensors. By leveraging the emerging low-cost RGB-D cameras and mmWave radars, we propose the first-of-its-kind vision-RF system for cross-modal multi-person ReID at the same time. Firstly, to address the fundamental inter-modality discrepancy, we propose a novel signature synthesis algorithm based on the observed specular reflection model of a human body. Secondly, an effective cross-modal deep metric learning model is introduced to deal with interference caused by unsynchronized data across radars and cameras. Through extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, we demonstrate that our proposed system is able to achieve ~92.5% top-1 accuracy and ~97.5% top-5 accuracy out of 56 volunteers. We also show that our proposed system is able to robustly reidentify subjects even when multiple subjects are present in the sensors' field of view.

- **Summary**: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) has been in the spotlight recently because it is an important preprocessing operation for various vision tasks. However, despite advances in deep learning-based methods, RGB-D SOD is still challenging due to the large domain gap between an RGB image and the depth map and low-quality depth maps. To solve this problem, we propose a novel superpixel prototype sampling network (SPSN) architecture. The proposed model splits the input RGB image and depth map into component superpixels to generate component prototypes. We design a prototype sampling network so that the network only samples prototypes corresponding to salient objects. In addition, we propose a reliance selection module to recognize the quality of each RGB and depth feature map and adaptively weight them in proportion to their reliability. The proposed method makes the model robust to inconsistencies between RGB images and depth maps and eliminates the influence of non-salient objects. Our method is evaluated on five popular datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparative experiments.



### Mutual Adaptive Reasoning for Monocular 3D Multi-Person Pose Estimation

- **Summary**: Inter-person occlusion and depth ambiguity make estimating the 3D poses of monocular multiple persons as camera-centric coordinates a challenging problem. Typical top-down frameworks suffer from high computational redundancy with an additional detection stage. By contrast, the bottom-up methods enjoy low computational costs as they are less affected by the number of humans. However, most existing bottom-up methods treat camera-centric 3D human pose estimation as two unrelated subtasks: 2.5D pose estimation and camera-centric depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a unified model that leverages the mutual benefits of both these subtasks. Within the framework, a robust structured 2.5D pose estimation is designed to recognize inter-person occlusion based on depth relationships. Additionally, we develop an end-to-end geometry-aware depth reasoning method that exploits the mutual benefits of both 2.5D pose and camera-centric root depths. This method first uses 2.5D pose and geometry information to infer camera-centric root depths in a forward pass, and then exploits the root depths to further improve representation learning of 2.5D pose estimation in a backward pass. Further, we designed an adaptive fusion scheme that leverages both visual perception and body geometry to alleviate inherent depth ambiguity issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over a wide range of bottom-up methods. Our accuracy is even competitive with top-down counterparts. Notably, our model runs much faster than existing bottom-up and top-down methods.

- **Summary**: The current studies of Scene Graph Generation (SGG) focus on solving the long-tailed problem for generating unbiased scene graphs. However, most de-biasing methods overemphasize the tail predicates and underestimate head ones throughout training, thereby wrecking the representation ability of head predicate features. Furthermore, these impaired features from head predicates harm the learning of tail predicates. In fact, the inference of tail predicates heavily depends on the general patterns learned from head ones, e.g., "standing on" depends on "on". Thus, these de-biasing SGG methods can neither achieve excellent performance on tail predicates nor satisfying behaviors on head ones. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-branch Hybrid Learning network (DHL) to take care of both head predicates and tail ones for SGG, including a Coarse-grained Learning Branch (CLB) and a Fine-grained Learning Branch (FLB). Specifically, the CLB is responsible for learning expertise and robust features of head predicates, while the FLB is expected to predict informative tail predicates. Furthermore, DHL is equipped with a Branch Curriculum Schedule (BCS) to make the two branches work well together. Experiments show that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on VG and GQA datasets and makes a trade-off between the performance of tail predicates and head ones. Moreover, extensive experiments on two downstream tasks (i.e., Image Captioning and Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval) further verify the generalization and practicability of our method.

- **Summary**: It is feasible to recognize the presence and seriousness of eye disease by investigating the progressions in retinal biological structure. Fundus examination is a diagnostic procedure to examine the biological structure and anomaly of the eye. Ophthalmic diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cataract are the main reason for visual impairment around the world. Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR-5K) is a benchmark structured fundus image dataset utilized by researchers for multi-label multi-disease classification of fundus images. This work presents a discriminative kernel convolution network (DKCNet), which explores discriminative region-wise features without adding extra computational cost. DKCNet is composed of an attention block followed by a squeeze and excitation (SE) block. The attention block takes features from the backbone network and generates discriminative feature attention maps. The SE block takes the discriminative feature maps and improves channel interdependencies. Better performance of DKCNet is observed with InceptionResnet backbone network for multi-label classification of ODIR-5K fundus images with 96.08 AUC, 94.28 F1-score and 0.81 kappa score. The proposed method splits the common target label for an eye pair based on the diagnostic keyword. Based on these labels oversampling and undersampling is done to resolve class imbalance. To check the biasness of proposed model towards training data, the model trained on ODIR dataset is tested on three publicly available benchmark datasets. It is found to give good performance on completely unseen fundus images also.

- **Summary**: Plant diseases are the primary cause of crop losses globally, with an impact on the world economy. To deal with these issues, smart agriculture solutions are evolving that combine the Internet of Things and machine learning for early disease detection and control. Many such systems use vision-based machine learning methods for real-time disease detection and diagnosis. With the advancement in deep learning techniques, new methods have emerged that employ convolutional neural networks for plant disease detection and identification. Another trend in vision-based deep learning is the use of vision transformers, which have proved to be powerful models for classification and other problems. However, vision transformers have rarely been investigated for plant pathology applications. In this study, a Vision Transformer enabled Convolutional Neural Network model called "PlantXViT" is proposed for plant disease identification. The proposed model combines the capabilities of traditional convolutional neural networks with the Vision Transformers to efficiently identify a large number of plant diseases for several crops. The proposed model has a lightweight structure with only 0.8 million trainable parameters, which makes it suitable for IoT-based smart agriculture services. The performance of PlantXViT is evaluated on five publicly available datasets. The proposed PlantXViT network performs better than five state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets. The average accuracy for recognising plant diseases is shown to exceed 93.55%, 92.59%, and 98.33% on Apple, Maize, and Rice datasets, respectively, even under challenging background conditions. The efficiency in terms of explainability of the proposed model is evaluated using gradient-weighted class activation maps and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation.

- **Summary**: Euler's elastica constitute an appealing variational image inpainting model. It minimises an energy that involves the total variation as well as the level line curvature. These components are transparent and make it attractive for shape completion tasks. However, its gradient flow is a singular, anisotropic, and nonlinear PDE of fourth order, which is numerically challenging: It is difficult to find efficient algorithms that offer sharp edges and good rotation invariance. As a remedy, we design the first neural algorithm that simulates inpainting with Euler's Elastica. We use the deep energy concept which employs the variational energy as neural network loss. Furthermore, we pair it with a deep image prior where the network architecture itself acts as a prior. This yields better inpaintings by steering the optimisation trajectory closer to the desired solution. Our results are qualitatively on par with state-of-the-art algorithms on elastica-based shape completion. They combine good rotation invariance with sharp edges. Moreover, we benefit from the high efficiency and effortless parallelisation within a neural framework. Our neural elastica approach only requires 3x3 central difference stencils. It is thus much simpler than other well-performing algorithms for elastica inpainting. Last but not least, it is unsupervised as it requires no ground truth training data.

- **Summary**: While the research on image background restoration from regular size of degraded images has achieved remarkable progress, restoring ultra high-resolution (e.g., 4K) images remains an extremely challenging task due to the explosion of computational complexity and memory usage, as well as the deficiency of annotated data. In this paper we present a novel model for ultra high-resolution image restoration, referred to as the Global-Local Stepwise Generative Network (GLSGN), which employs a stepwise restoring strategy involving four restoring pathways: three local pathways and one global pathway. The local pathways focus on conducting image restoration in a fine-grained manner over local but high-resolution image patches, while the global pathway performs image restoration coarsely on the scale-down but intact image to provide cues for the local pathways in a global view including semantics and noise patterns. To smooth the mutual collaboration between these four pathways, our GLSGN is designed to ensure the inter-pathway consistency in four aspects in terms of low-level content, perceptual attention, restoring intensity and high-level semantics, respectively. As another major contribution of this work, we also introduce the first ultra high-resolution dataset to date for both reflection removal and rain streak removal, comprising 4,670 real-world and synthetic images. Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for image background restoration, including image reflection removal, image rain streak removal and image dehazing, show that our GLSGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, several spatial-temporal memory-based methods have verified that storing intermediate frames and their masks as memory are helpful to segment target objects in videos. However, they mainly focus on better matching between the current frame and the memory frames without explicitly paying attention to the quality of the memory. Therefore, frames with poor segmentation masks are prone to be memorized, which leads to a segmentation mask error accumulation problem and further affect the segmentation performance. In addition, the linear increase of memory frames with the growth of frame number also limits the ability of the models to handle long videos. To this end, we propose a Quality-aware Dynamic Memory Network (QDMN) to evaluate the segmentation quality of each frame, allowing the memory bank to selectively store accurately segmented frames to prevent the error accumulation problem. Then, we combine the segmentation quality with temporal consistency to dynamically update the memory bank to improve the practicability of the models. Without any bells and whistles, our QDMN achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both DAVIS and YouTube-VOS benchmarks. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Quality Assessment Module (QAM) can be applied to memory-based methods as generic plugins and significantly improves performance.

- **Summary**: Behavioral and semantic relationships play a vital role on intelligent self-driving vehicles and ADAS systems. Different from other research focused on trajectory, position, and bounding boxes, relationship data provides a human understandable description of the object's behavior, and it could describe an object's past and future status in an amazingly brief way. Therefore it is a fundamental method for tasks such as risk detection, environment understanding, and decision making. In this paper, we propose RSG-Net (Road Scene Graph Net): a graph convolutional network designed to predict potential semantic relationships from object proposals, and produces a graph-structured result, called "Road Scene Graph". The experimental results indicate that this network, trained on Road Scene Graph dataset, could efficiently predict potential semantic relationships among objects around the ego-vehicle.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have exhibited remarkable performance in image super-resolution (SR) tasks by learning a mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. However, the SR problem is typically an ill-posed problem and existing methods would come with several limitations. First, the possible mapping space of SR can be extremely large since there may exist many different HR images that can be downsampled to the same LR image. As a result, it is hard to directly learn a promising SR mapping from such a large space. Second, it is often inevitable to develop very large models with extremely high computational cost to yield promising SR performance. In practice, one can use model compression techniques to obtain compact models by reducing model redundancy. Nevertheless, it is hard for existing model compression methods to accurately identify the redundant components due to the extremely large SR mapping space. To alleviate the first challenge, we propose a dual regression learning scheme to reduce the space of possible SR mappings. Specifically, in addition to the mapping from LR to HR images, we learn an additional dual regression mapping to estimate the downsampling kernel and reconstruct LR images. In this way, the dual mapping acts as a constraint to reduce the space of possible mappings. To address the second challenge, we propose a lightweight dual regression compression method to reduce model redundancy in both layer-level and channel-level based on channel pruning. Specifically, we first develop a channel number search method that minimizes the dual regression loss to determine the redundancy of each layer. Given the searched channel numbers, we further exploit the dual regression manner to evaluate the importance of channels and prune the redundant ones. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in obtaining accurate and efficient SR models.

- **Summary**: For retinal image matching (RIM), we propose SuperRetina, the first end-to-end method with jointly trainable keypoint detector and descriptor. SuperRetina is trained in a novel semi-supervised manner. A small set of (nearly 100) images are incompletely labeled and used to supervise the network to detect keypoints on the vascular tree. To attack the incompleteness of manual labeling, we propose Progressive Keypoint Expansion to enrich the keypoint labels at each training epoch. By utilizing a keypoint-based improved triplet loss as its description loss, SuperRetina produces highly discriminative descriptors at full input image size. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets justify the viability of SuperRetina. Even with manual labeling replaced by auto labeling and thus making the training process fully manual-annotation free, SuperRetina compares favorably against a number of strong baselines for two RIM tasks, i.e. image registration and identity verification. SuperRetina will be open source.

- **Summary**: Low-cost autonomous agents including autonomous driving vehicles chiefly adopt monocular 3D object detection to perceive surrounding environment. This paper studies 3D intermediate representation methods which generate intermediate 3D features for subsequent tasks. For example, the 3D features can be taken as input for not only detection, but also end-to-end prediction and/or planning that require a bird's-eye-view feature representation. In the study, we found that in generating 3D representation previous methods do not maintain the consistency between the objects' implicit poses in the latent space, especially orientations, and the explicitly observed poses in the Euclidean space, which can substantially hurt model performance. To tackle this problem, we present a novel monocular detection method, the first one being aware of the poses to purposefully guarantee that they are consistent between the implicit and explicit features. Additionally, we introduce a local ray attention mechanism to efficiently transform image features to voxels at accurate 3D locations. Thirdly, we propose a handcrafted Gaussian positional encoding function, which outperforms the sinusoidal encoding function while retaining the benefit of being continuous. Results show that our method improves the state-of-the-art 3D intermediate representation method by 3.15%. We are ranked 1st among all the reported monocular methods on both 3D and BEV detection benchmark on KITTI leaderboard as of th result's submission time.

- **Summary**: When a high-resolution (HR) image is degraded into a low-resolution (LR) image, the image loses some of the existing information. Consequently, multiple HR images can correspond to the LR image. Most of the existing methods do not consider the uncertainty caused by the stochastic attribute, which can only be probabilistically inferred. Therefore, the predicted HR images are often blurry because the network tries to reflect all possibilities in a single output image. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel face super-resolution (SR) scheme to take into the uncertainty by stochastic modeling. Specifically, the information in LR images is separately encoded into deterministic and stochastic attributes. Furthermore, an Input Conditional Attribute Predictor is proposed and separately trained to predict the partially alive stochastic attributes from only the LR images. Extensive evaluation shows that the proposed method successfully reduces the uncertainty in the learning process and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an object-based camera pose estimation from a single RGB image and a pre-built map of objects, represented with ellipsoidal models. We show that contrary to point correspondences, the definition of a cost function characterizing the projection of a 3D object onto a 2D object detection is not straightforward. We develop an ellipse-ellipse cost based on level sets sampling, demonstrate its nice properties for handling partially visible objects and compare its performance with other common metrics. Finally, we show that the use of a predictive uncertainty on the detected ellipses allows a fair weighting of the contribution of the correspondences which improves the computed pose.

- **Summary**: Recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable results in image synthesis by gradually removing noise and amplifying signals. Although the simple generative process surprisingly works well, is this the best way to generate image data? For instance, despite the fact that human perception is more sensitive to the low frequencies of an image, diffusion models themselves do not consider any relative importance of each frequency component. Therefore, to incorporate the inductive bias for image data, we propose a novel generative process that synthesizes images in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, we generalize the standard diffusion models by enabling diffusion in a rotated coordinate system with different velocities for each component of the vector. We further propose a blur diffusion as a special case, where each frequency component of an image is diffused at different speeds. Specifically, the proposed blur diffusion consists of a forward process that blurs an image and adds noise gradually, after which a corresponding reverse process deblurs an image and removes noise progressively. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the previous method in FID on LSUN bedroom and church datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/sangyun884/blur-diffusion.

- **Summary**: Most existing compound facial expression recognition (FER) methods rely on large-scale labeled compound expression data for training. However, collecting such data is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we address the compound FER task in the cross-domain few-shot learning (FSL) setting, which requires only a few samples of compound expressions in the target domain. Specifically, we propose a novel cascaded decomposition network (CDNet), which cascades several learn-to-decompose modules with shared parameters based on a sequential decomposition mechanism, to obtain a transferable feature space. To alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited base classes in our task, a partial regularization strategy is designed to effectively exploit the best of both episodic training and batch training. By training across similar tasks on multiple basic expression datasets, CDNet learns the ability of learn-to-decompose that can be easily adapted to identify unseen compound expressions. Extensive experiments on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild compound expression datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CDNet against several state-of-the-art FSL methods.

- **Summary**: Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging task that requires to distinguish the interaction between a human-object pair. Attention based relation parsing is a popular and effective strategy utilized in HOI. However, current methods execute relation parsing in a "bottom-up" manner. We argue that the independent use of the bottom-up parsing strategy in HOI is counter-intuitive and could lead to the diffusion of attention. Therefore, we introduce a novel knowledge-guided top-down attention into HOI, and propose to model the relation parsing as a "look and search" process: execute scene-context modeling (i.e. look), and then, given the knowledge of the target pair, search visual clues for the discrimination of the interaction between the pair. We implement the process via unifying the bottom-up and top-down attention in a single encoder-decoder based model. The experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performance on the V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets.

- **Summary**: We propose DiffuStereo, a novel system using only sparse cameras (8 in this work) for high-quality 3D human reconstruction. At its core is a novel diffusion-based stereo module, which introduces diffusion models, a type of powerful generative models, into the iterative stereo matching network. To this end, we design a new diffusion kernel and additional stereo constraints to facilitate stereo matching and depth estimation in the network. We further present a multi-level stereo network architecture to handle high-resolution (up to 4k) inputs without requiring unaffordable memory footprint. Given a set of sparse-view color images of a human, the proposed multi-level diffusion-based stereo network can produce highly accurate depth maps, which are then converted into a high-quality 3D human model through an efficient multi-view fusion strategy. Overall, our method enables automatic reconstruction of human models with quality on par to high-end dense-view camera rigs, and this is achieved using a much more light-weight hardware setup. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: In this work, we focus on generating graphical representations of noisy, instructional videos for video understanding. We propose a self-supervised, interpretable approach that does not require any annotations for graphical representations, which would be expensive and time consuming to collect. We attempt to overcome "black box" learning limitations by presenting Semantic Video Graph or SVGraph, a multi-modal approach that utilizes narrations for semantic interpretability of the learned graphs. SVGraph 1) relies on the agreement between multiple modalities to learn a unified graphical structure with the help of cross-modal attention and 2) assigns semantic interpretation with the help of Semantic-Assignment, which captures the semantics from video narration. We perform experiments on multiple datasets and demonstrate the interpretability of SVGraph in semantic graph learning.

- **Summary**: A self-supervised multi-task learning (SSMTL) framework for video anomaly detection was recently introduced in literature. Due to its highly accurate results, the method attracted the attention of many researchers. In this work, we revisit the self-supervised multi-task learning framework, proposing several updates to the original method. First, we study various detection methods, e.g. based on detecting high-motion regions using optical flow or background subtraction, since we believe the currently used pre-trained YOLOv3 is suboptimal, e.g. objects in motion or objects from unknown classes are never detected. Second, we modernize the 3D convolutional backbone by introducing multi-head self-attention modules, inspired by the recent success of vision transformers. As such, we alternatively introduce both 2D and 3D convolutional vision transformer (CvT) blocks. Third, in our attempt to further improve the model, we study additional self-supervised learning tasks, such as predicting segmentation maps through knowledge distillation, solving jigsaw puzzles, estimating body pose through knowledge distillation, predicting masked regions (inpainting), and adversarial learning with pseudo-anomalies. We conduct experiments to assess the performance impact of the introduced changes. Upon finding more promising configurations of the framework, dubbed SSMTL++v1 and SSMTL++v2, we extend our preliminary experiments to more data sets, demonstrating that our performance gains are consistent across all data sets. In most cases, our results on Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal raise the state-of-the-art performance bar to a new level.

- **Summary**: Monitoring vegetation productivity at extremely fine resolutions is valuable for real-world agricultural applications, such as detecting crop stress and providing early warning of food insecurity. Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) provides a promising way to directly measure plant productivity from space. However, satellite SIF observations are only available at a coarse spatial resolution, making it impossible to monitor how individual crop types or farms are doing. This poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression (or downscaling) task; at training time, we only have SIF labels at a coarse resolution (3km), but we want to predict SIF at much finer spatial resolutions (e.g. 30m, a 100x increase). We also have additional fine-resolution input features, but the relationship between these features and SIF is unknown. To address this, we propose Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net (CS-SUNet), a novel method for this coarse supervision setting. CS-SUNet combines the expressive power of deep convolutional networks with novel regularization methods based on prior knowledge (such as a smoothness loss) that are crucial for preventing overfitting. Experiments show that CS-SUNet resolves fine-grained variations in SIF more accurately than existing methods.

- **Summary**: Generating representations of video data is of key importance in advancing the field of machine perception. Most current techniques rely on hand-annotated data, which can be difficult to work with, expensive to generate, and hard to scale. In this work, we propose a novel learning approach based on contrastive learning, LAVA, which is capable of learning joint language, audio, and video representations in a self-supervised manner. We pre-train LAVA on the Kinetics 700 dataset using transformer encoders to learn representations for each modality. We then demonstrate that LAVA performs competitively with the current state-of-the-art self-supervised and weakly-supervised pretraining techniques on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 video action recognition while using a fraction of the unlabeled data.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging is the most important tool for detecting complications in the inner body of medicine. Nowadays, with the development of image processing technology as well as changing the size of photos to higher resolution images in the field of digital medical imaging, there is an efficient and accurate system for segmenting this. Real-world images that for a variety of reasons have poor heterogeneity, noise and contrast are essential. Digital image segmentation in medicine is used for diagnostic and therapeutic analysis, which is very helpful for physicians. In this study, we aim at liver cancer photographs, which aim to more accurately detect the lesion or tumor of the liver because accurate and timely detection of the tumor is very important in the survival and life of the patient.The aim of this paper is to simplify the obnoxious study problems related to the study of MR images. The liver is the second organ most generic involved by metastatic disease being liver cancer one of the prominent causes of death worldwide. Without healthy liver a person cannot survive. It is life threatening disease which is very challenging perceptible for both medical and engineering technologists. Medical image processing is used as a non-invasive method to detect tumours. The chances of survival having liver Tumor highly depends on early detection of Tumor and then classification as cancerous and noncancerous tumours. Image processing techniques for automatic detection of brain are includes pre-processing and enhancement, image segmentation, classification and volume calculation, Poly techniques have been developed for the detection of liver Tumor and different liver toM oR detection algorithms and methodologies utilized for Tumor diagnosis. Novel methodology for the detection and diagnosis of liver Tumor.

- **Summary**: Deep networks should be robust to rare events if they are to be successfully deployed in high-stakes real-world applications (e.g., self-driving cars). Here we study the capability of deep networks to recognize objects in unusual poses. We create a synthetic dataset of images of objects in unusual orientations, and evaluate the robustness of a collection of 38 recent and competitive deep networks for image classification. We show that classifying these images is still a challenge for all networks tested, with an average accuracy drop of 29.5% compared to when the objects are presented upright. This brittleness is largely unaffected by various network design choices, such as training losses (e.g., supervised vs. self-supervised), architectures (e.g., convolutional networks vs. transformers), dataset modalities (e.g., images vs. image-text pairs), and data-augmentation schemes. However, networks trained on very large datasets substantially outperform others, with the best network tested$\unicode{x2014}$Noisy Student EfficentNet-L2 trained on JFT-300M$\unicode{x2014}$showing a relatively small accuracy drop of only 14.5% on unusual poses. Nevertheless, a visual inspection of the failures of Noisy Student reveals a remaining gap in robustness with the human visual system. Furthermore, combining multiple object transformations$\unicode{x2014}$3D-rotations and scaling$\unicode{x2014}$further degrades the performance of all networks. Altogether, our results provide another measurement of the robustness of deep networks that is important to consider when using them in the real world.

- **Summary**: Spatial resolution of medical images can be improved using super-resolution methods. Real Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) is one of the recent effective approaches utilized to produce higher resolution images, given input images of lower resolution. In this paper, we apply this method to enhance the spatial resolution of 2D MR images. In our proposed approach, we slightly modify the structure of the Real-ESRGAN to train 2D Magnetic Resonance images (MRI) taken from the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2018 dataset. The obtained results are validated qualitatively and quantitatively by computing SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure), NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) values.

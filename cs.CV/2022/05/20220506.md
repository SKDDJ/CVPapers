- **Summary**: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a formal framework for training machine learning models with individual example level privacy. In the field of deep learning, Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) has emerged as a popular private training algorithm. Unfortunately, the computational cost of training large-scale models with DP-SGD is substantially higher than non-private training. This is further exacerbated by the fact that increasing the number of parameters leads to larger degradation in utility with DP. In this work, we zoom in on the ImageNet dataset and demonstrate that, similar to the non-private case, pre-training over-parameterized models on a large public dataset can lead to substantial gains when the model is finetuned privately. Moreover, by systematically comparing private and non-private models across a range of large batch sizes, we find that similar to non-private setting, choice of optimizer can further improve performance substantially with DP. By using LAMB optimizer with DP-SGD we saw improvement of up to 20$\%$ points (absolute). Finally, we show that finetuning just the last layer for a \emph{single step} in the full batch setting, combined with extremely small-scale (near-zero) initialization leads to both SOTA results of 81.7 $\%$ under a wide privacy budget range of $\epsilon \in [4, 10]$ and $\delta$ = $10^{-6}$ while minimizing the computational overhead substantially.

- **Summary**: Recently, synthesizing personalized characters from a single user-given portrait has received remarkable attention as a drastic popularization of social media and the metaverse. The input image is not always in frontal view, thus it is important to acquire or predict canonical view for 3D modeling or other applications. Although the progress of generative models enables the stylization of a portrait, obtaining the stylized image in canonical view is still a challenging task. There have been several studies on face frontalization but their performance significantly decreases when input is not in the real image domain, e.g., cartoon or painting. Stylizing after frontalization also results in degenerated output. In this paper, we propose a novel and unified framework which generates stylized portraits in canonical view. With a proposed latent mapper, we analyze and discover frontalization mapping in a latent space of StyleGAN to stylize and frontalize at once. In addition, our model can be trained with unlabelled 2D image sets, without any 3D supervision. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by experimental results.

- **Summary**: Multi-view point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D reconstruction. Since there are close connections between point clouds captured from different viewpoints, registration performance can be enhanced if these connections be harnessed properly. Therefore, this paper models the registration problem as multi-task optimization, and proposes a novel bi-channel knowledge sharing mechanism for effective and efficient problem solving. The modeling of multi-view point cloud registration as multi-task optimization are twofold. By simultaneously considering the local accuracy of two point clouds as well as the global consistency posed by all the point clouds involved, a fitness function with an adaptive threshold is derived. Also a framework of the co-evolutionary search process is defined for the concurrent optimization of multiple fitness functions belonging to related tasks. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, the proposed bi-channel knowledge sharing mechanism plays its role. The intra-task knowledge sharing introduces aiding tasks that are much simpler to solve, and useful information is shared across aiding tasks and the original tasks, accelerating the search process. The inter-task knowledge sharing explores commonalities buried among the original tasks, aiming to prevent tasks from getting stuck to local optima. Comprehensive experiments conducted on model object as well as scene point clouds show the efficacy of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: MRI-based modeling of brain networks has been widely used to understand functional and structural interactions and connections among brain regions, and factors that affect them, such as brain development and disease. Graph mining on brain networks may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers for clinical phenotypes and neurodegenerative diseases. Since brain networks derived from functional and structural MRI describe the brain topology from different perspectives, exploring a representation that combines these cross-modality brain networks is non-trivial. Most current studies aim to extract a fused representation of the two types of brain network by projecting the structural network to the functional counterpart. Since the functional network is dynamic and the structural network is static, mapping a static object to a dynamic object is suboptimal. However, mapping in the opposite direction is not feasible due to the non-negativity requirement of current graph learning techniques. Here, we propose a novel graph learning framework, known as Deep Signed Brain Networks (DSBN), with a signed graph encoder that, from an opposite perspective, learns the cross-modality representations by projecting the functional network to the structural counterpart. We validate our framework on clinical phenotype and neurodegenerative disease prediction tasks using two independent, publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses the lack of labeled data by exploiting large unlabeled data through pseudolabeling. However, in the extremely low-label regime, pseudo labels could be incorrect, a.k.a. the confirmation bias, and the pseudo labels will in turn harm the network training. Recent studies combined finetuning (FT) from pretrained weights with SSL to mitigate the challenges and claimed superior results in the low-label regime. In this work, we first show that the better pretrained weights brought in by FT account for the state-of-the-art performance, and importantly that they are universally helpful to off-the-shelf semi-supervised learners. We further argue that direct finetuning from pretrained weights is suboptimal due to covariate shift and propose a contrastive target pretraining step to adapt model weights towards target dataset. We carried out extensive experiments on both classification and segmentation tasks by doing target pretraining then followed by semi-supervised finetuning. The promising results validate the efficacy of target pretraining for SSL, in particular in the low-label regime.

- **Summary**: Surgery is a high-stakes domain where surgeons must navigate critical anatomical structures and actively avoid potential complications while achieving the main task at hand. Such surgical activity has been shown to affect long-term patient outcomes. To better understand this relationship, whose mechanics remain unknown for the majority of surgical procedures, we hypothesize that the core elements of surgery must first be quantified in a reliable, objective, and scalable manner. We believe this is a prerequisite for the provision of surgical feedback and modulation of surgeon performance in pursuit of improved patient outcomes. To holistically quantify surgeries, we propose a unified deep learning framework, entitled Roboformer, which operates exclusively on videos recorded during surgery to independently achieve multiple tasks: surgical phase recognition (the what of surgery), gesture classification and skills assessment (the how of surgery). We validated our framework on four video-based datasets of two commonly-encountered types of steps (dissection and suturing) within minimally-invasive robotic surgeries. We demonstrated that our framework can generalize well to unseen videos, surgeons, medical centres, and surgical procedures. We also found that our framework, which naturally lends itself to explainable findings, identified relevant information when achieving a particular task. These findings are likely to instill surgeons with more confidence in our framework's behaviour, increasing the likelihood of clinical adoption, and thus paving the way for more targeted surgical feedback.

- **Summary**: Video captioning aims to understand the spatio-temporal semantic concept of the video and generate descriptive sentences. The de-facto approach to this task dictates a text generator to learn from \textit{offline-extracted} motion or appearance features from \textit{pre-trained} vision models. However, these methods may suffer from the so-called \textbf{\textit{"couple"}} drawbacks on both \textit{video spatio-temporal representation} and \textit{sentence generation}. For the former, \textbf{\textit{"couple"}} means learning spatio-temporal representation in a single model(3DCNN), resulting the problems named \emph{disconnection in task/pre-train domain} and \emph{hard for end-to-end training}. As for the latter, \textbf{\textit{"couple"}} means treating the generation of visual semantic and syntax-related words equally. To this end, we present $\mathcal{D}^{2}$ - a dual-level decoupled transformer pipeline to solve the above drawbacks: \emph{(i)} for video spatio-temporal representation, we decouple the process of it into "first-spatial-then-temporal" paradigm, releasing the potential of using dedicated model(\textit{e.g.} image-text pre-training) to connect the pre-training and downstream tasks, and makes the entire model end-to-end trainable. \emph{(ii)} for sentence generation, we propose \emph{Syntax-Aware Decoder} to dynamically measure the contribution of visual semantic and syntax-related words. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks (MSVD, MSR-VTT and VATEX) have shown great potential of the proposed $\mathcal{D}^{2}$ and surpassed the previous methods by a large margin in the task of video captioning.

- **Summary**: Continual learning is a challenging real-world problem for constructing a mature AI system when data are provided in a streaming fashion. Despite recent progress in continual classification, the researches of continual object detection are impeded by the diverse sizes and numbers of objects in each image. Different from previous works that tune the whole network for all tasks, in this work, we present a simple and flexible framework for continual object detection via pRotOtypical taSk corrElaTion guided gaTing mechAnism (ROSETTA). Concretely, a unified framework is shared by all tasks while task-aware gates are introduced to automatically select sub-models for specific tasks. In this way, various knowledge can be successively memorized by storing their corresponding sub-model weights in this system. To make ROSETTA automatically determine which experience is available and useful, a prototypical task correlation guided Gating Diversity Controller(GDC) is introduced to adaptively adjust the diversity of gates for the new task based on class-specific prototypes. GDC module computes class-to-class correlation matrix to depict the cross-task correlation, and hereby activates more exclusive gates for the new task if a significant domain gap is observed. Comprehensive experiments on COCO-VOC, KITTI-Kitchen, class-incremental detection on VOC and sequential learning of four tasks show that ROSETTA yields state-of-the-art performance on both task-based and class-based continual object detection.

- **Summary**: The data representation in a machine-learning model strongly influences its performance. This becomes even more important for quantum machine learning models implemented on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Encoding high dimensional data into a quantum circuit for a NISQ device without any loss of information is not trivial and brings a lot of challenges. While simple encoding schemes (like single qubit rotational gates to encode high dimensional data) often lead to information loss within the circuit, complex encoding schemes with entanglement and data re-uploading lead to an increase in the encoding gate count. This is not well-suited for NISQ devices. This work proposes 'incremental data-uploading', a novel encoding pattern for high dimensional data that tackles these challenges. We spread the encoding gates for the feature vector of a given data point throughout the quantum circuit with parameterized gates in between them. This encoding pattern results in a better representation of data in the quantum circuit with a minimal pre-processing requirement. We show the efficiency of our encoding pattern on a classification task using the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, and compare different encoding methods via classification accuracy and the effective dimension of the model.

- **Summary**: Acute leukemia is a type of blood cancer with a high mortality rate. Current therapeutic methods include bone marrow transplantation, supportive therapy, and chemotherapy. Although a satisfactory remission of the disease can be achieved, the risk of recurrence is still high. Therefore, novel treatments are demanding. Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a promising approach to treat and cure acute leukemia. To harness the therapeutic potential of CAR-T cell therapy for blood diseases, reliable cell morphological identification is crucial. Nevertheless, the identification of CAR-T cells is a big challenge posed by their phenotypic similarity with other blood cells. To address this substantial clinical challenge, herein we first construct a CAR-T dataset with 500 original microscopy images after staining. Following that, we create a novel integrated model called RCMNet (ResNet18 with CBAM and MHSA) that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer. The model shows 99.63% top-1 accuracy on the public dataset. Compared with previous reports, our model obtains satisfactory results for image classification. Although testing on the CAR-T cells dataset, a decent performance is observed, which is attributed to the limited size of the dataset. Transfer learning is adapted for RCMNet and a maximum of 83.36% accuracy has been achieved, which is higher than other SOTA models. The study evaluates the effectiveness of RCMNet on a big public dataset and translates it to a clinical dataset for diagnostic applications.

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques have shown great potential in medical image processing, particularly through accurate and reliable image segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or computed tomography (CT) scans, which allow the localization and diagnosis of lesions. However, training these segmentation models requires a large number of manually annotated pixel-level labels, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, in contrast to image-level labels that are easier to obtain. It is imperative to resolve this problem through weakly-supervised semantic segmentation models using image-level labels as supervision since it can significantly reduce human annotation efforts. Most of the advanced solutions exploit class activation mapping (CAM). However, the original CAMs rarely capture the precise boundaries of lesions. In this study, we propose the strategy of multi-scale inference to refine CAMs by reducing the detail loss in single-scale reasoning. For segmentation, we develop a novel model named Mixed-UNet, which has two parallel branches in the decoding phase. The results can be obtained after fusing the extracted features from two branches. We evaluate the designed Mixed-UNet against several prevalent deep learning-based segmentation approaches on our dataset collected from the local hospital and public datasets. The validation results demonstrate that our model surpasses available methods under the same supervision level in the segmentation of various lesions from brain imaging.

- **Summary**: Synthetic datasets have successfully been used to probe visual question-answering datasets for their reasoning abilities. CLEVR (johnson2017clevr), for example, tests a range of visual reasoning abilities. The questions in CLEVR focus on comparisons of shapes, colors, and sizes, numerical reasoning, and existence claims. This paper introduces a minimally biased, diagnostic visual question-answering dataset, QLEVR, that goes beyond existential and numerical quantification and focus on more complex quantifiers and their combinations, e.g., asking whether there are more than two red balls that are smaller than at least three blue balls in an image. We describe how the dataset was created and present a first evaluation of state-of-the-art visual question-answering models, showing that QLEVR presents a formidable challenge to our current models.

- **Summary**: The integration of the modern Machine Learning (ML) models into remote sensing and agriculture has expanded the scope of the application of satellite images in the agriculture domain. In this paper, we present how the accuracy of crop type identification improves as we move from medium-spatiotemporal-resolution (MSTR) to high-spatiotemporal-resolution (HSTR) satellite images. We further demonstrate that high spectral resolution in satellite imagery can improve prediction performance for low spatial and temporal resolutions (LSTR) images. The F1-score is increased by 7% when using multispectral data of MSTR images as compared to the best results obtained from HSTR images. Similarly, when crop season based time series of multispectral data is used we observe an increase of 1.2% in the F1-score. The outcome motivates further advancements in the field of synthetic band generation.

- **Summary**: Uncertainty quantification in a neural network is one of the most discussed topics for safety-critical applications. Though Neural Networks (NNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for many applications, they still provide unreliable point predictions, which lack information about uncertainty estimates. Among various methods to enable neural networks to estimate uncertainty, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout has gained much popularity in a short period due to its simplicity. In this study, we present a new version of the traditional dropout layer where we are able to fix the number of dropout configurations. As such, each layer can take and apply the new dropout layer in the MC method to quantify the uncertainty associated with NN predictions. We conduct experiments on both toy and realistic datasets and compare the results with the MC method using the traditional dropout layer. Performance analysis utilizing uncertainty evaluation metrics corroborates that our dropout layer offers better performance in most cases.

- **Summary**: Supervised person re-identification methods rely heavily on high-quality cross-camera training label. This significantly hinders the deployment of re-ID models in real-world applications. The unsupervised person re-ID methods can reduce the cost of data annotation, but their performance is still far lower than the supervised ones. In this paper, we make full use of the auxiliary information mined from the datasets for multi-modal feature learning, including camera information, temporal information and spatial information. By analyzing the style bias of cameras, the characteristics of pedestrians' motion trajectories and the positions of camera network, this paper designs three modules: Time-Overlapping Constraint (TOC), Spatio-Temporal Similarity (STS) and Same-Camera Penalty (SCP) to exploit the auxiliary information. Auxiliary information can improve the model performance and inference accuracy by constructing association constraints or fusing with visual features. In addition, this paper proposes three effective training tricks, including Restricted Label Smoothing Cross Entropy Loss (RLSCE), Weight Adaptive Triplet Loss (WATL) and Dynamic Training Iterations (DTI). The tricks achieve mAP of 72.4% and 81.1% on MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID, respectively. Combined with auxiliary information exploiting modules, our methods achieve mAP of 89.9% on DukeMTMC, where TOC, STS and SCP all contributed considerable performance improvements. The method proposed by this paper outperforms most existing unsupervised re-ID methods and narrows the gap between unsupervised and supervised re-ID methods.

- **Summary**: In stereoscope-based Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MIS), dense stereo matching plays an indispensable role in 3D shape recovery, AR, VR, and navigation tasks. Although numerous Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches are proposed, the conventional prior-free approaches are still popular in the industry because of the lack of open-source annotated data set and the limitation of the task-specific pre-trained DNNs. Among the prior-free stereo matching algorithms, there is no successful real-time algorithm in none GPU environment for MIS. This paper proposes the first CPU-level real-time prior-free stereo matching algorithm for general MIS tasks. We achieve an average 17 Hz on 640*480 images with a single-core CPU (i5-9400) for surgical images. Meanwhile, it achieves slightly better accuracy than the popular ELAS. The patch-based fast disparity searching algorithm is adopted for the rectified stereo images. A coarse-to-fine Bayesian probability and a spatial Gaussian mixed model were proposed to evaluate the patch probability at different scales. An optional probability density function estimation algorithm was adopted to quantify the prediction variance. Extensive experiments demonstrated the proposed method's capability to handle ambiguities introduced by the textureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency from the non-Lambertian reflectance and dark illumination. The estimated probability managed to balance the confidences of the patches for stereo images at different scales. It has similar or higher accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline ELAS in MIS, while it is 4-5 times faster. The code and the synthetic data sets are available at https://github.com/JingweiSong/BDIS-v2.

- **Summary**: Addressing the annotation challenge in 3D Point Cloud segmentation has inspired research into weakly supervised learning. Existing approaches mainly focus on exploiting manifold and pseudo-labeling to make use of large unlabeled data points. A fundamental challenge here lies in the large intra-class variations of local geometric structure, resulting in subclasses within a semantic class. In this work, we leverage this intuition and opt for maintaining an individual classifier for each subclass. Technically, we design a multi-prototype classifier, each prototype serves as the classifier weights for one subclass. To enable effective updating of multi-prototype classifier weights, we propose two constraints respectively for updating the prototypes w.r.t. all point features and for encouraging the learning of diverse prototypes. Experiments on weakly supervised 3D point cloud segmentation tasks validate the efficacy of proposed method in particular at low-label regime. Our hypothesis is also verified given the consistent discovery of semantic subclasses at no cost of additional annotations.

- **Summary**: The unabated mystique of large-scale neural networks, such as the CLIP dual image-and-text encoder, popularized automatically generated art. Increasingly more sophisticated generators enhanced the artworks' realism and visual appearance, and creative prompt engineering enabled stylistic expression. Guided by an artist-in-the-loop ideal, we design a gradient-based generator to produce collages. It requires the human artist to curate libraries of image patches and to describe (with prompts) the whole image composition, with the option to manually adjust the patches' positions during generation, thereby allowing humans to reclaim some control of the process and achieve greater creative freedom. We explore the aesthetic potentials of high-resolution collages, and provide an open-source Google Colab as an artistic tool.

- **Summary**: Visual question answering (VQA) for remote sensing scene has great potential in intelligent human-computer interaction system. Although VQA in computer vision has been widely researched, VQA for remote sensing data (RSVQA) is still in its infancy. There are two characteristics that need to be specially considered for the RSVQA task. 1) No object annotations are available in RSVQA datasets, which makes it difficult for models to exploit informative region representation; 2) There are questions with clearly different difficulty levels for each image in the RSVQA task. Directly training a model with questions in a random order may confuse the model and limit the performance. To address these two problems, in this paper, a multi-level visual feature learning method is proposed to jointly extract language-guided holistic and regional image features. Besides, a self-paced curriculum learning (SPCL)-based VQA model is developed to train networks with samples in an easy-to-hard way. To be more specific, a language-guided SPCL method with a soft weighting strategy is explored in this work. The proposed model is evaluated on three public datasets, and extensive experimental results show that the proposed RSVQA framework can achieve promising performance.

- **Summary**: Mapping X-ray images, radiology reports, and other medical data as binary codes in the common space, which can assist clinicians to retrieve pathology-related data from heterogeneous modalities (i.e., hashing-based cross-modal medical data retrieval), provides a new view to promot computeraided diagnosis. Nevertheless, there remains a barrier to boost medical retrieval accuracy: how to reveal the ambiguous semantics of medical data without the distraction of superfluous information. To circumvent this drawback, we propose Deep Supervised Information Bottleneck Hashing (DSIBH), which effectively strengthens the discriminability of hash codes. Specifically, the Deep Deterministic Information Bottleneck (Yu, Yu, and Principe 2021) for single modality is extended to the cross-modal scenario. Benefiting from this, the superfluous information is reduced, which facilitates the discriminability of hash codes. Experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed DSIBH compared with state-of-the-arts in cross-modal medical data retrieval tasks.

- **Summary**: CNNs exhibit many behaviors different from humans, one of which is the capability of employing high-frequency components. This paper discusses the frequency bias phenomenon in image classification tasks: the high-frequency components are actually much less exploited than the low- and mid-frequency components. We first investigate the frequency bias phenomenon by presenting two observations on feature discrimination and learning priority. Furthermore, we hypothesize that (i) the spectral density, (ii) class consistency directly affect the frequency bias. Specifically, our investigations verify that the spectral density of datasets mainly affects the learning priority, while the class consistency mainly affects the feature discrimination.

- **Summary**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, computed tomography (CT) is a good way to diagnose COVID-19 patients. HRCT (High-Resolution Computed Tomography) is a form of computed tomography that uses advanced methods to improve image resolution. Publicly accessible COVID-19 CT image datasets are very difficult to come by due to privacy concerns, which impedes the study and development of AI-powered COVID-19 diagnostic algorithms based on CT images. To address this problem, we have introduced HRCTv1-COVID-19, a new COVID-19 high resolution chest CT Scan image dataset that includes not only COVID-19 cases of Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), Crazy Paving, and Air Space Consolidation, but also CT images of cases with negative COVID-19. The HRCTv1-COVID-19 dataset, which includes slice-level, and patient-level labels, has the potential to aid COVID-19 research, especially for diagnosis and differentiation using artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning and deep learning methods. This dataset is accessible through web at: http://databiox.com and includes 181,106 chest HRCT images from 395 patients with four labels: GGO, Crazy Paving, Air Space Consolidation and Negative.

- **Summary**: Moving object segmentation (MOS) is a task to distinguish moving objects, e.g., moving vehicles and pedestrians, from the surrounding static environment. The segmentation accuracy of MOS can have an influence on odometry, map construction, and planning tasks. In this paper, we propose a semantics-guided convolutional neural network for moving object segmentation. The network takes sequential LiDAR range images as inputs. Instead of segmenting the moving objects directly, the network conducts single-scan-based semantic segmentation and multiple-scan-based moving object segmentation in turn. The semantic segmentation module provides semantic priors for the MOS module, where we propose an adjacent scan association (ASA) module to convert the semantic features of adjacent scans into the same coordinate system to fully exploit the cross-scan semantic features. Finally, by analyzing the difference between the transformed features, reliable MOS result can be obtained quickly. Experimental results on the SemanticKITTI MOS dataset proves the effectiveness of our work.

- **Summary**: Reliably predicting future occupancy of highly dynamic urban environments is an important precursor for safe autonomous navigation. Common challenges in the prediction include forecasting the relative position of other vehicles, modelling the dynamics of vehicles subjected to different traffic conditions, and vanishing surrounding objects. To tackle these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal prediction network pipeline that takes the past information from the environment and semantic labels separately for generating future occupancy predictions. Compared to the current SOTA, our approach predicts occupancy for a longer horizon of 3 seconds and in a relatively complex environment from the nuScenes dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate the ability of spatio-temporal networks to understand scene dynamics without the need for HD-Maps and explicit modeling dynamic objects. We publicly release our occupancy grid dataset based on nuScenes to support further research.

- **Summary**: Crowd counting has important applications in public safety and pandemic control. A robust and practical crowd counting system has to be capable of continuously learning with the new incoming domain data in real-world scenarios instead of fitting one domain only. Off-the-shelf methods have some drawbacks when handling multiple domains: (1) the models will achieve limited performance (even drop dramatically) among old domains after training images from new domains due to the discrepancies of intrinsic data distributions from various domains, which is called catastrophic forgetting; (2) the well-trained model in a specific domain achieves imperfect performance among other unseen domains because of the domain shift; and (3) it leads to linearly increasing storage overhead, either mixing all the data for training or simply training dozens of separate models for different domains when new ones are available. To overcome these issues, we investigated a new crowd counting task in the incremental domains training setting called Lifelong Crowd Counting. Its goal is to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting and improve the generalization ability using a single model updated by the incremental domains. Specifically, we propose a self-distillation learning framework as a benchmark (Forget Less, Count Better, or FLCB) for lifelong crowd counting, which helps the model sustainably leverage previous meaningful knowledge for better crowd counting to mitigate the forgetting when the new data arrive. In addition, a new quantitative metric, normalized backward transfer (nBwT), is developed to evaluate the forgetting degree of the model in the lifelong learning process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed benchmark in achieving a low catastrophic forgetting degree and strong generalization ability.

- **Summary**: We present prompt distribution learning for effectively adapting a pre-trained vision-language model to address downstream recognition tasks. Our method not only learns low-bias prompts from a few samples but also captures the distribution of diverse prompts to handle the varying visual representations. In this way, we provide high-quality task-related content for facilitating recognition. This prompt distribution learning is realized by an efficient approach that learns the output embeddings of prompts instead of the input embeddings. Thus, we can employ a Gaussian distribution to model them effectively and derive a surrogate loss for efficient training. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently and significantly outperforms existing methods. For example, with 1 sample per category, it relatively improves the average result by 9.1% compared to human-crafted prompts.

- **Summary**: Dark environment becomes a challenge for computer vision algorithms owing to insufficient photons and undesirable noise. To enhance object detection in a dark environment, we propose a novel multitask auto encoding transformation (MAET) model which is able to explore the intrinsic pattern behind illumination translation. In a self-supervision manner, the MAET learns the intrinsic visual structure by encoding and decoding the realistic illumination-degrading transformation considering the physical noise model and image signal processing (ISP).   Based on this representation, we achieve the object detection task by decoding the bounding box coordinates and classes. To avoid the over-entanglement of two tasks, our MAET disentangles the object and degrading features by imposing an orthogonal tangent regularity. This forms a parametric manifold along which multitask predictions can be geometrically formulated by maximizing the orthogonality between the tangents along the outputs of respective tasks. Our framework can be implemented based on the mainstream object detection architecture and directly trained end-to-end using normal target detection datasets, such as VOC and COCO. We have achieved the state-of-the-art performance using synthetic and real-world datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/cuiziteng/MAET.

- **Summary**: Most of the existing video face super-resolution (VFSR) methods are trained and evaluated on VoxCeleb1, which is designed specifically for speaker identification and the frames in this dataset are of low quality. As a consequence, the VFSR models trained on this dataset can not output visual-pleasing results. In this paper, we develop an automatic and scalable pipeline to collect a high-quality video face dataset (VFHQ), which contains over $16,000$ high-fidelity clips of diverse interview scenarios. To verify the necessity of VFHQ, we further conduct experiments and demonstrate that VFSR models trained on our VFHQ dataset can generate results with sharper edges and finer textures than those trained on VoxCeleb1. In addition, we show that the temporal information plays a pivotal role in eliminating video consistency issues as well as further improving visual performance. Based on VFHQ, by analyzing the benchmarking study of several state-of-the-art algorithms under bicubic and blind settings. See our project page: https://liangbinxie.github.io/projects/vfhq

- **Summary**: Computational methods are driving high impact microscopy techniques such as ptychography. However, the design and implementation of new algorithms is often a laborious process, as many parts of the code are written in close-to-the-hardware programming constructs to speed up the reconstruction. In this paper, we present SciComPty, a new ptychography software framework aiming at simulating ptychography datasets and testing state-of-the-art and new reconstruction algorithms. Despite its simplicity, the software leverages GPU accelerated processing through the PyTorch CUDA interface. This is essential to design new methods that can readily be employed. As an example, we present an improved position refinement method based on Adam and a new version of the rPIE algorithm, adapted for partial coherence setups. Results are shown on both synthetic and real datasets. The software is released as open-source.



### All Grains, One Scheme (AGOS): Learning Multi-grain Instance Representation for Aerial Scene Classification

- **Summary**: Aerial scene classification remains challenging as: 1) the size of key objects in determining the scene scheme varies greatly; 2) many objects irrelevant to the scene scheme are often flooded in the image. Hence, how to effectively perceive the region of interests (RoIs) from a variety of sizes and build more discriminative representation from such complicated object distribution is vital to understand an aerial scene. In this paper, we propose a novel all grains, one scheme (AGOS) framework to tackle these challenges. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to extend the classic multiple instance learning into multi-grain formulation. Specially, it consists of a multi-grain perception module (MGP), a multi-branch multi-instance representation module (MBMIR) and a self-aligned semantic fusion (SSF) module. Firstly, our MGP preserves the differential dilated convolutional features from the backbone, which magnifies the discriminative information from multi-grains. Then, our MBMIR highlights the key instances in the multi-grain representation under the MIL formulation. Finally, our SSF allows our framework to learn the same scene scheme from multi-grain instance representations and fuses them, so that the entire framework is optimized as a whole. Notably, our AGOS is flexible and can be easily adapted to existing CNNs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on UCM, AID and NWPU benchmarks demonstrate that our AGOS achieves a comparable performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Learning from a few training samples is a desirable ability of an object detector, inspiring the explorations of Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD). Most existing approaches employ a pretrain-transfer paradigm. The model is first pre-trained on base classes with abundant data and then transferred to novel classes with a few annotated samples. Despite the substantial progress, the FSOD performance is still far behind satisfactory. During pre-training, due to the co-occurrence between base and novel classes, the model is learned to treat the co-occurred novel classes as backgrounds. During transferring, given scarce samples of novel classes, the model suffers from learning discriminative features to distinguish novel instances from backgrounds and base classes. To overcome the obstacles, we propose a novel framework, Mining Implicit Novel Instances (MINI), to mine the implicit novel instances as auxiliary training samples, which widely exist in abundant base data but are not annotated. MINI comprises an offline mining mechanism and an online mining mechanism. The offline mining mechanism leverages a self-supervised discriminative model to collaboratively mine implicit novel instances with a trained FSOD network. Taking the mined novel instances as auxiliary training samples, the online mining mechanism takes a teacher-student framework to simultaneously update the FSOD network and the mined implicit novel instances on the fly. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets show MINI achieves new state-of-the-art performance on any shot and split. The significant performance improvements demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Self-attention based models such as vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a very competitive architecture alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision. Despite increasingly stronger variants with ever-higher recognition accuracies, due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, existing ViTs are typically demanding in computation and model size. Although several successful design choices (e.g., the convolutions and hierarchical multi-stage structure) of prior CNNs have been reintroduced into recent ViTs, they are still not sufficient to meet the limited resource requirements of mobile devices. This motivates a very recent attempt to develop light ViTs based on the state-of-the-art MobileNet-v2, but still leaves a performance gap behind. In this work, pushing further along this under-studied direction we introduce EdgeViTs, a new family of light-weight ViTs that, for the first time, enable attention-based vision models to compete with the best light-weight CNNs in the tradeoff between accuracy and on-device efficiency. This is realized by introducing a highly cost-effective local-global-local (LGL) information exchange bottleneck based on optimal integration of self-attention and convolutions. For device-dedicated evaluation, rather than relying on inaccurate proxies like the number of FLOPs or parameters, we adopt a practical approach of focusing directly on on-device latency and, for the first time, energy efficiency. Specifically, we show that our models are Pareto-optimal when both accuracy-latency and accuracy-energy trade-offs are considered, achieving strict dominance over other ViTs in almost all cases and competing with the most efficient CNNs.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal registration is a required step for many image-guided procedures, especially ultrasound-guided interventions that require anatomical context. While a number of such registration algorithms are already available, they all require a good initialization to succeed due to the challenging appearance of ultrasound images and the arbitrary coordinate system they are acquired in. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the problem of registration of an ultrasound sweep to a pre-operative image. We learn dense keypoint descriptors from which we then estimate the registration. We show that our method overcomes the challenges inherent to registration tasks with freehand ultrasound sweeps, namely, the multi-modality and multidimensionality of the data in addition to lack of precise ground truth and low amounts of training examples. We derive a registration method that is fast, generic, fully automatic, does not require any initialization and can naturally generate visualizations aiding interpretability and explainability. Our approach is evaluated on a clinical dataset of paired MR volumes and ultrasound sequences.

- **Summary**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can now generate photo-realistic images. However, how to best control the image content remains an open challenge. We introduce LatentKeypointGAN, a two-stage GAN internally conditioned on a set of keypoints and associated appearance embeddings providing control of the position and style of the generated objects and their respective parts. A major difficulty that we address is disentangling the image into spatial and appearance factors with little domain knowledge and supervision signals. We demonstrate in a user study and quantitative experiments that LatentKeypointGAN provides an interpretable latent space that can be used to re-arrange the generated images by re-positioning and exchanging keypoint embeddings, such as generating portraits by combining the eyes, and mouth from different images. Notably, our method does not require labels as it is self-supervised and thereby applies to diverse application domains, such as editing portraits, indoor rooms, and full-body human poses.

- **Summary**: Image blurring refers to the degradation of an image wherein the image's overall sharpness decreases. Image blurring is caused by several factors. Additionally, during the image acquisition process, noise may get added to the image. Such a noisy and blurred image can be represented as the image resulting from the convolution of the original image with the associated point spread function, along with additive noise. However, the blurred image often contains inadequate information to uniquely determine the plausible original image. Based on the availability of blurring information, image deblurring methods can be classified as blind and non-blind. In non-blind image deblurring, some prior information is known regarding the corresponding point spread function and the added noise. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of non-blind image deblurring methods with respect to the identification and elimination of noise present in blurred images. In this study, three non-blind image deblurring methods, namely Wiener deconvolution, Lucy-Richardson deconvolution, and regularized deconvolution were comparatively analyzed for noisy images featuring salt-and-pepper noise. Two types of blurring effects were simulated, namely motion blurring and Gaussian blurring. The said three non-blind deblurring methods were applied under two scenarios: direct deblurring of noisy blurred images and deblurring of images after denoising through the application of the adaptive median filter. The obtained results were then compared for each scenario to determine the best approach for deblurring noisy images.

- **Summary**: A new event camera dataset, EVIMO2, is introduced that improves on the popular EVIMO dataset by providing more data, from better cameras, in more complex scenarios. As with its predecessor, EVIMO2 provides labels in the form of per-pixel ground truth depth and segmentation as well as camera and object poses. All sequences use data from physical cameras and many sequences feature multiple independently moving objects. Typically, such labeled data is unavailable in physical event camera datasets. Thus, EVIMO2 will serve as a challenging benchmark for existing algorithms and rich training set for the development of new algorithms. In particular, EVIMO2 is suited for supporting research in motion and object segmentation, optical flow, structure from motion, and visual (inertial) odometry in both monocular or stereo configurations.   EVIMO2 consists of 41 minutes of data from three 640$\times$480 event cameras, one 2080$\times$1552 classical color camera, inertial measurements from two six axis inertial measurement units, and millimeter accurate object poses from a Vicon motion capture system. The dataset's 173 sequences are arranged into three categories. 3.75 minutes of independently moving household objects, 22.55 minutes of static scenes, and 14.85 minutes of basic motions in shallow scenes. Some sequences were recorded in low-light conditions where conventional cameras fail. Depth and segmentation are provided at 60 Hz for the event cameras and 30 Hz for the classical camera. The masks can be regenerated using open-source code up to rates as high as 200 Hz.   This technical report briefly describes EVIMO2. The full documentation is available online. Videos of individual sequences can be sampled on the download page.

- **Summary**: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) inputs are examples that do not belong to the true underlying distribution of the dataset. Research has shown that deep neural nets make confident mispredictions on OoD inputs. Therefore, it is critical to identify OoD inputs for safe and reliable deployment of deep neural nets. Often a threshold is applied on a similarity score to detect OoD inputs. One such similarity is angular similarity which is the dot product of latent representation with the mean class representation. Angular similarity encodes uncertainty, for example, if the angular similarity is less, it is less certain that the input belongs to that class. However, we observe that, different classes have different distributions of angular similarity. Therefore, applying a single threshold for all classes is not ideal since the same similarity score represents different uncertainties for different classes. In this paper, we propose norm-scaling which normalizes the logits separately for each class. This ensures that a single value consistently represents similar uncertainty for various classes. We show that norm-scaling, when used with maximum softmax probability detector, achieves 9.78% improvement in AUROC, 5.99% improvement in AUPR and 33.19% reduction in FPR95 metrics over previous state-of-the-art methods.

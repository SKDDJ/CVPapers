- **Summary**: Object placement assessment (OPA) aims to predict the rationality score of a composite image in terms of the placement (e.g., scale, location) of inserted foreground object. However, given a pair of scaled foreground and background, to enumerate all the reasonable locations, existing OPA model needs to place the foreground at each location on the background and pass the obtained composite image through the model one at a time, which is very time-consuming. In this work, we investigate a new task named as fast OPA. Specifically, provided with a scaled foreground and a background, we only pass them through the model once and predict the rationality scores for all locations. To accomplish this task, we propose a pioneering fast OPA model with several innovations (i.e., foreground dynamic filter, background prior transfer, and composite feature mimicking) to bridge the performance gap between slow OPA model and fast OPA model. Extensive experiments on OPA dataset show that our proposed fast OPA model performs on par with slow OPA model but runs significantly faster.

- **Summary**: Lip region-of-interest (ROI) is conventionally used for visual input in the lipreading task. Few works have adopted the entire face as visual input because lip-excluded parts of the face are usually considered to be redundant and irrelevant to visual speech recognition. However, faces contain much more detailed information than lips, such as speakers' head pose, emotion, identity etc. We argue that such information might benefit visual speech recognition if a powerful feature extractor employing the entire face is trained. In this work, we propose to adopt the entire face for lipreading with self-supervised learning. AV-HuBERT, an audio-visual multi-modal self-supervised learning framework, was adopted in our experiments. Our experimental results showed that adopting the entire face achieved 16% relative word error rate (WER) reduction on the lipreading task, compared with the baseline method using lip as visual input. Without self-supervised pretraining, the model with face input achieved a higher WER than that using lip input in the case of limited training data (30 hours), while a slightly lower WER when using large amount of training data (433 hours).

- **Summary**: We aim for image-based novelty detection. Despite considerable progress, existing models either fail or face a dramatic drop under the so-called "near-distribution" setting, where the differences between normal and anomalous samples are subtle. We first demonstrate existing methods experience up to 20% decrease in performance in the near-distribution setting. Next, we propose to exploit a score-based generative model to produce synthetic near-distribution anomalous data. Our model is then fine-tuned to distinguish such data from the normal samples. We provide a quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation of this strategy, and compare the results with a variety of GAN-based models. Effectiveness of our method for both the near-distribution and standard novelty detection is assessed through extensive experiments on datasets in diverse applications such as medical images, object classification, and quality control. This reveals that our method considerably improves over existing models, and consistently decreases the gap between the near-distribution and standard novelty detection performance.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are susceptible to label noise. Existing methods to improve robustness, such as meta-learning and regularization, usually require significant change to the network architecture or careful tuning of the optimization procedure. In this work, we propose a simple hierarchical approach that incorporates a label hierarchy when training the deep learning models. Our approach requires no change of the network architecture or the optimization procedure. We investigate our hierarchical network through a wide range of simulated and real datasets and various label noise types. Our hierarchical approach improves upon regular deep neural networks in learning with label noise. Combining our hierarchical approach with pre-trained models achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world noisy datasets.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fake news detection has attracted many research interests in social forensics. Many existing approaches introduce tailored attention mechanisms to guide the fusion of unimodal features. However, how the similarity of these features is calculated and how it will affect the decision-making process in FND are still open questions. Besides, the potential of pretrained multi-modal feature learning models in fake news detection has not been well exploited. This paper proposes a FND-CLIP framework, i.e., a multimodal Fake News Detection network based on Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). Given a targeted multimodal news, we extract the deep representations from the image and text using a ResNet-based encoder, a BERT-based encoder and two pair-wise CLIP encoders. The multimodal feature is a concatenation of the CLIP-generated features weighted by the standardized cross-modal similarity of the two modalities. The extracted features are further processed for redundancy reduction before feeding them into the final classifier. We introduce a modality-wise attention module to adaptively reweight and aggregate the features. We have conducted extensive experiments on typical fake news datasets. The results indicate that the proposed framework has a better capability in mining crucial features for fake news detection. The proposed FND-CLIP can achieve better performances than previous works, i.e., 0.7\%, 6.8\% and 1.3\% improvements in overall accuracy on Weibo, Politifact and Gossipcop, respectively. Besides, we justify that CLIP-based learning can allow better flexibility on multimodal feature selection.



### MolScribe: Robust Molecular Structure Recognition with Image-To-Graph Generation

- **Summary**: Molecular structure recognition is the task of translating a molecular image into its graph structure. Significant variation in drawing styles and conventions exhibited in chemical literature poses a significant challenge for automating this task. In this paper, we propose MolScribe, a novel image-to-graph generation model that explicitly predicts atoms and bonds, along with their geometric layouts, to construct the molecular structure. Our model flexibly incorporates symbolic chemistry constraints to recognize chirality and expand abbreviated structures. We further develop data augmentation strategies to enhance the model robustness against domain shifts. In experiments on both synthetic and realistic molecular images, MolScribe significantly outperforms previous models, achieving 76-93% accuracy on public benchmarks. Chemists can also easily verify MolScribe's prediction, informed by its confidence estimation and atom-level alignment with the input image. MolScribe is publicly available through Python and web interfaces: https://github.com/thomas0809/MolScribe.

- **Summary**: Recently, Transformers were shown to enhance the performance of multi-view stereo by enabling long-range feature interaction. In this work, we propose Window-based Transformers (WT) for local feature matching and global feature aggregation in multi-view stereo. We introduce a Window-based Epipolar Transformer (WET) which reduces matching redundancy by using epipolar constraints. Since point-to-line matching is sensitive to erroneous camera pose and calibration, we match windows near the epipolar lines. A second Shifted WT is employed for aggregating global information within cost volume. We present a novel Cost Transformer (CT) to replace 3D convolutions for cost volume regularization. In order to better constrain the estimated depth maps from multiple views, we further design a novel geometric consistency loss (Geo Loss) which punishes unreliable areas where multi-view consistency is not satisfied. Our WT multi-view stereo method (WT-MVSNet) achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and ranks $1^{st}$ on Tanks and Temples benchmark.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a learning-based method for multi-view depth estimation from posed images. Our core idea is a "learning-to-optimize" paradigm that iteratively indexes a plane-sweeping cost volume and regresses the depth map via a convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Since the cost volume plays a paramount role in encoding the multi-view geometry, we aim to improve its construction both at pixel- and frame- levels. At the pixel level, we propose to break the symmetry of the Siamese network (which is typically used in MVS to extract image features) by introducing a transformer block to the reference image (but not to the source images). Such an asymmetric volume allows the network to extract global features from the reference image to predict its depth map. Given potential inaccuracies in the poses between reference and source images, we propose to incorporate a residual pose network to correct the relative poses. This essentially rectifies the cost volume at the frame level. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world MVS datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both within-dataset evaluation and cross-dataset generalization.



### Point RCNN: An Angle-Free Framework for Rotated Object Detection

- **Summary**: Rotated object detection in aerial images is still challenging due to arbitrary orientations, large scale and aspect ratio variations, and extreme density of objects. Existing state-of-the-art rotated object detection methods mainly rely on angle-based detectors. However, angle regression can easily suffer from the long-standing boundary problem. To tackle this problem, we propose a purely angle-free framework for rotated object detection, called Point RCNN, which mainly consists of PointRPN and PointReg. In particular, PointRPN generates accurate rotated RoIs (RRoIs) by converting the learned representative points with a coarse-to-fine manner, which is motivated by RepPoints. Based on the learned RRoIs, PointReg performs corner points refinement for more accurate detection. In addition, aerial images are often severely unbalanced in categories, and existing methods almost ignore this issue. In this paper, we also experimentally verify that re-sampling the images of the rare categories will stabilize training and further improve the detection performance. Experiments demonstrate that our Point RCNN achieves the new state-of-the-art detection performance on commonly used aerial datasets, including DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, and HRSC2016.

- **Summary**: We propose a differentiable rendering algorithm for efficient novel view synthesis. By departing from volume-based representations in favor of a learned point representation, we improve on existing methods more than an order of magnitude in memory and runtime, both in training and inference. The method begins with a uniformly-sampled random point cloud and learns per-point position and view-dependent appearance, using a differentiable splat-based renderer to evolve the model to match a set of input images. Our method is up to 300x faster than NeRF in both training and inference, with only a marginal sacrifice in quality, while using less than 10~MB of memory for a static scene. For dynamic scenes, our method trains two orders of magnitude faster than STNeRF and renders at near interactive rate, while maintaining high image quality and temporal coherence even without imposing any temporal-coherency regularizers.



### V4D: Voxel for 4D Novel View Synthesis

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields have made a remarkable breakthrough in the novel view synthesis task at the 3D static scene. However, for the 4D circumstance (e.g., dynamic scene), the performance of the existing method is still limited by the capacity of the neural network, typically in a multilayer perceptron network (MLP). In this paper, we utilize 3D Voxel to model the 4D neural radiance field, short as V4D, where the 3D voxel has two formats. The first one is to regularly model the 3D space and then use the sampled local 3D feature with the time index to model the density field and the texture field by a tiny MLP. The second one is in look-up tables (LUTs) format that is for the pixel-level refinement, where the pseudo-surface produced by the volume rendering is utilized as the guidance information to learn a 2D pixel-level refinement mapping. The proposed LUTs-based refinement module achieves the performance gain with little computational cost and could serve as the plug-and-play module in the novel view synthesis task. Moreover, we propose a more effective conditional positional encoding toward the 4D data that achieves performance gain with negligible computational burdens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at a low computational cost.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised pre-training for images without labels has recently achieved promising performance in image classification. The success of transformer-based methods, ViT and MAE, draws the community's attention to the design of backbone architecture and self-supervised task. In this work, we show that current masked image encoding models learn the underlying relationship between all objects in the whole scene, instead of a single object representation. Therefore, those methods bring a lot of compute time for self-supervised pre-training. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel object selection and division strategy to drop non-object patches for learning object-wise representations by selective reconstruction with interested region masks. We refer to this method ObjMAE. Extensive experiments on four commonly-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in reducing the compute cost by 72% while achieving competitive performance. Furthermore, we investigate the inter-object and intra-object relationship and find that the latter is crucial for self-supervised pre-training.

- **Summary**: The estimation of 3D human body shape and clothing measurements is crucial for virtual try-on and size recommendation problems in the fashion industry but has always been a challenging problem due to several conditions, such as lack of publicly available realistic datasets, ambiguity in multiple camera resolutions, and the undefinable human shape space. Existing works proposed various solutions to these problems but could not succeed in the industry adaptation because of complexity and restrictions. To solve the complexity and challenges, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective architecture to estimate both shape and measures from frontal- and side-view images. We utilize silhouette segmentation from the two multi-view images and implement an auto-encoder network to learn low-dimensional features from segmented silhouettes. Then, we adopt a kernel-based regularized regression module to estimate the body shape and measurements. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides competitive results on the synthetic dataset, NOMO-3d-400-scans Dataset, and RGB Images of humans captured in different cameras.

- **Summary**: Previous multi-task dense prediction studies developed complex pipelines such as multi-modal distillations in multiple stages or searching for task relational contexts for each task. The core insight beyond these methods is to maximize the mutual effects of each task. Inspired by the recent query-based Transformers, we propose a simple pipeline named Multi-Query Transformer (MQTransformer) that is equipped with multiple queries from different tasks to facilitate the reasoning among multiple tasks and simplify the cross-task interaction pipeline. Instead of modeling the dense per-pixel context among different tasks, we seek a task-specific proxy to perform cross-task reasoning via multiple queries where each query encodes the task-related context. The MQTransformer is composed of three key components: shared encoder, cross-task query attention module and shared decoder. We first model each task with a task-relevant query. Then both the task-specific feature output by the feature extractor and the task-relevant query are fed into the shared encoder, thus encoding the task-relevant query from the task-specific feature. Secondly, we design a cross-task query attention module to reason the dependencies among multiple task-relevant queries; this enables the module to only focus on the query-level interaction. Finally, we use a shared decoder to gradually refine the image features with the reasoned query features from different tasks. Extensive experiment results on two dense prediction datasets (NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context) show that the proposed method is an effective approach and achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of in-the-wild Facial Expression Recognition (FER) by exploiting semi-supervised learning. Large-scale labeled data and deep learning methods have greatly improved the performance of image recognition. However, the performance of FER is still not ideal due to the lack of training data and incorrect annotations (e.g., label noises). Among existing in-the-wild FER datasets, reliable ones contain insufficient data to train robust deep models while large-scale ones are annotated in lower quality. To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm named Progressive Teacher (PT) to utilize reliable FER datasets as well as large-scale unlabeled expression images for effective training. On the one hand, PT introduces semi-supervised learning method to relieve the shortage of data in FER. On the other hand, it selects useful labeled training samples automatically and progressively to alleviate label noise. PT uses selected clean labeled data for computing the supervised classification loss and unlabeled data for unsupervised consistency loss. Experiments on widely-used databases RAF-DB and FERPlus validate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with accuracy of 89.57% on RAF-DB. Additionally, when the synthetic noise rate reaches even 30%, the performance of our PT algorithm only degrades by 4.37%.

- **Summary**: We propose WaveMix -- a novel neural architecture for computer vision that is resource-efficient yet generalizable and scalable. WaveMix networks achieve comparable or better accuracy than the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and token mixers for several tasks, establishing new benchmarks for segmentation on Cityscapes; and for classification on Places-365, five EMNIST datasets, and iNAT-mini. Remarkably, WaveMix architectures require fewer parameters to achieve these benchmarks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Moreover, when controlled for the number of parameters, WaveMix requires lesser GPU RAM, which translates to savings in time, cost, and energy. To achieve these gains we used multi-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) in WaveMix blocks, which has the following advantages: (1) It reorganizes spatial information based on three strong image priors -- scale-invariance, shift-invariance, and sparseness of edges, (2) in a lossless manner without adding parameters, (3) while also reducing the spatial sizes of feature maps, which reduces the memory and time required for forward and backward passes, and (4) expanding the receptive field faster than convolutions do. The whole architecture is a stack of self-similar and resolution-preserving WaveMix blocks, which allows architectural flexibility for various tasks and levels of resource availability. Our code and trained models are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Facial semantic guidance (including facial landmarks, facial heatmaps, and facial parsing maps) and facial generative adversarial networks (GAN) prior have been widely used in blind face restoration (BFR) in recent years. Although existing BFR methods have achieved good performance in ordinary cases, these solutions have limited resilience when applied to face images with serious degradation and pose-varied (e.g., looking right, looking left, laughing, etc.) in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a well-designed blind face restoration network with generative facial prior. The proposed network is mainly comprised of an asymmetric codec and a StyleGAN2 prior network. In the asymmetric codec, we adopt a mixed multi-path residual block (MMRB) to gradually extract weak texture features of input images, which can better preserve the original facial features and avoid excessive fantasy. The MMRB can also be plug-and-play in other networks. Furthermore, thanks to the affluent and diverse facial priors of the StyleGAN2 model, we adopt it as the primary generator network in our proposed method and specially design a novel self-supervised training strategy to fit the distribution closer to the target and flexibly restore natural and realistic facial details. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model performs superior to the prior art for face restoration and face super-resolution tasks.

Compared to other image retrieval tasks, facial image retrieval is more challenging due to the high subjectivity involved in describing a person's facial features. Existing methods do so by comparing specific characteristics from the user's mental image against the suggested images via high-level supervision such as using natural language. In contrast, we propose a method that uses a relatively simpler form of binary supervision by utilizing the user's feedback to label images as either similar or dissimilar to the target image. Such supervision enables us to exploit the contrastive learning paradigm for encapsulating each user's personalized notion of similarity. For this, we propose a novel loss function optimized online via user feedback. We validate the efficacy of our proposed approach using a carefully designed testbed to simulate user feedback and a large-scale user study. Our experiments demonstrate that our method iteratively improves personalization, leading to faster convergence and enhanced recommendation relevance, thereby, improving user satisfaction. Our proposed framework is also equipped with a user-friendly web interface with a real-time experience for facial image retrieval.

- **Summary**: As robots are expected to get more involved in people's everyday lives, frameworks that enable intuitive user interfaces are in demand. Hand gesture recognition systems provide a natural way of communication and, thus, are an integral part of seamless Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Recent years have witnessed an immense evolution of computational models powered by deep learning. However, state-of-the-art models fall short in expanding across different gesture domains, such as emblems and co-speech. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid hand gesture recognition system. Our architecture enables learning both static and dynamic gestures: by capturing a so-called "snapshot" of the gesture performance at its peak, we integrate the hand pose along with the dynamic movement. Moreover, we present a method for analyzing the motion profile of a gesture to uncover its dynamic characteristics and which allows regulating a static channel based on the amount of motion. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our approach on two gesture benchmarks compared to a CNNLSTM baseline. We also provide an analysis on a gesture class basis that unveils the potential of our Snapture architecture for performance improvements. Thanks to its modular implementation, our framework allows the integration of other multimodal data like facial expressions and head tracking, which are important cues in HRI scenarios, into one architecture. Thus, our work contributes both to gesture recognition research and machine learning applications for non-verbal communication with robots.

- **Summary**: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

- **Summary**: Skeleton sequences are compact and lightweight. Numerous skeleton-based action recognizers have been proposed to classify human behaviors. In this work, we aim to incorporate components that are compatible with existing models and further improve their accuracy. To this end, we design two temporal accessories: discrete cosine encoding (DCE) and chronological loss (CRL). DCE facilitates models to analyze motion patterns from the frequency domain and meanwhile alleviates the influence of signal noise. CRL guides networks to explicitly capture the sequence's chronological order. These two components consistently endow many recently-proposed action recognizers with accuracy boosts, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on two large datasets.

- **Summary**: Supervised deep neural networks are the-state-of-the-art for many tasks in the remote sensing domain, against the fact that such techniques require the dataset consisting of pairs of input and label, which are rare and expensive to collect in term of both manpower and resources. On the other hand, there are abundance of raw satellite images available both for commercial and academic purposes. Hence, in this work, we tackle the insufficient labeled data problem in satellite image classification task by introducing the process based on the self-supervised learning technique to create the synthetic labels for satellite image patches. These synthetic labels can be used as the training dataset for the existing supervised learning techniques. In our experiments, we show that the models trained on the synthetic labels give similar performance to the models trained on the real labels. And in the process of creating the synthetic labels, we also obtain the visual representation vectors that are versatile and knowledge transferable.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose MAGICSTYLEGAN and MAGICSTYLEGAN-ADA - both incarnations of the state-of-the-art models StyleGan2 and StyleGan2 ADA - to experiment with their capacity of transfer learning into a rather different domain: creating new illustrations for the vast universe of the game "Magic: The Gathering" cards. This is a challenging task especially due to the variety of elements present in these illustrations, such as humans, creatures, artifacts, and landscapes - not to mention the plethora of art styles of the images made by various artists throughout the years. To solve the task at hand, we introduced a novel dataset, named MTG, with thousands of illustration from diverse card types and rich in metadata. The resulting set is a dataset composed by a myriad of both realistic and fantasy-like illustrations. Although, to investigate effects of diversity we also introduced subsets that contain specific types of concepts, such as forests, islands, faces, and humans. We show that simpler models, such as DCGANs, are not able to learn to generate proper illustrations in any setting. On the other side, we train instances of MAGICSTYLEGAN using all proposed subsets, being able to generate high quality illustrations. We perform experiments to understand how well pre-trained features from StyleGan2 can be transferred towards the target domain. We show that in well trained models we can find particular instances of noise vector that realistically represent real images from the dataset. Moreover, we provide both quantitative and qualitative studies to support our claims, and that demonstrate that MAGICSTYLEGAN is the state-of-the-art approach for generating Magic illustrations. Finally, this paper highlights some emerging properties regarding transfer learning in GANs, which is still a somehow under-explored field in generative learning research.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning on large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs) as pre-training methods has achieved promising downstream performance. Yet, how much these pre-training paradigms promote lightweight ViTs' performance is considerably less studied. In this work, we develop and benchmark several self-supervised pre-training methods on image classification tasks and some downstream dense prediction tasks. We surprisingly find that if proper pre-training is adopted, even vanilla lightweight ViTs show comparable performance to previous SOTA networks with delicate architecture design. It breaks the recently popular conception that vanilla ViTs are not suitable for vision tasks in lightweight regimes. We also point out some defects of such pre-training, e.g., failing to benefit from large-scale pre-training data and showing inferior performance on data-insufficient downstream tasks. Furthermore, we analyze and clearly show the effect of such pre-training by analyzing the properties of the layer representation and attention maps for related models. Finally, based on the above analyses, a distillation strategy during pre-training is developed, which leads to further downstream performance improvement for MAE-based pre-training.

- **Summary**: Concept learning constructs visual representations that are connected to linguistic semantics, which is fundamental to vision-language tasks. Although promising progress has been made, existing concept learners are still vulnerable to attribute perturbations and out-of-distribution compositions during inference. We ascribe the bottleneck to a failure of exploring the intrinsic semantic hierarchy of visual concepts, e.g. \{red, blue,...\} $\in$ `color' subspace yet cube $\in$ `shape'. In this paper, we propose a visual superordinate abstraction framework for explicitly modeling semantic-aware visual subspaces (i.e. visual superordinates). With only natural visual question answering data, our model first acquires the semantic hierarchy from a linguistic view, and then explores mutually exclusive visual superordinates under the guidance of linguistic hierarchy. In addition, a quasi-center visual concept clustering and a superordinate shortcut learning schemes are proposed to enhance the discrimination and independence of concepts within each visual superordinate. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework under diverse settings, which increases the overall answering accuracy relatively by 7.5\% on reasoning with perturbations and 15.6\% on compositional generalization tests.

- **Summary**: Accuracy and Diversity are two essential metrizable manifestations in generating natural and semantically correct captions. Many efforts have been made to enhance one of them with another decayed due to the trade-off gap. In this work, we will show that the inferior standard of accuracy draws from human annotations (leave-one-out) are not appropriate for machine-generated captions. To improve diversity with a solid accuracy performance, we exploited a novel Variational Transformer framework. By introducing the "Invisible Information Prior" and the "Auto-selectable GMM", we instruct the encoder to learn the precise language information and object relation in different scenes for accuracy assurance. By introducing the "Range-Median Reward" baseline, we retain more diverse candidates with higher rewards during the RL-based training process for diversity assurance. Experiments show that our method achieves the simultaneous promotion of accuracy (CIDEr) and diversity (self-CIDEr), up to 1.1 and 4.8 percent. Also, our method got the most similar performance of the semantic retrieval compared to human annotations, with 50.3 (50.6 of human) for R@1(i2t).

- **Summary**: Recent advances in contrastive representation learning over paired image-text data have led to models such as CLIP that achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot classification and distributional robustness. Such models typically require joint reasoning in the image and text representation spaces for downstream inference tasks. Contrary to prior beliefs, we demonstrate that the image and text representations learned via a standard contrastive objective are not interchangeable and can lead to inconsistent downstream predictions. To mitigate this issue, we formalize consistency and propose CyCLIP, a framework for contrastive representation learning that explicitly optimizes for the learned representations to be geometrically consistent in the image and text space. In particular, we show that consistent representations can be learned by explicitly symmetrizing (a) the similarity between the two mismatched image-text pairs (cross-modal consistency); and (b) the similarity between the image-image pair and the text-text pair (in-modal consistency). Empirically, we show that the improved consistency in CyCLIP translates to significant gains over CLIP, with gains ranging from 10%-24% for zero-shot classification accuracy on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet1K) and 10%-27% for robustness to various natural distribution shifts.

- **Summary**: In developing countries, building codes often are outdated or not enforced. As a result, a large portion of the housing stock is substandard and vulnerable to natural hazards and climate related events. Assessing housing quality is key to inform public policies and private investments. Standard assessment methods are typically carried out only on a sample / pilot basis due to its high costs or, when complete, tend to be obsolete due to the lack of compliance with recommended updating standards or not accessible to most users with the level of detail needed to take key policy or business decisions. Thus, we propose an evaluation framework that is cost-efficient for first capture and future updates, and is reliable at the block level. The framework complements existing work of using street view imagery combined with deep learning to automatically extract building information to assist the identification of housing characteristics. We then check its potential for scalability and higher level reliability. For that purpose, we create an index, which synthesises the highest possible level of granularity of data at the housing unit and at the household level at the block level, and assess whether the predictions made by our model could be used to approximate vulnerability conditions with a lower budget and in selected areas. Our results indicated that the predictions from the images are clearly correlated with the index.

- **Summary**: Understanding 3D point cloud models for learning purposes has become an imperative challenge for real-world identification such as autonomous driving systems. A wide variety of solutions using deep learning have been proposed for point cloud segmentation, object detection, and classification. These methods, however, often require a considerable number of model parameters and are computationally expensive. We study a semantic dimension of given 3D data points and propose an efficient method called Meta-Semantic Learning (Meta-SeL). Meta-SeL is an integrated framework that leverages two input 3D local points (input 3D models and part-segmentation labels), providing a time and cost-efficient, and precise projection model for a number of 3D recognition tasks. The results indicate that Meta-SeL yields competitive performance in comparison with other complex state-of-the-art work. Moreover, being random shuffle invariant, Meta-SeL is resilient to translation as well as jittering noise.

  to suppress the confirmation bias
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Domain Adaptation of Black-box Predictors (DABP) aims to learn a model on an unlabeled target domain supervised by a black-box predictor trained on a source domain. It does not require access to both the source-domain data and the predictor parameters, thus addressing the data privacy and portability issues of standard domain adaptation. Existing DABP approaches mostly rely on model distillation from the black-box predictor, \emph{i.e.}, training the model with its noisy target-domain predictions, which however inevitably introduces the confirmation bias accumulated from the prediction noises. To mitigate such bias, we propose a new method, named BETA, to incorporate knowledge distillation and noisy label learning into one coherent framework. This is enabled by a new divide-to-adapt strategy. BETA divides the target domain into an easy-to-adapt subdomain with less noise and a hard-to-adapt subdomain. Then it deploys mutually-teaching twin networks to filter the predictor errors for each other and improve them progressively, from the easy to hard subdomains. As such, BETA effectively purifies the noisy labels and reduces error accumulation. We theoretically show that the target error of BETA is minimized by decreasing the noise ratio of the subdomains. Extensive experiments demonstrate BETA outperforms existing methods on all DABP benchmarks, and is even comparable with the standard domain adaptation methods that use the source-domain data.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been extensively employed to transfer the knowledge from a large teacher model to the smaller students, where the parameters of the teacher are fixed (or partially) during training. Recent studies show that this mode may cause difficulties in knowledge transfer due to the mismatched model capacities. To alleviate the mismatch problem, teacher-student joint training methods, e.g., online distillation, have been proposed, but it always requires expensive computational cost. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient and student-friendly knowledge distillation method, namely PESF-KD, to achieve efficient and sufficient knowledge transfer by updating relatively few partial parameters. Technically, we first mathematically formulate the mismatch as the sharpness gap between their predictive distributions, where we show such a gap can be narrowed with the appropriate smoothness of the soft label. Then, we introduce an adapter module for the teacher and only update the adapter to obtain soft labels with appropriate smoothness. Experiments on a variety of benchmarks show that PESF-KD can significantly reduce the training cost while obtaining competitive results compared to advanced online distillation methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: We propose an approach, called the Equilibrium Distribution Model (EDM), for automatically selecting colors with optimum perceptual contrast for scientific visualization. Given any number of features that need to be emphasized in a visualization task, our approach derives evenly distributed points in the CIELAB color space to assign colors to the features so that the minimum Euclidean Distance among the colors are optimized. Our approach can assign colors with high perceptual contrast even for very high numbers of features, where other color selection methods typically fail. We compare our approach with the widely used Harmonic color selection scheme and demonstrate that while the harmonic scheme can achieve reasonable color contrast for visualizing up to 20 different features, our Equilibrium scheme provides significantly better contrast and achieves perceptible contrast for visualizing even up to 100 unique features.

- **Summary**: Precise 6D pose estimation of rigid objects from RGB images is a critical but challenging task in robotics, augmented reality and human-computer interaction. To address this problem, we propose DeepRM, a novel recurrent network architecture for 6D pose refinement. DeepRM leverages initial coarse pose estimates to render synthetic images of target objects. The rendered images are then matched with the observed images to predict a rigid transform for updating the previous pose estimate. This process is repeated to incrementally refine the estimate at each iteration. The DeepRM architecture incorporates LSTM units to propagate information through each refinement step, significantly improving overall performance. In contrast to current 2-stage Perspective-n-Point based solutions, DeepRM is trained end-to-end, and uses a scalable backbone that can be tuned via a single parameter for accuracy and efficiency. During training, a multi-scale optical flow head is added to predict the optical flow between the observed and synthetic images. Optical flow prediction stabilizes the training process, and enforces the learning of features that are relevant to the task of pose estimation. Our results demonstrate that DeepRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely accepted challenging datasets.

- **Summary**: The attention mechanism has become a go-to technique for natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Recently, the MLP-Mixer and other MLP-based architectures, based simply on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), are also powerful compared to CNNs and attention techniques and raises a new research direction. However, the high capability of the MLP-based networks severely relies on large volume of training data, and lacks of explanation ability compared to the Vision Transformer (ViT) or ConvNets. When trained on small datasets, they usually achieved inferior results than ConvNets. To resolve it, we present (i) multi-dimensional MLP (MDMLP), a conceptually simple and lightweight MLP-based architecture yet achieves SOTA when training from scratch on small-size datasets; (ii) multi-dimension MLP Attention Tool (MDAttnTool), a novel and efficient attention mechanism based on MLPs. Even without strong data augmentation, MDMLP achieves 90.90% accuracy on CIFAR10 with only 0.3M parameters, while the well-known MLP-Mixer achieves 85.45% with 17.1M parameters. In addition, the lightweight MDAttnTool highlights objects in images, indicating its explanation power. Our code is available at https://github.com/Amoza-Theodore/MDMLP.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have been deployed in numerous real-world applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance. However, these models are vulnerable in adversarial environments. Backdoor attack is emerging as a severe security threat which injects a backdoor trigger into a small portion of training data such that the trained model behaves normally on benign inputs but gives incorrect predictions when the specific trigger appears. While most research in backdoor attacks focuses on image classification, backdoor attacks on object detection have not been explored but are of equal importance. Object detection has been adopted as an important module in various security-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving. Therefore, backdoor attacks on object detection could pose severe threats to human lives and properties. We propose four kinds of backdoor attacks for object detection task: 1) Object Generation Attack: a trigger can falsely generate an object of the target class; 2) Regional Misclassification Attack: a trigger can change the prediction of a surrounding object to the target class; 3) Global Misclassification Attack: a single trigger can change the predictions of all objects in an image to the target class; and 4) Object Disappearance Attack: a trigger can make the detector fail to detect the object of the target class. We develop appropriate metrics to evaluate the four backdoor attacks on object detection. We perform experiments using two typical object detection models -- Faster-RCNN and YOLOv3 on different datasets. More crucially, we demonstrate that even fine-tuning on another benign dataset cannot remove the backdoor hidden in the object detection model. To defend against these backdoor attacks, we propose Detector Cleanse, an entropy-based run-time detection framework to identify poisoned testing samples for any deployed object detector.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks for image classification are well-known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. One such attack that has garnered recent attention is the adversarial backdoor attack, which has demonstrated the capability to perform targeted misclassification of specific examples. In particular, backdoor attacks attempt to force a model to learn spurious relations between backdoor trigger patterns and false labels. In response to this threat, numerous defensive measures have been proposed; however, defenses against backdoor attacks focus on backdoor pattern detection, which may be unreliable against novel or unexpected types of backdoor pattern designs. We introduce a novel re-contextualization of the adversarial setting, where the presence of an adversary implicitly admits the existence of multiple database contributors. Then, under the mild assumption of contributor awareness, it becomes possible to exploit this knowledge to defend against backdoor attacks by destroying the false label associations. We propose a contributor-aware universal defensive framework for learning in the presence of multiple, potentially adversarial data sources that utilizes semi-supervised ensembles and learning from crowds to filter the false labels produced by adversarial triggers. Importantly, this defensive strategy is agnostic to backdoor pattern design, as it functions without needing -- or even attempting -- to perform either adversary identification or backdoor pattern detection during either training or inference. Our empirical studies demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework against adversarial backdoor attacks from multiple simultaneous adversaries.

- **Summary**: Recently, self-supervised Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have attracted unprecedented attention for their impressive representation learning ability. However, the pretext task, Masked Image Modeling (MIM), reconstructs the missing local patches, lacking the global understanding of the image. This paper extends MAE to a fully-supervised setting by adding a supervised classification branch, thereby enabling MAE to effectively learn global features from golden labels. The proposed Supervised MAE (SupMAE) only exploits a visible subset of image patches for classification, unlike the standard supervised pre-training where all image patches are used. Through experiments, we demonstrate that not only is SupMAE more training efficient but also it learns more robust and transferable features. Specifically, SupMAE achieves comparable performance with MAE using only 30% of compute when evaluated on ImageNet with the ViT-B/16 model. SupMAE's robustness on ImageNet variants and transfer learning performance outperforms MAE and standard supervised pre-training counterparts. Code will be made publicly available.

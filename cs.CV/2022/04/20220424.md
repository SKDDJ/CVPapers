- **Summary**: In line with the development of Industry 4.0, surface defect detection/anomaly detection becomes a topical subject in the industry field. Improving efficiency as well as saving labor costs has steadily become a matter of great concern in practice, where deep learning-based algorithms perform better than traditional vision inspection methods in recent years. While existing deep learning-based algorithms are biased towards supervised learning, which not only necessitates a huge amount of labeled data and human labor, but also brings about inefficiency and limitations. In contrast, recent research shows that unsupervised learning has great potential in tackling the above disadvantages for visual industrial anomaly detection. In this survey, we summarize current challenges and provide a thorough overview of recently proposed unsupervised algorithms for visual industrial anomaly detection covering five categories, whose innovation points and frameworks are described in detail. Meanwhile, publicly available datasets for industrial anomaly detection are introduced. By comparing different classes of methods, the advantages and disadvantages of anomaly detection algorithms are summarized. Based on the current research framework, we point out the core issue that remains to be resolved and provide further improvement directions. Meanwhile, based on the latest technological trends, we offer insights into future research directions. It is expected to assist both the research community and industry in developing a broader and cross-domain perspective.

- **Summary**: Reasoning about visual relationships is central to how humans interpret the visual world. This task remains challenging for current deep learning algorithms since it requires addressing three key technical problems jointly: 1) identifying object entities and their properties, 2) inferring semantic relations between pairs of entities, and 3) generalizing to novel object-relation combinations, i.e., systematic generalization. In this work, we use vision transformers (ViTs) as our base model for visual reasoning and make better use of concepts defined as object entities and their relations to improve the reasoning ability of ViTs. Specifically, we introduce a novel concept-feature dictionary to allow flexible image feature retrieval at training time with concept keys. This dictionary enables two new concept-guided auxiliary tasks: 1) a global task for promoting relational reasoning, and 2) a local task for facilitating semantic object-centric correspondence learning. To examine the systematic generalization of visual reasoning models, we introduce systematic splits for the standard HICO and GQA benchmarks. We show the resulting model, Concept-guided Vision Transformer (or RelViT for short) significantly outperforms prior approaches on HICO and GQA by 16% and 13% in the original split, and by 43% and 18% in the systematic split. Our ablation analyses also reveal our model's compatibility with multiple ViT variants and robustness to hyper-parameters.

- **Summary**: Transductive inference is widely used in few-shot learning, as it leverages the statistics of the unlabeled query set of a few-shot task, typically yielding substantially better performances than its inductive counterpart. The current few-shot benchmarks use perfectly class-balanced tasks at inference. We argue that such an artificial regularity is unrealistic, as it assumes that the marginal label probability of the testing samples is known and fixed to the uniform distribution. In fact, in realistic scenarios, the unlabeled query sets come with arbitrary and unknown label marginals. We introduce and study the effect of arbitrary class distributions within the query sets of few-shot tasks at inference, removing the class-balance artefact. Specifically, we model the marginal probabilities of the classes as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, which yields a principled and realistic sampling within the simplex. This leverages the current few-shot benchmarks, building testing tasks with arbitrary class distributions. We evaluate experimentally state-of-the-art transductive methods over 3 widely used data sets, and observe, surprisingly, substantial performance drops, even below inductive methods in some cases. Furthermore, we propose a generalization of the mutual-information loss, based on $\alpha$-divergences, which can handle effectively class-distribution variations. Empirically, we show that our transductive $\alpha$-divergence optimization outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several data sets, models and few-shot settings.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider a novel problem of reconstructing a 3D human avatar from multiple unconstrained frames, independent of assumptions on camera calibration, capture space, and constrained actions. The problem should be addressed by a framework that takes multiple unconstrained images as inputs, and generates a shape-with-skinning avatar in the canonical space, finished in one feed-forward pass. To this end, we present 3D Avatar Reconstruction in the wild (ARwild), which first reconstructs the implicit skinning fields in a multi-level manner, by which the image features from multiple images are aligned and integrated to estimate a pixel-aligned implicit function that represents the clothed shape. To enable the training and testing of the new framework, we contribute a large-scale dataset, MVP-Human (Multi-View and multi-Pose 3D Human), which contains 400 subjects, each of which has 15 scans in different poses and 8-view images for each pose, providing 6,000 3D scans and 48,000 images in total. Overall, benefits from the specific network architecture and the diverse data, the trained model enables 3D avatar reconstruction from unconstrained frames and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Compressed Sensing MRI (CS-MRI) aims at reconstructing de-aliased images from sub-Nyquist sampling k-space data to accelerate MR Imaging, thus presenting two basic issues, i.e., where to sample and how to reconstruct. To deal with both problems simultaneously, we propose a novel end-to-end Probabilistic Under-sampling and Explicable Reconstruction neTwork, dubbed PUERT, to jointly optimize the sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. Instead of learning a deterministic mask, the proposed sampling subnet explores an optimal probabilistic sub-sampling pattern, which describes independent Bernoulli random variables at each possible sampling point, thus retaining robustness and stochastics for a more reliable CS reconstruction. A dynamic gradient estimation strategy is further introduced to gradually approximate the binarization function in backward propagation, which efficiently preserves the gradient information and further improves the reconstruction quality. Moreover, in our reconstruction subnet, we adopt a model-based network design scheme with high efficiency and interpretability, which is shown to assist in further exploitation for the sampling subnet. Extensive experiments on two widely used MRI datasets demonstrate that our proposed PUERT not only achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality but also yields a sub-sampling pattern and a reconstruction model that are both customized to training data.



### 2D LiDAR and Camera Fusion Using Motion Cues for Indoor Layout Estimation

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel indoor layout estimation system based on the fusion of 2D LiDAR and intensity camera data. A ground robot explores an indoor space with a single floor and vertical walls, and collects a sequence of intensity images and 2D LiDAR datasets. The LiDAR provides accurate depth information, while the camera captures high-resolution data for semantic interpretation. The alignment of sensor outputs and image segmentation are computed jointly by aligning LiDAR points, as samples of the room contour, to ground-wall boundaries in the images. The alignment problem is decoupled into a top-down view projection and a 2D similarity transformation estimation, which can be solved according to the vertical vanishing point and motion of two sensors. The recursive random sample consensus algorithm is implemented to generate, evaluate and optimize multiple hypotheses with the sequential measurements. The system allows jointly analyzing the geometric interpretation from different sensors without offline calibration. The ambiguity in images for ground-wall boundary extraction is removed with the assistance of LiDAR observations, which improves the accuracy of semantic segmentation. The localization and mapping is refined using the fused data, which enables the system to work reliably in scenes with low texture or low geometric features.

- **Summary**: Image retrieval with hybrid-modality queries, also known as composing text and image for image retrieval (CTI-IR), is a retrieval task where the search intention is expressed in a more complex query format, involving both vision and text modalities. For example, a target product image is searched using a reference product image along with text about changing certain attributes of the reference image as the query. It is a more challenging image retrieval task that requires both semantic space learning and cross-modal fusion. Previous approaches that attempt to deal with both aspects achieve unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we decompose the CTI-IR task into a three-stage learning problem to progressively learn the complex knowledge for image retrieval with hybrid-modality queries. We first leverage the semantic embedding space for open-domain image-text retrieval, and then transfer the learned knowledge to the fashion-domain with fashion-related pre-training tasks. Finally, we enhance the pre-trained model from single-query to hybrid-modality query for the CTI-IR task. Furthermore, as the contribution of individual modality in the hybrid-modality query varies for different retrieval scenarios, we propose a self-supervised adaptive weighting strategy to dynamically determine the importance of image and text in the hybrid-modality query for better retrieval. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the mean of Recall@K by 24.9% and 9.5% on the Fashion-IQ and Shoes benchmark datasets respectively.

- **Summary**: Depth Estimation and Object Detection Recognition play an important role in autonomous driving technology under the guidance of deep learning artificial intelligence. We propose a hybrid structure called RealNet: a co-design method combining the model-streamlined recognition algorithm, the depth estimation algorithm with information fusion, and deploying them on the Jetson-Nano for unmanned vehicles with monocular vision sensors. We use ROS for experiment. The method proposed in this paper is suitable for mobile platforms with high real-time request. Innovation of our method is using information fusion to compensate the problem of insufficient frame rate of output image, and improve the robustness of target detection and depth estimation under monocular vision.Object Detection is based on YOLO-v5. We have simplified the network structure of its DarkNet53 and realized a prediction speed up to 0.01s. Depth Estimation is based on the VNL Depth Estimation, which considers multiple geometric constraints in 3D global space. It calculates the loss function by calculating the deviation of the virtual normal vector VN and the label, which can obtain deeper depth information. We use PnP fusion algorithm to solve the problem of insufficient frame rate of depth map output. It solves the motion estimation depth from three-dimensional target to two-dimensional point based on corner feature matching, which is faster than VNL calculation. We interpolate VNL output and PnP output to achieve information fusion. Experiments show that this can effectively eliminate the jitter of depth information and improve robustness. At the control end, this method combines the results of target detection and depth estimation to calculate the target position, and uses a pure tracking control algorithm to track it.

- **Summary**: Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by various retinal diseases. By noninvasive Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, a number of abnormal structural changes in the retina, namely retinal lesions, can be identified. Automated lesion localization in OCT is thus important for detecting retinal diseases at their early stage. To conquer the lack of manual annotation for deep supervised learning, this paper presents a first study on utilizing semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) for lesion localization in OCT images. To that end, we develop a taxonomy to provide a unified and structured viewpoint of the current SSOD methods, and consequently identify key modules in these methods. To evaluate the influence of these modules in the new task, we build OCT-SS, a new dataset consisting of over 1k expert-labeled OCT B-scan images and over 13k unlabeled B-scans. Extensive experiments on OCT-SS identify Unbiased Teacher (UnT) as the best current SSOD method for lesion localization. Moreover, we improve over this strong baseline, with mAP increased from 49.34 to 50.86.

- **Summary**: Domain Adaptation aims to transfer the knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain whose data distributions are different. However, the training data in source domain required by most of the existing methods is usually unavailable in real-world applications due to privacy preserving policies. Recently, Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) has drawn much attention, which tries to tackle domain adaptation problem without using source data. In this work, we propose a novel framework called SFDA-DE to address SFDA task via source Distribution Estimation. Firstly, we produce robust pseudo-labels for target data with spherical k-means clustering, whose initial class centers are the weight vectors (anchors) learned by the classifier of pretrained model. Furthermore, we propose to estimate the class-conditioned feature distribution of source domain by exploiting target data and corresponding anchors. Finally, we sample surrogate features from the estimated distribution, which are then utilized to align two domains by minimizing a contrastive adaptation loss function. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple DA benchmarks, and even outperforms traditional DA methods which require plenty of source data.

- **Summary**: Virtual try-on(VTON) aims at fitting target clothes to reference person images, which is widely adopted in e-commerce.Existing VTON approaches can be narrowly categorized into Parser-Based(PB) and Parser-Free(PF) by whether relying on the parser information to mask the persons' clothes and synthesize try-on images. Although abandoning parser information has improved the applicability of PF methods, the ability of detail synthesizing has also been sacrificed. As a result, the distraction from original cloth may persistin synthesized images, especially in complicated postures and high resolution applications. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel PF method named Regional Mask Guided Network(RMGN). More specifically, a regional mask is proposed to explicitly fuse the features of target clothes and reference persons so that the persisted distraction can be eliminated. A posture awareness loss and a multi-level feature extractor are further proposed to handle the complicated postures and synthesize high resolution images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RMGN outperforms both state-of-the-art PB and PF methods.Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness ofmodules in RMGN.

- **Summary**: Recent research on Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) has focused primarily on generation-based methods. However, current literature has overlooked the fundamental principles of these methods and has made limited progress in a complex manner. In this paper, we aim to deconstruct the generator-classifier framework and provide guidance for its improvement and extension. We begin by breaking down the generator-learned unseen class distribution into class-level and instance-level distributions. Through our analysis of the role of these two types of distributions in solving the GZSL problem, we generalize the focus of the generation-based approach, emphasizing the importance of (i) attribute generalization in generator learning and (ii) independent classifier learning with partially biased data. We present a simple method based on this analysis that outperforms SotAs on four public GZSL datasets, demonstrating the validity of our deconstruction. Furthermore, our proposed method remains effective even without a generative model, representing a step towards simplifying the generator-classifier structure. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/cdb342/DGZ}.

- **Summary**: In order to read meter values from a camera on an autonomous inspection robot with positional errors, it is necessary to detect meter regions from the image. In this study, we developed shape-based, texture-based, and background information-based methods as meter area detection techniques and compared their effectiveness for meters of different shapes and sizes. As a result, we confirmed that the background information-based method can detect the farthest meters regardless of the shape and number of meters, and can stably detect meters with a diameter of 40px.

- **Summary**: Learning representation from unlabeled time series data is a challenging problem. Most existing self-supervised and unsupervised approaches in the time-series domain do not capture low and high-frequency features at the same time. Further, some of these methods employ large scale models like transformers or rely on computationally expensive techniques such as contrastive learning. To tackle these problems, we propose a non-contrastive self-supervised learning approach efficiently captures low and high-frequency time-varying features in a cost-effective manner. Our method takes raw time series data as input and creates two different augmented views for two branches of the model, by randomly sampling the augmentations from same family. Following the terminology of BYOL, the two branches are called online and target network which allows bootstrapping of the latent representation. In contrast to BYOL, where a backbone encoder is followed by multilayer perceptron (MLP) heads, the proposed model contains additional temporal convolutional network (TCN) heads. As the augmented views are passed through large kernel convolution blocks of the encoder, the subsequent combination of MLP and TCN enables an effective representation of low as well as high-frequency time-varying features due to the varying receptive fields. The two modules (MLP and TCN) act in a complementary manner. We train an online network where each module learns to predict the outcome of the respective module of target network branch. To demonstrate the robustness of our model we performed extensive experiments and ablation studies on five real-world time-series datasets. Our method achieved state-of-art performance on all five real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Several deep learning algorithms have been developed to predict survival of cancer patients using whole slide images (WSIs).However, identification of image phenotypes within the WSIs that are relevant to patient survival and disease progression is difficult for both clinicians, and deep learning algorithms. Most deep learning based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms for survival prediction use either top instances (e.g., maxpooling) or top/bottom instances (e.g., MesoNet) to identify image phenotypes. In this study, we hypothesize that wholistic information of the distribution of the patch scores within a WSI can predict the cancer survival better. We developed a distribution based multiple-instance survival learning algorithm (DeepDisMISL) to validate this hypothesis. We designed and executed experiments using two large international colorectal cancer WSIs datasets - MCO CRC and TCGA COAD-READ. Our results suggest that the more information about the distribution of the patch scores for a WSI, the better is the prediction performance. Including multiple neighborhood instances around each selected distribution location (e.g., percentiles) could further improve the prediction. DeepDisMISL demonstrated superior predictive ability compared to other recently published, state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm is interpretable and could assist in understanding the relationship between cancer morphological phenotypes and patients cancer survival risk.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose dictionary attacks against speaker verification - a novel attack vector that aims to match a large fraction of speaker population by chance. We introduce a generic formulation of the attack that can be used with various speech representations and threat models. The attacker uses adversarial optimization to maximize raw similarity of speaker embeddings between a seed speech sample and a proxy population. The resulting master voice successfully matches a non-trivial fraction of people in an unknown population. Adversarial waveforms obtained with our approach can match on average 69% of females and 38% of males enrolled in the target system at a strict decision threshold calibrated to yield false alarm rate of 1%. By using the attack with a black-box voice cloning system, we obtain master voices that are effective in the most challenging conditions and transferable between speaker encoders. We also show that, combined with multiple attempts, this attack opens even more to serious issues on the security of these systems.

- **Summary**: As 3D facial avatars become more widely used for communication, it is critical that they faithfully convey emotion. Unfortunately, the best recent methods that regress parametric 3D face models from monocular images are unable to capture the full spectrum of facial expression, such as subtle or extreme emotions. We find the standard reconstruction metrics used for training (landmark reprojection error, photometric error, and face recognition loss) are insufficient to capture high-fidelity expressions. The result is facial geometries that do not match the emotional content of the input image. We address this with EMOCA (EMOtion Capture and Animation), by introducing a novel deep perceptual emotion consistency loss during training, which helps ensure that the reconstructed 3D expression matches the expression depicted in the input image. While EMOCA achieves 3D reconstruction errors that are on par with the current best methods, it significantly outperforms them in terms of the quality of the reconstructed expression and the perceived emotional content. We also directly regress levels of valence and arousal and classify basic expressions from the estimated 3D face parameters. On the task of in-the-wild emotion recognition, our purely geometric approach is on par with the best image-based methods, highlighting the value of 3D geometry in analyzing human behavior.

- **Summary**: In this work, we tackle the problem of real-world fluid animation from a still image. The key of our system is a surface-based layered representation deriving from video decomposition, where the scene is decoupled into a surface fluid layer and an impervious background layer with corresponding transparencies to characterize the composition of the two layers. The animated video can be produced by warping only the surface fluid layer according to the estimation of fluid motions and recombining it with the background. In addition, we introduce surface-only fluid simulation, a $2.5D$ fluid calculation version, as a replacement for motion estimation. Specifically, we leverage the triangular mesh based on a monocular depth estimator to represent the fluid surface layer and simulate the motion in the physics-based framework with the inspiration of the classic theory of the hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian method, along with a learnable network so as to adapt to complex real-world image textures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system through comparison with existing methods in both standard objective metrics and subjective ranking scores. Extensive experiments not only indicate our method's competitive performance for common fluid scenes but also better robustness and reasonability under complex transparent fluid scenarios. Moreover, as the proposed surface-based layer representation and surface-only fluid simulation naturally disentangle the scene, interactive editing such as adding objects to the river and texture replacing could be easily achieved with realistic results.

- **Summary**: Image registration is a critical component in the applications of various medical image analyses. In recent years, there has been a tremendous surge in the development of deep learning (DL)-based medical image registration models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of medical image registration. Firstly, a discussion is provided for supervised registration categories, for example, fully supervised, dual supervised, and weakly supervised registration. Next, similarity-based as well as generative adversarial network (GAN)-based registration are presented as part of unsupervised registration. Deep iterative registration is then described with emphasis on deep similarity-based and reinforcement learning-based registration. Moreover, the application areas of medical image registration are reviewed. This review focuses on monomodal and multimodal registration and associated imaging, for instance, X-ray, CT scan, ultrasound, and MRI. The existing challenges are highlighted in this review, where it is shown that a major challenge is the absence of a training dataset with known transformations. Finally, a discussion is provided on the promising future research areas in the field of DL-based medical image registration.

- **Summary**: Identifying sleep stages and patterns is an essential part of diagnosing and treating sleep disorders. With the advancement of smart technologies, sensor data related to sleeping patterns can be captured easily. In this paper, we propose a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture that improves the classification performance. In particular, we benchmark the classification performance from different methods, including traditional machine learning methods such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), on 3 publicly available sleep datasets. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F-score are reported and will serve as a baseline to simulate the research in this direction in the future.

- **Summary**: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has produced great achievements since it was proposed, including the possibility of processing raw vision input data. However, training an agent to perform tasks based on image feedback remains a challenge. It requires the processing of large amounts of data from high-dimensional observation spaces, frame by frame, and the agent's actions are computed according to deep neural network policies, end-to-end. Image pre-processing is an effective way of reducing these high dimensional spaces, eliminating unnecessary information present in the scene, supporting the extraction of features and their representations in the agent's neural network. Modern video-games are examples of this type of challenge for DRL algorithms because of their visual complexity. In this paper, we propose a low-dimensional observation filter that allows a deep Q-network agent to successfully play in a visually complex and modern video-game, called Neon Drive.

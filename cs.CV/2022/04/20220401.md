- **Summary**: Semi- and weakly-supervised learning have recently attracted considerable attention in the object detection literature since they can alleviate the cost of annotation needed to successfully train deep learning models. State-of-art approaches for semi-supervised learning rely on student-teacher models trained using a multi-stage process, and considerable data augmentation. Custom networks have been developed for the weakly-supervised setting, making it difficult to adapt to different detectors. In this paper, a weakly semi-supervised training method is introduced that reduces these training challenges, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging only a small fraction of fully-labeled images with information in weakly-labeled images. In particular, our generic sampling-based learning strategy produces pseudo-ground-truth (GT) bounding box annotations in an online fashion, eliminating the need for multi-stage training, and student-teacher network configurations. These pseudo GT boxes are sampled from weakly-labeled images based on the categorical score of object proposals accumulated via a score propagation process. Empirical results on the Pascal VOC dataset, indicate that the proposed approach improves performance by 5.0% when using VOC 2007 as fully-labeled, and VOC 2012 as weak-labeled data. Also, with 5-10% fully annotated images, we observed an improvement of more than 10% in mAP, showing that a modest investment in image-level annotation, can substantially improve detection performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an explainable and interpretable diabetic retinopathy (ExplainDR) classification model based on neural-symbolic learning. To gain explainability, a highlevel symbolic representation should be considered in decision making. Specifically, we introduce a human-readable symbolic representation, which follows a taxonomy style of diabetic retinopathy characteristics related to eye health conditions to achieve explainability. We then include humanreadable features obtained from the symbolic representation in the disease prediction. Experimental results on a diabetic retinopathy classification dataset show that our proposed ExplainDR method exhibits promising performance when compared to that from state-of-the-art methods applied to the IDRiD dataset, while also providing interpretability and explainability.

- **Summary**: Existing deep learning-based change detection methods try to elaborately design complicated neural networks with powerful feature representations, but ignore the universal domain shift induced by time-varying land cover changes, including luminance fluctuations and season changes between pre-event and post-event images, thereby producing sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Supervised Domain Adaptation framework for cross-domain Change Detection, namely SDACD, to effectively alleviate the domain shift between bi-temporal images for better change predictions. Specifically, our SDACD presents collaborative adaptations from both image and feature perspectives with supervised learning. Image adaptation exploits generative adversarial learning with cycle-consistency constraints to perform cross-domain style transformation, effectively narrowing the domain gap in a two-side generation fashion. As to feature adaptation, we extract domain-invariant features to align different feature distributions in the feature space, which could further reduce the domain gap of cross-domain images. To further improve the performance, we combine three types of bi-temporal images for the final change prediction, including the initial input bi-temporal images and two generated bi-temporal images from the pre-event and post-event domains. Extensive experiments and analyses on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposed framework. Notably, our framework pushes several representative baseline models up to new State-Of-The-Art records, achieving 97.34% and 92.36% on the CDD and WHU building datasets, respectively. The source code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Perfect-You/SDACD.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the problem of view synthesis with certain amount of rotations from a pair of images, what we called stereo unstructured magnification. While the multi-plane image representation is well suited for view synthesis with depth invariant, how to generalize it to unstructured views remains a significant challenge. This is primarily due to the depth-dependency caused by camera frontal parallel representation. Here we propose a novel multiple homography image (MHI) representation, comprising of a set of scene planes with fixed normals and distances. A two-stage network is developed for novel view synthesis. Stage-1 is an MHI reconstruction module that predicts the MHIs and composites layered multi-normal images along the normal direction. Stage-2 is a normal-blending module to find blending weights. We also derive an angle-based cost to guide the blending of multi-normal images by exploiting per-normal geometry. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves superior performance for view synthesis qualitatively and quantitatively, especially for cases when the cameras undergo rotations.



### LASER: LAtent SpacE Rendering for 2D Visual Localization

- **Summary**: We present LASER, an image-based Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) framework for 2D floor maps. LASER introduces the concept of latent space rendering, where 2D pose hypotheses on the floor map are directly rendered into a geometrically-structured latent space by aggregating viewing ray features. Through a tightly coupled rendering codebook scheme, the viewing ray features are dynamically determined at rendering-time based on their geometries (i.e. length, incident-angle), endowing our representation with view-dependent fine-grain variability. Our codebook scheme effectively disentangles feature encoding from rendering, allowing the latent space rendering to run at speeds above 10KHz. Moreover, through metric learning, our geometrically-structured latent space is common to both pose hypotheses and query images with arbitrary field of views. As a result, LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale indoor localization datasets (i.e. ZInD and Structured3D) for both panorama and perspective image queries, while significantly outperforming existing learning-based methods in speed.

- **Summary**: Remote telepresence via next-generation mixed reality platforms can provide higher levels of immersion for computer-mediated communications, allowing participants to engage in a wide spectrum of activities, previously not possible in 2D screen-based communication methods. However, as mixed reality experiences are limited to the local physical surrounding of each user, finding a common virtual ground where users can freely move and interact with each other is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel mutual scene synthesis method that takes the participants' spaces as input, and generates a virtual synthetic scene that corresponds to the functional features of all participants' local spaces. Our method combines a mutual function optimization module with a deep-learning conditional scene augmentation process to generate a scene mutually and physically accessible to all participants of a mixed reality telepresence scenario. The synthesized scene can hold mutual walkable, sittable and workable functions, all corresponding to physical objects in the users' real environments. We perform experiments using the MatterPort3D dataset and conduct comparative user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. Our results show that our proposed approach can be a promising research direction for facilitating contextualized telepresence systems for next-generation spatial computing platforms.

- **Summary**: While pose estimation is an important computer vision task, it requires expensive annotation and suffers from domain shift. In this paper, we investigate the problem of domain adaptive 2D pose estimation that transfers knowledge learned on a synthetic source domain to a target domain without supervision. While several domain adaptive pose estimation models have been proposed recently, they are not generic but only focus on either human pose or animal pose estimation, and thus their effectiveness is somewhat limited to specific scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified framework that generalizes well on various domain adaptive pose estimation problems. We propose to align representations using both input-level and output-level cues (pixels and pose labels, respectively), which facilitates the knowledge transfer from the source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Our experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under various domain shifts. Our method outperforms existing baselines on human pose estimation by up to 4.5 percent points (pp), hand pose estimation by up to 7.4 pp, and animal pose estimation by up to 4.8 pp for dogs and 3.3 pp for sheep. These results suggest that our method is able to mitigate domain shift on diverse tasks and even unseen domains and objects (e.g., trained on horse and tested on dog). Our code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/UDA_PoseEstimation.



### GraftNet: Towards Domain Generalized Stereo Matching with a Broad-Spectrum and Task-Oriented Feature

- **Summary**: Although supervised deep stereo matching networks have made impressive achievements, the poor generalization ability caused by the domain gap prevents them from being applied to real-life scenarios. In this paper, we propose to leverage the feature of a model trained on large-scale datasets to deal with the domain shift since it has seen various styles of images. With the cosine similarity based cost volume as a bridge, the feature will be grafted to an ordinary cost aggregation module. Despite the broad-spectrum representation, such a low-level feature contains much general information which is not aimed at stereo matching. To recover more task-specific information, the grafted feature is further input into a shallow network to be transformed before calculating the cost. Extensive experiments show that the model generalization ability can be improved significantly with this broad-spectrum and task-oriented feature. Specifically, based on two well-known architectures PSMNet and GANet, our methods are superior to other robust algorithms when transferring from SceneFlow to KITTI 2015, KITTI 2012, and Middlebury.

### Dynamic Supervisor for Cross-dataset Object Detection

- **Summary**: The application of cross-dataset training in object detection tasks is complicated because the inconsistency in the category range across datasets transforms fully supervised learning into semi-supervised learning. To address this problem, recent studies focus on the generation of high-quality missing annotations. In this study, we first point out that it is not enough to generate high-quality annotations using a single model, which only looks once for annotations. Through detailed experimental analyses, we further conclude that hard-label training is conducive to generating high-recall annotations, while soft-label training tends to obtain high-precision annotations. Inspired by the aspects mentioned above, we propose a dynamic supervisor framework that updates the annotations multiple times through multiple-updated submodels trained using hard and soft labels. In the final generated annotations, both recall and precision improve significantly through the integration of hard-label training with soft-label training. Extensive experiments conducted on various dataset combination settings support our analyses and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed dynamic supervisor.



### Epipolar Focus Spectrum: A Novel Light Field Representation and Application in Dense-view Reconstruction

- **Summary**: Existing light field representations, such as epipolar plane image (EPI) and sub-aperture images, do not consider the structural characteristics across the views, so they usually require additional disparity and spatial structure cues for follow-up tasks. Besides, they have difficulties dealing with occlusions or larger disparity scenes. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Epipolar Focus Spectrum (EFS) representation by rearranging the EPI spectrum. Different from the classical EPI representation where an EPI line corresponds to a specific depth, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EFS line to the view. Accordingly, compared to a sparsely-sampled light field, a densely-sampled one with the same field of view (FoV) leads to a more compact distribution of such linear structures in the double-cone-shaped region with the identical opening angle in its corresponding EFS. Hence the EFS representation is invariant to the scene depth. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we develop a trainable EFS-based pipeline for light field reconstruction, where a dense light field can be reconstructed by compensating the "missing EFS lines" given a sparse light field, yielding promising results with cross-view consistency, especially in the presence of severe occlusion and large disparity. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed method over SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: Internet of things (IoT) technologies are becoming a more and more widespread part of civilian life in common urban spaces, which are rapidly turning into cyber-physical spaces. Simultaneously, the fear of terrorism and crime in such public spaces is ever-increasing. Due to the resulting increased demand for security, video-based IoT surveillance systems have become an important area for research. Considering the large number of devices involved in the illicit recognition task, we conducted a field study in a Dutch Easter music festival in a national interest project called VISOR to select the most appropriate device configuration in terms of performance and results. We iteratively architected solutions for the security of cyber-physical spaces using IoT devices. We tested the performance of multiple federated devices encompassing drones, closed-circuit television, smart phone cameras, and smart glasses to detect real-case scenarios of potentially malicious activities such as mosh-pits and pick-pocketing. Our results pave the way to select optimal IoT architecture configurations -- i.e., a mix of CCTV, drones, smart glasses, and camera phones in our case -- to make safer cyber-physical spaces' a reality.



### Bridging the Gap between Classification and Localization for Weakly Supervised Object Localization

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised object localization aims to find a target object region in a given image with only weak supervision, such as image-level labels. Most existing methods use a class activation map (CAM) to generate a localization map; however, a CAM identifies only the most discriminative parts of a target object rather than the entire object region. In this work, we find the gap between classification and localization in terms of the misalignment of the directions between an input feature and a class-specific weight. We demonstrate that the misalignment suppresses the activation of CAM in areas that are less discriminative but belong to the target object. To bridge the gap, we propose a method to align feature directions with a class-specific weight. The proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art localization performance on the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Diffusion models learn to restore noisy data, which is corrupted with different levels of noise, by optimizing the weighted sum of the corresponding loss terms, i.e., denoising score matching loss. In this paper, we show that restoring data corrupted with certain noise levels offers a proper pretext task for the model to learn rich visual concepts. We propose to prioritize such noise levels over other levels during training, by redesigning the weighting scheme of the objective function. We show that our simple redesign of the weighting scheme significantly improves the performance of diffusion models regardless of the datasets, architectures, and sampling strategies.

- **Summary**: Real-time holistic scene understanding would allow machines to interpret their surrounding in a much more detailed manner than is currently possible. While panoptic image segmentation methods have brought image segmentation closer to this goal, this information has to be described relative to the 3D environment for the machine to be able to utilise it effectively. In this paper, we investigate methods for sequentially reconstructing static environments from panoptic image segmentations in 3D. We specifically target real-time operation: the algorithm must process data strictly online and be able to run at relatively fast frame rates. Additionally, the method should be scalable for environments large enough for practical applications. By applying a simple but powerful data-association algorithm, we outperform earlier similar works when operating purely online. Our method is also capable of reaching frame-rates high enough for real-time applications and is scalable to larger environments as well.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method for action recognition using instance segmentation. Although many data augmentation methods have been proposed for image recognition, few of them are tailored for action recognition. Our proposed method, ObjectMix, extracts each object region from two videos using instance segmentation and combines them to create new videos. Experiments on two action recognition datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show its superiority over VideoMix, a prior work.

- **Summary**: Most existing Human-Object Interaction~(HOI) Detection methods rely heavily on full annotations with predefined HOI categories, which is limited in diversity and costly to scale further. We aim at advancing zero-shot HOI detection to detect both seen and unseen HOIs simultaneously. The fundamental challenges are to discover potential human-object pairs and identify novel HOI categories. To overcome the above challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end zero-shot HOI Detection (EoID) framework via vision-language knowledge distillation. We first design an Interactive Score module combined with a Two-stage Bipartite Matching algorithm to achieve interaction distinguishment for human-object pairs in an action-agnostic manner. Then we transfer the distribution of action probability from the pretrained vision-language teacher as well as the seen ground truth to the HOI model to attain zero-shot HOI classification. Extensive experiments on HICO-Det dataset demonstrate that our model discovers potential interactive pairs and enables the recognition of unseen HOIs. Finally, our method outperforms the previous SOTA by 8.92% on unseen mAP and 10.18% on overall mAP under UA setting, by 6.02% on unseen mAP and 9.1% on overall mAP under UC setting. Moreover, our method is generalizable to large-scale object detection data to further scale up the action sets. The source code will be available at: https://github.com/mrwu-mac/EoID.

- **Summary**: Multi-source image registration is challenging due to intensity, rotation, and scale differences among the images. Considering the characteristics and differences of multi-source remote sensing images, a feature-based registration algorithm named Multi-scale Histogram of Local Main Orientation (MS-HLMO) is proposed. Harris corner detection is first adopted to generate feature points. The HLMO feature of each Harris feature point is extracted on a Partial Main Orientation Map (PMOM) with a Generalized Gradient Location and Orientation Histogram-like (GGLOH) feature descriptor, which provides high intensity, rotation, and scale invariance. The feature points are matched through a multi-scale matching strategy. Comprehensive experiments on 17 multi-source remote sensing scenes demonstrate that the proposed MS-HLMO and its simplified version MS-HLMO$^+$ outperform other competitive registration algorithms in terms of effectiveness and generalization.

- **Summary**: Few-Shot classification aims at solving problems that only a few samples are available in the training process. Due to the lack of samples, researchers generally employ a set of training tasks from other domains to assist the target task, where the distribution between assistant tasks and the target task is usually different. To reduce the distribution gap, several lines of methods have been proposed, such as data augmentation and domain alignment. However, one common drawback of these algorithms is that they ignore the similarity task selection before training. The fundamental problem is to push the auxiliary tasks close to the target task. In this paper, we propose a novel task selecting algorithm, named Optimal Transport Task Selecting (OTTS), to construct a training set by selecting similar tasks for Few-Shot learning. Specifically, the OTTS measures the task similarity by calculating the optimal transport distance and completes the model training via a self-supervised strategy. By utilizing the selected tasks with OTTS, the training process of Few-Shot learning become more stable and effective. Other proposed methods including data augmentation and domain alignment can be used in the meantime with OTTS. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including MiniImageNet, CIFAR, CUB, Cars, and Places, to evaluate the effectiveness of OTTS. Experimental results validate that our OTTS outperforms the typical baselines, i.e., MAML, matchingnet, protonet, by a large margin (averagely 1.72\% accuracy improvement).

- **Summary**: This article presents GrowliFlower, a georeferenced, image-based UAV time series dataset of two monitored cauliflower fields of size 0.39 and 0.60 ha acquired in 2020 and 2021. The dataset contains RGB and multispectral orthophotos from which about 14,000 individual plant coordinates are derived and provided. The coordinates enable the dataset users the extraction of complete and incomplete time series of image patches showing individual plants. The dataset contains collected phenotypic traits of 740 plants, including the developmental stage as well as plant and cauliflower size. As the harvestable product is completely covered by leaves, plant IDs and coordinates are provided to extract image pairs of plants pre and post defoliation, to facilitate estimations of cauliflower head size. Moreover, the dataset contains pixel-accurate leaf and plant instance segmentations, as well as stem annotations to address tasks like classification, detection, segmentation, instance segmentation, and similar computer vision tasks. The dataset aims to foster the development and evaluation of machine learning approaches. It specifically focuses on the analysis of growth and development of cauliflower and the derivation of phenotypic traits to foster the development of automation in agriculture. Two baseline results of instance segmentation at plant and leaf level based on the labeled instance segmentation data are presented. The entire data set is publicly available.

- **Summary**: To make full use of computer vision technology in stores, it is required to consider the actual needs that fit the characteristics of the retail scene. Pursuing this goal, we introduce the United Retail Datasets (Unitail), a large-scale benchmark of basic visual tasks on products that challenges algorithms for detecting, reading, and matching. With 1.8M quadrilateral-shaped instances annotated, the Unitail offers a detection dataset to align product appearance better. Furthermore, it provides a gallery-style OCR dataset containing 1454 product categories, 30k text regions, and 21k transcriptions to enable robust reading on products and motivate enhanced product matching. Besides benchmarking the datasets using various state-of-the-arts, we customize a new detector for product detection and provide a simple OCR-based matching solution that verifies its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Learning from a label distribution has achieved promising results on ordinal regression tasks such as facial age and head pose estimation wherein, the concept of adaptive label distribution learning (ALDL) has drawn lots of attention recently for its superiority in theory. However, compared with the methods assuming fixed form label distribution, ALDL methods have not achieved better performance. We argue that existing ALDL algorithms do not fully exploit the intrinsic properties of ordinal regression. In this paper, we emphatically summarize that learning an adaptive label distribution on ordinal regression tasks should follow three principles. First, the probability corresponding to the ground-truth should be the highest in label distribution. Second, the probabilities of neighboring labels should decrease with the increase of distance away from the ground-truth, i.e., the distribution is unimodal. Third, the label distribution should vary with samples changing, and even be distinct for different instances with the same label, due to the different levels of difficulty and ambiguity. Under the premise of these principles, we propose a novel loss function for fully adaptive label distribution learning, namely unimodal-concentrated loss. Specifically, the unimodal loss derived from the learning to rank strategy constrains the distribution to be unimodal. Furthermore, the estimation error and the variance of the predicted distribution for a specific sample are integrated into the proposed concentrated loss to make the predicted distribution maximize at the ground-truth and vary according to the predicting uncertainty. Extensive experimental results on typical ordinal regression tasks including age and head pose estimation, show the superiority of our proposed unimodal-concentrated loss compared with existing loss functions.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, LiDAR point-clouds and RGB images are two major data modalities with complementary cues for 3D object detection. However, it is quite difficult to sufficiently use them, due to large inter-modal discrepancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, namely Contrastively Augmented Transformer for multi-modal 3D object Detection (CAT-Det). Specifically, CAT-Det adopts a two-stream structure consisting of a Pointformer (PT) branch, an Imageformer (IT) branch along with a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) module. PT, IT and CMT jointly encode intra-modal and inter-modal long-range contexts for representing an object, thus fully exploring multi-modal information for detection. Furthermore, we propose an effective One-way Multi-modal Data Augmentation (OMDA) approach via hierarchical contrastive learning at both the point and object levels, significantly improving the accuracy only by augmenting point-clouds, which is free from complex generation of paired samples of the two modalities. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that CAT-Det achieves a new state-of-the-art, highlighting its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Recently, the dense correlation volume method achieves state-of-the-art performance in optical flow. However, the correlation volume computation requires a lot of memory, which makes prediction difficult on high-resolution images. In this paper, we propose a novel Patchmatch-based framework to work on high-resolution optical flow estimation. Specifically, we introduce the first end-to-end Patchmatch based deep learning optical flow. It can get high-precision results with lower memory benefiting from propagation and local search of Patchmatch. Furthermore, a new inverse propagation is proposed to decouple the complex operations of propagation, which can significantly reduce calculations in multiple iterations. At the time of submission, our method ranks first on all the metrics on the popular KITTI2015 benchmark, and ranks second on EPE on the Sintel clean benchmark among published optical flow methods. Experiment shows our method has a strong cross-dataset generalization ability that the F1-all achieves 13.73%, reducing 21% from the best published result 17.4% on KITTI2015. What's more, our method shows a good details preserving result on the high-resolution dataset DAVIS and consumes 2x less memory than RAFT.

- **Summary**: The proposed RMS-FlowNet is a novel end-to-end learning-based architecture for accurate and efficient scene flow estimation which can operate on point clouds of high density. For hierarchical scene flow estimation, the existing methods depend on either expensive Farthest-Point-Sampling (FPS) or structure-based scaling which decrease their ability to handle a large number of points. Unlike these methods, we base our fully supervised architecture on Random-Sampling (RS) for multiscale scene flow prediction. To this end, we propose a novel flow embedding design which can predict more robust scene flow in conjunction with RS. Exhibiting high accuracy, our RMS-FlowNet provides a faster prediction than state-of-the-art methods and works efficiently on consecutive dense point clouds of more than 250K points at once. Our comprehensive experiments verify the accuracy of RMS-FlowNet on the established FlyingThings3D data set with different point cloud densities and validate our design choices. Additionally, we show that our model presents a competitive ability to generalize towards the real-world scenes of KITTI data set without fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Defocus deblurring is a challenging task due to the spatially varying nature of defocus blur. While deep learning approach shows great promise in solving image restoration problems, defocus deblurring demands accurate training data that consists of all-in-focus and defocus image pairs, which is difficult to collect. Naive two-shot capturing cannot achieve pixel-wise correspondence between the defocused and all-in-focus image pairs. Synthetic aperture of light fields is suggested to be a more reliable way to generate accurate image pairs. However, the defocus blur generated from light field data is different from that of the images captured with a traditional digital camera. In this paper, we propose a novel deep defocus deblurring network that leverages the strength and overcomes the shortcoming of light fields. We first train the network on a light field-generated dataset for its highly accurate image correspondence. Then, we fine-tune the network using feature loss on another dataset collected by the two-shot method to alleviate the differences between the defocus blur exists in the two domains. This strategy is proved to be highly effective and able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on multiple test sets. Extensive ablation studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of each network module to the final performance.

- **Summary**: Iris presentation attack detection (PAD) has achieved remarkable success to ensure the reliability and security of iris recognition systems. Most existing methods exploit discriminative features in the spatial domain and report outstanding performance under intra-dataset settings. However, the degradation of performance is inevitable under cross-dataset settings, suffering from domain shift. In consideration of real-world applications, a small number of bonafide samples are easily accessible. We thus define a new domain adaptation setting called Few-shot One-class Domain Adaptation (FODA), where adaptation only relies on a limited number of target bonafide samples. To address this problem, we propose a novel FODA framework based on the expressive power of frequency information. Specifically, our method integrates frequency-related information through two proposed modules. Frequency-based Attention Module (FAM) aggregates frequency information into spatial attention and explicitly emphasizes high-frequency fine-grained features. Frequency Mixing Module (FMM) mixes certain frequency components to generate large-scale target-style samples for adaptation with limited target bonafide samples. Extensive experiments on LivDet-Iris 2017 dataset demonstrate the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both cross-dataset and intra-dataset settings.

- **Summary**: Automatic facial action unit (AU) recognition is a challenging task due to the scarcity of manual annotations. To alleviate this problem, a large amount of efforts has been dedicated to exploiting various weakly supervised methods which leverage numerous unlabeled data. However, many aspects with regard to some unique properties of AUs, such as the regional and relational characteristics, are not sufficiently explored in previous works. Motivated by this, we take the AU properties into consideration and propose two auxiliary AU related tasks to bridge the gap between limited annotations and the model performance in a self-supervised manner via the unlabeled data. Specifically, to enhance the discrimination of regional features with AU relation embedding, we design a task of RoI inpainting to recover the randomly cropped AU patches. Meanwhile, a single image based optical flow estimation task is proposed to leverage the dynamic change of facial muscles and encode the motion information into the global feature representation. Based on these two self-supervised auxiliary tasks, local features, mutual relation and motion cues of AUs are better captured in the backbone network. Furthermore, by incorporating semi-supervised learning, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework named weakly supervised regional and temporal learning (WSRTL) for AU recognition. Extensive experiments on BP4D and DISFA demonstrate the superiority of our method and new state-of-the-art performances are achieved.

- **Summary**: The reliability assessment of a machine learning model's prediction is an important quantity for the deployment in safety critical applications. Not only can it be used to detect novel sceneries, either as out-of-distribution or anomaly sample, but it also helps to determine deficiencies in the training data distribution. A lot of promising research directions have either proposed traditional methods like Gaussian processes or extended deep learning based approaches, for example, by interpreting them from a Bayesian point of view. In this work we propose a novel approach for uncertainty estimation based on autoencoder models: The recursive application of a previously trained autoencoder model can be interpreted as a dynamical system storing training examples as attractors. While input images close to known samples will converge to the same or similar attractor, input samples containing unknown features are unstable and converge to different training samples by potentially removing or changing characteristic features. The use of dropout during training and inference leads to a family of similar dynamical systems, each one being robust on samples close to the training distribution but unstable on new features. Either the model reliably removes these features or the resulting instability can be exploited to detect problematic input samples. We evaluate our approach on several dataset combinations as well as on an industrial application for occupant classification in the vehicle interior for which we additionally release a new synthetic dataset.

- **Summary**: Learning on synthetic data and transferring the resulting properties to their real counterparts is an important challenge for reducing costs and increasing safety in machine learning. In this work, we focus on autoencoder architectures and aim at learning latent space representations that are invariant to inductive biases caused by the domain shift between simulated and real images showing the same scenario. We train on synthetic images only, present approaches to increase generalizability and improve the preservation of the semantics to real datasets of increasing visual complexity. We show that pre-trained feature extractors (e.g. VGG) can be sufficient for generalization on images of lower complexity, but additional improvements are required for visually more complex scenes. To this end, we demonstrate a new sampling technique, which matches semantically important parts of the image, while randomizing the other parts, leads to salient feature extraction and a neglection of unimportant parts. This helps the generalization to real data and we further show that our approach outperforms fine-tuned classification models.

- **Summary**: With the increasing availability of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images thanks to the Sentinel constellation, and the explosion of deep learning, new methods have emerged in recent years to tackle the reconstruction of optical images that are impacted by clouds. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of convolutional neural networks that use jointly SAR and optical images to retrieve the missing contents in one single polluted optical image. We propose a simple framework that ease the creation of datasets for the training of deep nets targeting optical image reconstruction, and for the validation of machine learning based or deterministic approaches. These methods are quite different in terms of input images constraints, and comparing them is a problematic task not addressed in the literature. We show how space partitioning data structures help to query samples in terms of cloud coverage, relative acquisition date, pixel validity and relative proximity between SAR and optical images. We generate several datasets to compare the reconstructed images from networks that use a single pair of SAR and optical image, versus networks that use multiple pairs, and a traditional deterministic approach performing interpolation in temporal domain.

- **Summary**: Exemplar-based image translation establishes dense correspondences between a conditional input and an exemplar (from two different domains) for leveraging detailed exemplar styles to achieve realistic image translation. Existing work builds the cross-domain correspondences implicitly by minimizing feature-wise distances across the two domains. Without explicit exploitation of domain-invariant features, this approach may not reduce the domain gap effectively which often leads to sub-optimal correspondences and image translation. We design a Marginal Contrastive Learning Network (MCL-Net) that explores contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant features for realistic exemplar-based image translation. Specifically, we design an innovative marginal contrastive loss that guides to establish dense correspondences explicitly. Nevertheless, building correspondence with domain-invariant semantics alone may impair the texture patterns and lead to degraded texture generation. We thus design a Self-Correlation Map (SCM) that incorporates scene structures as auxiliary information which improves the built correspondences substantially. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on multifarious image translation tasks show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently.

- **Summary**: Feature shifts have been shown to be useful for action recognition with CNN-based models since Temporal Shift Module (TSM) was proposed. It is based on frame-wise feature extraction with late fusion, and layer features are shifted along the time direction for the temporal interaction. TokenShift, a recent model based on Vision Transformer (ViT), also uses the temporal feature shift mechanism, which, however, does not fully exploit the structure of Multi-head Self-Attention (MSA) in ViT. In this paper, we propose Multi-head Self/Cross-Attention (MSCA), which fully utilizes the attention structure. TokenShift is based on a frame-wise ViT with features temporally shifted with successive frames (at time t+1 and t-1). In contrast, the proposed MSCA replaces MSA in the frame-wise ViT, and some MSA heads attend to successive frames instead of the current frame. The computation cost is the same as the frame-wise ViT and TokenShift as it simply changes the target to which the attention is taken. There is a choice about which of key, query, and value are taken from the successive frames, then we experimentally compared these variants with Kinetics400. We also investigate other variants in which the proposed MSCA is used along the patch dimension of ViT, instead of the head dimension. Experimental results show that a variant, MSCA-KV, shows the best performance and is better than TokenShift by 0.1% and then ViT by 1.2%.

- **Summary**: A key functional block of visual navigation system for intelligent autonomous vehicles is Loop Closure detection and subsequent relocalisation. State-of-the-Art methods still approach the problem as uni-directional along the direction of the previous motion. As a result, most of the methods fail in the absence of a significantly similar overlap of perspectives. In this study, we propose an approach for bi-directional loop closure. This will, for the first time, provide us with the capability to relocalize to a location even when traveling in the opposite direction, thus significantly reducing long-term odometry drift in the absence of a direct loop. We present a technique to select training data from large datasets in order to make them usable for the bi-directional problem. The data is used to train and validate two different CNN architectures for loop closure detection and subsequent regression of 6-DOF camera pose between the views in an end-to-end manner. The outcome packs a considerable impact and aids significantly to real-world scenarios that do not offer direct loop closure opportunities. We provide a rigorous empirical comparison against other established approaches and evaluate our method on both outdoor and indoor data from the FinnForest dataset and PennCOSYVIO dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper shows the application of autonomous Crater Detection using the U-Net, a Fully-Convolutional Neural Network, on Ceres. The U-Net is trained on optical images of the Moon Global Morphology Mosaic based on data collected by the LRO and manual crater catalogues. The Moon-trained network will be tested on Dawn optical images of Ceres: this task is accomplished by means of a Transfer Learning (TL) approach. The trained model has been fine-tuned using 100, 500 and 1000 additional images of Ceres. The test performance was measured on 350 never before seen images, reaching a testing accuracy of 96.24%, 96.95% and 97.19%, respectively. This means that despite the intrinsic differences between the Moon and Ceres, TL works with encouraging results. The output of the U-Net contains predicted craters: it will be post-processed applying global thresholding for image binarization and a template matching algorithm to extract craters positions and radii in the pixel space. Post-processed craters will be counted and compared to the ground truth data in order to compute image segmentation metrics: precision, recall and F1 score. These indices will be computed, and their effect will be discussed for tasks such as automated crater cataloguing and optical navigation.

- **Summary**: A common practice in transfer learning is to initialize the downstream model weights by pre-training on a data-abundant upstream task. In object detection specifically, the feature backbone is typically initialized with Imagenet classifier weights and fine-tuned on the object detection task. Recent works show this is not strictly necessary under longer training regimes and provide recipes for training the backbone from scratch. We investigate the opposite direction of this end-to-end training trend: we show that an extreme form of knowledge preservation -- freezing the classifier-initialized backbone -- consistently improves many different detection models, and leads to considerable resource savings. We hypothesize and corroborate experimentally that the remaining detector components capacity and structure is a crucial factor in leveraging the frozen backbone. Immediate applications of our findings include performance improvements on hard cases like detection of long-tail object classes and computational and memory resource savings that contribute to making the field more accessible to researchers with access to fewer computational resources.

- **Summary**: Cognitive science has shown that humans perceive videos in terms of events separated by the state changes of dominant subjects. State changes trigger new events and are one of the most useful among the large amount of redundant information perceived. However, previous research focuses on the overall understanding of segments without evaluating the fine-grained status changes inside. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset called Kinetic-GEB+. The dataset consists of over 170k boundaries associated with captions describing status changes in the generic events in 12K videos. Upon this new dataset, we propose three tasks supporting the development of a more fine-grained, robust, and human-like understanding of videos through status changes. We evaluate many representative baselines in our dataset, where we also design a new TPD (Temporal-based Pairwise Difference) Modeling method for visual difference and achieve significant performance improvements. Besides, the results show there are still formidable challenges for current methods in the utilization of different granularities, representation of visual difference, and the accurate localization of status changes. Further analysis shows that our dataset can drive developing more powerful methods to understand status changes and thus improve video level comprehension.

- **Summary**: Over the last years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the dominating neural architecture in a wide range of computer vision tasks. From an image and signal processing point of view, this success might be a bit surprising as the inherent spatial pyramid design of most CNNs is apparently violating basic signal processing laws, i.e. Sampling Theorem in their down-sampling operations. However, since poor sampling appeared not to affect model accuracy, this issue has been broadly neglected until model robustness started to receive more attention. Recent work [17] in the context of adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, showed after all, that there is a strong correlation between the vulnerability of CNNs and aliasing artifacts induced by poor down-sampling operations. This paper builds on these findings and introduces an aliasing free down-sampling operation which can easily be plugged into any CNN architecture: FrequencyLowCut pooling. Our experiments show, that in combination with simple and fast FGSM adversarial training, our hyper-parameter free operator significantly improves model robustness and avoids catastrophic overfitting.

- **Summary**: Previous works derive personalized speech features by training the model on a large dataset composed of his/her audio sounds. It was reported that face information has a strong link with the speech sound. Thus in this work, we innovatively extract personalized speech features from human faces to synthesize personalized speech using neural vocoder. A Face-based Residual Personalized Speech Synthesis Model (FR-PSS) containing a speech encoder, a speech synthesizer and a face encoder is designed for PSS. In this model, by designing two speech priors, a residual-guided strategy is introduced to guide the face feature to approach the true speech feature in the training. Moreover, considering the error of feature's absolute values and their directional bias, we formulate a novel tri-item loss function for face encoder. Experimental results show that the speech synthesized by our model is comparable to the personalized speech synthesized by training a large amount of audio data in previous works.

- **Summary**: Technological advances are in part enabled by the development of novel manufacturing processes that give rise to new materials or material property improvements. Development and evaluation of new manufacturing methodologies is labor-, time-, and resource-intensive expensive due to complex, poorly defined relationships between advanced manufacturing process parameters and the resulting microstructures. In this work, we present a topological representation of temper (heat-treatment) dependent material micro-structure, as captured by scanning electron microscopy, called TopTemp. We show that this topological representation is able to support temper classification of microstructures in a data limited setting, generalizes well to previously unseen samples, is robust to image perturbations, and captures domain interpretable features. The presented work outperforms conventional deep learning baselines and is a first step towards improving understanding of process parameters and resulting material properties.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based methods have made impressive progress in enhancing extremely low-light images - the image quality of the reconstructed images has generally improved. However, we found out that most of these methods could not sufficiently recover the image details, for instance, the texts in the scene. In this paper, a novel image enhancement framework is proposed to precisely restore the scene texts, as well as the overall quality of the image simultaneously under extremely low-light images conditions. Mainly, we employed a self-regularised attention map, an edge map, and a novel text detection loss. In addition, leveraging synthetic low-light images is beneficial for image enhancement on the genuine ones in terms of text detection. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results have shown that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image restoration, text detection, and text spotting on See In the Dark and ICDAR15 datasets.

- **Summary**: We introduce a camera relocalization pipeline that combines absolute pose regression (APR) and direct feature matching. By incorporating exposure-adaptive novel view synthesis, our method successfully addresses photometric distortions in outdoor environments that existing photometric-based methods fail to handle. With domain-invariant feature matching, our solution improves pose regression accuracy using semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data. In particular, the pipeline consists of two components: Novel View Synthesizer and DFNet. The former synthesizes novel views compensating for changes in exposure and the latter regresses camera poses and extracts robust features that close the domain gap between real images and synthetic ones. Furthermore, we introduce an online synthetic data generation scheme. We show that these approaches effectively enhance camera pose estimation both in indoor and outdoor scenes. Hence, our method achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy by outperforming existing single-image APR methods by as much as 56%, comparable to 3D structure-based methods.

- **Summary**: We consider unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), where labeled data from a source domain (e.g., photographs) and unlabeled data from a target domain (e.g., sketches) are used to learn a classifier for the target domain. Conventional UDA methods (e.g., domain adversarial training) learn domain-invariant features to improve generalization to the target domain. In this paper, we show that contrastive pre-training, which learns features on unlabeled source and target data and then fine-tunes on labeled source data, is competitive with strong UDA methods. However, we find that contrastive pre-training does not learn domain-invariant features, diverging from conventional UDA intuitions. We show theoretically that contrastive pre-training can learn features that vary subtantially across domains but still generalize to the target domain, by disentangling domain and class information. Our results suggest that domain invariance is not necessary for UDA. We empirically validate our theory on benchmark vision datasets.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViT)s have recently become popular due to their outstanding modeling capabilities, in particular for capturing long-range information, and scalability to dataset and model sizes which has led to state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision and medical image analysis tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework consisting of two architectures, dubbed UNetFormer, with a 3D Swin Transformer-based encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transformer-based decoders. In the proposed model, the encoder is linked to the decoder via skip connections at five different resolutions with deep supervision. The design of proposed architecture allows for meeting a wide range of trade-off requirements between accuracy and computational cost. In addition, we present a methodology for self-supervised pre-training of the encoder backbone via learning to predict randomly masked volumetric tokens using contextual information of visible tokens. We pre-train our framework on a cohort of $5050$ CT images, gathered from publicly available CT datasets, and present a systematic investigation of various components such as masking ratio and patch size that affect the representation learning capability and performance of downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our pre-training approach by fine-tuning and testing our model on liver and liver tumor segmentation task using the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of various segmentation metrics. To demonstrate its generalizability, we train and test the model on BraTS 21 dataset for brain tumor segmentation using MRI images and outperform other methods in terms of Dice score.

- **Summary**: We present an end-to-end framework for fast retraining of object detection models in human-robot-collaboration. Our Faster R-CNN based setup covers the whole workflow of automatic image generation and labeling, model retraining on-site as well as inference on a FPGA edge device. The intervention of a human operator reduces to providing the new object together with its label and starting the training process. Moreover, we present a new loss, the intraspread-objectosphere loss, to tackle the problem of open world recognition. Though it fails to completely solve the problem, it significantly reduces the number of false positive detections of unknown objects.

- **Summary**: Large pretrained (e.g., "foundation") models exhibit distinct capabilities depending on the domain of data they are trained on. While these domains are generic, they may only barely overlap. For example, visual-language models (VLMs) are trained on Internet-scale image captions, but large language models (LMs) are further trained on Internet-scale text with no images (e.g., spreadsheets, SAT questions, code). As a result, these models store different forms of commonsense knowledge across different domains. In this work, we show that this diversity is symbiotic, and can be leveraged through Socratic Models (SMs): a modular framework in which multiple pretrained models may be composed zero-shot i.e., via multimodal-informed prompting, to exchange information with each other and capture new multimodal capabilities, without requiring finetuning. With minimal engineering, SMs are not only competitive with state-of-the-art zero-shot image captioning and video-to-text retrieval, but also enable new applications such as (i) answering free-form questions about egocentric video, (ii) engaging in multimodal assistive dialogue with people (e.g., for cooking recipes) by interfacing with external APIs and databases (e.g., web search), and (iii) robot perception and planning.

- **Summary**: We present Dance2Music-GAN (D2M-GAN), a novel adversarial multi-modal framework that generates complex musical samples conditioned on dance videos. Our proposed framework takes dance video frames and human body motions as input, and learns to generate music samples that plausibly accompany the corresponding input. Unlike most existing conditional music generation works that generate specific types of mono-instrumental sounds using symbolic audio representations (e.g., MIDI), and that usually rely on pre-defined musical synthesizers, in this work we generate dance music in complex styles (e.g., pop, breaking, etc.) by employing a Vector Quantized (VQ) audio representation, and leverage both its generality and high abstraction capacity of its symbolic and continuous counterparts. By performing an extensive set of experiments on multiple datasets, and following a comprehensive evaluation protocol, we assess the generative qualities of our proposal against alternatives. The attained quantitative results, which measure the music consistency, beats correspondence, and music diversity, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Last but not least, we curate a challenging dance-music dataset of in-the-wild TikTok videos, which we use to further demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in real-world applications -- and which we hope to serve as a starting point for relevant future research.

- **Summary**: Many recent self-supervised frameworks for visual representation learning are based on certain forms of Siamese networks. Such networks are conceptually symmetric with two parallel encoders, but often practically asymmetric as numerous mechanisms are devised to break the symmetry. In this work, we conduct a formal study on the importance of asymmetry by explicitly distinguishing the two encoders within the network -- one produces source encodings and the other targets. Our key insight is keeping a relatively lower variance in target than source generally benefits learning. This is empirically justified by our results from five case studies covering different variance-oriented designs, and is aligned with our preliminary theoretical analysis on the baseline. Moreover, we find the improvements from asymmetric designs generalize well to longer training schedules, multiple other frameworks and newer backbones. Finally, the combined effect of several asymmetric designs achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet linear probing and competitive results on downstream transfer. We hope our exploration will inspire more research in exploiting asymmetry for Siamese representation learning.

- **Summary**: Simplicial Embeddings (SEM) are representations learned through self-supervised learning (SSL), wherein a representation is projected into $L$ simplices of $V$ dimensions each using a softmax operation. This procedure conditions the representation onto a constrained space during pretraining and imparts an inductive bias for group sparsity. For downstream classification, we formally prove that the SEM representation leads to better generalization than an unnormalized representation. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that SSL methods trained with SEMs have improved generalization on natural image datasets such as CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Finally, when used in a downstream classification task, we show that SEM features exhibit emergent semantic coherence where small groups of learned features are distinctly predictive of semantically-relevant classes.

- **Summary**: The significant success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is highly promoted by the multiple sophisticated DNN libraries. On the contrary, although some work have proved that Quadratic Deep Neuron Networks (QDNNs) show better non-linearity and learning capability than the first-order DNNs, their neuron design suffers certain drawbacks from theoretical performance to practical deployment. In this paper, we first proposed a new QDNN neuron architecture design, and further developed QuadraLib, a QDNN library to provide architecture optimization and design exploration for QDNNs. Extensive experiments show that our design has good performance regarding prediction accuracy and computation consumption on multiple learning tasks.

- **Summary**: Real-world autonomous driving datasets comprise of images aggregated from different drives on the road. The ability to relight captured scenes to unseen lighting conditions, in a controllable manner, presents an opportunity to augment datasets with a richer variety of lighting conditions, similar to what would be encountered in the real-world. This paper presents a novel image-based relighting pipeline, SIMBAR, that can work with a single image as input. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work on scene relighting leveraging explicit geometric representations from a single image. We present qualitative comparisons with prior multi-view scene relighting baselines. To further validate and effectively quantify the benefit of leveraging SIMBAR for data augmentation for automated driving vision tasks, object detection and tracking experiments are conducted with a state-of-the-art method, a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 93.3% is achieved with CenterTrack on SIMBAR-augmented KITTI - an impressive 9.0% relative improvement over the baseline MOTA of 85.6% with CenterTrack on original KITTI, both models trained from scratch and tested on Virtual KITTI.

- **Summary**: Precision medicine for chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) involves choosing a treatment which best balances efficacy and side effects/preferences for individual patients. Making this choice as early as possible is important, as delays in finding an effective therapy can lead to irreversible disability accrual. To this end, we present the first deep neural network model for individualized treatment decisions from baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (with clinical information if available) for MS patients. Our model (a) predicts future new and enlarging T2 weighted (NE-T2) lesion counts on follow-up MRI on multiple treatments and (b) estimates the conditional average treatment effect (CATE), as defined by the predicted future suppression of NE-T2 lesions, between different treatment options relative to placebo. Our model is validated on a proprietary federated dataset of 1817 multi-sequence MRIs acquired from MS patients during four multi-centre randomized clinical trials. Our framework achieves high average precision in the binarized regression of future NE-T2 lesions on five different treatments, identifies heterogeneous treatment effects, and provides a personalized treatment recommendation that accounts for treatment-associated risk (e.g. side effects, patient preference, administration difficulties).

- **Summary**: Current face detection algorithms are extremely generalized and can obtain decent accuracy when detecting the adult faces. These approaches are insufficient when handling outlier cases, for example when trying to detect the face of a neonate infant whose face composition and expressions are relatively different than that of the adult. It is furthermore difficult when applied to detect faces in a complicated setting such as the Neonate Intensive Care Unit. By training a state-of-the-art face detection model, You-Only-Look-Once, on a proprietary dataset containing labelled neonate faces in a clinical setting, this work achieves near real time neonate face detection. Our preliminary findings show an accuracy of 68.7%, compared to the off the shelf solution which detected neonate faces with an accuracy of 7.37%. Although further experiments are needed to validate our model, our results are promising and prove the feasibility of detecting neonatal faces in challenging real-world settings. The robust and real-time detection of neonatal faces would benefit wide range of automated systems (e.g., pain recognition and surveillance) who currently suffer from the time and effort due to the necessity of manual annotations. To benefit the research community, we make our trained weights publicly available at github(https://github.com/ja05haus/trained_neonate_face).

- **Summary**: Most hard attention models initially observe a complete scene to locate and sense informative glimpses, and predict class-label of a scene based on glimpses. However, in many applications (e.g., aerial imaging), observing an entire scene is not always feasible due to the limited time and resources available for acquisition. In this paper, we develop a Sequential Transformers Attention Model (STAM) that only partially observes a complete image and predicts informative glimpse locations solely based on past glimpses. We design our agent using DeiT-distilled and train it with a one-step actor-critic algorithm. Furthermore, to improve classification performance, we introduce a novel training objective, which enforces consistency between the class distribution predicted by a teacher model from a complete image and the class distribution predicted by our agent using glimpses. When the agent senses only 4% of the total image area, the inclusion of the proposed consistency loss in our training objective yields 3% and 8% higher accuracy on ImageNet and fMoW datasets, respectively. Moreover, our agent outperforms previous state-of-the-art by observing nearly 27% and 42% fewer pixels in glimpses on ImageNet and fMoW.

- **Summary**: In early 2022, Intuitive Machines' NOVA-C Lander will touch down on the lunar surface becoming the first commercial endeavor to visit a celestial body. NOVA-C will deliver six payloads to the lunar surface with various scientific and engineering objectives, ushering in a new era of commercial space exploration and utilization. However, to safely accomplish the mission, the NOVA-C lander must ensure its landing site is free of hazards larger than 30 cm and the slope of local terrain at touchdown is less than 10 degrees off vertical. To accomplish this, NOVA-C utilizes Intuitive Machines' precision navigation system, coupled with machine vision algorithms for scene reduction and landing site characterization. A unique aspect to the NOVA-C approach is the real-time nature of the hazard detection and avoidance algorithms--which are performed 400 meters above and down range of the intended landing site and completed within 15 seconds. In this paper, we review the theoretical foundations for the hazard detection and avoidance algorithms, describe the practical challenges of implementation on the NOVA-C flight computer, and present test and analysis results.

- **Summary**: A major challenge in text-video and text-audio retrieval is the lack of large-scale training data. This is unlike image-captioning, where datasets are in the order of millions of samples. To close this gap we propose a new video mining pipeline which involves transferring captions from image captioning datasets to video clips with no additional manual effort. Using this pipeline, we create a new large-scale, weakly labelled audio-video captioning dataset consisting of millions of paired clips and captions. We show that training a multimodal transformed based model on this data achieves competitive performance on video retrieval and video captioning, matching or even outperforming HowTo100M pretraining with 20x fewer clips. We also show that our mined clips are suitable for text-audio pretraining, and achieve state of the art results for the task of audio retrieval.

- **Summary**: Research studies have shown no qualms about using data driven deep learning models for downstream tasks in medical image analysis, e.g., anatomy segmentation and lesion detection, disease diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment planning. However, deep learning models are not the sovereign remedy for medical image analysis when the upstream imaging is not being conducted properly (with artefacts). This has been manifested in MRI studies, where the scanning is typically slow, prone to motion artefacts, with a relatively low signal to noise ratio, and poor spatial and/or temporal resolution. Recent studies have witnessed substantial growth in the development of deep learning techniques for propelling fast MRI. This article aims to (1) introduce the deep learning based data driven techniques for fast MRI including convolutional neural network and generative adversarial network based methods, (2) survey the attention and transformer based models for speeding up MRI reconstruction, and (3) detail the research in coupling physics and data driven models for MRI acceleration. Finally, we will demonstrate through a few clinical applications, explain the importance of data harmonisation and explainable models for such fast MRI techniques in multicentre and multi-scanner studies, and discuss common pitfalls in current research and recommendations for future research directions.

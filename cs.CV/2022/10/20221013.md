- **Summary**: How can one visually characterize people in a decade? In this work, we assemble the Faces Through Time dataset, which contains over a thousand portrait images from each decade, spanning the 1880s to the present day. Using our new dataset, we present a framework for resynthesizing portrait images across time, imagining how a portrait taken during a particular decade might have looked like, had it been taken in other decades. Our framework optimizes a family of per-decade generators that reveal subtle changes that differentiate decade--such as different hairstyles or makeup--while maintaining the identity of the input portrait. Experiments show that our method is more effective in resynthesizing portraits across time compared to state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods, as well as attribute-based and language-guided portrait editing models. Our code and data will be available at https://facesthroughtime.github.io

- **Summary**: Structural pruning can simplify network architecture and improve inference speed. We propose Hardware-Aware Latency Pruning (HALP) that formulates structural pruning as a global resource allocation optimization problem, aiming at maximizing the accuracy while constraining latency under a predefined budget on targeting device. For filter importance ranking, HALP leverages latency lookup table to track latency reduction potential and global saliency score to gauge accuracy drop. Both metrics can be evaluated very efficiently during pruning, allowing us to reformulate global structural pruning under a reward maximization problem given target constraint. This makes the problem solvable via our augmented knapsack solver, enabling HALP to surpass prior work in pruning efficacy and accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We examine HALP on both classification and detection tasks, over varying networks, on ImageNet and VOC datasets, on different platforms. In particular, for ResNet-50/-101 pruning on ImageNet, HALP improves network throughput by $1.60\times$/$1.90\times$ with $+0.3\%$/$-0.2\%$ top-1 accuracy changes, respectively. For SSD pruning on VOC, HALP improves throughput by $1.94\times$ with only a $0.56$ mAP drop. HALP consistently outperforms prior art, sometimes by large margins.

- **Summary**: Purpose: (1) To develop a deep learning algorithm to automatically segment structures of the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula in 3D wide-field optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans; (2) To assess whether 3D macula or ONH structures (or the combination of both) provide the best diagnostic power for glaucoma. Methods: A cross-sectional comparative study was performed which included wide-field swept-source OCT scans from 319 glaucoma subjects and 298 non-glaucoma subjects. All scans were compensated to improve deep-tissue visibility. We developed a deep learning algorithm to automatically label all major ONH tissue structures by using 270 manually annotated B-scans for training. The performance of our algorithm was assessed using the Dice coefficient (DC). A glaucoma classification algorithm (3D CNN) was then designed using a combination of 500 OCT volumes and their corresponding automatically segmented masks. This algorithm was trained and tested on 3 datasets: OCT scans cropped to contain the macular tissues only, those to contain the ONH tissues only, and the full wide-field OCT scans. The classification performance for each dataset was reported using the AUC. Results: Our segmentation algorithm was able to segment ONH and macular tissues with a DC of 0.94 $\pm$ 0.003. The classification algorithm was best able to diagnose glaucoma using wide-field 3D-OCT volumes with an AUC of 0.99 $\pm$ 0.01, followed by ONH volumes with an AUC of 0.93 $\pm$ 0.06, and finally macular volumes with an AUC of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.11. Conclusions: this study showed that using wide-field OCT as compared to the typical OCT images containing just the ONH or macular may allow for a significantly improved glaucoma diagnosis. This may encourage the mainstream adoption of 3D wide-field OCT scans. For clinical AI studies that use traditional machines, we would recommend the use of ONH scans as opposed to macula scans.

- **Summary**: Sport-related concussion (SRC) depends on sensory information from visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems. At the same time, the current clinical administration of Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) is subjective and deviates among administrators. Therefore, for the assessment and management of concussion detection, standardization is required to lower the risk of injury and increase the validation among clinicians. With the advancement of technology, virtual reality (VR) can be utilized to advance the standardization of the VOMS, increasing the accuracy of testing administration and decreasing overall false positive rates. In this paper, we experimented with multiple machine learning methods to detect SRC on VR-generated data using VOMS. In our observation, the data generated from VR for smooth pursuit (SP) and the Visual Motion Sensitivity (VMS) tests are highly reliable for concussion detection. Furthermore, we train and evaluate these models, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our findings show these models can reach high true-positive-rates of around 99.9 percent of symptom provocation on the VR stimuli-based VOMS vs. current clinical manual VOMS.

- **Summary**: Human brains are commonly modeled as networks of Regions of Interest (ROIs) and their connections for the understanding of brain functions and mental disorders. Recently, Transformer-based models have been studied over different types of data, including graphs, shown to bring performance gains widely. In this work, we study Transformer-based models for brain network analysis. Driven by the unique properties of data, we model brain networks as graphs with nodes of fixed size and order, which allows us to (1) use connection profiles as node features to provide natural and low-cost positional information and (2) learn pair-wise connection strengths among ROIs with efficient attention weights across individuals that are predictive towards downstream analysis tasks. Moreover, we propose an Orthonormal Clustering Readout operation based on self-supervised soft clustering and orthonormal projection. This design accounts for the underlying functional modules that determine similar behaviors among groups of ROIs, leading to distinguishable cluster-aware node embeddings and informative graph embeddings. Finally, we re-standardize the evaluation pipeline on the only one publicly available large-scale brain network dataset of ABIDE, to enable meaningful comparison of different models. Experiment results show clear improvements of our proposed Brain Network Transformer on both the public ABIDE and our restricted ABCD datasets. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Wayfear/BrainNetworkTransformer.

- **Summary**: In practical applications especially with safety requirement, some hand-held actions need to be monitored closely, including smoking cigarettes, dialing, eating, etc. Taking smoking cigarettes as example, existing smoke detection algorithms usually detect the cigarette or cigarette with hand as the target object only, which leads to low accuracy. In this paper, we propose an application-driven AI paradigm for hand-held action detection based on hierarchical object detection. It is a coarse-to-fine hierarchical detection framework composed of two modules. The first one is a coarse detection module with the human pose consisting of the whole hand, cigarette and head as target object. The followed second one is a fine detection module with the fingers holding cigarette, mouth area and the whole cigarette as target. Some experiments are done with the dataset collected from real-world scenarios, and the results show that the proposed framework achieve higher detection rate with good adaptation and robustness in complex environments.

- **Summary**: Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection algorithms mostly use multiple instance learning (MIL) or their varieties. Almost all recent approaches focus on how to select the correct snippets for training to improve the performance. They overlook or do not realize the power of video classification in boosting the performance of anomaly detection. In this paper, we study explicitly the power of video classification supervision using a BERT or LSTM. With this BERT or LSTM, CNN features of all snippets of a video can be aggregated into a single feature which can be used for video classification. This simple yet powerful video classification supervision, combined into the MIL framework, brings extraordinary performance improvement on all three major video anomaly detection datasets. Particularly it improves the mean average precision (mAP) on the XD-Violence from SOTA 78.84\% to new 82.10\%.

- **Summary**: Deep neural network (DNN) classifiers are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. An adversary poisons some of the training data in such attacks by installing a trigger. The goal is to make the trained DNN output the attacker's desired class whenever the trigger is activated while performing as usual for clean data. Various approaches have recently been proposed to detect malicious backdoored DNNs. However, a robust, end-to-end training approach, like adversarial training, is yet to be discovered for backdoor poisoned data. In this paper, we take the first step toward such methods by developing a robust training framework, COLLIDER, that selects the most prominent samples by exploiting the underlying geometric structures of the data. Specifically, we effectively filter out candidate poisoned data at each training epoch by solving a geometrical coreset selection objective. We first argue how clean data samples exhibit (1) gradients similar to the clean majority of data and (2) low local intrinsic dimensionality (LID). Based on these criteria, we define a novel coreset selection objective to find such samples, which are used for training a DNN. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method for robust training of DNNs on various poisoned datasets, reducing the backdoor success rate significantly.

- **Summary**: The large pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various visual tasks, but suffer from expensive computational and memory cost problems when deployed on resource-constrained devices. Among the powerful compression approaches, quantization extremely reduces the computation and memory consumption by low-bit parameters and bit-wise operations. However, low-bit ViTs remain largely unexplored and usually suffer from a significant performance drop compared with the real-valued counterparts. In this work, through extensive empirical analysis, we first identify the bottleneck for severe performance drop comes from the information distortion of the low-bit quantized self-attention map. We then develop an information rectification module (IRM) and a distribution guided distillation (DGD) scheme for fully quantized vision transformers (Q-ViT) to effectively eliminate such distortion, leading to a fully quantized ViTs. We evaluate our methods on popular DeiT and Swin backbones. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves a much better performance than the prior arts. For example, our Q-ViT can theoretically accelerates the ViT-S by 6.14x and achieves about 80.9% Top-1 accuracy, even surpassing the full-precision counterpart by 1.0% on ImageNet dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel data-driven framework to aid in system state estimation when the power system is under unobservable false data injection attacks. The proposed framework dynamically detects and classifies false data injection attacks. Then, it retrieves the control signal using the acquired information. This process is accomplished in three main modules, with novel designs, for detection, classification, and control signal retrieval. The detection module monitors historical changes in phasor measurements and captures any deviation pattern caused by an attack on a complex plane. This approach can help to reveal characteristics of the attacks including the direction, magnitude, and ratio of the injected false data. Using this information, the signal retrieval module can easily recover the original control signal and remove the injected false data. Further information regarding the attack type can be obtained through the classifier module. The proposed ensemble learner is compatible with harsh learning conditions including the lack of labeled data, concept drift, concept evolution, recurring classes, and independence from external updates. The proposed novel classifier can dynamically learn from data and classify attacks under all these harsh learning conditions. The introduced framework is evaluated w.r.t. real-world data captured from the Central New York Power System. The obtained results indicate the efficacy and stability of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Oriented object detection emerges in many applications from aerial images to autonomous driving, while many existing detection benchmarks are annotated with horizontal bounding box only which is also less costive than fine-grained rotated box, leading to a gap between the readily available training corpus and the rising demand for oriented object detection. This paper proposes a simple yet effective oriented object detection approach called H2RBox merely using horizontal box annotation for weakly-supervised training, which closes the above gap and shows competitive performance even against those trained with rotated boxes. The cores of our method are weakly- and self-supervised learning, which predicts the angle of the object by learning the consistency of two different views. To our best knowledge, H2RBox is the first horizontal box annotation-based oriented object detector. Compared to an alternative i.e. horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation with our post adaption to oriented object detection, our approach is not susceptible to the prediction quality of mask and can perform more robustly in complex scenes containing a large number of dense objects and outliers. Experimental results show that H2RBox has significant performance and speed advantages over horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation methods, as well as lower memory requirements. While compared to rotated box-supervised oriented object detectors, our method shows very close performance and speed.

- **Summary**: Combining RGB images and the corresponding depth maps in semantic segmentation proves the effectiveness in the past few years. Existing RGB-D modal fusion methods either lack the non-linear feature fusion ability or treat both modal images equally, regardless of the intrinsic distribution gap or information loss. Here we find that depth maps are suitable to provide intrinsic fine-grained patterns of objects due to their local depth continuity, while RGB images effectively provide a global view. Based on this, we propose a pixel differential convolution attention (DCA) module to consider geometric information and local-range correlations for depth data. Furthermore, we extend DCA to ensemble differential convolution attention (EDCA) which propagates long-range contextual dependencies and seamlessly incorporates spatial distribution for RGB data. DCA and EDCA dynamically adjust convolutional weights by pixel difference to enable self-adaptive in local and long range, respectively. A two-branch network built with DCA and EDCA, called Differential Convolutional Network (DCANet), is proposed to fuse local and global information of two-modal data. Consequently, the individual advantage of RGB and depth data are emphasized. Our DCANet is shown to set a new state-of-the-art performance for RGB-D semantic segmentation on two challenging benchmark datasets, i.e., NYUDv2 and SUN-RGBD.

- **Summary**: In Active Domain Adaptation (ADA), one uses Active Learning (AL) to select a subset of images from the target domain, which are then annotated and used for supervised domain adaptation (DA). Given the large performance gap between supervised and unsupervised DA techniques, ADA allows for an excellent trade-off between annotation cost and performance. Prior art makes use of measures of uncertainty or disagreement of models to identify `regions' to be annotated by the human oracle. However, these regions frequently comprise of pixels at object boundaries which are hard and tedious to annotate. Hence, even if the fraction of image pixels annotated reduces, the overall annotation time and the resulting cost still remain high. In this work, we propose an ADA strategy, which given a frame, identifies a set of classes that are hardest for the model to predict accurately, thereby recommending semantically meaningful regions to be annotated in a selected frame. We show that these set of `hard' classes are context-dependent and typically vary across frames, and when annotated help the model generalize better. We propose two ADA techniques: the Anchor-based and Augmentation-based approaches to select complementary and diverse regions in the context of the current training set. Our approach achieves 66.6 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes dataset with an annotation budget of 4.7% in comparison to 64.9 mIoU by MADA using 5% of annotations. Our technique can also be used as a decorator for any existing frame-based AL technique, e.g., we report 1.5% performance improvement for CDAL on Cityscapes using our approach.

- **Summary**: Decoding human visual neural representations is a challenging task with great scientific significance in revealing vision-processing mechanisms and developing brain-like intelligent machines. Most existing methods are difficult to generalize to novel categories that have no corresponding neural data for training. The two main reasons are 1) the under-exploitation of the multimodal semantic knowledge underlying the neural data and 2) the small number of paired (stimuli-responses) training data. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a generic neural decoding method called BraVL that uses multimodal learning of brain-visual-linguistic features. We focus on modeling the relationships between brain, visual and linguistic features via multimodal deep generative models. Specifically, we leverage the mixture-of-product-of-experts formulation to infer a latent code that enables a coherent joint generation of all three modalities. To learn a more consistent joint representation and improve the data efficiency in the case of limited brain activity data, we exploit both intra- and inter-modality mutual information maximization regularization terms. In particular, our BraVL model can be trained under various semi-supervised scenarios to incorporate the visual and textual features obtained from the extra categories. Finally, we construct three trimodal matching datasets, and the extensive experiments lead to some interesting conclusions and cognitive insights: 1) decoding novel visual categories from human brain activity is practically possible with good accuracy; 2) decoding models using the combination of visual and linguistic features perform much better than those using either of them alone; 3) visual perception may be accompanied by linguistic influences to represent the semantics of visual stimuli.

- **Summary**: Confidence estimation, a task that aims to evaluate the trustworthiness of the model's prediction output during deployment, has received lots of research attention recently, due to its importance for the safe deployment of deep models. Previous works have outlined two important qualities that a reliable confidence estimation model should possess, i.e., the ability to perform well under label imbalance and the ability to handle various out-of-distribution data inputs. In this work, we propose a meta-learning framework that can simultaneously improve upon both qualities in a confidence estimation model. Specifically, we first construct virtual training and testing sets with some intentionally designed distribution differences between them. Our framework then uses the constructed sets to train the confidence estimation model through a virtual training and testing scheme leading it to learn knowledge that generalizes to diverse distributions. We show the effectiveness of our framework on both monocular depth estimation and image classification.

- **Summary**: Bird's-eye-view (BEV) grid is a common representation for the perception of road components, e.g., drivable area, in autonomous driving. Most existing approaches rely on cameras only to perform segmentation in BEV space, which is fundamentally constrained by the absence of reliable depth information. Latest works leverage both camera and LiDAR modalities, but sub-optimally fuse their features using simple, concatenation-based mechanisms.   In this paper, we address these problems by enhancing the alignment of the unimodal features in order to aid feature fusion, as well as enhancing the alignment between the cameras' perspective view (PV) and BEV representations. We propose X-Align, a novel end-to-end cross-modal and cross-view learning framework for BEV segmentation consisting of the following components: (i) a novel Cross-Modal Feature Alignment (X-FA) loss, (ii) an attention-based Cross-Modal Feature Fusion (X-FF) module to align multi-modal BEV features implicitly, and (iii) an auxiliary PV segmentation branch with Cross-View Segmentation Alignment (X-SA) losses to improve the PV-to-BEV transformation. We evaluate our proposed method across two commonly used benchmark datasets, i.e., nuScenes and KITTI-360. Notably, X-Align significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3 absolute mIoU points on nuScenes. We also provide extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the individual components.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition is a unique biometric technique that can be performed at a long distance non-cooperatively and has broad applications in public safety and intelligent traffic systems. Previous gait works focus more on minimizing the intra-class variance while ignoring the significance in constraining inter-class variance. To this end, we propose a generalized inter-class loss which resolves the inter-class variance from both sample-level feature distribution and class-level feature distribution. Instead of equal penalty strength on pair scores, the proposed loss optimizes sample-level inter-class feature distribution by dynamically adjusting the pairwise weight. Further, in class-level distribution, generalized inter-class loss adds a constraint on the uniformity of inter-class feature distribution, which forces the feature representations to approximate a hypersphere and keep maximal inter-class variance. In addition, the proposed method automatically adjusts the margin between classes which enables the inter-class feature distribution to be more flexible. The proposed method can be generalized to different gait recognition networks and achieves significant improvements. We conduct a series of experiments on CASIA-B and OUMVLP, and the experimental results show that the proposed loss can significantly improve the performance and achieves the state-of-the-art performances.

- **Summary**: Few-shot semantic segmentation aims to segment the target objects in query under the condition of a few annotated support images. Most previous works strive to mine more effective category information from the support to match with the corresponding objects in query. However, they all ignored the category information gap between query and support images. If the objects in them show large intra-class diversity, forcibly migrating the category information from the support to the query is ineffective. To solve this problem, we are the first to introduce an intermediate prototype for mining both deterministic category information from the support and adaptive category knowledge from the query. Specifically, we design an Intermediate Prototype Mining Transformer (IPMT) to learn the prototype in an iterative way. In each IPMT layer, we propagate the object information in both support and query features to the prototype and then use it to activate the query feature map. By conducting this process iteratively, both the intermediate prototype and the query feature can be progressively improved. At last, the final query feature is used to yield precise segmentation prediction. Extensive experiments on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets clearly verify the effectiveness of our IPMT and show that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: The application of deep neural networks to remote sensing imagery is often constrained by the lack of ground-truth annotations. Adressing this issue requires models that generalize efficiently from limited amounts of labeled data, allowing us to tackle a wider range of Earth observation tasks. Another challenge in this domain is developing algorithms that operate at variable spatial resolutions, e.g., for the problem of classifying land use at different scales. Recently, self-supervised learning has been applied in the remote sensing domain to exploit readily-available unlabeled data, and was shown to reduce or even close the gap with supervised learning. In this paper, we study self-supervised visual representation learning through the lens of label efficiency, for the task of land use classification on multi-resolution/multi-scale satellite images. We benchmark two contrastive self-supervised methods adapted from Momentum Contrast (MoCo) and provide evidence that these methods can be perform effectively given little downstream supervision, where randomly initialized networks fail to generalize. Moreover, they outperform out-of-domain pretraining alternatives. We use the large-scale fMoW dataset to pretrain and evaluate the networks, and validate our observations with transfer to the RESISC45 dataset.

- **Summary**: Open-Set Classification (OSC) intends to adapt closed-set classification models to real-world scenarios, where the classifier must correctly label samples of known classes while rejecting previously unseen unknown samples. Only recently, research started to investigate on algorithms that are able to handle these unknown samples correctly. Some of these approaches address OSC by including into the training set negative samples that a classifier learns to reject, expecting that these data increase the robustness of the classifier on unknown classes. Most of these approaches are evaluated on small-scale and low-resolution image datasets like MNIST, SVHN or CIFAR, which makes it difficult to assess their applicability to the real world, and to compare them among each other. We propose three open-set protocols that provide rich datasets of natural images with different levels of similarity between known and unknown classes. The protocols consist of subsets of ImageNet classes selected to provide training and testing data closer to real-world scenarios. Additionally, we propose a new validation metric that can be employed to assess whether the training of deep learning models addresses both the classification of known samples and the rejection of unknown samples. We use the protocols to compare the performance of two baseline open-set algorithms to the standard SoftMax baseline and find that the algorithms work well on negative samples that have been seen during training, and partially on out-of-distribution detection tasks, but drop performance in the presence of samples from previously unseen unknown classes.

- **Summary**: Despite tremendous progress in natural language processing using deep learning techniques in recent years, sign language production and comprehension has advanced very little. One critical barrier is the lack of largescale datasets available to the public due to the unbearable cost of labeled data generation. Efforts to provide public data for American Sign Language (ASL) comprehension have yielded two datasets, comprising more than thousand video clips. These datasets are large enough to enable a meaningful start to deep learning research on sign languages but are far too small to lead to any solution that can be practically deployed. So far, there is still no suitable dataset for ASL production. We proposed a system that can generate large scale ASL datasets for continuous ASL. It is suitable for general ASL processing and is particularly useful for ASL production. The continuous ASL dataset contains English labeled human articulations in condensed body pose data formats. To better serve the research community, we are releasing the first version of our ASL dataset, which contains 30k sentences, 416k words, a vocabulary of 18k words, in a total of 104 hours. This is the largest continuous sign language dataset published to date in terms of video duration. We also describe a system that can evolve and expand the dataset to incorporate better data processing techniques and more contents when available. It is our hope that the release of this ASL dataset and the sustainable dataset generation system to the public will propel better deep-learning research in ASL natural language processing.

- **Summary**: The accurate localization of inserted medical tubes and parts of human anatomy is a common problem when analyzing chest radiographs and something deep neural networks could potentially automate. However, many foreign objects like tubes and various anatomical structures are small in comparison to the entire chest X-ray, which leads to severely unbalanced data and makes training deep neural networks difficult. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective `Only-One-Object-Exists' (OOOE) assumption to improve the deep network's ability to localize small landmarks in chest radiographs. The OOOE enables us to recast the localization problem as a classification problem and we can replace commonly used continuous regression techniques with a multi-class discrete objective. We validate our approach using a large scale proprietary dataset of over 100K radiographs as well as publicly available RANZCR-CLiP Kaggle Challenge dataset and show that our method consistently outperforms commonly used regression-based detection models as well as commonly used pixel-wise classification methods. Additionally, we find that the method using the OOOE assumption generalizes to multiple detection problems in chest X-rays and the resulting model shows state-of-the-art performance on detecting various tube tips inserted to the patient as well as patient anatomy.

- **Summary**: The calibration of deep learning-based perception models plays a crucial role in their reliability. Our work focuses on a class-wise evaluation of several model's confidence performance for LiDAR-based semantic segmentation with the aim of providing insights into the calibration of underrepresented classes. Those classes often include VRUs and are thus of particular interest for safety reasons. With the help of a metric based on sparsification curves we compare the calibration abilities of three semantic segmentation models with different architectural concepts, each in a in deterministic and a probabilistic version. By identifying and describing the dependency between the predictive performance of a class and the respective calibration quality we aim to facilitate the model selection and refinement for safety-critical applications.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of incremental semantic segmentation (ISS) recognizing novel object/stuff categories continually without forgetting previous ones that have been learned. The catastrophic forgetting problem is particularly severe in ISS, since pixel-level ground-truth labels are available only for the novel categories at training time. To address the problem, regularization-based methods exploit probability calibration techniques to learn semantic information from unlabeled pixels. While such techniques are effective, there is still a lack of theoretical understanding of them. Replay-based methods propose to memorize a small set of images for previous categories. They achieve state-of-the-art performance at the cost of large memory footprint. We propose in this paper a novel ISS method, dubbed ALIFE, that provides a better compromise between accuracy and efficiency. To this end, we first show an in-depth analysis on the calibration techniques to better understand the effects on ISS. Based on this, we then introduce an adaptive logit regularizer (ALI) that enables our model to better learn new categories, while retaining knowledge for previous ones. We also present a feature replay scheme that memorizes features, instead of images directly, in order to reduce memory requirements significantly. Since a feature extractor is changed continually, memorized features should also be updated at every incremental stage. To handle this, we introduce category-specific rotation matrices updating the features for each category separately. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with extensive experiments on standard ISS benchmarks, and show that our method achieves a better trade-off in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Succinct representation of complex signals using coordinate-based neural representations (CNRs) has seen great progress, and several recent efforts focus on extending them for handling videos. Here, the main challenge is how to (a) alleviate a compute-inefficiency in training CNRs to (b) achieve high-quality video encoding while (c) maintaining the parameter-efficiency. To meet all requirements (a), (b), and (c) simultaneously, we propose neural video representations with learnable positional features (NVP), a novel CNR by introducing "learnable positional features" that effectively amortize a video as latent codes. Specifically, we first present a CNR architecture based on designing 2D latent keyframes to learn the common video contents across each spatio-temporal axis, which dramatically improves all of those three requirements. Then, we propose to utilize existing powerful image and video codecs as a compute-/memory-efficient compression procedure of latent codes. We demonstrate the superiority of NVP on the popular UVG benchmark; compared with prior arts, NVP not only trains 2 times faster (less than 5 minutes) but also exceeds their encoding quality as 34.07$\rightarrow$34.57 (measured with the PSNR metric), even using $>$8 times fewer parameters. We also show intriguing properties of NVP, e.g., video inpainting, video frame interpolation, etc.

### NeuralRoom: Geometry-Constrained Neural Implicit Surfaces for Indoor Scene Reconstruction

- **Summary**: We present a novel neural surface reconstruction method called NeuralRoom for reconstructing room-sized indoor scenes directly from a set of 2D images. Recently, implicit neural representations have become a promising way to reconstruct surfaces from multiview images due to their high-quality results and simplicity. However, implicit neural representations usually cannot reconstruct indoor scenes well because they suffer severe shape-radiance ambiguity. We assume that the indoor scene consists of texture-rich and flat texture-less regions. In texture-rich regions, the multiview stereo can obtain accurate results. In the flat area, normal estimation networks usually obtain a good normal estimation. Based on the above observations, we reduce the possible spatial variation range of implicit neural surfaces by reliable geometric priors to alleviate shape-radiance ambiguity. Specifically, we use multiview stereo results to limit the NeuralRoom optimization space and then use reliable geometric priors to guide NeuralRoom training. Then the NeuralRoom would produce a neural scene representation that can render an image consistent with the input training images. In addition, we propose a smoothing method called perturbation-residual restrictions to improve the accuracy and completeness of the flat region, which assumes that the sampling points in a local surface should have the same normal and similar distance to the observation center. Experiments on the ScanNet dataset show that our method can reconstruct the texture-less area of indoor scenes while maintaining the accuracy of detail. We also apply NeuralRoom to more advanced multiview reconstruction algorithms and significantly improve their reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have shown their vulnerability when dealing with adversarial attacks. Existing attacks almost perform on low-level instances, such as pixels and super-pixels, and rarely exploit semantic clues. For face recognition attacks, existing methods typically generate the l_p-norm perturbations on pixels, however, resulting in low attack transferability and high vulnerability to denoising defense models. In this work, instead of performing perturbations on the low-level pixels, we propose to generate attacks through perturbing on the high-level semantics to improve attack transferability. Specifically, a unified flexible framework, Adversarial Attributes (Adv-Attribute), is designed to generate inconspicuous and transferable attacks on face recognition, which crafts the adversarial noise and adds it into different attributes based on the guidance of the difference in face recognition features from the target. Moreover, the importance-aware attribute selection and the multi-objective optimization strategy are introduced to further ensure the balance of stealthiness and attacking strength. Extensive experiments on the FFHQ and CelebA-HQ datasets show that the proposed Adv-Attribute method achieves the state-of-the-art attacking success rates while maintaining better visual effects against recent attack methods.

- **Summary**: Video language pre-training methods have mainly adopted sparse sampling techniques to alleviate the temporal redundancy of videos. Though effective, sparse sampling still suffers inter-modal redundancy: visual redundancy and textual redundancy. Compared with highly generalized text, sparsely sampled frames usually contain text-independent portions, called visual redundancy. Sparse sampling is also likely to miss important frames corresponding to some text portions, resulting in textual redundancy. Inter-modal redundancy leads to a mismatch of video and text information, hindering the model from better learning the shared semantics across modalities. To alleviate it, we propose Redundancy-aware Video-language Pre-training. We design a redundancy measurement of video patches and text tokens by calculating the cross-modal minimum dis-similarity. Then, we penalize the highredundant video patches and text tokens through a proposed redundancy-aware contrastive learning. We evaluate our method on four benchmark datasets, MSRVTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and LSMDC, achieving a significant improvement over the previous stateof-the-art results. Our code are available at https://github.com/caskcsg/VLP/tree/main/RaP.

- **Summary**: Segmentation, i.e., the partitioning of volumetric data into components, is a crucial task in many image processing applications ever since such data could be generated. Most existing applications nowadays, specifically CNNs, make use of voxelwise classification systems which need to be trained on a large number of annotated training volumes. However, in many practical applications such data sets are seldom available and the generation of annotations is time-consuming and cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce a novel voxelwise segmentation method based on active learning on geometric features. Our method uses interactively provided seed points to train a voxelwise classifier based entirely on local information. The combination of an ad hoc incorporation of domain knowledge and local processing results in a flexible yet efficient segmentation method that is applicable to three-dimensional volumes without size restrictions. We illustrate the potential and flexibility of our approach by applying it to selected computed tomography scans where we perform different segmentation tasks to scans from different domains and of different sizes.

- **Summary**: Without the demand of training in reality, humans can easily detect a known concept simply based on its language description. Empowering deep learning with this ability undoubtedly enables the neural network to handle complex vision tasks, e.g., object detection, without collecting and annotating real images. To this end, this paper introduces a novel challenging learning paradigm Imaginary-Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where neither real images nor manual annotations are allowed for training object detectors. To resolve this challenge, we propose ImaginaryNet, a framework to synthesize images by combining pretrained language model and text-to-image synthesis model. Given a class label, the language model is used to generate a full description of a scene with a target object, and the text-to-image model deployed to generate a photo-realistic image. With the synthesized images and class labels, weakly supervised object detection can then be leveraged to accomplish ISOD. By gradually introducing real images and manual annotations, ImaginaryNet can collaborate with other supervision settings to further boost detection performance. Experiments show that ImaginaryNet can (i) obtain about 70% performance in ISOD compared with the weakly supervised counterpart of the same backbone trained on real data, (ii) significantly improve the baseline while achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance by incorporating ImaginaryNet with other supervision settings.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training is exploited to develop a robust Deep Neural Network (DNN) model against the malicious altered data. These attacks may have catastrophic effects on DNN models but are indistinguishable for a human being. For example, an external attack can modify an image adding noises invisible for a human eye, but a DNN model misclassified the image. A key objective for developing robust DNN models is to use a learning algorithm that is fast but can also give model that is robust against different types of adversarial attacks. Especially for adversarial training, enormously long training times are needed for obtaining high accuracy under many different types of adversarial samples generated using different adversarial attack techniques.   This paper aims at accelerating the adversarial training to enable fast development of robust DNN models against adversarial attacks. The general method for improving the training performance is the hyperparameters fine-tuning, where the learning rate is one of the most crucial hyperparameters. By modifying its shape (the value over time) and value during the training, we can obtain a model robust to adversarial attacks faster than standard training.   First, we conduct experiments on two different datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100), exploring various techniques. Then, this analysis is leveraged to develop a novel fast training methodology, AccelAT, which automatically adjusts the learning rate for different epochs based on the accuracy gradient. The experiments show comparable results with the related works, and in several experiments, the adversarial training of DNNs using our AccelAT framework is conducted up to 2 times faster than the existing techniques. Thus, our findings boost the speed of adversarial training in an era in which security and performance are fundamental optimization objectives in DNN-based applications.

- **Summary**: Most matting researches resort to advanced semantics to achieve high-quality alpha mattes, and direct low-level features combination is usually explored to complement alpha details. However, we argue that appearance-agnostic integration can only provide biased foreground details and alpha mattes require different-level feature aggregation for better pixel-wise opacity perception. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Hierarchical and Progressive Attention Matting Network (HAttMatting++), which can better predict the opacity of the foreground from single RGB images without additional input. Specifically, we utilize channel-wise attention to distill pyramidal features and employ spatial attention at different levels to filter appearance cues. This progressive attention mechanism can estimate alpha mattes from adaptive semantics and semantics-indicated boundaries. We also introduce a hybrid loss function fusing Structural SIMilarity (SSIM), Mean Square Error (MSE), Adversarial loss, and sentry supervision to guide the network to further improve the overall foreground structure. Besides, we construct a large-scale and challenging image matting dataset comprised of 59, 600 training images and 1000 test images (a total of 646 distinct foreground alpha mattes), which can further improve the robustness of our hierarchical and progressive aggregation model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HAttMatting++ can capture sophisticated foreground structures and achieve state-of-the-art performance with single RGB images as input.



### Feature-Proxy Transformer for Few-Shot Segmentation

- **Summary**: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims at performing semantic segmentation on novel classes given a few annotated support samples. With a rethink of recent advances, we find that the current FSS framework has deviated far from the supervised segmentation framework: Given the deep features, FSS methods typically use an intricate decoder to perform sophisticated pixel-wise matching, while the supervised segmentation methods use a simple linear classification head. Due to the intricacy of the decoder and its matching pipeline, it is not easy to follow such an FSS framework. This paper revives the straightforward framework of "feature extractor $+$ linear classification head" and proposes a novel Feature-Proxy Transformer (FPTrans) method, in which the "proxy" is the vector representing a semantic class in the linear classification head. FPTrans has two keypoints for learning discriminative features and representative proxies: 1) To better utilize the limited support samples, the feature extractor makes the query interact with the support features from the bottom to top layers using a novel prompting strategy. 2) FPTrans uses multiple local background proxies (instead of a single one) because the background is not homogeneous and may contain some novel foreground regions. These two keypoints are easily integrated into the vision transformer backbone with the prompting mechanism in the transformer. Given the learned features and proxies, FPTrans directly compares their cosine similarity for segmentation. Although the framework is straightforward, we show that FPTrans achieves competitive FSS accuracy on par with state-of-the-art decoder-based methods.

- **Summary**: The presence and density of specific types of immune cells are important to understand a patient's immune response to cancer. However, immunofluorescence staining required to identify T cell subtypes is expensive, time-consuming, and rarely performed in clinical settings. We present a framework to virtually stain Hoechst images (which are cheap and widespread) with both CD3 and CD8 to identify T cell subtypes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma using generative adversarial networks. Our proposed method jointly learns both staining tasks, incentivising the network to incorporate mutually beneficial information from each task. We devise a novel metric to quantify the virtual staining quality, and use it to evaluate our method.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals by recognizing their walking patterns. However, an observation is made that most of the previous gait recognition methods degenerate significantly due to two memorization effects, namely appearance memorization and label noise memorization. To address the problem, for the first time noisy gait recognition is studied, and a cyclic noise-tolerant network (CNTN) is proposed with a cyclic training algorithm, which equips the two parallel networks with explicitly different abilities, namely one forgetting network and one memorizing network. The overall model will not memorize the pattern unless the two different networks both memorize it. Further, a more refined co-teaching constraint is imposed to help the model learn intrinsic patterns which are less influenced by memorization. Also, to address label noise memorization, an adaptive noise detection module is proposed to rule out the samples with high possibility to be noisy from updating the model. Experiments are conducted on the three most popular benchmarks and CNTN achieves state-of-the-art performances. We also reconstruct two noisy gait recognition datasets, and CNTN gains significant improvements (especially 6% improvements on CL setting). CNTN is also compatible with any off-the-shelf backbones and improves them consistently.

- **Summary**: This paper reviews recent deep-learning-based matting research and conceives our wider and higher motivation for image matting. Many approaches achieve alpha mattes with complex encoders to extract robust semantics, then resort to the U-net-like decoder to concatenate or fuse encoder features. However, image matting is essentially a pixel-wise regression, and the ideal situation is to perceive the maximum opacity correspondence from the input image. In this paper, we argue that the high-resolution feature representation, perception and communication are more crucial for matting accuracy. Therefore, we propose an Intensive Integration and Global Foreground Perception network (I2GFP) to integrate wider and higher feature streams. Wider means we combine intensive features in each decoder stage, while higher suggests we retain high-resolution intermediate features and perceive large-scale foreground appearance. Our motivation sacrifices model depth for a significant performance promotion. We perform extensive experiments to prove the proposed I2GFP model, and state-of-the-art results can be achieved on different public datasets.

- **Summary**: Text image super-resolution is a unique and important task to enhance readability of text images to humans. It is widely used as pre-processing in scene text recognition. However, due to the complex degradation in natural scenes, recovering high-resolution texts from the low-resolution inputs is ambiguous and challenging. Existing methods mainly leverage deep neural networks trained with pixel-wise losses designed for natural image reconstruction, which ignore the unique character characteristics of texts. A few works proposed content-based losses. However, they only focus on text recognizers' accuracy, while the reconstructed images may still be ambiguous to humans. Further, they often have weak generalizability to handle cross languages. To this end, we present TATSR, a Text-Aware Text Super-Resolution framework, which effectively learns the unique text characteristics using Criss-Cross Transformer Blocks (CCTBs) and a novel Content Perceptual (CP) Loss. The CCTB extracts vertical and horizontal content information from text images by two orthogonal transformers, respectively. The CP Loss supervises the text reconstruction with content semantics by multi-scale text recognition features, which effectively incorporates content awareness into the framework. Extensive experiments on various language datasets demonstrate that TATSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recognition accuracy and human perception.

- **Summary**: The normalizing layer has become one of the basic configurations of deep learning models, but it still suffers from computational inefficiency, interpretability difficulties, and low generality. After gaining a deeper understanding of the recent normalization and normalizer-free research works from a sample's perspective, we reveal the fact that the problem lies in the sampling noise and the inappropriate prior assumption. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective alternative to normalization, which is called "NoMorelization". NoMorelization is composed of two trainable scalars and a zero-centered noise injector. Experimental results demonstrate that NoMorelization is a general component for deep learning and is suitable for different model paradigms (e.g., convolution-based and attention-based models) to tackle different tasks (e.g., discriminative and generative tasks). Compared with existing mainstream normalizers (e.g., BN, LN, and IN) and state-of-the-art normalizer-free methods, NoMorelization shows the best speed-accuracy trade-off.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is key to improving the generalization ability of deep learning models. Mixup is a simple and widely-used data augmentation technique that has proven effective in alleviating the problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Also, recent studies of saliency-aware Mixup in the image domain show that preserving discriminative parts is beneficial to improving the generalization performance. However, these Mixup-based data augmentations are underexplored in 3D vision, especially in point clouds. In this paper, we propose SageMix, a saliency-guided Mixup for point clouds to preserve salient local structures. Specifically, we extract salient regions from two point clouds and smoothly combine them into one continuous shape. With a simple sequential sampling by re-weighted saliency scores, SageMix preserves the local structure of salient regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing Mixup methods in various benchmark point cloud datasets. With PointNet++, our method achieves an accuracy gain of 2.6% and 4.0% over standard training in 3D Warehouse dataset (MN40) and ScanObjectNN, respectively. In addition to generalization performance, SageMix improves robustness and uncertainty calibration. Moreover, when adopting our method to various tasks including part segmentation and standard 2D image classification, our method achieves competitive performance.

- **Summary**: The traditional model upgrading paradigm for retrieval requires recomputing all gallery embeddings before deploying the new model (dubbed as "backfilling"), which is quite expensive and time-consuming considering billions of instances in industrial applications. BCT presents the first step towards backward-compatible model upgrades to get rid of backfilling. It is workable but leaves the new model in a dilemma between new feature discriminativeness and new-to-old compatibility due to the undifferentiated compatibility constraints. In this work, we propose Darwinian Model Upgrades (DMU), which disentangle the inheritance and variation in the model evolving with selective backward compatibility and forward adaptation, respectively. The old-to-new heritable knowledge is measured by old feature discriminativeness, and the gallery features, especially those of poor quality, are evolved in a lightweight manner to become more adaptive in the new latent space. We demonstrate the superiority of DMU through comprehensive experiments on large-scale landmark retrieval and face recognition benchmarks. DMU effectively alleviates the new-to-new degradation and improves new-to-old compatibility, rendering a more proper model upgrading paradigm in large-scale retrieval systems.

- **Summary**: Thresholding is the most widely used segmentation method in volumetric image processing, and its pointwise nature makes it attractive for the fast handling of large three-dimensional samples. However, global thresholds often do not properly extract components in the presence of artifacts, measurement noise or grayscale value fluctuations. This paper introduces Feature-Adaptive Interactive Thresholding (FAITH), a thresholding technique that incorporates (geometric) features, local processing and interactive user input to overcome these limitations. Given a global threshold suitable for most regions, FAITH uses interactively selected seed voxels to identify critical regions in which that threshold will be adapted locally on the basis of features computed from local environments around these voxels. The combination of domain expert knowledge and a rigorous mathematical model thus enables a very exible way of local thresholding with intuitive user interaction. A qualitative analysis shows that the proposed model is able to overcome limitations typically occuring in plain thresholding while staying efficient enough to also allow the segmentation of big volumes.

- **Summary**: Neural fields have rapidly been adopted for representing 3D signals, but their application to more classical 2D image-processing has been relatively limited. In this paper, we consider one of the most important operations in image processing: upsampling. In deep learning, learnable upsampling layers have extensively been used for single image super-resolution. We propose to parameterize upsampling kernels as neural fields. This parameterization leads to a compact architecture that obtains a 40-fold reduction in the number of parameters when compared with competing arbitrary-scale super-resolution architectures. When upsampling images of size 256x256 we show that our architecture is 2x-10x more efficient than competing arbitrary-scale super-resolution architectures, and more efficient than sub-pixel convolutions when instantiated to a single-scale model. In the general setting, these gains grow polynomially with the square of the target scale. We validate our method on standard benchmarks showing such efficiency gains can be achieved without sacrifices in super-resolution performance.

- **Summary**: Medical image datasets and their annotations are not growing as fast as their equivalents in the general domain. This makes translation from the newest, more data-intensive methods that have made a large impact on the vision field increasingly more difficult and less efficient. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic latent variable model for disease classification in chest X-ray images. Specifically we consider chest X-ray datasets that contain global disease labels, and for a smaller subset contain object level expert annotations in the form of eye gaze patterns and disease bounding boxes. We propose a two-stage optimization algorithm which is able to handle these different label granularities through a single training pipeline in a two-stage manner. In our pipeline global dataset features are learned in the lower level layers of the model. The specific details and nuances in the fine-grained expert object-level annotations are learned in the final layers of the model using a knowledge distillation method inspired by conditional variational inference. Subsequently, model weights are frozen to guide this learning process and prevent overfitting on the smaller richly annotated data subsets. The proposed method yields consistent classification improvement across different backbones on the common benchmark datasets Chest X-ray14 and MIMIC-CXR. This shows how two-stage learning of labels from coarse to fine-grained, in particular with object level annotations, is an effective method for more optimal annotation usage.

- **Summary**: This work proposes Multi-task Meta Learning (MTML), integrating two learning paradigms Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and meta learning, to bring together the best of both worlds. In particular, it focuses simultaneous learning of multiple tasks, an element of MTL and promptly adapting to new tasks, a quality of meta learning. It is important to highlight that we focus on heterogeneous tasks, which are of distinct kind, in contrast to typically considered homogeneous tasks (e.g., if all tasks are classification or if all tasks are regression tasks). The fundamental idea is to train a multi-task model, such that when an unseen task is introduced, it can learn in fewer steps whilst offering a performance at least as good as conventional single task learning on the new task or inclusion within the MTL. By conducting various experiments, we demonstrate this paradigm on two datasets and four tasks: NYU-v2 and the taskonomy dataset for which we perform semantic segmentation, depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and edge detection. MTML achieves state-of-the-art results for three out of four tasks for the NYU-v2 dataset and two out of four for the taskonomy dataset. In the taskonomy dataset, it was discovered that many pseudo-labeled segmentation masks lacked classes that were expected to be present in the ground truth; however, our MTML approach was found to be effective in detecting these missing classes, delivering good qualitative results. While, quantitatively its performance was affected due to the presence of incorrect ground truth labels.

- **Summary**: Imaging is critical to the characterisation of materials. However, even with careful sample preparation and microscope calibration, imaging techniques are often prone to defects and unwanted artefacts. This is particularly problematic for applications where the micrograph is to be used for simulation or feature analysis, as defects are likely to lead to inaccurate results. Microstructural inpainting is a method to alleviate this problem by replacing occluded regions with synthetic microstructure with matching boundaries. In this paper we introduce two methods that use generative adversarial networks to generate contiguous inpainted regions of arbitrary shape and size by learning the microstructural distribution from the unoccluded data. We find that one benefits from high speed and simplicity, whilst the other gives smoother boundaries at the inpainting border. We also outline the development of a graphical user interface that allows users to utilise these machine learning methods in a 'no-code' environment.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation models that generate images based on prompt descriptions have attracted an increasing amount of attention during the past few months. Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular text-to-image generation models, including DALL$\cdot$E 2, Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25 and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by text-to-image generation models. We appeal to the community's consideration of the counterpart solutions, like ours, against the rapidly-evolving fake image generation.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models dealing with image understanding in real-world settings must be able to adapt to a wide variety of tasks across different domains. Domain adaptation and class incremental learning deal with domain and task variability separately, whereas their unified solution is still an open problem. We tackle both facets of the problem together, taking into account the semantic shift within both input and label spaces. We start by formally introducing continual learning under task and domain shift. Then, we address the proposed setup by using style transfer techniques to extend knowledge across domains when learning incremental tasks and a robust distillation framework to effectively recollect task knowledge under incremental domain shift. The devised framework (LwS, Learning with Style) is able to generalize incrementally acquired task knowledge across all the domains encountered, proving to be robust against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experimental evaluation on multiple autonomous driving datasets shows how the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, which prove to be ill-equipped to deal with continual semantic segmentation under both task and domain shift.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to identify unseen classes with zero samples during training. Broadly speaking, present ZSL methods usually adopt class-level semantic labels and compare them with instance-level semantic predictions to infer unseen classes. However, we find that such existing models mostly produce imbalanced semantic predictions, i.e. these models could perform precisely for some semantics, but may not for others. To address the drawback, we aim to introduce an imbalanced learning framework into ZSL. However, we find that imbalanced ZSL has two unique challenges: (1) Its imbalanced predictions are highly correlated with the value of semantic labels rather than the number of samples as typically considered in the traditional imbalanced learning; (2) Different semantics follow quite different error distributions between classes. To mitigate these issues, we first formalize ZSL as an imbalanced regression problem which offers empirical evidences to interpret how semantic labels lead to imbalanced semantic predictions. We then propose a re-weighted loss termed Re-balanced Mean-Squared Error (ReMSE), which tracks the mean and variance of error distributions, thus ensuring rebalanced learning across classes. As a major contribution, we conduct a series of analyses showing that ReMSE is theoretically well established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively alleviates the imbalance in semantic prediction and outperforms many state-of-the-art ZSL methods.

- **Summary**: Increased biosecurity and food safety requirements may increase demand for efficient traceability and identification systems of livestock in the supply chain. The advanced technologies of machine learning and computer vision have been applied in precision livestock management, including critical disease detection, vaccination, production management, tracking, and health monitoring. This paper offers a systematic literature review (SLR) of vision-based cattle identification. More specifically, this SLR is to identify and analyse the research related to cattle identification using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). For the two main applications of cattle detection and cattle identification, all the ML based papers only solve cattle identification problems. However, both detection and identification problems were studied in the DL based papers. Based on our survey report, the most used ML models for cattle identification were support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and artificial neural network (ANN). Convolutional neural network (CNN), residual network (ResNet), Inception, You Only Look Once (YOLO), and Faster R-CNN were popular DL models in the selected papers. Among these papers, the most distinguishing features were the muzzle prints and coat patterns of cattle. Local binary pattern (LBP), speeded up robust features (SURF), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and Inception or CNN were identified as the most used feature extraction methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in a large number of tasks in computer vision. One of them is object detection for autonomous driving. Although CNNs are used widely in many areas, what happens inside the network is still unexplained on many levels. Our goal is to determine the effect of Intrinsic dimension (i.e. minimum number of parameters required to represent data) in different layers on the accuracy of object detection network for augmented data sets. Our investigation determines that there is difference between the representation of normal and augmented data during feature extraction.

- **Summary**: The objective of this paper is audio-visual synchronisation of general videos 'in the wild'. For such videos, the events that may be harnessed for synchronisation cues may be spatially small and may occur only infrequently during a many seconds-long video clip, i.e. the synchronisation signal is 'sparse in space and time'. This contrasts with the case of synchronising videos of talking heads, where audio-visual correspondence is dense in both time and space.   We make four contributions: (i) in order to handle longer temporal sequences required for sparse synchronisation signals, we design a multi-modal transformer model that employs 'selectors' to distil the long audio and visual streams into small sequences that are then used to predict the temporal offset between streams. (ii) We identify artefacts that can arise from the compression codecs used for audio and video and can be used by audio-visual models in training to artificially solve the synchronisation task. (iii) We curate a dataset with only sparse in time and space synchronisation signals; and (iv) the effectiveness of the proposed model is shown on both dense and sparse datasets quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved the state-of-the-art performance in medical image segmentation due to their ability to extract highly complex feature representations. However, it is argued in recent studies that traditional CNNs lack the intelligence to capture long-term dependencies of different image regions. Following the success of applying Transformer models on natural language processing tasks, the medical image segmentation field has also witnessed growing interest in utilizing Transformers, due to their ability to capture long-range contextual information. However, unlike CNNs, Transformers lack the ability to learn local feature representations. Thus, to fully utilize the advantages of both CNNs and Transformers, we propose a hybrid encoder-decoder segmentation model (ConvTransSeg). It consists of a multi-layer CNN as the encoder for feature learning and the corresponding multi-level Transformer as the decoder for segmentation prediction. The encoder and decoder are interconnected in a multi-resolution manner. We compared our method with many other state-of-the-art hybrid CNN and Transformer segmentation models on binary and multiple class image segmentation tasks using several public medical image datasets, including skin lesion, polyp, cell and brain tissue. The experimental results show that our method achieves overall the best performance in terms of Dice coefficient and average symmetric surface distance measures with low model complexity and memory consumption. In contrast to most Transformer-based methods that we compared, our method does not require the use of pre-trained models to achieve similar or better performance.

- **Summary**: Generating natural language questions from visual scenes, known as Visual Question Generation (VQG), has been explored in the recent past where large amounts of meticulously labeled data provide the training corpus. However, in practice, it is not uncommon to have only a few images with question annotations corresponding to a few types of answers. In this paper, we propose a new and challenging Few-Shot Visual Question Generation (FS-VQG) task and provide a comprehensive benchmark to it. Specifically, we evaluate various existing VQG approaches as well as popular few-shot solutions based on meta-learning and self-supervised strategies for the FS-VQG task. We conduct experiments on two popular existing datasets VQG and Visual7w. In addition, we have also cleaned and extended the VQG dataset for use in a few-shot scenario, with additional image-question pairs as well as additional answer categories. We call this new dataset VQG-23. Several important findings emerge from our experiments, that shed light on the limits of current models in few-shot vision and language generation tasks. We find that trivially extending existing VQG approaches with transfer learning or meta-learning may not be enough to tackle the inherent challenges in few-shot VQG. We believe that this work will contribute to accelerating the progress in few-shot learning research.

- **Summary**: Calibrated probabilistic classifiers are models whose predicted probabilities can directly be interpreted as uncertainty estimates. It has been shown recently that deep neural networks are poorly calibrated and tend to output overconfident predictions. As a remedy, we propose a low-bias, trainable calibration error estimator based on Dirichlet kernel density estimates, which asymptotically converges to the true $L_p$ calibration error. This novel estimator enables us to tackle the strongest notion of multiclass calibration, called canonical (or distribution) calibration, while other common calibration methods are tractable only for top-label and marginal calibration. The computational complexity of our estimator is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, the convergence rate is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$, and it is unbiased up to $\mathcal{O}(n^{-2})$, achieved by a geometric series debiasing scheme. In practice, this means that the estimator can be applied to small subsets of data, enabling efficient estimation and mini-batch updates. The proposed method has a natural choice of kernel, and can be used to generate consistent estimates of other quantities based on conditional expectation, such as the sharpness of a probabilistic classifier. Empirical results validate the correctness of our estimator, and demonstrate its utility in canonical calibration error estimation and calibration error regularized risk minimization.

- **Summary**: Specular microscopy assessment of the human corneal endothelium (CE) in Fuchs' dystrophy is challenging due to the presence of dark image regions called guttae. This paper proposes a UNet-based segmentation approach that requires minimal post-processing and achieves reliable CE morphometric assessment and guttae identification across all degrees of Fuchs' dystrophy. We cast the segmentation problem as a regression task of the cell and gutta signed distance maps instead of a pixel-level classification task as typically done with UNets. Compared to the conventional UNet classification approach, the distance-map regression approach converges faster in clinically relevant parameters. It also produces morphometric parameters that agree with the manually-segmented ground-truth data, namely the average cell density difference of -41.9 cells/mm2 (95% confidence interval (CI) [-306.2, 222.5]) and the average difference of mean cell area of 14.8 um2 (95% CI [-41.9, 71.5]). These results suggest a promising alternative for CE assessment.

- **Summary**: Single image blind deblurring is highly ill-posed as neither the latent sharp image nor the blur kernel is known. Even though considerable progress has been made, several major difficulties remain for blind deblurring, including the trade-off between high-performance deblurring and real-time processing. Besides, we observe that current single image blind deblurring networks cannot further improve or stabilize the performance but significantly degrades the performance when re-deblurring is repeatedly applied. This implies the limitation of these networks in modeling an ideal deblurring process. In this work, we make two contributions to tackle the above difficulties: (1) We introduce the idempotent constraint into the deblurring framework and present a deep idempotent network to achieve improved blind non-uniform deblurring performance with stable re-deblurring. (2) We propose a simple yet efficient deblurring network with lightweight encoder-decoder units and a recurrent structure that can deblur images in a progressive residual fashion. Extensive experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets prove the superiority of our proposed framework. Remarkably, our proposed network is nearly 6.5X smaller and 6.4X faster than the state-of-the-art while achieving comparable high performance.

- **Summary**: Recently, transformer-based networks have shown impressive results in semantic segmentation. Yet for real-time semantic segmentation, pure CNN-based approaches still dominate in this field, due to the time-consuming computation mechanism of transformer. We propose RTFormer, an efficient dual-resolution transformer for real-time semantic segmenation, which achieves better trade-off between performance and efficiency than CNN-based models. To achieve high inference efficiency on GPU-like devices, our RTFormer leverages GPU-Friendly Attention with linear complexity and discards the multi-head mechanism. Besides, we find that cross-resolution attention is more efficient to gather global context information for high-resolution branch by spreading the high level knowledge learned from low-resolution branch. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RTFormer, it achieves state-of-the-art on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCOStuff, and shows promising results on ADE20K.

- **Summary**: High resolution and advanced semantic representation are both vital for dense prediction. Empirically, low-resolution feature maps often achieve stronger semantic representation, and high-resolution feature maps generally can better identify local features such as edges, but contains weaker semantic information. Existing state-of-the-art frameworks such as HRNet has kept low-resolution and high-resolution feature maps in parallel, and repeatedly exchange the information across different resolutions. However, we believe that the lowest-resolution feature map often contains the strongest semantic information, and it is necessary to go through more layers to merge with high-resolution feature maps, while for high-resolution feature maps, the computational cost of each convolutional layer is very large, and there is no need to go through so many layers. Therefore, we designed a U-shaped High-Resolution Network (U-HRNet), which adds more stages after the feature map with strongest semantic representation and relaxes the constraint in HRNet that all resolutions need to be calculated parallel for a newly added stage. More calculations are allocated to low-resolution feature maps, which significantly improves the overall semantic representation. U-HRNet is a substitute for the HRNet backbone and can achieve significant improvement on multiple semantic segmentation and depth prediction datasets, under the exactly same training and inference setting, with almost no increasing in the amount of calculation.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel normal estimation method called HSurf-Net, which can accurately predict normals from point clouds with noise and density variations. Previous methods focus on learning point weights to fit neighborhoods into a geometric surface approximated by a polynomial function with a predefined order, based on which normals are estimated. However, fitting surfaces explicitly from raw point clouds suffers from overfitting or underfitting issues caused by inappropriate polynomial orders and outliers, which significantly limits the performance of existing methods. To address these issues, we introduce hyper surface fitting to implicitly learn hyper surfaces, which are represented by multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers that take point features as input and output surface patterns in a high dimensional feature space. We introduce a novel space transformation module, which consists of a sequence of local aggregation layers and global shift layers, to learn an optimal feature space, and a relative position encoding module to effectively convert point clouds into the learned feature space. Our model learns hyper surfaces from the noise-less features and directly predicts normal vectors. We jointly optimize the MLP weights and module parameters in a data-driven manner to make the model adaptively find the most suitable surface pattern for various points. Experimental results show that our HSurf-Net achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the synthetic shape dataset, the real-world indoor and outdoor scene datasets. The code, data and pretrained models are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Large pre-trained models have proved to be remarkable zero- and (prompt-based) few-shot learners in unimodal vision and language tasks. We propose MAPL, a simple and parameter-efficient method that reuses frozen pre-trained unimodal models and leverages their strong generalization capabilities in multimodal vision-language (VL) settings. MAPL learns a lightweight mapping between the representation spaces of unimodal models using aligned image-text data, and can generalize to unseen VL tasks from just a few in-context examples. The small number of trainable parameters makes MAPL effective at low-data and in-domain learning. Moreover, MAPL's modularity enables easy extension to other pre-trained models. Extensive experiments on several visual question answering and image captioning benchmarks show that MAPL achieves superior or competitive performance compared to similar methods while training orders of magnitude fewer parameters. MAPL can be trained in just a few hours using modest computational resources and public datasets. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/mair-lab/mapl.

- **Summary**: We propose a generalizable neural radiance fields - MonoNeRF, that can be trained on large-scale monocular videos of moving in static scenes without any ground-truth annotations of depth and camera poses. MonoNeRF follows an Autoencoder-based architecture, where the encoder estimates the monocular depth and the camera pose, and the decoder constructs a Multiplane NeRF representation based on the depth encoder feature, and renders the input frames with the estimated camera. The learning is supervised by the reconstruction error. Once the model is learned, it can be applied to multiple applications including depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and single-image novel view synthesis.

- **Summary**: Machine learning-based modeling of physical systems has experienced increased interest in recent years. Despite some impressive progress, there is still a lack of benchmarks for Scientific ML that are easy to use but still challenging and representative of a wide range of problems. We introduce PDEBench, a benchmark suite of time-dependent simulation tasks based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). PDEBench comprises both code and data to benchmark the performance of novel machine learning models against both classical numerical simulations and machine learning baselines. Our proposed set of benchmark problems contribute the following unique features: (1) A much wider range of PDEs compared to existing benchmarks, ranging from relatively common examples to more realistic and difficult problems; (2) much larger ready-to-use datasets compared to prior work, comprising multiple simulation runs across a larger number of initial and boundary conditions and PDE parameters; (3) more extensible source codes with user-friendly APIs for data generation and baseline results with popular machine learning models (FNO, U-Net, PINN, Gradient-Based Inverse Method). PDEBench allows researchers to extend the benchmark freely for their own purposes using a standardized API and to compare the performance of new models to existing baseline methods. We also propose new evaluation metrics with the aim to provide a more holistic understanding of learning methods in the context of Scientific ML. With those metrics we identify tasks which are challenging for recent ML methods and propose these tasks as future challenges for the community. The code is available at https://github.com/pdebench/PDEBench.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown promising performance on a variety of recognition tasks using the standard zero-shot classification procedure -- computing similarity between the query image and the embedded words for each category. By only using the category name, they neglect to make use of the rich context of additional information that language affords. The procedure gives no intermediate understanding of why a category is chosen, and furthermore provides no mechanism for adjusting the criteria used towards this decision. We present an alternative framework for classification with VLMs, which we call classification by description. We ask VLMs to check for descriptive features rather than broad categories: to find a tiger, look for its stripes; its claws; and more. By basing decisions on these descriptors, we can provide additional cues that encourage using the features we want to be used. In the process, we can get a clear idea of what features the model uses to construct its decision; it gains some level of inherent explainability. We query large language models (e.g., GPT-3) for these descriptors to obtain them in a scalable way. Extensive experiments show our framework has numerous advantages past interpretability. We show improvements in accuracy on ImageNet across distribution shifts; demonstrate the ability to adapt VLMs to recognize concepts unseen during training; and illustrate how descriptors can be edited to effectively mitigate bias compared to the baseline.

- **Summary**: While 6D object pose estimation has wide applications across computer vision and robotics, it remains far from being solved due to the lack of annotations. The problem becomes even more challenging when moving to category-level 6D pose, which requires generalization to unseen instances. Current approaches are restricted by leveraging annotations from simulation or collected from humans. In this paper, we overcome this barrier by introducing a self-supervised learning approach trained directly on large-scale real-world object videos for category-level 6D pose estimation in the wild. Our framework reconstructs the canonical 3D shape of an object category and learns dense correspondences between input images and the canonical shape via surface embedding. For training, we propose novel geometrical cycle-consistency losses which construct cycles across 2D-3D spaces, across different instances and different time steps. The learned correspondence can be applied for 6D pose estimation and other downstream tasks such as keypoint transfer. Surprisingly, our method, without any human annotations or simulators, can achieve on-par or even better performance than previous supervised or semi-supervised methods on in-the-wild images.

- **Summary**: In class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS), deep learning architectures suffer from the critical problems of catastrophic forgetting and semantic background shift. Although recent works focused on these issues, existing classifier initialization methods do not address the background shift problem and assign the same initialization weights to both background and new foreground class classifiers. We propose to address the background shift with a novel classifier initialization method which employs gradient-based attribution to identify the most relevant weights for new classes from the classifier's weights for the previous background and transfers these weights to the new classifier. This warm-start weight initialization provides a general solution applicable to several CISS methods. Furthermore, it accelerates learning of new classes while mitigating forgetting. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement in mIoU compared to the state-of-the-art CISS methods on the Pascal-VOC 2012, ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets.

- **Summary**: Masked Autoencoding (MAE) has emerged as an effective approach for pre-training representations across multiple domains. In contrast to discrete tokens in natural languages, the input for image MAE is continuous and subject to additional specifications. We systematically study each input specification during the pre-training stage, and find sequence length is a key axis that further scales MAE. Our study leads to a long-sequence version of MAE with minimal changes to the original recipe, by just decoupling the mask size from the patch size. For object detection and semantic segmentation, our long-sequence MAE shows consistent gains across all the experimental setups without extra computation cost during the transfer. While long-sequence pre-training is discerned most beneficial for detection and segmentation, we also achieve strong results on ImageNet-1K classification by keeping a standard image size and only increasing the sequence length. We hope our findings can provide new insights and avenues for scaling in computer vision.

- **Summary**: Prompt tuning, a parameter- and data-efficient transfer learning paradigm that tunes only a small number of parameters in a model's input space, has become a trend in the vision community since the emergence of large vision-language models like CLIP. We present a systematic study on two representative prompt tuning methods, namely text prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning. A major finding is that none of the unimodal prompt tuning methods performs consistently well: text prompt tuning fails on data with high intra-class visual variances while visual prompt tuning cannot handle low inter-class variances. To combine the best from both worlds, we propose a simple approach called Unified Prompt Tuning (UPT), which essentially learns a tiny neural network to jointly optimize prompts across different modalities. Extensive experiments on over 11 vision datasets show that UPT achieves a better trade-off than the unimodal counterparts on few-shot learning benchmarks, as well as on domain generalization benchmarks. Code and models will be released to facilitate future research.

- **Summary**: Top-performing landmark estimation algorithms are based on exploiting the excellent ability of large convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to represent local appearance. However, it is well known that they can only learn weak spatial relationships. To address this problem, we propose a model based on the combination of a CNN with a cascade of Graph Attention Network regressors. To this end, we introduce an encoding that jointly represents the appearance and location of facial landmarks and an attention mechanism to weigh the information according to its reliability. This is combined with a multi-task approach to initialize the location of graph nodes and a coarse-to-fine landmark description scheme. Our experiments confirm that the proposed model learns a global representation of the structure of the face, achieving top performance in popular benchmarks on head pose and landmark estimation. The improvement provided by our model is most significant in situations involving large changes in the local appearance of landmarks.

- **Summary**: Multi-task learning promises better model generalization on a target task by jointly optimizing it with an auxiliary task. However, the current practice requires additional labeling efforts for the auxiliary task, while not guaranteeing better model performance. In this paper, we find that jointly training a dense prediction (target) task with a self-supervised (auxiliary) task can consistently improve the performance of the target task, while eliminating the need for labeling auxiliary tasks. We refer to this joint training as Composite Learning (CompL). Experiments of CompL on monocular depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and boundary detection show consistent performance improvements in fully and partially labeled datasets. Further analysis on depth estimation reveals that joint training with self-supervision outperforms most labeled auxiliary tasks. We also find that CompL can improve model robustness when the models are evaluated in new domains. These results demonstrate the benefits of self-supervision as an auxiliary task, and establish the design of novel task-specific self-supervised methods as a new axis of investigation for future multi-task learning research.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT), a radically different architecture than convolutional neural networks offers multiple advantages including design simplicity, robustness and state-of-the-art performance on many vision tasks. However, in contrast to convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformer lacks inherent inductive biases. Therefore, successful training of such models is mainly attributed to pre-training on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet with 1.2M or JFT with 300M images. This hinders the direct adaption of Vision Transformer for small-scale datasets. In this work, we show that self-supervised inductive biases can be learned directly from small-scale datasets and serve as an effective weight initialization scheme for fine-tuning. This allows to train these models without large-scale pre-training, changes to model architecture or loss functions. We present thorough experiments to successfully train monolithic and non-monolithic Vision Transformers on five small datasets including CIFAR10/100, CINIC10, SVHN, Tiny-ImageNet and two fine-grained datasets: Aircraft and Cars. Our approach consistently improves the performance of Vision Transformers while retaining their properties such as attention to salient regions and higher robustness.

- **Summary**: Modern quantum annealers can find high-quality solutions to combinatorial optimisation objectives given as quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) problems. Unfortunately, obtaining suitable QUBO forms in computer vision remains challenging and currently requires problem-specific analytical derivations. Moreover, such explicit formulations impose tangible constraints on solution encodings. In stark contrast to prior work, this paper proposes to learn QUBO forms from data through gradient backpropagation instead of deriving them. As a result, the solution encodings can be chosen flexibly and compactly. Furthermore, our methodology is general and virtually independent of the specifics of the target problem type. We demonstrate the advantages of learnt QUBOs on the diverse problem types of graph matching, 2D point cloud alignment and 3D rotation estimation. Our results are competitive with the previous quantum state of the art while requiring much fewer logical and physical qubits, enabling our method to scale to larger problems. The code and the new dataset will be open-sourced.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is vital to safety-critical machine learning applications and has thus been extensively studied, with a plethora of methods developed in the literature. However, the field currently lacks a unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often results in unfair comparisons and inconclusive results. From the problem setting perspective, OOD detection is closely related to neighboring fields including anomaly detection (AD), open set recognition (OSR), and model uncertainty, since methods developed for one domain are often applicable to each other. To help the community to improve the evaluation and advance, we build a unified, well-structured codebase called OpenOOD, which implements over 30 methods developed in relevant fields and provides a comprehensive benchmark under the recently proposed generalized OOD detection framework. With a comprehensive comparison of these methods, we are gratified that the field has progressed significantly over the past few years, where both preprocessing methods and the orthogonal post-hoc methods show strong potential.

- **Summary**: A successful paradigm in representation learning is to perform self-supervised pretraining using tasks based on mini-batch statistics (e.g., SimCLR, VICReg, SwAV, MSN). We show that in the formulation of all these methods is an overlooked prior to learn features that enable uniform clustering of the data. While this prior has led to remarkably semantic representations when pretraining on class-balanced data, such as ImageNet, we demonstrate that it can hamper performance when pretraining on class-imbalanced data. By moving away from conventional uniformity priors and instead preferring power-law distributed feature clusters, we show that one can improve the quality of the learned representations on real-world class-imbalanced datasets. To demonstrate this, we develop an extension of the Masked Siamese Networks (MSN) method to support the use of arbitrary features priors.

- **Summary**: Pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) is the most common type of brain cancer among children, and the identification of molecular markers for pLGG is crucial for successful treatment planning. Current standard care is biopsy, which is invasive. Thus, the non-invasive imaging-based approaches, where Machine Learning (ML) has a high potential, are impactful. Recently, we developed a tumor-location-based algorithm and demonstrated its potential to differentiate pLGG molecular subtypes. In this work, we first reevaluated the performance of the location-based algorithm on a larger pLGG dataset, which includes 214 patients and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 77.90. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithm increased the average AUROC to 86.11. Ultimately, we designed and implemented a tumor-location-guided CNN algorithm and achieved average AUROC of 88.64. Using a repeated experiment approach with 100 runs, we ensured the results were reproducible and the improvement was statistically significant.

- **Summary**: With the recent advances in NeRF-based 3D aware GANs quality, projecting an image into the latent space of these 3D-aware GANs has a natural advantage over 2D GAN inversion: not only does it allow multi-view consistent editing of the projected image, but it also enables 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis when given only a single image. However, the explicit viewpoint control acts as a main hindrance in the 3D GAN inversion process, as both camera pose and latent code have to be optimized simultaneously to reconstruct the given image. Most works that explore the latent space of the 3D-aware GANs rely on ground-truth camera viewpoint or deformable 3D model, thus limiting their applicability. In this work, we introduce a generalizable 3D GAN inversion method that infers camera viewpoint and latent code simultaneously to enable multi-view consistent semantic image editing. The key to our approach is to leverage pre-trained estimators for better initialization and utilize the pixel-wise depth calculated from NeRF parameters to better reconstruct the given image. We conduct extensive experiments on image reconstruction and editing both quantitatively and qualitatively, and further compare our results with 2D GAN-based editing to demonstrate the advantages of utilizing the latent space of 3D GANs.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved comparable or superior performance than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. This empirical breakthrough is even more remarkable since, in contrast to CNNs, ViTs do not embed any visual inductive bias of spatial locality. Yet, recent works have shown that while minimizing their training loss, ViTs specifically learn spatially localized patterns. This raises a central question: how do ViTs learn these patterns by solely minimizing their training loss using gradient-based methods from random initialization? In this paper, we provide some theoretical justification of this phenomenon. We propose a spatially structured dataset and a simplified ViT model. In this model, the attention matrix solely depends on the positional encodings. We call this mechanism the positional attention mechanism. On the theoretical side, we consider a binary classification task and show that while the learning problem admits multiple solutions that generalize, our model implicitly learns the spatial structure of the dataset while generalizing: we call this phenomenon patch association. We prove that patch association helps to sample-efficiently transfer to downstream datasets that share the same structure as the pre-training one but differ in the features. Lastly, we empirically verify that a ViT with positional attention performs similarly to the original one on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN and ImageNet.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a characteristic extraction algorithm and the Multi-domain Image Characteristics Dataset of characteristic-tagged images to simulate the way a human brain classifies cross-domain information and generates insight. The intent was to identify prominent characteristics in data and use this identification mechanism to auto-generate insight from data in other unseen domains. An information extraction algorithm is proposed which is a combination of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Capsule Networks. Capsule Networks are used to decompose images into their individual features and VAEs are used to explore variations on these decomposed features. Thus, making the model robust in recognizing characteristics from variations of the data. A noteworthy point is that the algorithm uses efficient hierarchical decoding of data which helps in richer output interpretation. Noticing a dearth in the number of datasets that contain visible characteristics in images belonging to various domains, the Multi-domain Image Characteristics Dataset was created and made publicly available. It consists of thousands of images across three domains. This dataset was created with the intent of introducing a new benchmark for fine-grained characteristic recognition tasks in the future.

- **Summary**: As a new paradigm in machine learning, self-supervised learning (SSL) is capable of learning high-quality representations of complex data without relying on labels. In addition to eliminating the need for labeled data, research has found that SSL improves the adversarial robustness over supervised learning since lacking labels makes it more challenging for adversaries to manipulate model predictions. However, the extent to which this robustness superiority generalizes to other types of attacks remains an open question.   We explore this question in the context of backdoor attacks. Specifically, we design and evaluate CTRL, an embarrassingly simple yet highly effective self-supervised backdoor attack. By only polluting a tiny fraction of training data (<= 1%) with indistinguishable poisoning samples, CTRL causes any trigger-embedded input to be misclassified to the adversary's designated class with a high probability (>= 99%) at inference time. Our findings suggest that SSL and supervised learning are comparably vulnerable to backdoor attacks. More importantly, through the lens of CTRL, we study the inherent vulnerability of SSL to backdoor attacks. With both empirical and analytical evidence, we reveal that the representation invariance property of SSL, which benefits adversarial robustness, may also be the very reason making \ssl highly susceptible to backdoor attacks. Our findings also imply that the existing defenses against supervised backdoor attacks are not easily retrofitted to the unique vulnerability of SSL.

- **Summary**: We address dense action forecasting: the problem of predicting future action sequence over long durations based on partial observation. Our key insight is that future action sequences are more accurately modeled with variable, rather than one, levels of abstraction, and that the optimal level of abstraction can be dynamically selected during the prediction process. Our experiments show that most parts of future action sequences can be predicted confidently in fine detail only in small segments of future frames, which are effectively ``islands'' of high model prediction confidence in a ``sea'' of uncertainty. We propose a combination Bayesian neural network and hierarchical convolutional segmentation model to both accurately predict future actions and optimally select abstraction levels. We evaluate this approach on standard datasets against existing state-of-the-art systems and demonstrate that our ``islands of predictability'' approach maintains fine-grained action predictions while also making accurate abstract predictions where systems were previously unable to do so, and thus results in substantial, monotonic increases in accuracy.

- **Summary**: We report the first systematic analysis of the experimental foundations of facial attribute classification. Two annotators independently assigning attribute values shows that only 12 of 40 common attributes are assigned values with >= 95% consistency, and three (high cheekbones, pointed nose, oval face) have essentially random consistency. Of 5,068 duplicate face appearances in CelebA, attributes have contradicting values on from 10 to 860 of the 5,068 duplicates. Manual audit of a subset of CelebA estimates error rates as high as 40% for (no beard=false), even though the labeling consistency experiment indicates that no beard could be assigned with >= 95% consistency. Selecting the mouth slightly open (MSO) for deeper analysis, we estimate the error rate for (MSO=true) at about 20% and (MSO=false) at about 2%. A corrected version of the MSO attribute values enables learning a model that achieves higher accuracy than previously reported for MSO. Corrected values for CelebA MSO are available at https://github.com/HaiyuWu/CelebAMSO.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection in point clouds is a core component for modern robotics and autonomous driving systems. A key challenge in 3D object detection comes from the inherent sparse nature of point occupancy within the 3D scene. In this paper, we propose Sparse Window Transformer (SWFormer ), a scalable and accurate model for 3D object detection, which can take full advantage of the sparsity of point clouds. Built upon the idea of window-based Transformers, SWFormer converts 3D points into sparse voxels and windows, and then processes these variable-length sparse windows efficiently using a bucketing scheme. In addition to self-attention within each spatial window, our SWFormer also captures cross-window correlation with multi-scale feature fusion and window shifting operations. To further address the unique challenge of detecting 3D objects accurately from sparse features, we propose a new voxel diffusion technique. Experimental results on the Waymo Open Dataset show our SWFormer achieves state-of-the-art 73.36 L2 mAPH on vehicle and pedestrian for 3D object detection on the official test set, outperforming all previous single-stage and two-stage models, while being much more efficient.

- **Summary**: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an imaging modality that provides unique insights into the dynamics of proteins and other building blocks of life. The algorithmic challenge of jointly estimating the poses, 3D structure, and conformational heterogeneity of a biomolecule from millions of noisy and randomly oriented 2D projections in a computationally efficient manner, however, remains unsolved. Our method, cryoFIRE, performs ab initio heterogeneous reconstruction with unknown poses in an amortized framework, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive step of pose search while enabling the analysis of conformational heterogeneity. Poses and conformation are jointly estimated by an encoder while a physics-based decoder aggregates the images into an implicit neural representation of the conformational space. We show that our method can provide one order of magnitude speedup on datasets containing millions of images without any loss of accuracy. We validate that the joint estimation of poses and conformations can be amortized over the size of the dataset. For the first time, we prove that an amortized method can extract interpretable dynamic information from experimental datasets.

- **Summary**: Vision language (VL) models like CLIP are robust to natural distribution shifts, in part because CLIP learns on unstructured data using a technique called caption supervision; the model inteprets image-linked texts as ground-truth labels. In a carefully controlled comparison study, we show that caption-supervised CNNs trained on a standard cross-entropy loss (with image labels assigned by scanning captions for class names) can exhibit greater distributional robustness than VL models trained on the same data. To facilitate future experiments with high-accuracy caption-supervised models, we introduce CaptionNet (https://github.com/penfever/CaptionNet/), which includes a class-balanced, fully supervised dataset with over 50,000 new human-labeled ImageNet-compliant samples which includes web-scraped captions. In a series of experiments on CaptionNet, we show how the choice of loss function, data filtration and supervision strategy enable robust computer vision. We also provide the codebase necessary to reproduce our experiments at VL Hub (https://github.com/penfever/vlhub/).

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a three-stream algorithm for real-time action recognition and a new dataset of handwash videos, with the intent of aligning action recognition with real-world constraints to yield effective conclusions. A three-stream fusion algorithm is proposed, which runs both accurately and efficiently, in real-time even on low-powered systems such as a Raspberry Pi. The cornerstone of the proposed algorithm is the incorporation of both spatial and temporal information, as well as the information of the objects in a video while using an efficient architecture, and Optical Flow computation to achieve commendable results in real-time. The results achieved by this algorithm are benchmarked on the UCF-101 as well as the HMDB-51 datasets, achieving an accuracy of 92.7% and 64.9% respectively. An important point to note is that the algorithm is novel in the aspect that it is also able to learn the intricate differences between extremely similar actions, which would be difficult even for the human eye. Additionally, noticing a dearth in the number of datasets for the recognition of very similar or fine-grained actions, this paper also introduces a new dataset that is made publicly available, the Hand Wash Dataset with the intent of introducing a new benchmark for fine-grained action recognition tasks in the future.

- **Summary**: Neuroimaging-based prediction of neurocognitive measures is valuable for studying how the brain's structure relates to cognitive function. However, the accuracy of prediction using popular linear regression models is relatively low. We propose a novel deep regression method, namely TractoSCR, that allows full supervision for contrastive learning in regression tasks using diffusion MRI tractography. TractoSCR performs supervised contrastive learning by using the absolute difference between continuous regression labels (i.e. neurocognitive scores) to determine positive and negative pairs. We apply TractoSCR to analyze a large-scale dataset including multi-site harmonized diffusion MRI and neurocognitive data from 8735 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We extract white matter microstructural measures using a fine parcellation of white matter tractography into fiber clusters. Using these measures, we predict three scores related to domains of higher-order cognition (general cognitive ability, executive function, and learning/memory). To identify important fiber clusters for prediction of these neurocognitive scores, we propose a permutation feature importance method for high-dimensional data. We find that TractoSCR improves the accuracy of neurocognitive score prediction compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We find that the most predictive fiber clusters are predominantly located within the superficial white matter and projection tracts, particularly the superficial frontal white matter and striato-frontal connections. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of contrastive representation learning methods for regression, and in particular for improving neuroimaging-based prediction of higher-order cognitive abilities.

- **Summary**: Most existing OCR methods focus on alphanumeric characters due to the popularity of English and numbers, as well as their corresponding datasets. On extending the characters to more languages, recent methods have shown that training different scripts with different recognition heads can greatly improve the end-to-end recognition accuracy compared to combining characters from all languages in the same recognition head. However, we postulate that similarities between some languages could allow sharing of model parameters and benefit from joint training. Determining language groupings, however, is not immediately obvious. To this end, we propose an automatic method for multilingual text recognition with a task grouping and assignment module using Gumbel-Softmax, introducing a task grouping loss and weighted recognition loss to allow for simultaneous training of the models and grouping modules. Experiments on MLT19 lend evidence to our hypothesis that there is a middle ground between combining every task together and separating every task that achieves a better configuration of task grouping/separation.

- **Summary**: 3D bounding boxes are a widespread intermediate representation in many computer vision applications. However, predicting them is a challenging task, largely due to partial observability, which motivates the need for a strong sense of uncertainty. While many recent methods have explored better architectures for consuming sparse and unstructured point cloud data, we hypothesize that there is room for improvement in the modeling of the output distribution and explore how this can be achieved using an autoregressive prediction head. Additionally, we release a simulated dataset, COB-3D, which highlights new types of ambiguity that arise in real-world robotics applications, where 3D bounding box prediction has largely been underexplored. We propose methods for leveraging our autoregressive model to make high confidence predictions and meaningful uncertainty measures, achieving strong results on SUN-RGBD, Scannet, KITTI, and our new dataset.

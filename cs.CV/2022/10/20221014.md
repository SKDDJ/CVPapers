- **Summary**: There are a multitude of emerging imaging technologies that could benefit robotics. However the need for bespoke models, calibration and low-level processing represents a key barrier to their adoption. In this work we present NOCaL, Neural odometry and Calibration using Light fields, a semi-supervised learning architecture capable of interpreting previously unseen cameras without calibration. NOCaL learns to estimate camera parameters, relative pose, and scene appearance. It employs a scene-rendering hypernetwork pretrained on a large number of existing cameras and scenes, and adapts to previously unseen cameras using a small supervised training set to enforce metric scale. We demonstrate NOCaL on rendered and captured imagery using conventional cameras, demonstrating calibration-free odometry and novel view synthesis. This work represents a key step toward automating the interpretation of general camera geometries and emerging imaging technologies.

- **Summary**: Understanding the growth and distribution of the prawns is critical for optimising the feed and harvest strategies. An inadequate understanding of prawn growth can lead to reduced financial gain, for example, crops are harvested too early. The key to maintaining a good understanding of prawn growth is frequent sampling. However, the most commonly adopted sampling practice, the cast net approach, is unable to sample the prawns at a high frequency as it is expensive and laborious. An alternative approach is to sample prawns from feed trays that farm workers inspect each day. This will allow growth data collection at a high frequency (each day). But measuring prawns manually each day is a laborious task. In this article, we propose a new approach that utilises smart glasses, depth camera, computer vision and machine learning to detect prawn distribution and growth from feed trays. A smart headset was built to allow farmers to collect prawn data while performing daily feed tray checks. A computer vision + machine learning pipeline was developed and demonstrated to detect the growth trends of prawns in 4 prawn ponds over a growing season.

- **Summary**: We study how choices of input point cloud coordinate frames impact learning of manipulation skills from 3D point clouds. There exist a variety of coordinate frame choices to normalize captured robot-object-interaction point clouds. We find that different frames have a profound effect on agent learning performance, and the trend is similar across 3D backbone networks. In particular, the end-effector frame and the target-part frame achieve higher training efficiency than the commonly used world frame and robot-base frame in many tasks, intuitively because they provide helpful alignments among point clouds across time steps and thus can simplify visual module learning. Moreover, the well-performing frames vary across tasks, and some tasks may benefit from multiple frame candidates. We thus propose FrameMiners to adaptively select candidate frames and fuse their merits in a task-agnostic manner. Experimentally, FrameMiners achieves on-par or significantly higher performance than the best single-frame version on five fully physical manipulation tasks adapted from ManiSkill and OCRTOC. Without changing existing camera placements or adding extra cameras, point cloud frame mining can serve as a free lunch to improve 3D manipulation learning.



### Evaluating Out-of-Distribution Performance on Document Image Classifiers

- **Summary**: The ability of a document classifier to handle inputs that are drawn from a distribution different from the training distribution is crucial for robust deployment and generalizability. The RVL-CDIP corpus is the de facto standard benchmark for document classification, yet to our knowledge all studies that use this corpus do not include evaluation on out-of-distribution documents. In this paper, we curate and release a new out-of-distribution benchmark for evaluating out-of-distribution performance for document classifiers. Our new out-of-distribution benchmark consists of two types of documents: those that are not part of any of the 16 in-domain RVL-CDIP categories (RVL-CDIP-O), and those that are one of the 16 in-domain categories yet are drawn from a distribution different from that of the original RVL-CDIP dataset (RVL-CDIP-N). While prior work on document classification for in-domain RVL-CDIP documents reports high accuracy scores, we find that these models exhibit accuracy drops of between roughly 15-30% on our new out-of-domain RVL-CDIP-N benchmark, and further struggle to distinguish between in-domain RVL-CDIP-N and out-of-domain RVL-CDIP-O inputs. Our new benchmark provides researchers with a valuable new resource for analyzing out-of-distribution performance on document classifiers.

- **Summary**: Machine learning techniques rely on large and diverse datasets for generalization. Computer vision, natural language processing, and other applications can often reuse public datasets to train many different models. However, due to differences in physical configurations, it is challenging to leverage public datasets for training robotic control policies on new robot platforms or for new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel framework, ExAug to augment the experiences of different robot platforms from multiple datasets in diverse environments. ExAug leverages a simple principle: by extracting 3D information in the form of a point cloud, we can create much more complex and structured augmentations, utilizing both generating synthetic images and geometric-aware penalization that would have been suitable in the same situation for a different robot, with different size, turning radius, and camera placement. The trained policy is evaluated on two new robot platforms with three different cameras in indoor and outdoor environments with obstacles.

- **Summary**: Compression of convolutional neural network models has recently been dominated by pruning approaches. A class of previous works focuses solely on pruning the unimportant filters to achieve network compression. Another important direction is the design of sparsity-inducing constraints which has also been explored in isolation. This paper presents a novel training scheme based on composite constraints that prune redundant filters and minimize their effect on overall network learning via sparsity promotion. Also, as opposed to prior works that employ pseudo-norm-based sparsity-inducing constraints, we propose a sparse scheme based on gradient counting in our framework. Our tests on several pixel-wise segmentation benchmarks show that the number of neurons and the memory footprint of networks in the test phase are significantly reduced without affecting performance. MobileNetV3 and UNet, two well-known architectures, are used to test the proposed scheme. Our network compression method not only results in reduced parameters but also achieves improved performance compared to MobileNetv3, which is an already optimized architecture.

- **Summary**: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to solve the domain adaptation problem by transferring the knowledge learned from a pre-trained source model to an unseen target domain. Most existing methods assign pseudo-labels to the target data by generating feature prototypes. However, due to the discrepancy in the data distribution between the source domain and the target domain and category imbalance in the target domain, there are severe class biases in the generated feature prototypes and noisy pseudo-labels. Besides, the data structure of the target domain is often ignored, which is crucial for clustering. In this paper, a novel framework named PCSR is proposed to tackle SFDA via a novel intra-class Polycentric Clustering and Structural Regularization strategy. Firstly, an inter-class balanced sampling strategy is proposed to generate representative feature prototypes for each class. Furthermore, k-means clustering is introduced to generate multiple clustering centers for each class in the target domain to obtain robust pseudo-labels. Finally, to enhance the model's generalization, structural regularization is introduced for the target domain. Extensive experiments on three UDA benchmark datasets show that our method performs better or similarly against the other state of the art methods, demonstrating our approach's superiority for visual domain adaptation problems.

- **Summary**: During the investigation of criminal activity when evidence is available, the issue at hand is determining the credibility of the video and ascertaining that the video is real. Today, one way to authenticate the footage is to identify the camera that was used to capture the image or video in question. While a very common way to do this is by using image meta-data, this data can easily be falsified by changing the video content or even splicing together content from two different cameras. Given the multitude of solutions proposed to this problem, it is yet to be sufficiently solved. The aim of our project is to build an algorithm that identifies which camera was used to capture an image using traces of information left intrinsically in the image, using filters, followed by a deep neural network on these filters. Solving this problem would have a big impact on the verification of evidence used in criminal and civil trials and even news reporting.

- **Summary**: The application of computer vision and machine learning methods in the field of additive manufacturing (AM) for semantic segmentation of the structural elements of 3-D printed products will improve real-time failure analysis systems and can potentially reduce the number of defects by enabling in situ corrections. This work demonstrates the possibilities of using physics-based rendering for labeled image dataset generation, as well as image-to-image translation capabilities to improve the accuracy of real image segmentation for AM systems. Multi-class semantic segmentation experiments were carried out based on the U-Net model and cycle generative adversarial network. The test results demonstrated the capacity of detecting such structural elements of 3-D printed parts as a top layer, infill, shell, and support. A basis for further segmentation system enhancement by utilizing image-to-image style transfer and domain adaptation technologies was also developed. The results indicate that using style transfer as a precursor to domain adaptation can significantly improve real 3-D printing image segmentation in situations where a model trained on synthetic data is the only tool available. The mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores for synthetic test datasets included 94.90% for the entire 3-D printed part, 73.33% for the top layer, 78.93% for the infill, 55.31% for the shell, and 69.45% for supports.

- **Summary**: We propose a new task to benchmark scene understanding of embodied agents: Situated Question Answering in 3D Scenes (SQA3D). Given a scene context (e.g., 3D scan), SQA3D requires the tested agent to first understand its situation (position, orientation, etc.) in the 3D scene as described by text, then reason about its surrounding environment and answer a question under that situation. Based upon 650 scenes from ScanNet, we provide a dataset centered around 6.8k unique situations, along with 20.4k descriptions and 33.4k diverse reasoning questions for these situations. These questions examine a wide spectrum of reasoning capabilities for an intelligent agent, ranging from spatial relation comprehension to commonsense understanding, navigation, and multi-hop reasoning. SQA3D imposes a significant challenge to current multi-modal especially 3D reasoning models. We evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches and find that the best one only achieves an overall score of 47.20%, while amateur human participants can reach 90.06%. We believe SQA3D could facilitate future embodied AI research with stronger situation understanding and reasoning capability.



### InFIP: An Explainable DNN Intellectual Property Protection Method based on Intrinsic Features

- **Summary**: Intellectual property (IP) protection for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has raised serious concerns in recent years. Most existing works embed watermarks in the DNN model for IP protection, which need to modify the model and lack of interpretability. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an interpretable intellectual property protection method for DNN based on explainable artificial intelligence. Compared with existing works, the proposed method does not modify the DNN model, and the decision of the ownership verification is interpretable. We extract the intrinsic features of the DNN model by using Deep Taylor Decomposition. Since the intrinsic feature is composed of unique interpretation of the model's decision, the intrinsic feature can be regarded as fingerprint of the model. If the fingerprint of a suspected model is the same as the original model, the suspected model is considered as a pirated model. Experimental results demonstrate that the fingerprints can be successfully used to verify the ownership of the model and the test accuracy of the model is not affected. Furthermore, the proposed method is robust to fine-tuning attack, pruning attack, watermark overwriting attack, and adaptive attack.

- **Summary**: Scene text removal (STR), a task of erasing text from natural scene images, has recently attracted attention as an important component of editing text or concealing private information such as ID, telephone, and license plate numbers. While there are a variety of different methods for STR actively being researched, it is difficult to evaluate superiority because previously proposed methods do not use the same standardized training/evaluation dataset. We use the same standardized training/testing dataset to evaluate the performance of several previous methods after standardized re-implementation. We also introduce a simple yet extremely effective Gated Attention (GA) and Region-of-Interest Generation (RoIG) methodology in this paper. GA uses attention to focus on the text stroke as well as the textures and colors of the surrounding regions to remove text from the input image much more precisely. RoIG is applied to focus on only the region with text instead of the entire image to train the model more efficiently. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in almost all metrics with remarkably higher-quality results. Furthermore, because our model does not generate a text stroke mask explicitly, there is no need for additional refinement steps or sub-models, making our model extremely fast with fewer parameters. The dataset and code are available at this https://github.com/naver/garnet.

- **Summary**: Tumor lesion segmentation is one of the most important tasks in medical image analysis. In clinical practice, Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron-Emission Tomography~(FDG-PET) is a widely used technique to identify and quantify metabolically active tumors. However, since FDG-PET scans only provide metabolic information, healthy tissue or benign disease with irregular glucose consumption may be mistaken for cancer. To handle this challenge, PET is commonly combined with Computed Tomography~(CT), with the CT used to obtain the anatomic structure of the patient. The combination of PET-based metabolic and CT-based anatomic information can contribute to better tumor segmentation results. %Computed tomography~(CT) is a popular modality to illustrate the anatomic structure of the patient. The combination of PET and CT is promising to handle this challenge by utilizing metabolic and anatomic information. In this paper, we explore the potential of U-Net for lesion segmentation in whole-body FDG-PET/CT scans from three aspects, including network architecture, data preprocessing, and data augmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that the vanilla U-Net with proper input shape can achieve satisfactory performance. Specifically, our method achieves first place in both preliminary and final leaderboards of the autoPET 2022 challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yejin0111/autoPET2022_Blackbean.

- **Summary**: In action recognition, although the combination of spatio-temporal videos and skeleton features can improve the recognition performance, a separate model and balancing feature representation for cross-modal data are required. To solve these problems, we propose Spatio-TemporAl cRoss (STAR)-transformer, which can effectively represent two cross-modal features as a recognizable vector. First, from the input video and skeleton sequence, video frames are output as global grid tokens and skeletons are output as joint map tokens, respectively. These tokens are then aggregated into multi-class tokens and input into STAR-transformer. The STAR-transformer encoder layer consists of a full self-attention (FAttn) module and a proposed zigzag spatio-temporal attention (ZAttn) module. Similarly, the continuous decoder consists of a FAttn module and a proposed binary spatio-temporal attention (BAttn) module. STAR-transformer learns an efficient multi-feature representation of the spatio-temporal features by properly arranging pairings of the FAttn, ZAttn, and BAttn modules. Experimental results on the Penn-Action, NTU RGB+D 60, and 120 datasets show that the proposed method achieves a promising improvement in performance in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Getting robots to navigate to multiple objects autonomously is essential yet difficult in robot applications. One of the key challenges is how to explore environments efficiently with camera sensors only. Existing navigation methods mainly focus on fixed cameras and few attempts have been made to navigate with active cameras. As a result, the agent may take a very long time to perceive the environment due to limited camera scope. In contrast, humans typically gain a larger field of view by looking around for a better perception of the environment. How to make robots perceive the environment as efficiently as humans is a fundamental problem in robotics. In this paper, we consider navigating to multiple objects more efficiently with active cameras. Specifically, we cast moving camera to a Markov Decision Process and reformulate the active camera problem as a reinforcement learning problem. However, we have to address two new challenges: 1) how to learn a good camera policy in complex environments and 2) how to coordinate it with the navigation policy. To address these, we carefully design a reward function to encourage the agent to explore more areas by moving camera actively. Moreover, we exploit human experience to infer a rule-based camera action to guide the learning process. Last, to better coordinate two kinds of policies, the camera policy takes navigation actions into account when making camera moving decisions. Experimental results show our camera policy consistently improves the performance of multi-object navigation over four baselines on two datasets.



### Weakly-Supervised Multi-Granularity Map Learning for Vision-and-Language Navigation

- **Summary**: We address a practical yet challenging problem of training robot agents to navigate in an environment following a path described by some language instructions. The instructions often contain descriptions of objects in the environment. To achieve accurate and efficient navigation, it is critical to build a map that accurately represents both spatial location and the semantic information of the environment objects. However, enabling a robot to build a map that well represents the environment is extremely challenging as the environment often involves diverse objects with various attributes. In this paper, we propose a multi-granularity map, which contains both object fine-grained details (e.g., color, texture) and semantic classes, to represent objects more comprehensively. Moreover, we propose a weakly-supervised auxiliary task, which requires the agent to localize instruction-relevant objects on the map. Through this task, the agent not only learns to localize the instruction-relevant objects for navigation but also is encouraged to learn a better map representation that reveals object information. We then feed the learned map and instruction to a waypoint predictor to determine the next navigation goal. Experimental results show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 4.0% and 4.6% w.r.t. success rate both in seen and unseen environments, respectively on VLN-CE dataset.

- **Summary**: One recent promising approach to the Visual Place Recognition (VPR) problem has been to fuse the place recognition estimates of multiple complementary VPR techniques using methods such as SRAL and multi-process fusion. These approaches come with a substantial practical limitation: they require all potential VPR methods to be brute-force run before they are selectively fused. The obvious solution to this limitation is to predict the viable subset of methods ahead of time, but this is challenging because it requires a predictive signal within the imagery itself that is indicative of high performance methods. Here we propose an alternative approach that instead starts with a known single base VPR technique, and learns to predict the most complementary additional VPR technique to fuse with it, that results in the largest improvement in performance. The key innovation here is to use a dimensionally reduced difference vector between the query image and the top-retrieved reference image using this baseline technique as the predictive signal of the most complementary additional technique, both during training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach can train a single network to select performant, complementary technique pairs across datasets which span multiple modes of transportation (train, car, walking) as well as to generalise to unseen datasets, outperforming multiple baseline strategies for manually selecting the best technique pairs based on the same training data.

- **Summary**: Aero-engine is the core component of aircraft and other spacecraft. The high-speed rotating blades provide power by sucking in air and fully combusting, and various defects will inevitably occur, threatening the operation safety of aero-engine. Therefore, regular inspections are essential for such a complex system. However, existing traditional technology which is borescope inspection is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and experience-dependent. To endow this technology with intelligence, a novel superpixel perception graph neural network (SPGNN) is proposed by utilizing a multi-stage graph convolutional network (MSGCN) for feature extraction and superpixel perception region proposal network (SPRPN) for region proposal. First, to capture complex and irregular textures, the images are transformed into a series of patches, to obtain their graph representations. Then, MSGCN composed of several GCN blocks extracts graph structure features and performs graph information processing at graph level. Last but not least, the SPRPN is proposed to generate perceptual bounding boxes by fusing graph representation features and superpixel perception features. Therefore, the proposed SPGNN always implements feature extraction and information transmission at the graph level in the whole SPGNN pipeline, and SPRPN and MSGNN mutually benefit from each other. To verify the effectiveness of SPGNN, we meticulously construct a simulated blade dataset with 3000 images. A public aluminum dataset is also used to validate the performances of different methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SPGNN has superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved competitive performance in broad vision tasks. Unfortunately, on popular threat models, naturally trained ViTs are shown to provide no more adversarial robustness than convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Adversarial training is still required for ViTs to defend against such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we provide the first and comprehensive study on the adversarial training recipe of ViTs via extensive evaluation of various training techniques across benchmark datasets. We find that pre-training and SGD optimizer are necessary for ViTs' adversarial training. Further considering ViT as a new type of model architecture, we investigate its adversarial robustness from the perspective of its unique architectural components. We find, when randomly masking gradients from some attention blocks or masking perturbations on some patches during adversarial training, the adversarial robustness of ViTs can be remarkably improved, which may potentially open up a line of work to explore the architectural information inside the newly designed models like ViTs.

- **Summary**: Speech synthesis methods can create realistic-sounding speech, which may be used for fraud, spoofing, and misinformation campaigns. Forensic methods that detect synthesized speech are important for protection against such attacks. Forensic attribution methods provide even more information about the nature of synthesized speech signals because they identify the specific speech synthesis method (i.e., speech synthesizer) used to create a speech signal. Due to the increasing number of realistic-sounding speech synthesizers, we propose a speech attribution method that generalizes to new synthesizers not seen during training. To do so, we investigate speech synthesizer attribution in both a closed set scenario and an open set scenario. In other words, we consider some speech synthesizers to be "known" synthesizers (i.e., part of the closed set) and others to be "unknown" synthesizers (i.e., part of the open set). We represent speech signals as spectrograms and train our proposed method, known as compact attribution transformer (CAT), on the closed set for multi-class classification. Then, we extend our analysis to the open set to attribute synthesized speech signals to both known and unknown synthesizers. We utilize a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) on the latent space of the trained CAT to differentiate between each unknown synthesizer. Additionally, we explore poly-1 loss formulations to improve attribution results. Our proposed approach successfully attributes synthesized speech signals to their respective speech synthesizers in both closed and open set scenarios.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection is an important problem in computer vision; however, the scarcity of anomalous samples makes this task difficult. Thus, recent anomaly detection methods have used only normal images with no abnormal areas for training. In this work, a powerful anomaly detection method is proposed based on student-teacher feature pyramid matching (STPM), which consists of a student and teacher network. Generative models are another approach to anomaly detection. They reconstruct normal images from an input and compute the difference between the predicted normal and the input. Unfortunately, STPM does not have the ability to generate normal images. To improve the accuracy of STPM, this work uses a student network, as in generative models, to reconstruct normal features. This improves the accuracy; however, the anomaly maps for normal images are not clean because STPM does not use anomaly images for training, which decreases the accuracy of the image-level anomaly detection. To further improve accuracy, a discriminative network trained with pseudo-anomalies from anomaly maps is used in our method, which consists of two pairs of student-teacher networks and a discriminative network. The method displayed high accuracy on the MVTec anomaly detection dataset.

- **Summary**: Mixup is a commonly adopted data augmentation technique for image classification. Recent advances in mixup methods primarily focus on mixing based on saliency. However, many saliency detectors require intense computation and are especially burdensome for parameter-heavy transformer models. To this end, we propose TokenMixup, an efficient attention-guided token-level data augmentation method that aims to maximize the saliency of a mixed set of tokens. TokenMixup provides x15 faster saliency-aware data augmentation compared to gradient-based methods. Moreover, we introduce a variant of TokenMixup which mixes tokens within a single instance, thereby enabling multi-scale feature augmentation. Experiments show that our methods significantly improve the baseline models' performance on CIFAR and ImageNet-1K, while being more efficient than previous methods. We also reach state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 among from-scratch transformer models. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/TokenMixup.

- **Summary**: Several benchmarks have been built with heavy investment in resources to track our progress in NLP. Thousands of papers published in response to those benchmarks have competed to top leaderboards, with models often surpassing human performance. However, recent studies have shown that models triumph over several popular benchmarks just by overfitting on spurious biases, without truly learning the desired task. Despite this finding, benchmarking, while trying to tackle bias, still relies on workarounds, which do not fully utilize the resources invested in benchmark creation, due to the discarding of low quality data, and cover limited sets of bias. A potential solution to these issues -- a metric quantifying quality -- remains underexplored. Inspired by successful quality indices in several domains such as power, food, and water, we take the first step towards a metric by identifying certain language properties that can represent various possible interactions leading to biases in a benchmark. We look for bias related parameters which can potentially help pave our way towards the metric. We survey existing works and identify parameters capturing various properties of bias, their origins, types and impact on performance, generalization, and robustness. Our analysis spans over datasets and a hierarchy of tasks ranging from NLI to Summarization, ensuring that our parameters are generic and are not overfitted towards a specific task or dataset. We also develop certain parameters in this process.

- **Summary**: Domain generalization (DG) enables generalizing a learning machine from multiple seen source domains to an unseen target one. The general objective of DG methods is to learn semantic representations that are independent of domain labels, which is theoretically sound but empirically challenged due to the complex mixture of common and domain-specific factors. Although disentangling the representations into two disjoint parts has been gaining momentum in DG, the strong presumption over the data limits its efficacy in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Mix and Reason (\mire), a new DG framework that learns semantic representations via enforcing the structural invariance of semantic topology. \mire\ consists of two key components, namely, Category-aware Data Mixing (CDM) and Adaptive Semantic Topology Refinement (ASTR). CDM mixes two images from different domains in virtue of activation maps generated by two complementary classification losses, making the classifier focus on the representations of semantic objects. ASTR introduces relation graphs to represent semantic topology, which is progressively refined via the interactions between local feature aggregation and global cross-domain relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple DG benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed \mire.

- **Summary**: Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval tasks owing to efficient computation and low storage cost by encoding high-dimensional image data into binary codes. Since binary codes do not contain as much information as float features, the essence of binary encoding is preserving the main context to guarantee retrieval quality. However, the existing hashing methods have great limitations on suppressing redundant background information and accurately encoding from Euclidean space to Hamming space by a simple sign function. In order to solve these problems, a Cross-Scale Context Extracted Hashing Network (CSCE-Net) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we design a two-branch framework to capture fine-grained local information while maintaining high-level global semantic information. Besides, Attention guided Information Extraction module (AIE) is introduced between two branches, which suppresses areas of low context information cooperated with global sliding windows. Unlike previous methods, our CSCE-Net learns a content-related Dynamic Sign Function (DSF) to replace the original simple sign function. Therefore, the proposed CSCE-Net is context-sensitive and able to perform well on accurate image binary encoding. We further demonstrate that our CSCE-Net is superior to the existing hashing methods, which improves retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image generation models have shown promising results in generating high-fidelity photo-realistic images. Though the results are astonishing to human eyes, how applicable these generated images are for recognition tasks remains under-explored. In this work, we extensively study whether and how synthetic images generated from state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models can be used for image recognition tasks, and focus on two perspectives: synthetic data for improving classification models in data-scarce settings (i.e. zero-shot and few-shot), and synthetic data for large-scale model pre-training for transfer learning. We showcase the powerfulness and shortcomings of synthetic data from existing generative models, and propose strategies for better applying synthetic data for recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: Depth-aware video panoptic segmentation tackles the inverse projection problem of restoring panoptic 3D point clouds from video sequences, where the 3D points are augmented with semantic classes and temporally consistent instance identifiers. We propose a novel solution with a multi-task network that performs monocular depth estimation and video panoptic segmentation. Since acquiring ground truth labels for both depth and image segmentation has a relatively large cost, we leverage the power of unlabeled video sequences with self-supervised monocular depth estimation and semi-supervised learning from pseudo-labels for video panoptic segmentation. To further improve the depth prediction, we introduce panoptic-guided depth losses and a novel panoptic masking scheme for moving objects to avoid corrupting the training signal. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes-DVPS and SemKITTI-DVPS datasets demonstrate that our model with the proposed improvements achieves competitive results and fast inference speed.

- **Summary**: Recent work in multi-view stereo (MVS) combines learnable photometric scores and regularization with PatchMatch-based optimization to achieve robust pixelwise estimates of depth, normals, and visibility. However, non-learning based methods still outperform for large scenes with sparse views, in part due to use of geometric consistency constraints and ability to optimize over many views at high resolution. In this paper, we build on learning-based approaches to improve photometric scores by learning patch coplanarity and encourage geometric consistency by learning a scaled photometric cost that can be combined with reprojection error. We also propose an adaptive pixel sampling strategy for candidate propagation that reduces memory to enable training on larger resolution with more views and a larger encoder. These modifications lead to 6-15% gains in accuracy and completeness on the challenging ETH3D benchmark, resulting in higher F1 performance than the widely used state-of-the-art non-learning approaches ACMM and ACMP.

- **Summary**: The issue of image haze removal has attracted wide attention in recent years. However, most existing haze removal methods cannot restore the scene with clear blue sky, since the color and texture information of the object in the original haze image is insufficient. To remedy this, we propose a cycle generative adversarial network to construct a novel end-to-end image dehaze model. We adopt outdoor image datasets to train our model, which includes a set of real-world unpaired image dataset and a set of paired image dataset to ensure that the generated images are close to the real scene. Based on the cycle structure, our model adds four different kinds of loss function to constrain the effect including adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, photorealism loss and paired L1 loss. These four constraints can improve the overall quality of such degraded images for better visual appeal and ensure reconstruction of images to keep from distortion. The proposed model could remove the haze of images and also restore the sky of images to be clean and blue (like captured in a sunny weather).

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based algorithms have greatly improved the performance of remote sensing image (RSI) super-resolution (SR). However, increasing network depth and parameters cause a huge burden of computing and storage. Directly reducing the depth or width of existing models results in a large performance drop. We observe that the SR difficulty of different regions in an RSI varies greatly, and existing methods use the same deep network to process all regions in an image, resulting in a waste of computing resources. In addition, existing SR methods generally predefine integer scale factors and cannot perform stepless SR, i.e., a single model can deal with any potential scale factor. Retraining the model on each scale factor wastes considerable computing resources and model storage space. To address the above problems, we propose a saliency-aware dynamic routing network (SalDRN) for lightweight and stepless SR of RSIs. First, we introduce visual saliency as an indicator of region-level SR difficulty and integrate a lightweight saliency detector into the SalDRN to capture pixel-level visual characteristics. Then, we devise a saliency-aware dynamic routing strategy that employs path selection switches to adaptively select feature extraction paths of appropriate depth according to the SR difficulty of sub-image patches. Finally, we propose a novel lightweight stepless upsampling module whose core is an implicit feature function for realizing mapping from low-resolution feature space to high-resolution feature space. Comprehensive experiments verify that the SalDRN can achieve a good trade-off between performance and complexity. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/hanlinwu/SalDRN}.

- **Summary**: For the task of change detection (CD) in remote sensing images, deep convolution neural networks (CNNs)-based methods have recently aggregated transformer modules to improve the capability of global feature extraction. However, they suffer degraded CD performance on small changed areas due to the simple single-scale integration of deep CNNs and transformer modules. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid network based on multi-scale CNN-transformer structure, termed MCTNet, where the multi-scale global and local information are exploited to enhance the robustness of the CD performance on changed areas with different sizes. Especially, we design the ConvTrans block to adaptively aggregate global features from transformer modules and local features from CNN layers, which provides abundant global-local features with different scales. Experimental results demonstrate that our MCTNet achieves better detection performance than existing state-of-the-art CD methods.

- **Summary**: Multimodal sensors (e.g., visual, non-visual, and wearable) provide complementary information to develop robust perception systems for recognizing activities. However, most existing algorithms use dense sampling and heterogeneous sub-network to extract unimodal features and fuse them at the end of their framework, which causes data redundancy, lack of complementary multimodal information and high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new novel multimodal neural architecture based on RGB and IMU wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) for human activity recognition called Multimodal Temporal Segment Attention Network (MMTSA). MMTSA first employs a multimodal data isomorphism mechanism based on Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and then applies a novel multimodal sparse sampling method to reduce redundancy. Moreover, we propose an inter-segment attention module in MMTSA to fuse multimodal features effectively and efficiently. We demonstrate the importance of imu data imaging and attention mechanism in human activity recognition by rigorous evaluation on three public datasets, and achieve superior improvements ($11.13\%$ on the MMAct dataset) than the previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Deep Learning-based 2D/3D registration enables fast, robust, and accurate X-ray to CT image fusion when large annotated paired datasets are available for training. However, the need for paired CT volume and X-ray images with ground truth registration limits the applicability in interventional scenarios. An alternative is to use simulated X-ray projections from CT volumes, thus removing the need for paired annotated datasets. Deep Neural Networks trained exclusively on simulated X-ray projections can perform significantly worse on real X-ray images due to the domain gap. We propose a self-supervised 2D/3D registration framework combining simulated training with unsupervised feature and pixel space domain adaptation to overcome the domain gap and eliminate the need for paired annotated datasets. Our framework achieves a registration accuracy of 1.83$\pm$1.16 mm with a high success ratio of 90.1% on real X-ray images showing a 23.9% increase in success ratio compared to reference annotation-free algorithms.

- **Summary**: Evaluation of models on benchmarks is unreliable without knowing the degree of sample hardness; this subsequently overestimates the capability of AI systems and limits their adoption in real world applications. We propose a Data Scoring task that requires assignment of each unannotated sample in a benchmark a score between 0 to 1, where 0 signifies easy and 1 signifies hard. Use of unannotated samples in our task design is inspired from humans who can determine a question difficulty without knowing its correct answer. This also rules out the use of methods involving model based supervision (since they require sample annotations to get trained), eliminating potential biases associated with models in deciding sample difficulty. We propose a method based on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) for this task; we validate our method by showing that existing models are more accurate with respect to the easier sample-chunks than with respect to the harder sample-chunks. Finally we demonstrate five novel applications.

- **Summary**: Designing feasible and effective architectures under diverse computational budgets, incurred by different applications/devices, is essential for deploying deep models in real-world applications. To achieve this goal, existing methods often perform an independent architecture search process for each target budget, which is very inefficient yet unnecessary. More critically, these independent search processes cannot share their learned knowledge (i.e., the distribution of good architectures) with each other and thus often result in limited search results. To address these issues, we propose a Pareto-aware Neural Architecture Generator (PNAG) which only needs to be trained once and dynamically produces the Pareto optimal architecture for any given budget via inference. To train our PNAG, we learn the whole Pareto frontier by jointly finding multiple Pareto optimal architectures under diverse budgets. Such a joint search algorithm not only greatly reduces the overall search cost but also improves the search results. Extensive experiments on three hardware platforms (i.e., mobile device, CPU, and GPU) show the superiority of our method over existing methods.

- **Summary**: Recently vision transformers (ViT) have been applied successfully for various tasks in computer vision. However, important questions such as why they work or how they behave still remain largely unknown. In this paper, we propose an effective visualization technique, to assist us in exposing the information carried in neurons and feature embeddings across the ViT's layers. Our approach departs from the computational process of ViTs with a focus on visualizing the local and global information in input images and the latent feature embeddings at multiple levels. Visualizations at the input and embeddings at level 0 reveal interesting findings such as providing support as to why ViTs are rather generally robust to image occlusions and patch shuffling; or unlike CNNs, level 0 embeddings already carry rich semantic details. Next, we develop a rigorous framework to perform effective visualizations across layers, exposing the effects of ViTs filters and grouping/clustering behaviors to object patches. Finally, we provide comprehensive experiments on real datasets to qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the merit of our proposed methods as well as our findings. https://github.com/byM1902/ViT_visualization

- **Summary**: Hand, the bearer of human productivity and intelligence, is receiving much attention due to the recent fever of digital twins. Among different hand morphable models, MANO has been widely used in vision and graphics community. However, MANO disregards textures and accessories, which largely limits its power to synthesize photorealistic hand data. In this paper, we extend MANO with Diverse Accessories and Rich Textures, namely DART. DART is composed of 50 daily 3D accessories which varies in appearance and shape, and 325 hand-crafted 2D texture maps covers different kinds of blemishes or make-ups. Unity GUI is also provided to generate synthetic hand data with user-defined settings, e.g., pose, camera, background, lighting, textures, and accessories. Finally, we release DARTset, which contains large-scale (800K), high-fidelity synthetic hand images, paired with perfect-aligned 3D labels. Experiments demonstrate its superiority in diversity. As a complement to existing hand datasets, DARTset boosts the generalization in both hand pose estimation and mesh recovery tasks. Raw ingredients (textures, accessories), Unity GUI, source code and DARTset are publicly available at dart2022.github.io

- **Summary**: Landsat-8 (NASA) and Sentinel-2 (ESA) are two prominent multi-spectral imaging satellite projects that provide publicly available data. The multi-spectral imaging sensors of the satellites capture images of the earth's surface in the visible and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Since the majority of the earth's surface is constantly covered with clouds, which are not transparent at these wavelengths, many images do not provide much information. To increase the temporal availability of cloud-free images of a certain area, one can combine the observations from multiple sources. However, the sensors of satellites might differ in their properties, making the images incompatible. This work provides a first glance at the possibility of using a transformer-based model to reduce the spectral and spatial differences between observations from both satellite projects. We compare the results to a model based on a fully convolutional UNet architecture. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that, while deep models outperform classical approaches, the UNet significantly outperforms the transformer in our experiments.

- **Summary**: Pretrained Transformers (PT) have been shown to improve Out of Distribution (OOD) robustness than traditional models such as Bag of Words (BOW), LSTMs, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) powered by Word2Vec and Glove embeddings. How does the robustness comparison hold in a real world setting where some part of the dataset can be noisy? Do PT also provide more robust representation than traditional models on exposure to noisy data? We perform a comparative study on 10 models and find an empirical evidence that PT provide less robust representation than traditional models on exposure to noisy data. We investigate further and augment PT with an adversarial filtering (AF) mechanism that has been shown to improve OOD generalization. However, increase in generalization does not necessarily increase robustness, as we find that noisy data fools the AF method powered by PT.

- **Summary**: Multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) is a preferred method for detailed and precise 3D acquisition of an object from images. Although popular methods for MVPS can provide outstanding results, they are often complex to execute and limited to isotropic material objects. To address such limitations, we present a simple, practical approach to MVPS, which works well for isotropic as well as other object material types such as anisotropic and glossy. The proposed approach in this paper exploits the benefit of uncertainty modeling in a deep neural network for a reliable fusion of photometric stereo (PS) and multi-view stereo (MVS) network predictions. Yet, contrary to the recently proposed state-of-the-art, we introduce neural volume rendering methodology for a trustworthy fusion of MVS and PS measurements. The advantage of introducing neural volume rendering is that it helps in the reliable modeling of objects with diverse material types, where existing MVS methods, PS methods, or both may fail. Furthermore, it allows us to work on neural 3D shape representation, which has recently shown outstanding results for many geometric processing tasks. Our suggested new loss function aims to fits the zero level set of the implicit neural function using the most certain MVS and PS network predictions coupled with weighted neural volume rendering cost. The proposed approach shows state-of-the-art results when tested extensively on several benchmark datasets.



### Learning image representations for anomaly detection: application to discovery of histological alterations in drug development

- **Summary**: We present a system for anomaly detection in histopathological images. In histology, normal samples are usually abundant, whereas anomalous (pathological) cases are scarce or not available. Under such settings, one-class classifiers trained on healthy data can detect out-of-distribution anomalous samples. Such approaches combined with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) representations of images were previously employed for anomaly detection (AD). However, pre-trained off-the-shelf CNN representations may not be sensitive to abnormal conditions in tissues, while natural variations of healthy tissue may result in distant representations. To adapt representations to relevant details in healthy tissue we propose training a CNN on an auxiliary task that discriminates healthy tissue of different species, organs, and staining reagents. Almost no additional labeling workload is required, since healthy samples come automatically with aforementioned labels. During training we enforce compact image representations with a center-loss term, which further improves representations for AD. The proposed system outperforms established AD methods on a published dataset of liver anomalies. Moreover, it provided comparable results to conventional methods specifically tailored for quantification of liver anomalies. We show that our approach can be used for toxicity assessment of candidate drugs at early development stages and thereby may reduce expensive late-stage drug attrition.



### Quo Vadis: Is Trajectory Forecasting the Key Towards Long-Term Multi-Object Tracking?

- **Summary**: Recent developments in monocular multi-object tracking have been very successful in tracking visible objects and bridging short occlusion gaps, mainly relying on data-driven appearance models. While we have significantly advanced short-term tracking performance, bridging longer occlusion gaps remains elusive: state-of-the-art object trackers only bridge less than 10% of occlusions longer than three seconds. We suggest that the missing key is reasoning about future trajectories over a longer time horizon. Intuitively, the longer the occlusion gap, the larger the search space for possible associations. In this paper, we show that even a small yet diverse set of trajectory predictions for moving agents will significantly reduce this search space and thus improve long-term tracking robustness. Our experiments suggest that the crucial components of our approach are reasoning in a bird's-eye view space and generating a small yet diverse set of forecasts while accounting for their localization uncertainty. This way, we can advance state-of-the-art trackers on the MOTChallenge dataset and significantly improve their long-term tracking performance.

- **Summary**: Large-scale vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models are prone to hallucinate non-existent visual objects when generating text based on visual information. In this paper, we systematically study the object hallucination problem from three aspects. First, we examine recent state-of-the-art VLP models, showing that they still hallucinate frequently, and models achieving better scores on standard metrics (e.g., CIDEr) could be more unfaithful. Second, we investigate how different types of image encoding in VLP influence hallucination, including region-based, grid-based, and patch-based. Surprisingly, we find that patch-based features perform the best and smaller patch resolution yields a non-trivial reduction in object hallucination. Third, we decouple various VLP objectives and demonstrate that token-level image-text alignment and controlled generation are crucial to reducing hallucination. Based on that, we propose a simple yet effective VLP loss named ObjMLM to further mitigate object hallucination. Results show that it reduces object hallucination by up to 17.4% when tested on two benchmarks (COCO Caption for in-domain and NoCaps for out-of-domain evaluation).

- **Summary**: Multi-task learning based video anomaly detection methods combine multiple proxy tasks in different branches to detect video anomalies in different situations. Most existing methods either do not combine complementary tasks to effectively cover all motion patterns, or the class of the objects is not explicitly considered. To address the aforementioned shortcomings, we propose a novel multi-task learning based method that combines complementary proxy tasks to better consider the motion and appearance features. We combine the semantic segmentation and future frame prediction tasks in a single branch to learn the object class and consistent motion patterns, and to detect respective anomalies simultaneously. In the second branch, we added several attention mechanisms to detect motion anomalies with attention to object parts, the direction of motion, and the distance of the objects from the camera. Our qualitative results show that the proposed method considers the object class effectively and learns motion with attention to the aforementioned important factors which results in a precise motion modeling and a better motion anomaly detection. Additionally, quantitative results show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the analysis of cardiac function. However, the acquisition is often accompanied by motion artefacts because of the difficulty of breath-hold, especially for acute symptoms patients. Therefore, it is essential to assess the quality of cardiac MRI for further analysis. Time-consuming manual-based classification is not conducive to the construction of an end-to-end computer aided diagnostic system. To overcome this problem, an automatic cardiac MRI quality estimation framework using ensemble and transfer learning is proposed in this work. Multiple pre-trained models were initialised and fine-tuned on 2-dimensional image patches sampled from the training data. In the model inference process, decisions from these models are aggregated to make a final prediction. The framework has been evaluated on CMRxMotion grand challenge (MICCAI 2022) dataset which is small, multi-class, and imbalanced. It achieved a classification accuracy of 78.8% and 70.0% on the training set (5-fold cross-validation) and a validation set, respectively. The final trained model was also evaluated on an independent test set by the CMRxMotion organisers, which achieved the classification accuracy of 72.5% and Cohen's Kappa of 0.6309 (ranked top 1 in this grand challenge).

- **Summary**: An accurate model of the environment and the dynamic agents acting in it offers great potential for improving motion planning. We present MILE: a Model-based Imitation LEarning approach to jointly learn a model of the world and a policy for autonomous driving. Our method leverages 3D geometry as an inductive bias and learns a highly compact latent space directly from high-resolution videos of expert demonstrations. Our model is trained on an offline corpus of urban driving data, without any online interaction with the environment. MILE improves upon prior state-of-the-art by 31% in driving score on the CARLA simulator when deployed in a completely new town and new weather conditions. Our model can predict diverse and plausible states and actions, that can be interpretably decoded to bird's-eye view semantic segmentation. Further, we demonstrate that it can execute complex driving manoeuvres from plans entirely predicted in imagination. Our approach is the first camera-only method that models static scene, dynamic scene, and ego-behaviour in an urban driving environment. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/wayveai/mile.

- **Summary**: Driven by significant improvements in architectural design and training pipelines, computer vision has recently experienced dramatic progress in terms of accuracy on classic benchmarks such as ImageNet. These highly-accurate models are challenging to deploy, as they appear harder to compress using standard techniques such as pruning. We address this issue by introducing the Correlation Aware Pruner (CAP), a new unstructured pruning framework which significantly pushes the compressibility limits for state-of-the-art architectures. Our method is based on two technical advancements: a new theoretically-justified pruner, which can handle complex weight correlations accurately and efficiently during the pruning process itself, and an efficient finetuning procedure for post-compression recovery. We validate our approach via extensive experiments on several modern vision models such as Vision Transformers (ViT), modern CNNs, and ViT-CNN hybrids, showing for the first time that these can be pruned to high sparsity levels (e.g. $\geq 75$%) with low impact on accuracy ($\leq 1$% relative drop). Our approach is also compatible with structured pruning and quantization, and can lead to practical speedups of 1.5 to 2.4x without accuracy loss. To further showcase CAP's accuracy and scalability, we use it to show for the first time that extremely-accurate large vision models, trained via self-supervised techniques, can also be pruned to moderate sparsities, with negligible accuracy loss.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing images (RSIs) in real scenes may be disturbed by multiple factors such as optical blur, undersampling, and additional noise, resulting in complex and diverse degradation models. At present, the mainstream SR algorithms only consider a single and fixed degradation (such as bicubic interpolation) and cannot flexibly handle complex degradations in real scenes. Therefore, designing a super-resolution (SR) model that can cope with various degradations is gradually attracting the attention of researchers. Some studies first estimate the degradation kernels and then perform degradation-adaptive SR but face the problems of estimation error amplification and insufficient high-frequency details in the results. Although blind SR algorithms based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) have greatly improved visual quality, they still suffer from pseudo-texture, mode collapse, and poor training stability. In this article, we propose a novel blind SR framework based on the stochastic normalizing flow (BlindSRSNF) to address the above problems. BlindSRSNF learns the conditional probability distribution over the high-resolution image space given a low-resolution (LR) image by explicitly optimizing the variational bound on the likelihood. BlindSRSNF is easy to train and can generate photo-realistic SR results that outperform GAN-based models. Besides, we introduce a degradation representation strategy based on contrastive learning to avoid the error amplification problem caused by the explicit degradation estimation. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm can obtain SR results with excellent visual perception quality on both simulated LR and real-world RSIs.

- **Summary**: Recently, alpha matting has received a lot of attention because of its usefulness in mobile applications such as selfies. Therefore, there has been a demand for a lightweight alpha matting model due to the limited computational resources of commercial portable devices. To this end, we suggest a distillation-based channel pruning method for the alpha matting networks. In the pruning step, we remove channels of a student network having fewer impacts on mimicking the knowledge of a teacher network. Then, the pruned lightweight student network is trained by the same distillation loss. A lightweight alpha matting model from the proposed method outperforms existing lightweight methods. To show superiority of our algorithm, we provide various quantitative and qualitative experiments with in-depth analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of the proposed distillation-based channel pruning method by applying it to semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Numerous oncology indications have extensively quantified metabolically active tumors using positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT). F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is frequently utilized in clinical practice and clinical drug research to detect and measure metabolically active malignancies. The assessment of tumor burden using manual or computer-assisted tumor segmentation in FDG-PET images is widespread. Deep learning algorithms have also produced effective solutions in this area. However, there may be a need to improve the performance of a pre-trained deep learning network without the opportunity to modify this network. We investigate the potential benefits of test-time augmentation for segmenting tumors from PET-CT pairings. We applied a new framework of multilevel and multimodal tumor segmentation techniques that can simultaneously consider PET and CT data. In this study, we improve the network using a learnable composition of test time augmentations. We trained U-Net and Swin U-Netr on the training database to determine how different test time augmentation improved segmentation performance. We also developed an algorithm that finds an optimal test time augmentation contribution coefficient set. Using the newly trained U-Net and Swin U-Netr results, we defined an optimal set of coefficients for test-time augmentation and utilized them in combination with a pre-trained fixed nnU-Net. The ultimate idea is to improve performance at the time of testing when the model is fixed. Averaging the predictions with varying ratios on the augmented data can improve prediction accuracy.

- **Summary**: We propose a controllable style transfer framework based on Implicit Neural Representation that pixel-wisely controls the stylized output via test-time training. Unlike traditional image optimization methods that often suffer from unstable convergence and learning-based methods that require intensive training and have limited generalization ability, we present a model optimization framework that optimizes the neural networks during test-time with explicit loss functions for style transfer. After being test-time trained once, thanks to the flexibility of the INR-based model, our framework can precisely control the stylized images in a pixel-wise manner and freely adjust image resolution without further optimization or training. We demonstrate several applications.

- **Summary**: This report describes our approach for the Audio-Visual Diarization (AVD) task of the Ego4D Challenge 2022. Specifically, we present multiple technical improvements over the official baselines. First, we improve the detection performance of the camera wearer's voice activity by modifying the training scheme of its model. Second, we discover that an off-the-shelf voice activity detection model can effectively remove false positives when it is applied solely to the camera wearer's voice activities. Lastly, we show that better active speaker detection leads to a better AVD outcome. Our final method obtains 65.9% DER on the test set of Ego4D, which significantly outperforms all the baselines. Our submission achieved 1st place in the Ego4D Challenge 2022.

- **Summary**: Complete depth information and efficient estimators have become vital ingredients in scene understanding for automated driving tasks. A major problem for LiDAR-based depth completion is the inefficient utilization of convolutions due to the lack of coherent information as provided by the sparse nature of uncorrelated LiDAR point clouds, which often leads to complex and resource-demanding networks. The problem is reinforced by the expensive aquisition of depth data for supervised training. In this work, we propose an efficient depth completion model based on a vgg05-like CNN architecture and propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation approach to transfer knowledge from synthetic to real world data to improve data-efficiency and reduce the need for a large database. In order to boost spatial coherence, we guide the learning process using segmentations as additional source of information. The efficiency and accuracy of our approach is evaluated on the KITTI dataset. Our approach improves on previous efficient and low parameter state of the art approaches while having a noticeably lower computational footprint.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive results in a range of vision-language tasks. However, popular VLMs usually consist of hundreds of millions of parameters which brings challenges for fine-tuning and deployment in real-world applications due to space, memory, and latency constraints. In this work, we introduce a distilling then pruning framework to compress large vision-language models into smaller, faster, and more accurate ones. We first shrink the size of a pre-trained large VLM and apply knowledge distillation in the vision-language pre-training stage to obtain a task-agnostic compact VLM. Then we propose a modal-adaptive pruning algorithm to automatically infer the importance of vision and language modalities for different downstream tasks and adaptively remove redundant structures and neurons in different encoders with controllable target sparsity. We apply our framework to train EfficientVLM, a fast and accurate vision-language model consisting of 6 vision layers, 3 text layers, and 3 cross-modal fusion layers, accounting for only 93 million parameters in total, which is 44.3% of the teacher model. EfficientVLM retains 98.4% performance of the teacher model and accelerates its inference speed by 2.2x. EfficientVLM achieves a large absolute improvement over previous SoTA efficient VLMs of similar sizes by a large margin on various vision-language tasks, including VQAv2 (+4.9%), NLVR2 (+5.6%), ITR (R@1 on TR +17.2%, on IR + 15.6% ) and COCO caption generation (CIDEr +6.5), demonstrating a large potential on training lightweight VLMs.

- **Summary**: In this work, we compare five deep learning solutions to automatically segment the resection cavity in postoperative MRI. The proposed methods are based on the same 3D U-Net architecture. We use a dataset of postoperative MRI volumes, each including four MRI sequences and the ground truth of the corresponding resection cavity. Four solutions are trained with a different MRI sequence. Besides, a method designed with all the available sequences is also presented. Our experiments show that the method trained only with the T1 weighted contrast-enhanced MRI sequence achieves the best results, with a median DICE index of 0.81.

- **Summary**: LiDAR 3D object detection models are inevitably biased towards their training dataset. The detector clearly exhibits this bias when employed on a target dataset, particularly towards object sizes. However, object sizes vary heavily between domains due to, for instance, different labeling policies or geographical locations. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation approaches outsource methods to overcome the object size bias. Mainstream size adaptation approaches exploit target domain statistics, contradicting the original unsupervised assumption. Our novel unsupervised anchor calibration method addresses this limitation. Given a model trained on the source data, we estimate the optimal target anchors in a completely unsupervised manner. The main idea stems from an intuitive observation: by varying the anchor sizes for the target domain, we inevitably introduce noise or even remove valuable object cues. The latent object representation, perturbed by the anchor size, is closest to the learned source features only under the optimal target anchors. We leverage this observation for anchor size optimization. Our experimental results show that, without any retraining, we achieve competitive results even compared to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised size adaptation approaches. In addition, our anchor calibration can be combined with such existing methods, making them completely unsupervised.

- **Summary**: Detection of surface defects is one of the most important issues in the field of image processing and machine vision. In this article, a method for detecting surface defects based on energy changes in co-occurrence matrices is presented. The presented method consists of two stages of training and testing. In the training phase, the co-occurrence matrix operator is first applied on healthy images and then the amount of output energy is calculated. In the following, according to the changes in the amount of energy, a suitable feature vector is defined, and with the help of it, a suitable threshold for the health of the images is obtained. Then, in the test phase, with the help of the calculated quorum, the defective parts are distinguished from the healthy ones. In the results section, the mentioned method has been applied on stone and ceramic images and its detection accuracy has been calculated and compared with some previous methods. Among the advantages of the presented method, we can mention high accuracy, low calculations and compatibility with all types of levels due to the use of the training stage. The proposed approach can be used in medical applications to detect abnormalities such as diseases. So, the performance is evaluated on 2d-hela dataset to classify cell phenotypes. The proposed approach provides about 89.56 percent accuracy on 2d-hela.

- **Summary**: Deep learning for image super-resolution (SR) has been investigated by numerous researchers in recent years. Most of the works concentrate on effective block designs and improve the network representation but lack interpretation. There are also iterative optimization-inspired networks for image SR, which take the solution step as a whole without giving an explicit optimization step. This paper proposes an unfolding iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) inspired network for interpretable image SR. Specifically, we analyze the problem of image SR and propose a solution based on the ISTA method. Inspired by the mathematical analysis, the ISTA block is developed to conduct the optimization in an end-to-end manner. To make the exploration more effective, a multi-scale exploitation block and multi-scale attention mechanism are devised to build the ISTA block. Experimental results show the proposed ISTA-inspired restoration network (ISTAR) achieves competitive or better performances than other optimization-inspired works with fewer parameters and lower computation complexity.

- **Summary**: Visual perception is driven by the focus on relevant aspects in the surrounding world. To transfer this observation to the digital information processing of computers, attention mechanisms have been introduced to highlight salient image regions. Here, we introduce a parameter-free attention mechanism called PfAAM, that is a simple yet effective module. It can be plugged into various convolutional neural network architectures with a little computational overhead and without affecting model size. PfAAM was tested on multiple architectures for classification and segmentic segmentation leading to improved model performance for all tested cases. This demonstrates its wide applicability as a general easy-to-use module for computer vision tasks. The implementation of PfAAM can be found on https://github.com/nkoerb/pfaam.

- **Summary**: Industrial defect detection is commonly addressed with anomaly detection (AD) methods where no or only incomplete data of potentially occurring defects is available. This work discovers previously unknown problems of student-teacher approaches for AD and proposes a solution, where two neural networks are trained to produce the same output for the defect-free training examples. The core assumption of student-teacher networks is that the distance between the outputs of both networks is larger for anomalies since they are absent in training. However, previous methods suffer from the similarity of student and teacher architecture, such that the distance is undesirably small for anomalies. For this reason, we propose asymmetric student-teacher networks (AST). We train a normalizing flow for density estimation as a teacher and a conventional feed-forward network as a student to trigger large distances for anomalies: The bijectivity of the normalizing flow enforces a divergence of teacher outputs for anomalies compared to normal data. Outside the training distribution the student cannot imitate this divergence due to its fundamentally different architecture. Our AST network compensates for wrongly estimated likelihoods by a normalizing flow, which was alternatively used for anomaly detection in previous work. We show that our method produces state-of-the-art results on the two currently most relevant defect detection datasets MVTec AD and MVTec 3D-AD regarding image-level anomaly detection on RGB and 3D data.

- **Summary**: The current success of machine learning on image-based combustion monitoring is based on massive data, which is costly even impossible for industrial applications. To address this conflict, we introduce few-shot learning in order to achieve combustion monitoring and classification for the first time. Two algorithms, Siamese Network coupled with k Nearest Neighbors (SN-kNN) and Prototypical Network (PN), were tested. Rather than utilizing solely visible images as discussed in previous studies, we also used Infrared (IR) images. We analyzed the training process, test performance and inference speed of two algorithms on both image formats, and also used t-SNE to visualize learned features. The results demonstrated that both SN-kNN and PN were capable to distinguish flame states from learning with merely 20 images per flame state. The worst performance, which was realized by PN on IR images, still possessed precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score above 0.95. We showed that visible images demonstrated more substantial differences between classes and presented more consistent patterns inside the class, which made the training speed and model performance better compared to IR images. In contrast, the relatively low quality of IR images made it difficult for PN to extract distinguishable prototypes, which caused relatively weak performance. With the entrire training set supporting classification, SN-kNN performed well with IR images. On the other hand, benefitting from the architecture design, PN has a much faster speed in training and inference than SN-kNN. The presented work analyzed the characteristics of both algorithms and image formats for the first time, thus providing guidance for their future utilization in combustion monitoring tasks.

- **Summary**: In this article, we propose a variational inference formulation of auto-associative memories, allowing us to combine perceptual inference and memory retrieval into the same mathematical framework. In this formulation, the prior probability distribution onto latent representations is made memory dependent, thus pulling the inference process towards previously stored representations. We then study how different neural network approaches to variational inference can be applied in this framework. We compare methods relying on amortized inference such as Variational Auto Encoders and methods relying on iterative inference such as Predictive Coding and suggest combining both approaches to design new auto-associative memory models. We evaluate the obtained algorithms on the CIFAR10 and CLEVR image datasets and compare them with other associative memory models such as Hopfield Networks, End-to-End Memory Networks and Neural Turing Machines.

- **Summary**: We discuss basic concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and outline uses in manufacturing. We begin by discussing how different types of data objects commonly encountered in manufacturing (e.g., time series, images, micrographs, videos, spectra, molecular structures) can be represented in a flexible manner using tensors and graphs. We then discuss how CNNs use convolution operations to extract informative features (e.g., geometric patterns and textures) from the such representations to predict emergent properties and phenomena and/or to identify anomalies. We also discuss how CNNs can exploit color as a key source of information, which enables the use of modern computer vision hardware (e.g., infrared, thermal, and hyperspectral cameras). We illustrate the concepts using diverse case studies arising in spectral analysis, molecule design, sensor design, image-based control, and multivariate process monitoring.

- **Summary**: Solar energy is one of the most dependable renewable energy technologies, as it is feasible almost everywhere globally. However, improving the efficiency of a solar PV system remains a significant challenge. To enhance the robustness of the solar system, this paper proposes a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) based fault detection scheme to divide the images of photovoltaic modules. For binary classification, the algorithm classifies the input images of PV cells into two categories (i.e. faulty or normal). To further assess the network's capability, the defective PV cells are organized into shadowy, cracked, or dusty cells, and the model is utilized for multiple classifications. The success rate for the proposed CNN model is 91.1% for binary classification and 88.6% for multi-classification. Thus, the proposed trained CNN model remarkably outperforms the CNN model presented in a previous study which used the same datasets. The proposed CNN-based fault detection model is straightforward, simple and effective and could be applied in the fault detection of solar panel.

- **Summary**: The success of supervised deep learning models in medical image segmentation relies on detailed annotations. However, labor-intensive manual labeling is costly and inefficient, especially in dense object segmentation. To this end, we propose a self-supervised learning based approach with a Prior Self-activation Module (PSM) that generates self-activation maps from the input images to avoid labeling costs and further produce pseudo masks for the downstream task. To be specific, we firstly train a neural network using self-supervised learning and utilize the gradient information in the shallow layers of the network to generate self-activation maps. Afterwards, a semantic-guided generator is then introduced as a pipeline to transform visual representations from PSM to pixel-level semantic pseudo masks for downstream tasks. Furthermore, a two-stage training module, consisting of a nuclei detection network and a nuclei segmentation network, is adopted to achieve the final segmentation. Experimental results show the effectiveness on two public pathological datasets. Compared with other fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods, our method can achieve competitive performance without any manual annotations.

- **Summary**: Plant phenotyping is a central task in agriculture, as it describes plants' growth stage, development, and other relevant quantities. Robots can help automate this process by accurately estimating plant traits such as the number of leaves, leaf area, and the plant size. In this paper, we address the problem of joint semantic, plant instance, and leaf instance segmentation of crop fields from RGB data. We propose a single convolutional neural network that addresses the three tasks simultaneously, exploiting their underlying hierarchical structure. We introduce task-specific skip connections, which our experimental evaluation proves to be more beneficial than the usual schemes. We also propose a novel automatic post-processing, which explicitly addresses the problem of spatially close instances, common in the agricultural domain because of overlapping leaves. Our architecture simultaneously tackles these problems jointly in the agricultural context. Previous works either focus on plant or leaf segmentation, or do not optimise for semantic segmentation. Results show that our system has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while having a reduced number of parameters and is operating at camera frame rate.

- **Summary**: The discrete Fourier transform is among the most routine tools used in high-resolution scanning / transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). However, when calculating a Fourier transform, periodic boundary conditions are imposed and sharp discontinuities between the edges of an image cause a cross patterned artifact along the reciprocal space axes. This artifact can interfere with the analysis of reciprocal lattice peaks of an atomic resolution image. Here we demonstrate that the recently developed Periodic Plus Smooth Decomposition technique provides a simple, efficient method for reliable removal of artifacts caused by edge discontinuities. In this method, edge artifacts are reduced by subtracting a smooth background that solves Poisson's equation with boundary conditions set by the image's edges. Unlike the traditional windowed Fourier transforms, Periodic Plus Smooth Decomposition maintains sharp reciprocal lattice peaks from the image's entire field of view.

- **Summary**: Free-form text prompts allow users to describe their intentions during image manipulation conveniently. Based on the visual latent space of StyleGAN[21] and text embedding space of CLIP[34], studies focus on how to map these two latent spaces for text-driven attribute manipulations. Currently, the latent mapping between these two spaces is empirically designed and confines that each manipulation model can only handle one fixed text prompt. In this paper, we propose a method named Free-Form CLIP (FFCLIP), aiming to establish an automatic latent mapping so that one manipulation model handles free-form text prompts. Our FFCLIP has a cross-modality semantic modulation module containing semantic alignment and injection. The semantic alignment performs the automatic latent mapping via linear transformations with a cross attention mechanism. After alignment, we inject semantics from text prompt embeddings to the StyleGAN latent space. For one type of image (e.g., `human portrait'), one FFCLIP model can be learned to handle free-form text prompts. Meanwhile, we observe that although each training text prompt only contains a single semantic meaning, FFCLIP can leverage text prompts with multiple semantic meanings for image manipulation. In the experiments, we evaluate FFCLIP on three types of images (i.e., `human portraits', `cars', and `churches'). Both visual and numerical results show that FFCLIP effectively produces semantically accurate and visually realistic images. Project page: https://github.com/KumapowerLIU/FFCLIP.

- **Summary**: Predicting pedestrian behavior is a crucial task for intelligent driving systems. Accurate predictions require a deep understanding of various contextual elements that potentially impact the way pedestrians behave. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that relies on different data modalities to predict future trajectories and crossing actions of pedestrians from an ego-centric perspective. Specifically, our model utilizes a cross-modal Transformer architecture to capture dependencies between different data types. The output of the Transformer is augmented with representations of interactions between pedestrians and other traffic agents conditioned on the pedestrian and ego-vehicle dynamics that are generated via a semantic attentive interaction module. Lastly, the context encodings are fed into a multi-stream decoder framework using a gated-shared network. We evaluate our algorithm on public pedestrian behavior benchmarks, PIE and JAAD, and show that our model improves state-of-the-art in trajectory and action prediction by up to 22% and 13% respectively on various metrics. The advantages brought by components of our model are investigated via extensive ablation studies.

- **Summary**: To reduce doctors' workload, deep-learning-based automatic medical report generation has recently attracted more and more research efforts, where deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed to encode the input images, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used to decode the visual features into medical reports automatically. However, these state-of-the-art methods mainly suffer from three shortcomings: (i) incomprehensive optimization, (ii) low-order and unidimensional attention mechanisms, and (iii) repeated generation. In this article, we propose a hybrid reinforced medical report generation method with m-linear attention and repetition penalty mechanism (HReMRG-MR) to overcome these problems. Specifically, a hybrid reward with different weights is employed to remedy the limitations of single-metric-based rewards. We also propose a search algorithm with linear complexity to approximate the best weight combination. Furthermore, we use m-linear attention modules to explore high-order feature interactions and to achieve multi-modal reasoning, while a repetition penalty applies penalties to repeated terms during the model's training process. Extensive experimental studies on two public datasets show that HReMRG-MR greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of all metrics. We also conducted a series of ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness of all our proposed components. We also performed a reward search toy experiment to give evidence that our proposed search approach can significantly reduce the search time while approximating the best performance.

- **Summary**: Detection and recognition of text from scans and other images, commonly denoted as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), is a widely used form of automated document processing with a number of methods available. Yet OCR systems still do not achieve 100% accuracy, requiring human corrections in applications where correct readout is essential. Advances in machine learning enabled even more challenging scenarios of text detection and recognition "in-the-wild" - such as detecting text on objects from photographs of complex scenes. While the state-of-the-art methods for in-the-wild text recognition are typically evaluated on complex scenes, their performance in the domain of documents is typically not published, and a comprehensive comparison with methods for document OCR is missing. This paper compares several methods designed for in-the-wild text recognition and for document text recognition, and provides their evaluation on the domain of structured documents. The results suggest that state-of-the-art methods originally proposed for in-the-wild text detection also achieve competitive results on document text detection, outperforming available OCR methods. We argue that the application of document OCR should not be omitted in evaluation of text detection and recognition methods.

- **Summary**: The biggest challenge for the deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) close to the generated data on edge devices is their size, i.e., memory footprint and computational complexity. Both are significantly reduced with quantization. With the resulting lower word-length, the energy efficiency of DNNs increases proportionally. However, lower word-length typically causes accuracy degradation. To counteract this effect, the quantized DNN is retrained. Unfortunately, training costs up to 5000x more energy than the inference of the quantized DNN. To address this issue, we propose a post-training quantization flow without the need for retraining. For this, we investigated different quantization options. Furthermore, our analysis systematically assesses the impact of reduced word-lengths of weights and activations revealing a clear trend for the choice of word-length. Both aspects have not been systematically investigated so far. Our results are independent of the depth of the DNNs and apply to uniform quantization, allowing fast quantization of a given pre-trained DNN. We excel state-of-the-art for 6 bit by 2.2% Top-1 accuracy for ImageNet. Without retraining, our quantization to 8 bit surpasses floating-point accuracy.

- **Summary**: We introduce MOVE, a novel method to segment objects without any form of supervision. MOVE exploits the fact that foreground objects can be shifted locally relative to their initial position and result in realistic (undistorted) new images. This property allows us to train a segmentation model on a dataset of images without annotation and to achieve state of the art (SotA) performance on several evaluation datasets for unsupervised salient object detection and segmentation. In unsupervised single object discovery, MOVE gives an average CorLoc improvement of 7.2% over the SotA, and in unsupervised class-agnostic object detection it gives a relative AP improvement of 53% on average. Our approach is built on top of self-supervised features (e.g. from DINO or MAE), an inpainting network (based on the Masked AutoEncoder) and adversarial training.

- **Summary**: Although supervised learning has enabled high performance for image segmentation, it requires a large amount of labeled training data, which can be difficult to obtain in the medical imaging field. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods involving pretext tasks have shown promise in overcoming this requirement by first pretraining models using unlabeled data. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of two SSL methods (inpainting-based pretext tasks of context prediction and context restoration) for CT and MRI image segmentation in label-limited scenarios, and investigate the effect of implementation design choices for SSL on downstream segmentation performance. We demonstrate that optimally trained and easy-to-implement inpainting-based SSL segmentation models can outperform classically supervised methods for MRI and CT tissue segmentation in label-limited scenarios, for both clinically-relevant metrics and the traditional Dice score.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen embodied visual navigation advance in two distinct directions: (i) in equipping the AI agent to follow natural language instructions, and (ii) in making the navigable world multimodal, e.g., audio-visual navigation. However, the real world is not only multimodal, but also often complex, and thus in spite of these advances, agents still need to understand the uncertainty in their actions and seek instructions to navigate. To this end, we present AVLEN~ -- an interactive agent for Audio-Visual-Language Embodied Navigation. Similar to audio-visual navigation tasks, the goal of our embodied agent is to localize an audio event via navigating the 3D visual world; however, the agent may also seek help from a human (oracle), where the assistance is provided in free-form natural language. To realize these abilities, AVLEN uses a multimodal hierarchical reinforcement learning backbone that learns: (a) high-level policies to choose either audio-cues for navigation or to query the oracle, and (b) lower-level policies to select navigation actions based on its audio-visual and language inputs. The policies are trained via rewarding for the success on the navigation task while minimizing the number of queries to the oracle. To empirically evaluate AVLEN, we present experiments on the SoundSpaces framework for semantic audio-visual navigation tasks. Our results show that equipping the agent to ask for help leads to a clear improvement in performance, especially in challenging cases, e.g., when the sound is unheard during training or in the presence of distractor sounds.

- **Summary**: Artifacts on magnetic resonance scans are a serious challenge for both radiologists and computer-aided diagnosis systems. Most commonly, artifacts are caused by motion of the patients, but can also arise from device-specific abnormalities such as noise patterns. Irrespective of the source, artifacts can not only render a scan useless, but can potentially induce misdiagnoses if left unnoticed. For instance, an artifact may masquerade as a tumor or other abnormality. Retrospective artifact correction (RAC) is concerned with removing artifacts after the scan has already been taken. In this work, we propose a method capable of retrospectively removing eight common artifacts found in native-resolution MR imagery. Knowledge of the presence or location of a specific artifact is not assumed and the system is, by design, capable of undoing interactions of multiple artifacts. Our method is realized through the design of a novel volumetric transformer-based neural network that generalizes a \emph{window-centered} approach popularized by the Swin transformer. Unlike Swin, our method is (i) natively volumetric, (ii) geared towards dense prediction tasks instead of classification, and (iii), uses a novel and more global mechanism to enable information exchange between windows. Our experiments show that our reconstructions are considerably better than those attained by ResNet, V-Net, MobileNet-v2, DenseNet, CycleGAN and BicycleGAN. Moreover, we show that the reconstructed images from our model improves the accuracy of FSL BET, a standard skull-stripping method typically applied in diagnostic workflows.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the transferability of ImageNet spatial and Kinetics spatio-temporal representations to multi-label Movie Trailer Genre Classification (MTGC). In particular, we present an extensive evaluation of the transferability of ConvNet and Transformer models pretrained on ImageNet and Kinetics to Trailers12k, a new manually-curated movie trailer dataset composed of 12,000 videos labeled with 10 different genres and associated metadata. We analyze different aspects that can influence transferability, such as frame rate, input video extension, and spatio-temporal modeling. In order to reduce the spatio-temporal structure gap between ImageNet/Kinetics and Trailers12k, we propose Dual Image and Video Transformer Architecture (DIViTA), which performs shot detection so as to segment the trailer into highly correlated clips, providing a more cohesive input for pretrained backbones and improving transferability (a 1.83% increase for ImageNet and 3.75% for Kinetics). Our results demonstrate that representations learned on either ImageNet or Kinetics are comparatively transferable to Trailers12k. Moreover, both datasets provide complementary information that can be combined to improve classification performance (a 2.91% gain compared to the top single pretraining). Interestingly, using lightweight ConvNets as pretrained backbones resulted in only a 3.46% drop in classification performance compared with the top Transformer while requiring only 11.82% of its parameters and 0.81% of its FLOPS.

- **Summary**: We demonstrate the utility of recurring pattern discovery from a single image for spatial understanding of a 3D scene in terms of (1) vanishing point detection, (2) hypothesizing 3D translation symmetry and (3) counting the number of RP instances in the image.   Furthermore, we illustrate the feasibility of leveraging RP discovery output to form a more precise, quantitative text description of the scene. Our quantitative evaluations on a new 1K+ Recurring Pattern (RP) benchmark with diverse variations show that visual perception of recurrence from one single view leads to scene understanding outcomes that are as good as or better than existing supervised methods and/or unsupervised methods that use millions of images.

- **Summary**: Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a popular method for neural architecture search (NAS), which performs cell-search and utilizes continuous relaxation to improve the search efficiency via gradient-based optimization. The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the discovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during search. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with many methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or fundamental changes to DARTS. However, the weight-sharing framework used for cell-search in DARTS and the convergence of architecture parameters has not been analyzed yet. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical and empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that DARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing framework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the softmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers closer to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance collapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent performance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients of layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three different datasets show that our method ($\Lambda$-DARTS) does indeed prevent performance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and the proposed remedy.

- **Summary**: We propose learnable polyphase sampling (LPS), a pair of learnable down/upsampling layers that enable truly shift-invariant and equivariant convolutional networks. LPS can be trained end-to-end from data and generalizes existing handcrafted downsampling layers. It is widely applicable as it can be integrated into any convolutional network by replacing down/upsampling layers. We evaluate LPS on image classification and semantic segmentation. Experiments show that LPS is on-par with or outperforms existing methods in both performance and shift consistency. For the first time, we achieve true shift-equivariance on semantic segmentation (PASCAL VOC), i.e., 100% shift consistency, outperforming baselines by an absolute 3.3%.

- **Summary**: Recent work has seen the development of general purpose neural architectures that can be trained to perform tasks across diverse data modalities. General purpose models typically make few assumptions about the underlying data-structure and are known to perform well in the large-data regime. At the same time, there has been growing interest in modular neural architectures that represent the data using sparsely interacting modules. These models can be more robust out-of-distribution, computationally efficient, and capable of sample-efficient adaptation to new data. However, they tend to make domain-specific assumptions about the data, and present challenges in how module behavior (i.e., parameterization) and connectivity (i.e., their layout) can be jointly learned. In this work, we introduce a general purpose, yet modular neural architecture called Neural Attentive Circuits (NACs) that jointly learns the parameterization and a sparse connectivity of neural modules without using domain knowledge. NACs are best understood as the combination of two systems that are jointly trained end-to-end: one that determines the module configuration and the other that executes it on an input. We demonstrate qualitatively that NACs learn diverse and meaningful module configurations on the NLVR2 dataset without additional supervision. Quantitatively, we show that by incorporating modularity in this way, NACs improve upon a strong non-modular baseline in terms of low-shot adaptation on CIFAR and CUBs dataset by about 10%, and OOD robustness on Tiny ImageNet-R by about 2.5%. Further, we find that NACs can achieve an 8x speedup at inference time while losing less than 3% performance. Finally, we find NACs to yield competitive results on diverse data modalities spanning point-cloud classification, symbolic processing and text-classification from ASCII bytes, thereby confirming its general purpose nature.

- **Summary**: Most previous deblurring methods were built with a generic model trained on blurred images and their sharp counterparts. However, these approaches might have sub-optimal deblurring results due to the domain gap between the training and test sets. This paper proposes a reblur-deblur meta-transferring scheme to realize test-time adaptation without using ground truth for dynamic scene deblurring. Since the ground truth is usually unavailable at inference time in a real-world scenario, we leverage the blurred input video to find and use relatively sharp patches as the pseudo ground truth. Furthermore, we propose a reblurring model to extract the homogenous blur from the blurred input and transfer it to the pseudo-sharps to obtain the corresponding pseudo-blurred patches for meta-learning and test-time adaptation with only a few gradient updates. Extensive experimental results show that our reblur-deblur meta-learning scheme can improve state-of-the-art deblurring models on the DVD, REDS, and RealBlur benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: General movement assessment (GMA) of infant movement videos (IMVs) is an effective method for early detection of cerebral palsy (CP) in infants. We demonstrate in this paper that end-to-end trainable neural networks for image sequence recognition can be applied to achieve good results in GMA, and more importantly, augmenting raw video with infant body parsing and pose estimation information can significantly improve performance. To solve the problem of efficiently utilizing partially labeled IMVs for body parsing, we propose a semi-supervised model, termed SiamParseNet (SPN), which consists of two branches, one for intra-frame body parts segmentation and another for inter-frame label propagation. During training, the two branches are jointly trained by alternating between using input pairs of only labeled frames and input of both labeled and unlabeled frames. We also investigate training data augmentation by proposing a factorized video generative adversarial network (FVGAN) to synthesize novel labeled frames for training. When testing, we employ a multi-source inference mechanism, where the final result for a test frame is either obtained via the segmentation branch or via propagation from a nearby key frame. We conduct extensive experiments for body parsing using SPN on two infant movement video datasets, where SPN coupled with FVGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate that SPN can be easily adapted to the infant pose estimation task with superior performance. Last but not least, we explore the clinical application of our method for GMA. We collected a new clinical IMV dataset with GMA annotations, and our experiments show that SPN models for body parsing and pose estimation trained on the first two datasets generalize well to the new clinical dataset and their results can significantly boost the CRNN-based GMA prediction performance.

- **Summary**: Path prediction is an essential task for many real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications, from autonomous driving and traffic monitoring/management to pedestrian/worker safety. These real-world CPS applications need a robust, lightweight path prediction that can provide a universal network architecture for multiple subjects (e.g., pedestrians and vehicles) from different perspectives. However, most existing algorithms are tailor-made for a unique subject with a specific camera perspective and scenario. This article presents Pishgu, a universal lightweight network architecture, as a robust and holistic solution for path prediction. Pishgu's architecture can adapt to multiple path prediction domains with different subjects (vehicles, pedestrians), perspectives (bird's-eye, high-angle), and scenes (sidewalk, highway). Our proposed architecture captures the inter-dependencies within the subjects in each frame by taking advantage of Graph Isomorphism Networks and the attention module. We separately train and evaluate the efficacy of our architecture on three different CPS domains across multiple perspectives (vehicle bird's-eye view, pedestrian bird's-eye view, and human high-angle view). Pishgu outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in the vehicle bird's-eye view domain by 42% and 61% and pedestrian high-angle view domain by 23% and 22% in terms of ADE and FDE, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the domain-specific details for various datasets to understand their effect on path prediction and model interpretation. Finally, we report the latency and throughput for all three domains on multiple embedded platforms showcasing the robustness and adaptability of Pishgu for real-world integration into CPS applications.

- **Summary**: Learning-based perception and prediction modules in modern autonomous driving systems typically rely on expensive human annotation and are designed to perceive only a handful of predefined object categories. This closed-set paradigm is insufficient for the safety-critical autonomous driving task, where the autonomous vehicle needs to process arbitrarily many types of traffic participants and their motion behaviors in a highly dynamic world. To address this difficulty, this paper pioneers a novel and challenging direction, i.e., training perception and prediction models to understand open-set moving objects, with no human supervision. Our proposed framework uses self-learned flow to trigger an automated meta labeling pipeline to achieve automatic supervision. 3D detection experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that our method significantly outperforms classical unsupervised approaches and is even competitive to the counterpart with supervised scene flow. We further show that our approach generates highly promising results in open-set 3D detection and trajectory prediction, confirming its potential in closing the safety gap of fully supervised systems.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds is an important task in autonomous driving. However, training deep models via conventional supervised methods requires large datasets which are costly to label. It is critical to have label-efficient segmentation approaches to scale up the model to new operational domains or to improve performance on rare cases. While most prior works focus on indoor scenes, we are one of the first to propose a label-efficient semantic segmentation pipeline for outdoor scenes with LiDAR point clouds. Our method co-designs an efficient labeling process with semi/weakly supervised learning and is applicable to nearly any 3D semantic segmentation backbones. Specifically, we leverage geometry patterns in outdoor scenes to have a heuristic pre-segmentation to reduce the manual labeling and jointly design the learning targets with the labeling process. In the learning step, we leverage prototype learning to get more descriptive point embeddings and use multi-scan distillation to exploit richer semantics from temporally aggregated point clouds to boost the performance of single-scan models. Evaluated on the SemanticKITTI and the nuScenes datasets, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing label-efficient methods. With extremely limited human annotations (e.g., 0.1% point labels), our proposed method is even highly competitive compared to the fully supervised counterpart with 100% labels.

- **Summary**: For medical image semantic segmentation (MISS), Vision Transformers have emerged as strong alternatives to convolutional neural networks thanks to their inherent ability to capture long-range correlations. However, existing research uses off-the-shelf vision Transformer blocks based on linear projections and feature processing which lack spatial and local context to refine organ boundaries. Furthermore, Transformers do not generalize well on small medical imaging datasets and rely on large-scale pre-training due to limited inductive biases. To address these problems, we demonstrate the design of a compact and accurate Transformer network for MISS, CS-Unet, which introduces convolutions in a multi-stage design for hierarchically enhancing spatial and local modeling ability of Transformers. This is mainly achieved by our well-designed Convolutional Swin Transformer (CST) block which merges convolutions with Multi-Head Self-Attention and Feed-Forward Networks for providing inherent localized spatial context and inductive biases. Experiments demonstrate CS-Unet without pre-training outperforms other counterparts by large margins on multi-organ and cardiac datasets with fewer parameters and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at Github.

- **Summary**: Background: A crucial initial processing step for quantitative PET/CT analysis is the segmentation of tumor lesions enabling accurate feature ex-traction, tumor characterization, oncologic staging, and image-based therapy response assessment. Manual lesion segmentation is however associated with enormous effort and cost and is thus infeasible in clinical routine. Goal: The goal of this study was to report the performance of a deep neural network designed to automatically segment regions suspected of cancer in whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT images in the context of the AutoPET challenge. Method: A cascaded approach was developed where a stacked ensemble of 3D UNET CNN processed the PET/CT images at a fixed 6mm resolution. A refiner network composed of residual layers enhanced the 6mm segmentation mask to the original resolution. Results: 930 cases were used to train the model. 50% were histologically proven cancer patients and 50% were healthy controls. We obtained a dice=0.68 on 84 stratified test cases. Manual and automatic Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTV) were highly correlated (R2 = 0.969,Slope = 0.947). Inference time was 89.7 seconds on average. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm accurately segmented regions suspicious for cancer in whole-body 18F -FDG PET/CT images.

- **Summary**: Modern-day display systems demand high-quality rendering. However, rendering at higher resolution requires a large number of data samples and is computationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning-based image and video super-resolution techniques motivate us to investigate such networks for high-fidelity upscaling of frames rendered at a lower resolution to a higher resolution. While our work focuses on super-resolution of medical volume visualization performed with direct volume rendering, it is also applicable for volume visualization with other rendering techniques. We propose a learning-based technique where our proposed system uses color information along with other supplementary features gathered from our volume renderer to learn efficient upscaling of a low-resolution rendering to a higher-resolution space. Furthermore, to improve temporal stability, we also implement the temporal reprojection technique for accumulating history samples in volumetric rendering.

- **Summary**: The benefits of medical imaging are enormous. Medical images provide considerable amounts of anatomical information and this facilitates medical practitioners in performing effective disease diagnosis and deciding upon the best course of medical treatment. A transition from traditional monochromatic medical images like CT scans, X-Rays or MRI images to a colored 3D representation of the anatomical structure further enhances the capabilities of medical professionals in extracting valuable medical information. The proposed framework in our research starts with performing color transfer by finding deep semantic correspondence between two medical images: a colored reference image, and a monochromatic CT scan or an MRI image. We extend this idea of reference-based colorization technique to perform colored volume rendering from a stack of grayscale medical images. Furthermore, we also propose to use an effective reference image recommendation system to aid in the selection of good reference images. With our approach, we successfully perform colored medical volume visualization and essentially eliminate the painstaking process of user interaction with a transfer function to obtain color and opacity parameters for volume rendering.

- **Summary**: Melanoma is regarded as the most threatening among all skin cancers. There is a pressing need to build systems which can aid in the early detection of melanoma and enable timely treatment to patients. Recent methods are geared towards machine learning based systems where the task is posed as image recognition, tag dermoscopic images of skin lesions as melanoma or non-melanoma. Even though these methods show promising results in terms of accuracy, they are computationally quite expensive to train, that questions the ability of these models to be deployable in a clinical setting or memory constraint devices. To address this issue, we focus on building simple and performant models having few layers, less than ten compared to hundreds. As well as with fewer learnable parameters, 0.26 million (M) compared to 42.5M using knowledge distillation with the goal to detect melanoma from dermoscopic images. First, we train a teacher model using a ResNet-50 to detect melanoma. Using the teacher model, we train the student model known as Distilled Student Network (DSNet) which has around 0.26M parameters using knowledge distillation achieving an accuracy of 91.7%. We compare against ImageNet pre-trained models such MobileNet, VGG-16, Inception-V3, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-50 and ResNet-101. We find that our approach works well in terms of inference runtime compared to other pre-trained models, 2.57 seconds compared to 14.55 seconds. We find that DSNet (0.26M parameters), which is 15 times smaller, consistently performs better than EfficientNet-B0 (4M parameters) in both melanoma and non-melanoma detection across Precision, Recall and F1 scores

- **Summary**: Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several computer vision tasks and domains. Nevertheless, it still has a high computational cost and demands a significant amount of parameters. Such requirements hinder the use in resource-limited environments and demand both software and hardware optimization. Another limitation is that deep models are usually specialized into a single domain or task, requiring them to learn and store new parameters for each new one. Multi-Domain Learning (MDL) attempts to solve this problem by learning a single model that is capable of performing well in multiple domains. Nevertheless, the models are usually larger than the baseline for a single domain. This work tackles both of these problems: our objective is to prune models capable of handling multiple domains according to a user defined budget, making them more computationally affordable while keeping a similar classification performance. We achieve this by encouraging all domains to use a similar subset of filters from the baseline model, up to the amount defined by the user's budget. Then, filters that are not used by any domain are pruned from the network. The proposed approach innovates by better adapting to resource-limited devices while, to our knowledge, being the only work that is capable of handling multiple domains at test time with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than the baseline model for a single domain.

- **Summary**: Segmenting object instances is a key task in machine perception, with safety-critical applications in robotics and autonomous driving. We introduce a novel approach to instance segmentation that jointly leverages measurements from multiple sensor modalities, such as cameras and LiDAR. Our method learns to predict embeddings for each pixel or point that give rise to a dense segmentation of the scene. Specifically, our technique applies contrastive learning to points in the scene both across sensor modalities and the temporal domain. We demonstrate that this formulation encourages the models to learn embeddings that are invariant to viewpoint variations and consistent across sensor modalities. We further demonstrate that the embeddings are stable over time as objects move around the scene. This not only provides stable instance masks, but can also provide valuable signals to downstream tasks, such as object tracking. We evaluate our method on the Cityscapes and KITTI-360 datasets. We further conduct a number of ablation studies, demonstrating benefits when applying additional inputs for the contrastive loss.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel keypoint voting 6DoF object pose estimation method, which takes pure unordered point cloud geometry as input without RGB information. The proposed cascaded keypoint voting method, called RCVPose3D, is based upon a novel architecture which separates the task of semantic segmentation from that of keypoint regression, thereby increasing the effectiveness of both and improving the ultimate performance. The method also introduces a pairwise constraint in between different keypoints to the loss function when regressing the quantity for keypoint estimation, which is shown to be effective, as well as a novel Voter Confident Score which enhances both the learning and inference stages. Our proposed RCVPose3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occlusion LINEMOD (74.5%) and YCB-Video (96.9%) datasets, outperforming existing pure RGB and RGB-D based methods, as well as being competitive with RGB plus point cloud methods.

- **Summary**: On the internet, images are no longer static; they have become dynamic content. Thanks to the availability of smartphones with cameras and easy-to-use editing software, images can be remixed (i.e., redacted, edited, and recombined with other content) on-the-fly and with a world-wide audience that can repeat the process. From digital art to memes, the evolution of images through time is now an important topic of study for digital humanists, social scientists, and media forensics specialists. However, because typical data sets in computer vision are composed of static content, the development of automated algorithms to analyze remixed content has been limited. In this paper, we introduce the idea of Motif Mining - the process of finding and summarizing remixed image content in large collections of unlabeled and unsorted data. In this paper, this idea is formalized and a reference implementation is introduced. Experiments are conducted on three meme-style data sets, including a newly collected set associated with the information war in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. The proposed motif mining approach is able to identify related remixed content that, when compared to similar approaches, more closely aligns with the preferences and expectations of human observers.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D object detection is one of the most challenging tasks in 3D scene understanding. Due to the ill-posed nature of monocular imagery, existing monocular 3D detection methods highly rely on training with the manually annotated 3D box labels on the LiDAR point clouds. This annotation process is very laborious and expensive. To dispense with the reliance on 3D box labels, in this paper we explore the weakly supervised monocular 3D detection. Specifically, we first detect 2D boxes on the image. Then, we adopt the generated 2D boxes to select corresponding RoI LiDAR points as the weak supervision. Eventually, we adopt a network to predict 3D boxes which can tightly align with associated RoI LiDAR points. This network is learned by minimizing our newly-proposed 3D alignment loss between the 3D box estimates and the corresponding RoI LiDAR points. We will illustrate the potential challenges of the above learning problem and resolve these challenges by introducing several effective designs into our method. Codes will be available at https://github.com/SPengLiang/WeakM3D.

- **Summary**: We aim to improve the performance of regressing hand keypoints and segmenting pixel-level hand masks under new imaging conditions (e.g., outdoors) when we only have labeled images taken under very different conditions (e.g., indoors). In the real world, it is important that the model trained for both tasks works under various imaging conditions. However, their variation covered by existing labeled hand datasets is limited. Thus, it is necessary to adapt the model trained on the labeled images (source) to unlabeled images (target) with unseen imaging conditions. While self-training domain adaptation methods (i.e., learning from the unlabeled target images in a self-supervised manner) have been developed for both tasks, their training may degrade performance when the predictions on the target images are noisy. To avoid this, it is crucial to assign a low importance (confidence) weight to the noisy predictions during self-training. In this paper, we propose to utilize the divergence of two predictions to estimate the confidence of the target image for both tasks. These predictions are given from two separate networks, and their divergence helps identify the noisy predictions. To integrate our proposed confidence estimation into self-training, we propose a teacher-student framework where the two networks (teachers) provide supervision to a network (student) for self-training, and the teachers are learned from the student by knowledge distillation. Our experiments show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in adaptation settings with different lighting, grasping objects, backgrounds, and camera viewpoints. Our method improves by 4% the multi-task score on HO3D compared to the latest adversarial adaptation method. We also validate our method on Ego4D, egocentric videos with rapid changes in imaging conditions outdoors.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The great success neural networks have achieved is inseparable from the application of gradient-descent (GD) algorithms. Based on GD, many variant algorithms have emerged to improve the GD optimization process. The gradient for back-propagation is apparently the most crucial aspect for the training of a neural network. The quality of the calculated gradient can be affected by multiple aspects, e.g., noisy data, calculation error, algorithm limitation, and so on. To reveal gradient information beyond gradient descent, we introduce a framework (\textbf{GCGD}) to perform gradient correction. GCGD consists of two plug-in modules: 1) inspired by the idea of gradient prediction, we propose a \textbf{GC-W} module for weight gradient correction; 2) based on Neural ODE, we propose a \textbf{GC-ODE} module for hidden states gradient correction. Experiment results show that our gradient correction framework can effectively improve the gradient quality to reduce training epochs by $\sim$ 20\% and also improve the network performance.

- **Summary**: Class-agnostic counting (CAC) aims to count all instances in a query image given few exemplars. A standard pipeline is to extract visual features from exemplars and match them with query images to infer object counts. Two essential components in this pipeline are feature representation and similarity metric. Existing methods either adopt a pretrained network to represent features or learn a new one, while applying a naive similarity metric with fixed inner product. We find this paradigm leads to noisy similarity matching and hence harms counting performance. In this work, we propose a similarity-aware CAC framework that jointly learns representation and similarity metric. We first instantiate our framework with a naive baseline called Bilinear Matching Network (BMNet), whose key component is a learnable bilinear similarity metric. To further embody the core of our framework, we extend BMNet to BMNet+ that models similarity from three aspects: 1) representing the instances via their self-similarity to enhance feature robustness against intra-class variations; 2) comparing the similarity dynamically to focus on the key patterns of each exemplar; 3) learning from a supervision signal to impose explicit constraints on matching results. Extensive experiments on a recent CAC dataset FSC147 show that our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art CAC approaches. In addition, we also validate the cross-dataset generality of BMNet and BMNet+ on a car counting dataset CARPK. Code is at tiny.one/BMNet

- **Summary**: Visual dialog has witnessed great progress after introducing various vision-oriented goals into the conversation, especially such as GuessWhich and GuessWhat, where the only image is visible by either and both of the questioner and the answerer, respectively. Researchers explore more on visual dialog tasks in such kind of single- or perfectly co-observable visual scene, while somewhat neglect the exploration on tasks of non perfectly co-observable visual scene, where the images accessed by two agents may not be exactly the same, often occurred in practice. Although building common ground in non-perfectly co-observable visual scene through conversation is significant for advanced dialog agents, the lack of such dialog task and corresponding large-scale dataset makes it impossible to carry out in-depth research. To break this limitation, we propose an object-referring game in non-perfectly co-observable visual scene, where the goal is to spot the difference between the similar visual scenes through conversing in natural language. The task addresses challenges of the dialog strategy in non-perfectly co-observable visual scene and the ability of categorizing objects. Correspondingly, we construct a large-scale multimodal dataset, named SpotDiff, which contains 87k Virtual Reality images and 97k dialogs generated by self-play. Finally, we give benchmark models for this task, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance as well as analyze its main challenges.



### Mixed-Precision Neural Network Quantization via Learned Layer-wise Importance

- **Summary**: The exponentially large discrete search space in mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) makes it hard to determine the optimal bit-width for each layer. Previous works usually resort to iterative search methods on the training set, which consume hundreds or even thousands of GPU-hours. In this study, we reveal that some unique learnable parameters in quantization, namely the scale factors in the quantizer, can serve as importance indicators of a layer, reflecting the contribution of that layer to the final accuracy at certain bit-widths. These importance indicators naturally perceive the numerical transformation during quantization-aware training, which can precisely provide quantization sensitivity metrics of layers. However, a deep network always contains hundreds of such indicators, and training them one by one would lead to an excessive time cost. To overcome this issue, we propose a joint training scheme that can obtain all indicators at once. It considerably speeds up the indicators training process by parallelizing the original sequential training processes. With these learned importance indicators, we formulate the MPQ search problem as a one-time integer linear programming (ILP) problem. That avoids the iterative search and significantly reduces search time without limiting the bit-width search space. For example, MPQ search on ResNet18 with our indicators takes only 0.06 s, which improves time efficiency exponentially compared to iterative search methods. Also, extensive experiments show our approach can achieve SOTA accuracy on ImageNet for far-ranging models with various constraints (e.g., BitOps, compress rate).

- **Summary**: A major limitation in applying deep learning to artificial intelligence (AI) systems is the scarcity of high-quality curated datasets. We investigate strong augmentation based self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to address this problem. Using breast cancer detection as an example, we first identify a mammogram-specific transformation paradigm and then systematically compare four recent SSL methods representing a diversity of approaches. We develop a method to convert a pretrained model from making predictions on uniformly tiled patches to whole images, and an attention-based pooling method that improves the classification performance. We found that the best SSL model substantially outperformed the baseline supervised model. The best SSL model also improved the data efficiency of sample labeling by nearly 4-fold and was highly transferrable from one dataset to another. SSL represents a major breakthrough in computer vision and may help the AI for medical imaging field to shift away from supervised learning and dependency on scarce labels.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are a promising new class of generative models that mark a milestone in high-quality image generation. This paper showcases their ability to sequentially generate video, surpassing prior methods in perceptual and probabilistic forecasting metrics. We propose an autoregressive, end-to-end optimized video diffusion model inspired by recent advances in neural video compression. The model successively generates future frames by correcting a deterministic next-frame prediction using a stochastic residual generated by an inverse diffusion process. We compare this approach against five baselines on four datasets involving natural and simulation-based videos. We find significant improvements in terms of perceptual quality for all datasets. Furthermore, by introducing a scalable version of the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) applicable to video, we show that our model also outperforms existing approaches in their probabilistic frame forecasting ability.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Common image-to-image translation methods rely on joint training over data from both source and target domains. The training process requires concurrent access to both datasets, which hinders data separation and privacy protection; and existing models cannot be easily adapted for translation of new domain pairs. We present Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIBs), an image translation method based on diffusion models, that circumvents training on domain pairs. Image translation with DDIBs relies on two diffusion models trained independently on each domain, and is a two-step process: DDIBs first obtain latent encodings for source images with the source diffusion model, and then decode such encodings using the target model to construct target images. Both steps are defined via ordinary differential equations (ODEs), thus the process is cycle consistent only up to discretization errors of the ODE solvers. Theoretically, we interpret DDIBs as concatenation of source to latent, and latent to target Schrodinger Bridges, a form of entropy-regularized optimal transport, to explain the efficacy of the method. Experimentally, we apply DDIBs on synthetic and high-resolution image datasets, to demonstrate their utility in a wide variety of translation tasks and their inherent optimal transport properties.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently set off a new wave in neural architecture design thanks to their record-breaking performance in various vision tasks. In parallel, to fulfill the goal of deploying ViTs into real-world vision applications, their robustness against potential malicious attacks has gained increasing attention. In particular, recent works show that ViTs are more robust against adversarial attacks as compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and conjecture that this is because ViTs focus more on capturing global interactions among different input/feature patches, leading to their improved robustness to local perturbations imposed by adversarial attacks. In this work, we ask an intriguing question: "Under what kinds of perturbations do ViTs become more vulnerable learners compared to CNNs?" Driven by this question, we first conduct a comprehensive experiment regarding the robustness of both ViTs and CNNs under various existing adversarial attacks to understand the underlying reason favoring their robustness. Based on the drawn insights, we then propose a dedicated attack framework, dubbed Patch-Fool, that fools the self-attention mechanism by attacking its basic component (i.e., a single patch) with a series of attention-aware optimization techniques. Interestingly, our Patch-Fool framework shows for the first time that ViTs are not necessarily more robust than CNNs against adversarial perturbations. In particular, we find that ViTs are more vulnerable learners compared with CNNs against our Patch-Fool attack which is consistent across extensive experiments, and the observations from Sparse/Mild Patch-Fool, two variants of Patch-Fool, indicate an intriguing insight that the perturbation density and strength on each patch seem to be the key factors that influence the robustness ranking between ViTs and CNNs.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Despite the impressive progress of general face detection, the tuning of hyper-parameters and architectures is still critical for the performance of a domain-specific face detector. Though existing AutoML works can speedup such process, they either require tuning from scratch for a new scenario or do not consider data privacy. To scale up, we derive a new AutoML setting from a platform perspective. In such setting, new datasets sequentially arrive at the platform, where an architecture and hyper-parameter configuration is recommended to train the optimal face detector for each dataset. This, however, brings two major challenges: (1) how to predict the best configuration for any given dataset without touching their raw images due to the privacy concern? and (2) how to continuously improve the AutoML algorithm from previous tasks and offer a better warm-up for future ones? We introduce "HyperFD", a new privacy-preserving online AutoML framework for face detection. At its core part, a novel meta-feature representation of a dataset as well as its learning paradigm is proposed. Thanks to HyperFD, each local task (client) is able to effectively leverage the learning "experience" of previous tasks without uploading raw images to the platform; meanwhile, the meta-feature extractor is continuously learned to better trade off the bias and variance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our design.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed a great development of Convolutional Neural Networks in semantic segmentation, where all classes of training images are simultaneously available. In practice, new images are usually made available in a consecutive manner, leading to a problem called Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS). Typically, CSS faces the forgetting problem since previous training images are unavailable, and the semantic shift problem of the background class. Considering the semantic segmentation as a context-dependent pixel-level classification task, we explore CSS from a new perspective of context analysis in this paper. We observe that the context of old-class pixels in the new images is much more biased on new classes than that in the old images, which can sharply aggravate the old-class forgetting and new-class overfitting. To tackle the obstacle, we propose a biased-context-rectified CSS framework with a context-rectified image-duplet learning scheme and a biased-context-insensitive consistency loss. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive re-weighting class-balanced learning strategy for the biased class distribution. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in existing CSS scenarios.

- **Summary**: Accurate and efficient lumbar spine disease identification is crucial for clinical diagnosis. However, existing deep learning models with millions of parameters often fail to learn with only hundreds or dozens of medical images. These models also ignore the contextual relationship between adjacent objects, such as between vertebras and intervertebral discs. This work introduces a multi-scale context-guided network with coarse-to-fine localization and classification, named CCF-Net, for lumbar spine disease identification. Specifically, in learning, we divide the localization objective into two parallel tasks, coarse and fine, which are more straightforward and effectively reduce the number of parameters and computational cost. The experimental results show that the coarse-to-fine design presents the potential to achieve high performance with fewer parameters and data requirements. Moreover, the multi-scale context-guided module can significantly improve the performance by 6.45% and 5.51% with ResNet18 and ResNet50, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/czifan/CCFNet.pytorch.

- **Summary**: Sequence modeling has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on natural language and document understanding tasks. However, it is challenging to correctly serialize tokens in form-like documents in practice due to their variety of layout patterns. We propose FormNet, a structure-aware sequence model to mitigate the suboptimal serialization of forms. First, we design Rich Attention that leverages the spatial relationship between tokens in a form for more precise attention score calculation. Second, we construct Super-Tokens for each word by embedding representations from their neighboring tokens through graph convolutions. FormNet therefore explicitly recovers local syntactic information that may have been lost during serialization. In experiments, FormNet outperforms existing methods with a more compact model size and less pre-training data, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on CORD, FUNSD and Payment benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to discover and localize semantically meaningful categories within image corpora without any form of annotation. To solve this task, algorithms must produce features for every pixel that are both semantically meaningful and compact enough to form distinct clusters. Unlike previous works which achieve this with a single end-to-end framework, we propose to separate feature learning from cluster compactification. Empirically, we show that current unsupervised feature learning frameworks already generate dense features whose correlations are semantically consistent. This observation motivates us to design STEGO ($\textbf{S}$elf-supervised $\textbf{T}$ransformer with $\textbf{E}$nergy-based $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a novel framework that distills unsupervised features into high-quality discrete semantic labels. At the core of STEGO is a novel contrastive loss function that encourages features to form compact clusters while preserving their relationships across the corpora. STEGO yields a significant improvement over the prior state of the art, on both the CocoStuff ($\textbf{+14 mIoU}$) and Cityscapes ($\textbf{+9 mIoU}$) semantic segmentation challenges.

- **Summary**: Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable progress in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), the effective receptive field of CNN is insufficient to capture global context information, leading to sub-optimal results. Inspired by the great success of Transformers in fundamental vision areas, this work for the first time introduces Transformer to build a simple and effective WSSS framework, termed WegFormer. Unlike existing CNN-based methods, WegFormer uses Vision Transformer (ViT) as a classifier to produce high-quality pseudo segmentation masks. To this end, we introduce three tailored components in our Transformer-based framework, which are (1) a Deep Taylor Decomposition (DTD) to generate attention maps, (2) a soft erasing module to smooth the attention maps, and (3) an efficient potential object mining (EPOM) to filter noisy activation in the background. Without any bells and whistles, WegFormer achieves state-of-the-art 70.5% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC dataset, significantly outperforming the previous best method. We hope WegFormer provides a new perspective to tap the potential of Transformer in weakly supervised semantic segmentation. Code will be released.

- **Summary**: Few-shot image generation is a challenging task even using the state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Due to the unstable GAN training process and the limited training data, the generated images are often of low quality and low diversity. In this work, we propose a new editing-based method, i.e., Attribute Group Editing (AGE), for few-shot image generation. The basic assumption is that any image is a collection of attributes and the editing direction for a specific attribute is shared across all categories. AGE examines the internal representation learned in GANs and identifies semantically meaningful directions. Specifically, the class embedding, i.e., the mean vector of the latent codes from a specific category, is used to represent the category-relevant attributes, and the category-irrelevant attributes are learned globally by Sparse Dictionary Learning on the difference between the sample embedding and the class embedding. Given a GAN well trained on seen categories, diverse images of unseen categories can be synthesized through editing category-irrelevant attributes while keeping category-relevant attributes unchanged. Without re-training the GAN, AGE is capable of not only producing more realistic and diverse images for downstream visual applications with limited data but achieving controllable image editing with interpretable category-irrelevant directions.

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework to automatically learn to transform the differential cues from a stack of images densely captured with a rotational motion into spatially discriminative and view-invariant per-pixel features at each view. These low-level features can be directly fed to any existing multi-view stereo technique for enhanced 3D reconstruction. The lighting condition during acquisition can also be jointly optimized in a differentiable fashion. We sample from a dozen of pre-scanned objects with a wide variety of geometry and reflectance to synthesize a large amount of high-quality training data. The effectiveness of our features is demonstrated on a number of challenging objects acquired with a lightstage, comparing favorably with state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we explore additional applications of geometric detail visualization and computational stylization of complex appearance.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have demonstrated prominent capacities for image classification tasks in a closed set setting, where the test data come from the same distribution as the training data. However, in a more realistic open set scenario, traditional classifiers with incomplete knowledge cannot tackle test data that are not from the training classes. Open set recognition (OSR) aims to address this problem by both identifying unknown classes and distinguishing known classes simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to OSR that is based on the vision transformer (ViT) technique. Specifically, our approach employs two separate training stages. First, a ViT model is trained to perform closed set classification. Then, an additional detection head is attached to the embedded features extracted by the ViT, trained to force the representations of known data to class-specific clusters compactly. Test examples are identified as known or unknown based on their distance to the cluster centers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to leverage ViT for the purpose of OSR, and our extensive evaluation against several OSR benchmark datasets reveals that our approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods and obtains new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Emerging high-quality face restoration (FR) methods often utilize pre-trained GAN models (\textit{i.e.}, StyleGAN2) as GAN Prior. However, these methods usually struggle to balance realness and fidelity when facing various degradation levels. Besides, there is still a noticeable visual quality gap compared with pre-trained GAN models. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN Prior based degradation-aware feature interpolation network, dubbed Panini-Net, for FR tasks by explicitly learning the abstract representations to distinguish various degradations. Specifically, an unsupervised degradation representation learning (UDRL) strategy is first developed to extract degradation representations (DR) of the input degraded images. Then, a degradation-aware feature interpolation (DAFI) module is proposed to dynamically fuse the two types of informative features (\textit{i.e.}, features from input images and features from GAN Prior) with flexible adaption to various degradations based on DR. Ablation studies reveal the working mechanism of DAFI and its potential for editable FR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Panini-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance for multi-degradation face restoration and face super-resolution.

- **Summary**: Learned image compression methods have exhibited superior rate-distortion performance than classical image compression standards. Most existing learned image compression models are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Despite great contributions, a main drawback of CNN based model is that its structure is not designed for capturing local redundancy, especially the non-repetitive textures, which severely affects the reconstruction quality. Therefore, how to make full use of both global structure and local texture becomes the core problem for learning-based image compression. Inspired by recent progresses of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer, we found that combining the local-aware attention mechanism with the global-related feature learning could meet the expectation in image compression. In this paper, we first extensively study the effects of multiple kinds of attention mechanisms for local features learning, then introduce a more straightforward yet effective window-based local attention block. The proposed window-based attention is very flexible which could work as a plug-and-play component to enhance CNN and Transformer models. Moreover, we propose a novel Symmetrical TransFormer (STF) framework with absolute transformer blocks in the down-sampling encoder and up-sampling decoder. Extensive experimental evaluations have shown that the proposed method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Googolxx/STF.

- **Summary**: We push forward neural network compression research by exploiting a novel challenging task of large-scale conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) compression. To this end, we propose a gradually shrinking GAN (PPCD-GAN) by introducing progressive pruning residual block (PP-Res) and class-aware distillation. The PP-Res is an extension of the conventional residual block where each convolutional layer is followed by a learnable mask layer to progressively prune network parameters as training proceeds. The class-aware distillation, on the other hand, enhances the stability of training by transferring immense knowledge from a well-trained teacher model through instructive attention maps. We train the pruning and distillation processes simultaneously on a well-known GAN architecture in an end-to-end manner. After training, all redundant parameters as well as the mask layers are discarded, yielding a lighter network while retaining the performance. We comprehensively illustrate, on ImageNet 128x128 dataset, PPCD-GAN reduces up to 5.2x (81%) parameters against state-of-the-arts while keeping better performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we tackle the task of estimating the 3D orientation of previously-unseen objects from monocular images. This task contrasts with the one considered by most existing deep learning methods which typically assume that the testing objects have been observed during training. To handle the unseen objects, we follow a retrieval-based strategy and prevent the network from learning object-specific features by computing multi-scale local similarities between the query image and synthetically-generated reference images. We then introduce an adaptive fusion module that robustly aggregates the local similarities into a global similarity score of pairwise images. Furthermore, we speed up the retrieval process by developing a fast retrieval strategy. Our experiments on the LineMOD, LineMOD-Occluded, and T-LESS datasets show that our method yields a significantly better generalization to unseen objects than previous works. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://sailor-z.github.io/projects/Unseen_Object_Pose.html.

- **Summary**: Collecting and labeling the registered 3D point cloud is costly. As a result, 3D resources for training are typically limited in quantity compared to the 2D images counterpart. In this work, we deal with the data scarcity challenge of 3D tasks by transferring knowledge from strong 2D models via RGB-D images. Specifically, we utilize a strong and well-trained semantic segmentation model for 2D images to augment RGB-D images with pseudo-label. The augmented dataset can then be used to pre-train 3D models. Finally, by simply fine-tuning on a few labeled 3D instances, our method already outperforms existing state-of-the-art that is tailored for 3D label efficiency. We also show that the results of mean-teacher and entropy minimization can be improved by our pre-training, suggesting that the transferred knowledge is helpful in semi-supervised setting. We verify the effectiveness of our approach on two popular 3D models and three different tasks. On ScanNet official evaluation, we establish new state-of-the-art semantic segmentation results on the data-efficient track.

- **Summary**: Visual grounding, i.e., localizing objects in images according to natural language queries, is an important topic in visual language understanding. The most effective approaches for this task are based on deep learning, which generally require expensive manually labeled image-query or patch-query pairs. To eliminate the heavy dependence on human annotations, we present a novel method, named Pseudo-Q, to automatically generate pseudo language queries for supervised training. Our method leverages an off-the-shelf object detector to identify visual objects from unlabeled images, and then language queries for these objects are obtained in an unsupervised fashion with a pseudo-query generation module. Then, we design a task-related query prompt module to specifically tailor generated pseudo language queries for visual grounding tasks. Further, in order to fully capture the contextual relationships between images and language queries, we develop a visual-language model equipped with multi-level cross-modality attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method has two notable benefits: (1) it can reduce human annotation costs significantly, e.g., 31% on RefCOCO without degrading original model's performance under the fully supervised setting, and (2) without bells and whistles, it achieves superior or comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised visual grounding methods on all the five datasets we have experimented.

- **Summary**: Unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation often requires to maximize the mutual information between the source and the translated images across different domains, which is critical for the generator to keep the source content and prevent it from unnecessary modifications. The self-supervised contrastive learning has already been successfully applied in the I2I. By constraining features from the same location to be closer than those from different ones, it implicitly ensures the result to take content from the source. However, previous work uses the features from random locations to impose the constraint, which may not be appropriate since some locations contain less information of source domain. Moreover, the feature itself does not reflect the relation with others. This paper deals with these problems by intentionally selecting significant anchor points for contrastive learning. We design a query-selected attention (QS-Attn) module, which compares feature distances in the source domain, giving an attention matrix with a probability distribution in each row. Then we select queries according to their measurement of significance, computed from the distribution. The selected ones are regarded as anchors for contrastive loss. At the same time, the reduced attention matrix is employed to route features in both domains, so that source relations maintain in the synthesis. We validate our proposed method in three different I2I datasets, showing that it increases the image quality without adding learnable parameters.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion referring to completing 3D shapes from partial 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem for 3D point cloud analysis tasks. Benefiting from the development of deep neural networks, researches on point cloud completion have made great progress in recent years. However, the explicit local region partition like kNNs involved in existing methods makes them sensitive to the density distribution of point clouds. Moreover, it serves limited receptive fields that prevent capturing features from long-range context information. To solve the problems, we leverage the cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms to design novel neural network for processing point cloud in a per-point manner to eliminate kNNs. Two essential blocks Geometric Details Perception (GDP) and Self-Feature Augment (SFA) are proposed to establish the short-range and long-range structural relationships directly among points in a simple yet effective way via attention mechanism. Then based on GDP and SFA, we construct a new framework with popular encoder-decoder architecture for point cloud completion. The proposed framework, namely PointAttN, is simple, neat and effective, which can precisely capture the structural information of 3D shapes and predict complete point clouds with highly detailed geometries. Experimental results demonstrate that our PointAttN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on popular benchmarks like Completion3D and PCN.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a systematic literature review of image datasets for document image analysis, focusing on historical documents, such as handwritten manuscripts and early prints. Finding appropriate datasets for historical document analysis is a crucial prerequisite to facilitate research using different machine learning algorithms. However, because of the very large variety of the actual data (e.g., scripts, tasks, dates, support systems, and amount of deterioration), the different formats for data and label representation, and the different evaluation processes and benchmarks, finding appropriate datasets is a difficult task. This work fills this gap, presenting a meta-study on existing datasets. After a systematic selection process (according to PRISMA guidelines), we select 65 studies that are chosen based on different factors, such as the year of publication, number of methods implemented in the article, reliability of the chosen algorithms, dataset size, and journal outlet. We summarize each study by assigning it to one of three pre-defined tasks: document classification, layout structure, or content analysis. We present the statistics, document type, language, tasks, input visual aspects, and ground truth information for every dataset. In addition, we provide the benchmark tasks and results from these papers or recent competitions. We further discuss gaps and challenges in this domain. We advocate for providing conversion tools to common formats (e.g., COCO format for computer vision tasks) and always providing a set of evaluation metrics, instead of just one, to make results comparable across studies.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work devoted to multi-focus thermal image fusion. For testing of proposed algorithm we acquire six thermal image set with objects at different focal depth.

- **Summary**: The discovery of interpretable directions in the latent spaces of pre-trained GAN models has recently become a popular topic. In particular, StyleGAN2 has enabled various image generation and manipulation tasks due to its rich and disentangled latent spaces. The discovery of such directions is typically done either in a supervised manner, which requires annotated data for each desired manipulation or in an unsupervised manner, which requires a manual effort to identify the directions. As a result, existing work typically finds only a handful of directions in which controllable edits can be made. In this study, we design a novel submodular framework that finds the most representative and diverse subset of directions in the latent space of StyleGAN2. Our approach takes advantage of the latent space of channel-wise style parameters, so-called style space, in which we cluster channels that perform similar manipulations into groups. Our framework promotes diversity by using the notion of clusters and can be efficiently solved with a greedy optimization scheme. We evaluate our framework with qualitative and quantitative experiments and show that our method finds more diverse and disentangled directions.

- **Summary**: Patch attacks, one of the most threatening forms of physical attack in adversarial examples, can lead networks to induce misclassification by modifying pixels arbitrarily in a continuous region. Certifiable patch defense can guarantee robustness that the classifier is not affected by patch attacks. Existing certifiable patch defenses sacrifice the clean accuracy of classifiers and only obtain a low certified accuracy on toy datasets. Furthermore, the clean and certified accuracy of these methods is still significantly lower than the accuracy of normal classification networks, which limits their application in practice. To move towards a practical certifiable patch defense, we introduce Vision Transformer (ViT) into the framework of Derandomized Smoothing (DS). Specifically, we propose a progressive smoothed image modeling task to train Vision Transformer, which can capture the more discriminable local context of an image while preserving the global semantic information. For efficient inference and deployment in the real world, we innovatively reconstruct the global self-attention structure of the original ViT into isolated band unit self-attention. On ImageNet, under 2% area patch attacks our method achieves 41.70% certified accuracy, a nearly 1-fold increase over the previous best method (26.00%). Simultaneously, our method achieves 78.58% clean accuracy, which is quite close to the normal ResNet-101 accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains state-of-the-art clean and certified accuracy with inferring efficiently on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

- **Summary**: Learning to capture human motion is essential to 3D human pose and shape estimation from monocular video. However, the existing methods mainly rely on recurrent or convolutional operation to model such temporal information, which limits the ability to capture non-local context relations of human motion. To address this problem, we propose a motion pose and shape network (MPS-Net) to effectively capture humans in motion to estimate accurate and temporally coherent 3D human pose and shape from a video. Specifically, we first propose a motion continuity attention (MoCA) module that leverages visual cues observed from human motion to adaptively recalibrate the range that needs attention in the sequence to better capture the motion continuity dependencies. Then, we develop a hierarchical attentive feature integration (HAFI) module to effectively combine adjacent past and future feature representations to strengthen temporal correlation and refine the feature representation of the current frame. By coupling the MoCA and HAFI modules, the proposed MPS-Net excels in estimating 3D human pose and shape in the video. Though conceptually simple, our MPS-Net not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmark datasets, but also uses fewer network parameters.

While current literature focuses on fully-supervised performance, developing efficient methods that take advantage of realistic weak supervision have yet to be explored. In this paper, we propose using scribbles to annotate LiDAR point clouds and release ScribbleKITTI, the first scribble-annotated dataset for LiDAR semantic segmentation. Furthermore, we present a pipeline to reduce the performance gap that arises when using such weak annotations. Our pipeline comprises of three stand-alone contributions that can be combined with any LiDAR semantic segmentation model to achieve up to 95.7% of the fully-supervised performance while using only 8% labeled points. Our scribble annotations and code are available at github.com/ouenal/scribblekitti.

- **Summary**: Deep Metric Learning (DML) proposes to learn metric spaces which encode semantic similarities as embedding space distances. These spaces should be transferable to classes beyond those seen during training. Commonly, DML methods task networks to solve contrastive ranking tasks defined over binary class assignments. However, such approaches ignore higher-level semantic relations between the actual classes. This causes learned embedding spaces to encode incomplete semantic context and misrepresent the semantic relation between classes, impacting the generalizability of the learned metric space. To tackle this issue, we propose a language guidance objective for visual similarity learning. Leveraging language embeddings of expert- and pseudo-classnames, we contextualize and realign visual representation spaces corresponding to meaningful language semantics for better semantic consistency. Extensive experiments and ablations provide a strong motivation for our proposed approach and show language guidance offering significant, model-agnostic improvements for DML, achieving competitive and state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn representation spaces on which semantic relations can simply be expressed through predefined distance metrics. Best performing approaches commonly leverage class proxies as sample stand-ins for better convergence and generalization. However, these proxy-methods solely optimize for sample-proxy distances. Given the inherent non-bijectiveness of used distance functions, this can induce locally isotropic sample distributions, leading to crucial semantic context being missed due to difficulties resolving local structures and intraclass relations between samples. To alleviate this problem, we propose non-isotropy regularization ($\mathbb{NIR}$) for proxy-based Deep Metric Learning. By leveraging Normalizing Flows, we enforce unique translatability of samples from their respective class proxies. This allows us to explicitly induce a non-isotropic distribution of samples around a proxy to optimize for. In doing so, we equip proxy-based objectives to better learn local structures. Extensive experiments highlight consistent generalization benefits of $\mathbb{NIR}$ while achieving competitive and state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmarks CUB200-2011, Cars196 and Stanford Online Products. In addition, we find the superior convergence properties of proxy-based methods to still be retained or even improved, making $\mathbb{NIR}$ very attractive for practical usage.

- **Summary**: It is essential for safety-critical applications of deep neural networks to determine when new inputs are significantly different from the training distribution. In this paper, we explore this out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem for image classification using clusters of semantically similar embeddings of the training data and exploit the differences in distance relationships to these clusters between in- and out-of-distribution data. We study the structure and separation of clusters in the embedding space and find that supervised contrastive learning leads to well-separated clusters while its self-supervised counterpart fails to do so. In our extensive analysis of different training methods, clustering strategies, distance metrics, and thresholding approaches, we observe that there is no clear winner. The optimal approach depends on the model architecture and selected datasets for in- and out-of-distribution. While we could reproduce the outstanding results for contrastive training on CIFAR-10 as in-distribution data, we find standard cross-entropy paired with cosine similarity outperforms all contrastive training methods when training on CIFAR-100 instead. Cross-entropy provides competitive results as compared to expensive contrastive training methods.

- **Summary**: Due to the inherent ill-posed nature of 2D-3D projection, monocular 3D object detection lacks accurate depth recovery ability. Although the deep neural network (DNN) enables monocular depth-sensing from high-level learned features, the pixel-level cues are usually omitted due to the deep convolution mechanism. To benefit from both the powerful feature representation in DNN and pixel-level geometric constraints, we reformulate the monocular object depth estimation as a progressive refinement problem and propose a joint semantic and geometric cost volume to model the depth error. Specifically, we first leverage neural networks to learn the object position, dimension, and dense normalized 3D object coordinates. Based on the object depth, the dense coordinates patch together with the corresponding object features is reprojected to the image space to build a cost volume in a joint semantic and geometric error manner. The final depth is obtained by feeding the cost volume to a refinement network, where the distribution of semantic and geometric error is regularized by direct depth supervision. Through effectively mitigating depth error by the refinement framework, we achieve state-of-the-art results on both the KITTI and Waymo datasets.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks have made significant progresses in edge detection by progressively exploring the context and semantic features. However, local details are gradually suppressed with the enlarging of receptive fields. Recently, vision transformer has shown excellent capability in capturing long-range dependencies. Inspired by this, we propose a novel transformer-based edge detector, \emph{Edge Detection TransformER (EDTER)}, to extract clear and crisp object boundaries and meaningful edges by exploiting the full image context information and detailed local cues simultaneously. EDTER works in two stages. In Stage I, a global transformer encoder is used to capture long-range global context on coarse-grained image patches. Then in Stage II, a local transformer encoder works on fine-grained patches to excavate the short-range local cues. Each transformer encoder is followed by an elaborately designed Bi-directional Multi-Level Aggregation decoder to achieve high-resolution features. Finally, the global context and local cues are combined by a Feature Fusion Module and fed into a decision head for edge prediction. Extensive experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, and Multicue demonstrate the superiority of EDTER in comparison with state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Open Set Recognition (OSR) has been an emerging topic. Besides recognizing predefined classes, the system needs to reject the unknowns. Prototype learning is a potential manner to handle the problem, as its ability to improve intra-class compactness of representations is much needed in discrimination between the known and the unknowns. In this work, we propose a novel Prototype Mining And Learning (PMAL) framework. It has a prototype mining mechanism before the phase of optimizing embedding space, explicitly considering two crucial properties, namely high-quality and diversity of the prototype set. Concretely, a set of high-quality candidates are firstly extracted from training samples based on data uncertainty learning, avoiding the interference from unexpected noise. Considering the multifarious appearance of objects even in a single category, a diversity-based strategy for prototype set filtering is proposed. Accordingly, the embedding space can be better optimized to discriminate therein the predefined classes and between known and unknowns. Extensive experiments verify the two good characteristics (i.e., high-quality and diversity) embraced in prototype mining, and show the remarkable performance of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-arts.

We mainly focus on IR image and video sets which are collected and labelled for computer vision applications such as object detection, object segmentation, classification, and motion detection. We categorize 92 different publicly available or private sets according to their sensor types, image resolution, and scale. We describe each and every set in detail regarding their collection purpose, operation environment, optical system properties, and area of application. We also cover a general overview of fundamental concepts that relate to IR imagery, such as IR radiation, IR detectors, IR optics and application fields. We analyse the statistical significance of the entire corpus from different perspectives. We believe that this survey will be a guideline for computer vision and artificial intelligence researchers that are interested in working with the spectra beyond the visible domain.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has improved vanishing point detection in images. Yet, deep networks require expensive annotated datasets trained on costly hardware and do not generalize to even slightly different domains, and minor problem variants. Here, we address these issues by injecting deep vanishing point detection networks with prior knowledge. This prior knowledge no longer needs to be learned from data, saving valuable annotation efforts and compute, unlocking realistic few-sample scenarios, and reducing the impact of domain changes. Moreover, the interpretability of the priors allows to adapt deep networks to minor problem variations such as switching between Manhattan and non-Manhattan worlds. We seamlessly incorporate two geometric priors: (i) Hough Transform -- mapping image pixels to straight lines, and (ii) Gaussian sphere -- mapping lines to great circles whose intersections denote vanishing points. Experimentally, we ablate our choices and show comparable accuracy to existing models in the large-data setting. We validate our model's improved data efficiency, robustness to domain changes, adaptability to non-Manhattan settings.

- **Summary**: Generating artistic portraits is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing portrait stylization models that generate good quality results are based on Image-to-Image Translation and require abundant data from both source and target domains. However, without enough data, these methods would result in overfitting. In this work, we propose CtlGAN, a new few-shot artistic portraits generation model with a novel contrastive transfer learning strategy. We adapt a pretrained StyleGAN in the source domain to a target artistic domain with no more than 10 artistic faces. To reduce overfitting to the few training examples, we introduce a novel Cross-Domain Triplet loss which explicitly encourages the target instances generated from different latent codes to be distinguishable. We propose a new encoder which embeds real faces into Z+ space and proposes a dual-path training strategy to better cope with the adapted decoder and eliminate the artifacts. Extensive qualitative, quantitative comparisons and a user study show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts under 10-shot and 1-shot settings and generates high quality artistic portraits. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Tuning of measurement models is challenging in real-world applications of sequential Monte Carlo methods. Recent advances in differentiable particle filters have led to various efforts to learn measurement models through neural networks. But existing approaches in the differentiable particle filter framework do not admit valid probability densities in constructing measurement models, leading to incorrect quantification of the measurement uncertainty given state information. We propose to learn expressive and valid probability densities in measurement models through conditional normalizing flows, to capture the complex likelihood of measurements given states. We show that the proposed approach leads to improved estimation performance and faster training convergence in a visual tracking experiment.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a deformable object is considered for cameras deployment with the aim of visual coverage. The object contour is discretized into sampled points as meshes, and the deformation is represented as continuous trajectories for the sampled points. To reduce the computational complexity, some feature points are carefully selected representing the continuous deformation process, and the visual coverage for the deformable object is transferred to cover the specific feature points. In particular, the vertexes of a rectangle that can contain the entire deformation trajectory of every sampled point on the object contour are chosen as the feature points. An improved wolf pack algorithm is then proposed to solve the optimization problem. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deployment method of camera network.

- **Summary**: Friction Stir Welding is a robust joining process, and numerous AI-based algorithms are being developed in this field to enhance mechanical and microstructure properties. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are Artificial Neural Networks that use image data as input. Identical to Artificial Neural Networks, they are composed of weights that are determined throughout learning, neurons (activated functions), and a goal (loss function). CNN is utilized in a variety of applications, including image recognition, semantic segmentation, image recognition, and localization. Utilizing training on 3000 microstructure pictures and new tests on 300 microstructure photographs, the current work investigates the predictions of Friction Stir Welded joint effectiveness using microstructure images.

- **Summary**: In video coding, in-loop filters are applied on reconstructed video frames to enhance their perceptual quality, before storing the frames for output. Conventional in-loop filters are obtained by hand-crafted methods. Recently, learned filters based on convolutional neural networks that utilize attention mechanisms have been shown to improve upon traditional techniques. However, these solutions are typically significantly more computationally expensive, limiting their potential for practical applications. The proposed method uses a novel combination of sparsity and structured pruning for complexity reduction of learned in-loop filters. This is done through a three-step training process of magnitude-guidedweight pruning, insignificant neuron identification and removal, and fine-tuning. Through initial tests we find that network parameters can be significantly reduced with a minimal impact on network performance.

- **Summary**: Deep Implicit Functions (DIFs) represent 3D geometry with continuous signed distance functions learned through deep neural nets. Recently DIFs-based methods have been proposed to handle shape reconstruction and dense point correspondences simultaneously, capturing semantic relationships across shapes of the same class by learning a DIFs-modeled shape template. These methods provide great flexibility and accuracy in reconstructing 3D shapes and inferring correspondences. However, the point correspondences built from these methods do not intrinsically preserve the topology of the shapes, unlike mesh-based template matching methods. This limits their applications on 3D geometries where underlying topological structures exist and matter, such as anatomical structures in medical images. In this paper, we propose a new model called Neural Diffeomorphic Flow (NDF) to learn deep implicit shape templates, representing shapes as conditional diffeomorphic deformations of templates, intrinsically preserving shape topologies. The diffeomorphic deformation is realized by an auto-decoder consisting of Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) blocks that progressively map shapes to implicit templates. We conduct extensive experiments on several medical image organ segmentation datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of NDF on reconstructing and aligning shapes. NDF achieves consistently state-of-the-art organ shape reconstruction and registration results in both accuracy and quality.

- **Summary**: Non-line-of-sight reconstruction (NLoS) is a novel indirect imaging modality that aims to recover objects or scene parts outside the field of view from measurements of light that is indirectly scattered off a directly visible, diffuse wall. Despite recent advances in acquisition and reconstruction techniques, the well-posedness of the problem at large, and the recoverability of objects and their shapes in particular, remains an open question. The commonly employed Fermat path criterion is rather conservative with this regard, as it classifies some surfaces as unrecoverable, although they contribute to the signal.   In this paper, we use a simpler necessary criterion for an opaque surface patch to be recoverable. Such piece of surface must be directly visible from some point on the wall, and it must occlude the space behind itself. Inspired by recent advances in neural implicit representations, we devise a new representation and reconstruction technique for NLoS scenes that unifies the treatment of recoverability with the reconstruction itself. Our approach, which we validate on various synthetic and experimental datasets, exhibits interesting properties. Unlike memory-inefficient volumetric representations, ours allows to infer adaptively tessellated surfaces from time-of-flight measurements of moderate resolution. It can further recover features beyond the Fermat path criterion, and it is robust to significant amounts of self-occlusion. We believe that this is the first time that these properties have been achieved in one system that, as an additional benefit, is trainable and hence suited for data-driven approaches.

- **Summary**: With the development of deep convolutional neural networks, medical image segmentation has achieved a series of breakthroughs in recent years. However, the high-performance convolutional neural networks always mean numerous parameters and high computation costs, which will hinder the applications in clinical scenarios. Meanwhile, the scarceness of large-scale annotated medical image datasets further impedes the application of high-performance networks. To tackle these problems, we propose Graph Flow, a comprehensive knowledge distillation framework, for both network-efficiency and annotation-efficiency medical image segmentation. Specifically, our core Graph Flow Distillation transfer the essence of cross-layer variations from a well-trained cumbersome teacher network to a non-trained compact student network. In addition, an unsupervised Paraphraser Module is integrated to purify the knowledge of the teacher network, which is also beneficial for the stabilization of training procedure. Furthermore, we build a unified distillation framework by integrating the adversarial distillation and the vanilla logits distillation, which can further refine the final predictions of the compact network. With different teacher networks (conventional convolutional architecture or prevalent transformer architecture) and student networks, we conduct extensive experiments on four medical image datasets with different modalities (Gastric Cancer, Synapse, BUSI, and CVC-ClinicDB).We demonstrate the prominent ability of our method which achieves competitive performance on these datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our Graph Flow through a novel semi-supervised paradigm for dual efficient medical image segmentation. Our code will be available at Graph Flow.

- **Summary**: The surgical operating room (OR) presents many opportunities for automation and optimization. Videos from various sources in the OR are becoming increasingly available. The medical community seeks to leverage this wealth of data to develop automated methods to advance interventional care, lower costs, and improve overall patient outcomes. Existing datasets from OR room cameras are thus far limited in size or modalities acquired, leaving it unclear which sensor modalities are best suited for tasks such as recognizing surgical action from videos. This study demonstrates that surgical action recognition performance can vary depending on the image modalities used. We perform a methodical analysis on several commonly available sensor modalities, presenting two fusion approaches that improve classification performance. The analyses are carried out on a set of multi-view RGB-D video recordings of 18 laparoscopic procedures.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art distillation methods are mainly based on distilling deep features from intermediate layers, while the significance of logit distillation is greatly overlooked. To provide a novel viewpoint to study logit distillation, we reformulate the classical KD loss into two parts, i.e., target class knowledge distillation (TCKD) and non-target class knowledge distillation (NCKD). We empirically investigate and prove the effects of the two parts: TCKD transfers knowledge concerning the "difficulty" of training samples, while NCKD is the prominent reason why logit distillation works. More importantly, we reveal that the classical KD loss is a coupled formulation, which (1) suppresses the effectiveness of NCKD and (2) limits the flexibility to balance these two parts. To address these issues, we present Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), enabling TCKD and NCKD to play their roles more efficiently and flexibly. Compared with complex feature-based methods, our DKD achieves comparable or even better results and has better training efficiency on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO datasets for image classification and object detection tasks. This paper proves the great potential of logit distillation, and we hope it will be helpful for future research. The code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/mdistiller.

- **Summary**: Due to the amount of videos and related captions uploaded every hour, deep learning-based solutions for cross-modal video retrieval are attracting more and more attention. A typical approach consists in learning a joint text-video embedding space, where the similarity of a video and its associated caption is maximized, whereas a lower similarity is enforced with all the other captions, called negatives. This approach assumes that only the video and caption pairs in the dataset are valid, but different captions - positives - may also describe its visual contents, hence some of them may be wrongly penalized. To address this shortcoming, we propose the Relevance-Aware Negatives and Positives mining (RANP) which, based on the semantics of the negatives, improves their selection while also increasing the similarity of other valid positives. We explore the influence of these techniques on two video-text datasets: EPIC-Kitchens-100 and MSR-VTT. By using the proposed techniques, we achieve considerable improvements in terms of nDCG and mAP, leading to state-of-the-art results, e.g. +5.3% nDCG and +3.0% mAP on EPIC-Kitchens-100.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a simple baseline framework for video-based 2D/3D human pose estimation that can achieve 10 times efficiency improvement over existing works without any performance degradation, named DeciWatch. Unlike current solutions that estimate each frame in a video, DeciWatch introduces a simple yet effective sample-denoise-recover framework that only watches sparsely sampled frames, taking advantage of the continuity of human motions and the lightweight pose representation. Specifically, DeciWatch uniformly samples less than 10% video frames for detailed estimation, denoises the estimated 2D/3D poses with an efficient Transformer architecture, and then accurately recovers the rest of the frames using another Transformer-based network. Comprehensive experimental results on three video-based human pose estimation and body mesh recovery tasks with four datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of DeciWatch.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised Learning (SSL) including the mainstream contrastive learning has achieved great success in learning visual representations without data annotations. However, most methods mainly focus on the instance level information (\ie, the different augmented images of the same instance should have the same feature or cluster into the same class), but there is a lack of attention on the relationships between different instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel SSL paradigm, which we term as relational self-supervised learning (ReSSL) framework that learns representations by modeling the relationship between different instances. Specifically, our proposed method employs sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities among different instances as \textit{relation} metric, which is thus utilized to match the feature embeddings of different augmentations. To boost the performance, we argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more reliable relation, and leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency. The designed asymmetric predictor head and an InfoNCE warm-up strategy enhance the robustness to hyper-parameters and benefit the resulting performance. Experimental results show that our proposed ReSSL substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across different network architectures, including various lightweight networks (\eg, EfficientNet and MobileNet).

- **Summary**: A recent line of work on black-box adversarial attacks has revived the use of transfer from surrogate models by integrating it into query-based search. However, we find that existing approaches of this type underperform their potential, and can be overly complicated besides. Here, we provide a short and simple algorithm which achieves state-of-the-art results through a search which uses the surrogate network's class-score gradients, with no need for other priors or heuristics. The guiding assumption of the algorithm is that the studied networks are in a fundamental sense learning similar functions, and that a transfer attack from one to the other should thus be fairly "easy". This assumption is validated by the extremely low query counts and failure rates achieved: e.g. an untargeted attack on a VGG-16 ImageNet network using a ResNet-152 as the surrogate yields a median query count of 6 at a success rate of 99.9%.

- **Summary**: We establish a connection between tangles, a concept from structural graph theory that plays a central role in Robertson and Seymour's graph minor project, and hierarchical clustering. Tangles cannot only be defined for graphs, but in fact for arbitrary connectivity functions, which are functions defined on the subsets of some finite universe. In typical clustering applications these universes consist of points in some metric space. Connectivity functions are usually required to be submodular. It is our first contribution to show that the central duality theorem connecting tangles with hierarchical decompositions (so-called branch decompositions) also holds if submodularity is replaced by a different property that we call maximum-submodular. We then define a connectivity function on finite data sets in an arbitrary metric space and prove that its tangles are in one-to-one correspondence with the clusters obtained by applying the well-known single linkage clustering algorithms to the same data set. Lastly we generalize this correspondence for any hierarchical clustering. We show that the data structure that represents hierarchical clustering results, called dendograms, are equivalent to maximum-submodular connectivity functions and their tangles. The idea of viewing tangles as clusters has first been proposed by Diestel and Whittle in 2016 as an approach to image segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first that establishes a precise technical connection between tangles and clusters.

- **Summary**: The efficient, automated search for well-performing neural architectures (NAS) has drawn increasing attention in the recent past. Thereby, the predominant research objective is to reduce the necessity of costly evaluations of neural architectures while efficiently exploring large search spaces. To this aim, surrogate models embed architectures in a latent space and predict their performance, while generative models for neural architectures enable optimization-based search within the latent space the generator draws from. Both, surrogate and generative models, have the aim of facilitating query-efficient search in a well-structured latent space. In this paper, we further improve the trade-off between query-efficiency and promising architecture generation by leveraging advantages from both, efficient surrogate models and generative design. To this end, we propose a generative model, paired with a surrogate predictor, that iteratively learns to generate samples from increasingly promising latent subspaces. This approach leads to very effective and efficient architecture search, while keeping the query amount low. In addition, our approach allows in a straightforward manner to jointly optimize for multiple objectives such as accuracy and hardware latency. We show the benefit of this approach not only w.r.t. the optimization of architectures for highest classification accuracy but also in the context of hardware constraints and outperform state-of-the-art methods on several NAS benchmarks for single and multiple objectives. We also achieve state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet. The code is available at http://github.com/jovitalukasik/AG-Net .

- **Summary**: Although many fields have witnessed the superior performance brought about by deep learning, the robustness of neural networks remains an open issue. Specifically, a small adversarial perturbation on the input may cause the model to produce a completely different output. Such poor robustness implies many potential hazards, especially in security-critical applications, e.g., autonomous driving and mobile robotics. This work studies what information the adversarially trained model focuses on. Empirically, we notice that the differences between the clean and adversarial data are mainly distributed in the low-frequency region. We then find that an adversarially-trained model is more robust than its naturally-trained counterpart due to the reason that the former pays more attention to learning the dominant information in low-frequency components. In addition, we consider two common ways to improve model robustness, namely, by data augmentation and by using stronger network architectures, and understand these techniques from a frequency-domain perspective. We are hopeful this work can shed light on the design of more robust neural networks.

- **Summary**: De novo peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data is an important method for protein identification. Recently, various deep learning approaches were applied for de novo peptide sequencing and DeepNovoV2 is one of the represetative models. In this study, we proposed an enhanced model, DePS, which can improve the accuracy of de novo peptide sequencing even with missing signal peaks or large number of noisy peaks in tandem mass spectrometry data. It is showed that, for the same test set of DeepNovoV2, the DePS model achieved excellent results of 74.22%, 74.21% and 41.68% for amino acid recall, amino acid precision and peptide recall respectively. Furthermore, the results suggested that DePS outperforms DeepNovoV2 on the cross species dataset.

- **Summary**: Training of object detection models using less data is currently the focus of existing N-shot learning models in computer vision. Such methods use object-level labels and takes hours to train on unseen classes. There are many cases where we have large amount of image-level labels available for training but cannot be utilized by few shot object detection models for training. There is a need for a machine learning framework that can be used for training any unseen class and can become useful in real-time situations. In this paper, we proposed an "Unseen Class Detector" that can be trained within a very short time for any possible unseen class without bounding boxes with competitive accuracy. We build our approach on "Strong" and "Weak" baseline detectors, which we trained on existing object detection and image classification datasets, respectively. Unseen concepts are fine-tuned on the strong baseline detector using only image-level labels and further adapted by transferring the classifier-detector knowledge between baselines. We use semantic as well as visual similarities to identify the source class (i.e. Sheep) for the fine-tuning and adaptation of unseen class (i.e. Goat). Our model (UnseenNet) is trained on the ImageNet classification dataset for unseen classes and tested on an object detection dataset (OpenImages). UnseenNet improves the mean average precision (mAP) by 10% to 30% over existing baselines (semi-supervised and few-shot) of object detection on different unseen class splits. Moreover, training time of our model is <10 min for each unseen class. Qualitative results demonstrate that UnseenNet is suitable not only for few classes of Pascal VOC but for unseen classes of any dataset or web.

- **Summary**: In computer vision, pre-training models based on largescale supervised learning have been proven effective over the past few years. However, existing works mostly focus on learning from individual task with single data source (e.g., ImageNet for classification or COCO for detection). This restricted form limits their generalizability and usability due to the lack of vast semantic information from various tasks and data sources. Here, we demonstrate that jointly learning from heterogeneous tasks and multiple data sources contributes to universal visual representation, leading to better transferring results of various downstream tasks. Thus, learning how to bridge the gaps among different tasks and data sources is the key, but it still remains an open question. In this work, we propose a representation learning framework called X-Learner, which learns the universal feature of multiple vision tasks supervised by various sources, with expansion and squeeze stage: 1) Expansion Stage: X-Learner learns the task-specific feature to alleviate task interference and enrich the representation by reconciliation layer. 2) Squeeze Stage: X-Learner condenses the model to a reasonable size and learns the universal and generalizable representation for various tasks transferring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Learner achieves strong performance on different tasks without extra annotations, modalities and computational costs compared to existing representation learning methods. Notably, a single X-Learner model shows remarkable gains of 3.0%, 3.3% and 1.8% over current pretrained models on 12 downstream datasets for classification, object detection and semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: As the quality of few shot facial animation from landmarks increases, new applications become possible, such as ultra low bandwidth video chat compression with a high degree of realism. However, there are some important challenges to tackle in order to improve the experience in real world conditions. In particular, the current approaches fail to represent profile views without distortions, while running in a low compute regime. We focus on this key problem by introducing a multi-frames embedding dubbed Frontalizer to improve profile views rendering. In addition to this core improvement, we explore the learning of a latent code conditioning generations along with landmarks to better convey facial expressions. Our dense models achieves 22% of improvement in perceptual quality and 73% reduction of landmark error over the first order model baseline on a subset of DFDC videos containing head movements. Declined with mobile architectures, our models outperform the previous state-of-the-art (improving perceptual quality by more than 16% and reducing landmark error by more than 47% on two datasets) while running on real time on iPhone 8 with very low bandwidth requirements.

- **Summary**: Despite the enormous success of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in many disciplines, the characterization of their computations and the origin of key properties such as generalization and robustness remain open questions. Recent literature suggests that robust networks with good generalization properties tend to be biased towards processing low frequencies in images. To explore the frequency bias hypothesis further, we develop an algorithm that allows us to learn modulatory masks highlighting the essential input frequencies needed for preserving a trained network's performance. We achieve this by imposing invariance in the loss with respect to such modulations in the input frequencies. We first use our method to test the low-frequency preference hypothesis of adversarially trained or data-augmented networks. Our results suggest that adversarially robust networks indeed exhibit a low-frequency bias but we find this bias is also dependent on directions in frequency space. However, this is not necessarily true for other types of data augmentation. Our results also indicate that the essential frequencies in question are effectively the ones used to achieve generalization in the first place. Surprisingly, images seen through these modulatory masks are not recognizable and resemble texture-like patterns.

- **Summary**: The promise of self-supervised learning (SSL) is to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to solve complex tasks. While there has been excellent progress with simple, image-level learning, recent methods have shown the advantage of including knowledge of image structure. However, by introducing hand-crafted image segmentations to define regions of interest, or specialized augmentation strategies, these methods sacrifice the simplicity and generality that makes SSL so powerful. Instead, we propose a self-supervised learning paradigm that discovers this image structure by itself. Our method, Odin, couples object discovery and representation networks to discover meaningful image segmentations without any supervision. The resulting learning paradigm is simpler, less brittle, and more general, and achieves state-of-the-art transfer learning results for object detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on PASCAL and Cityscapes, while strongly surpassing supervised pre-training for video segmentation on DAVIS.

- **Summary**: There has been significant progress in machine learning algorithms for human pose estimation that may provide immense value in rehabilitation and movement sciences. However, there remain several challenges to routine use of these tools for clinical practice and translational research, including: 1) high technical barrier to entry, 2) rapidly evolving space of algorithms, 3) challenging algorithmic interdependencies, and 4) complex data management requirements between these components. To mitigate these barriers, we developed a human pose estimation pipeline that facilitates running state-of-the-art algorithms on data acquired in clinical context. Our system allows for running different implementations of several classes of algorithms and handles their interdependencies easily. These algorithm classes include subject identification and tracking, 2D keypoint detection, 3D joint location estimation, and estimating the pose of body models. The system uses a database to manage videos, intermediate analyses, and data for computations at each stage. It also provides tools for data visualization, including generating video overlays that also obscure faces to enhance privacy. Our goal in this work is not to train new algorithms, but to advance the use of cutting-edge human pose estimation algorithms for clinical and translation research. We show that this tool facilitates analyzing large numbers of videos of human movement ranging from gait laboratories analyses, to clinic and therapy visits, to people in the community. We also highlight limitations of these algorithms when applied to clinical populations in a rehabilitation setting.

- **Summary**: Boundaries are among the primary visual cues used by human and computer vision systems. One of the key problems in boundary detection is the label representation, which typically leads to class imbalance and, as a consequence, to thick boundaries that require non-differential post-processing steps to be thinned. In this paper, we re-interpret boundaries as 1-D surfaces and formulate a one-to-one vector transform function that allows for training of boundary prediction completely avoiding the class imbalance issue. Specifically, we define the boundary representation at any point as the unit vector pointing to the closest boundary surface. Our problem formulation leads to the estimation of direction as well as richer contextual information of the boundary, and, if desired, the availability of zero-pixel thin boundaries also at training time. Our method uses no hyper-parameter in the training loss and a fixed stable hyper-parameter at inference. We provide theoretical justification/discussions of the vector transform representation. We evaluate the proposed loss method using a standard architecture and show the excellent performance over other losses and representations on several datasets.

- **Summary**: Machine-vision-based defect classification techniques have been widely adopted for automatic quality inspection in manufacturing processes. This article describes a general framework for classifying defects from high volume data batches with efficient inspection of unlabelled samples. The concept is to construct a detector to identify new defect types, send them to the inspection station for labelling, and dynamically update the classifier in an efficient manner that reduces both storage and computational needs imposed by data samples of previously observed batches. Both a simulation study on image classification and a case study on surface defect detection via 3D point clouds are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: With a video data source, such as multispectral video acquired during administration of fluorescent tracers, extraction of time-resolved data typically requires the compensation of motion. While this can be done manually, which is arduous, or using off-the-shelf object tracking software, which often yields unsatisfactory performance, we present an algorithm which is simple and performant. Most importantly, we provide an open-source implementation, with an easy-to-use interface for researchers not inclined to write their own code, as well as Python modules that can be used programmatically.

- **Summary**: With the increasing demand for deep learning models on mobile devices, splitting neural network computation between the device and a more powerful edge server has become an attractive solution. However, existing split computing approaches often underperform compared to a naive baseline of remote computation on compressed data. Recent studies propose learning compressed representations that contain more relevant information for supervised downstream tasks, showing improved tradeoffs between compressed data size and supervised performance. However, existing evaluation metrics only provide an incomplete picture of split computing. This study introduces supervised compression for split computing (SC2) and proposes new evaluation criteria: minimizing computation on the mobile device, minimizing transmitted data size, and maximizing model accuracy. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark study using 10 baseline methods, three computer vision tasks, and over 180 trained models, and discuss various aspects of SC2. We also release sc2bench, a Python package for future research on SC2. Our proposed metrics and package will help researchers better understand the tradeoffs of supervised compression in split computing.

- **Summary**: Uncertainty estimation in deep learning has become a leading research field in medical image analysis due to the need for safe utilisation of AI algorithms in clinical practice. Most approaches for uncertainty estimation require sampling the network weights multiple times during testing or training multiple networks. This leads to higher training and testing costs in terms of time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose Layer Ensembles, a novel uncertainty estimation method that uses a single network and requires only a single pass to estimate predictive uncertainty of a network. Moreover, we introduce an image-level uncertainty metric, which is more beneficial for segmentation tasks compared to the commonly used pixel-wise metrics such as entropy and variance. We evaluate our approach on 2D and 3D, binary and multi-class medical image segmentation tasks. Our method shows competitive results with state-of-the-art Deep Ensembles, requiring only a single network and a single pass.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation (SS) aims to classify each pixel into one of the pre-defined classes. This task plays an important role in self-driving cars and autonomous drones. In SS, many works have shown that most misclassified pixels are commonly near object boundaries with high uncertainties. However, existing SS loss functions are not tailored to handle these uncertain pixels during training, as these pixels are usually treated equally as confidently classified pixels and cannot be embedded with arbitrary low distortion in Euclidean space, thereby degenerating the performance of SS. To overcome this problem, this paper designs a "Hyperbolic Uncertainty Loss" (HyperUL), which dynamically highlights the misclassified and high-uncertainty pixels in Hyperbolic space during training via the hyperbolic distances. The proposed HyperUL is model agnostic and can be easily applied to various neural architectures. After employing HyperUL to three recent SS models, the experimental results on Cityscapes and UAVid datasets reveal that the segmentation performance of existing SS models can be consistently improved.

- **Summary**: We introduce the Satellite Neural Radiance Field (Sat-NeRF), a new end-to-end model for learning multi-view satellite photogrammetry in the wild. Sat-NeRF combines some of the latest trends in neural rendering with native satellite camera models, represented by rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) functions. The proposed method renders new views and infers surface models of similar quality to those obtained with traditional state-of-the-art stereo pipelines. Multi-date images exhibit significant changes in appearance, mainly due to varying shadows and transient objects (cars, vegetation). Robustness to these challenges is achieved by a shadow-aware irradiance model and uncertainty weighting to deal with transient phenomena that cannot be explained by the position of the sun. We evaluate Sat-NeRF using WorldView-3 images from different locations and stress the advantages of applying a bundle adjustment to the satellite camera models prior to training. This boosts the network performance and can optionally be used to extract additional cues for depth supervision.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks are the de facto models for image recognition. However 3D CNNs, the straight forward extension of 2D CNNs for video recognition, have not achieved the same success on standard action recognition benchmarks. One of the main reasons for this reduced performance of 3D CNNs is the increased computational complexity requiring large scale annotated datasets to train them in scale. 3D kernel factorization approaches have been proposed to reduce the complexity of 3D CNNs. Existing kernel factorization approaches follow hand-designed and hard-wired techniques. In this paper we propose Gate-Shift-Fuse (GSF), a novel spatio-temporal feature extraction module which controls interactions in spatio-temporal decomposition and learns to adaptively route features through time and combine them in a data dependent manner. GSF leverages grouped spatial gating to decompose input tensor and channel weighting to fuse the decomposed tensors. GSF can be inserted into existing 2D CNNs to convert them into an efficient and high performing spatio-temporal feature extractor, with negligible parameter and compute overhead. We perform an extensive analysis of GSF using two popular 2D CNN families and achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on five standard action recognition benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The assessment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) severity on knee X-rays is a central criteria for the use of total knee arthroplasty. However, this assessment suffers from imprecise standards and a remarkably high inter-reader variability. An algorithmic, automated assessment of KOA severity could improve overall outcomes of knee replacement procedures by increasing the appropriateness of its use. We propose a novel deep learning-based five-step algorithm to automatically grade KOA from posterior-anterior (PA) views of radiographs: (1) image preprocessing (2) localization of knees joints in the image using the YOLO v3-Tiny model, (3) initial assessment of the severity of osteoarthritis using a convolutional neural network-based classifier, (4) segmentation of the joints and calculation of the joint space narrowing (JSN), and (5), a combination of the JSN and the initial assessment to determine a final Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) score. Furthermore, by displaying the segmentation masks used to make the assessment, our algorithm demonstrates a higher degree of transparency compared to typical "black box" deep learning classifiers. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using two public datasets and one dataset from our institution, and show that our algorithm reaches state-of-the art performance. Moreover, we also collected ratings from multiple radiologists at our institution and showed that our algorithm performs at the radiologist level.   The software has been made publicly available at https://github.com/MaciejMazurowski/osteoarthritis-classification.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved great success on image super-resolution (SR). However, most deep CNN-based SR models take massive computations to obtain high performance. Downsampling features for multi-resolution fusion is an efficient and effective way to improve the performance of visual recognition. Still, it is counter-intuitive in the SR task, which needs to project a low-resolution input to high-resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Pixel-Unshuffled Network (HPUN) by introducing an efficient and effective downsampling module into the SR task. The network contains pixel-unshuffled downsampling and Self-Residual Depthwise Separable Convolutions. Specifically, we utilize pixel-unshuffle operation to downsample the input features and use grouped convolution to reduce the channels. Besides, we enhance the depthwise convolution's performance by adding the input feature to its output. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our HPUN achieves and surpasses the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance with fewer parameters and computation costs.

- **Summary**: Super-resolution (SR) has become a widely researched topic in recent years. SR methods can improve overall image and video quality and create new possibilities for further content analysis. But the SR mainstream focuses primarily on increasing the naturalness of the resulting image despite potentially losing context accuracy. Such methods may produce an incorrect digit, character, face, or other structural object even though they otherwise yield good visual quality. Incorrect detail restoration can cause errors when detecting and identifying objects both manually and automatically. To analyze the detail-restoration capabilities of image and video SR models, we developed a benchmark based on our own video dataset, which contains complex patterns that SR models generally fail to correctly restore. We assessed 32 recent SR models using our benchmark and compared their ability to preserve scene context. We also conducted a crowd-sourced comparison of restored details and developed an objective assessment metric that outperforms other quality metrics by correlation with subjective scores for this task. In conclusion, we provide a deep analysis of benchmark results that yields insights for future SR-based work.

- **Summary**: While popular televised events such as presidential debates or TV shows are airing, people provide commentary on them in real-time. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to combine social media commentary and videos to create a multimedia summary of televised events. Our approach identifies scenes from these events based on spikes of mentions of people involved in the event and automatically selects tweets and frames from the videos that occur during the time period of the spike that talk about and show the people being discussed.

- **Summary**: Temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) aims to estimate temporal intervals of actions in untrimmed videos, which is a challenging yet plays an important role in many tasks of video analysis and understanding. Despite the great achievement in TAPG, most existing works ignore the human perception of interaction between agents and the surrounding environment by applying a deep learning model as a black-box to the untrimmed videos to extract video visual representation. Therefore, it is beneficial and potentially improve the performance of TAPG if we can capture these interactions between agents and the environment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Agent-Aware Boundary Network (ABN), which consists of two sub-networks (i) an Agent-Aware Representation Network to obtain both agent-agent and agents-environment relationships in the video representation, and (ii) a Boundary Generation Network to estimate the confidence score of temporal intervals. In the Agent-Aware Representation Network, the interactions between agents are expressed through local pathway, which operates at a local level to focus on the motions of agents whereas the overall perception of the surroundings are expressed through global pathway, which operates at a global level to perceive the effects of agents-environment. Comprehensive evaluations on 20-action THUMOS-14 and 200-action ActivityNet-1.3 datasets with different backbone networks (i.e C3D, SlowFast and Two-Stream) show that our proposed ABN robustly outperforms state-of-the-art methods regardless of the employed backbone network on TAPG. We further examine the proposal quality by leveraging proposals generated by our method onto temporal action detection (TAD) frameworks and evaluate their detection performances.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successful in solving tasks in computer vision including medical image segmentation due to their ability to automatically extract features from unstructured data. However, CNNs are sensitive to rotation and affine transformation and their success relies on huge-scale labeled datasets capturing various input variations. This network paradigm has posed challenges at scale because acquiring annotated data for medical segmentation is expensive, and strict privacy regulations. Furthermore, visual representation learning with CNNs has its own flaws, e.g., it is arguable that the pooling layer in traditional CNNs tends to discard positional information and CNNs tend to fail on input images that differ in orientations and sizes. Capsule network (CapsNet) is a recent new architecture that has achieved better robustness in representation learning by replacing pooling layers with dynamic routing and convolutional strides, which has shown potential results on popular tasks such as classification, recognition, segmentation, and natural language processing. Different from CNNs, which result in scalar outputs, CapsNet returns vector outputs, which aim to preserve the part-whole relationships. In this work, we first introduce the limitations of CNNs and fundamentals of CapsNet. We then provide recent developments of CapsNet for the task of medical image segmentation. We finally discuss various effective network architectures to implement a CapsNet for both 2D images and 3D volumetric medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods have been successful in solving tasks in machine learning and have made breakthroughs in many sectors owing to their ability to automatically extract features from unstructured data. However, their performance relies on manual trial-and-error processes for selecting an appropriate network architecture, hyperparameters for training, and pre-/post-procedures. Even though it has been shown that network architecture plays a critical role in learning feature representation feature from data and the final performance, searching for the best network architecture is computationally intensive and heavily relies on researchers' experience. Automated machine learning (AutoML) and its advanced techniques i.e. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have been promoted to address those limitations. Not only in general computer vision tasks, but NAS has also motivated various applications in multiple areas including medical imaging. In medical imaging, NAS has significant progress in improving the accuracy of image classification, segmentation, reconstruction, and more. However, NAS requires the availability of large annotated data, considerable computation resources, and pre-defined tasks. To address such limitations, meta-learning has been adopted in the scenarios of few-shot learning and multiple tasks. In this book chapter, we first present a brief review of NAS by discussing well-known approaches in search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. We then introduce various NAS approaches in medical imaging with different applications such as classification, segmentation, detection, reconstruction, etc. Meta-learning in NAS for few-shot learning and multiple tasks is then explained. Finally, we describe several open problems in NAS.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel neural network training framework that increases model's adversarial robustness to adversarial attacks while maintaining high clean accuracy by combining contrastive learning (CL) with adversarial training (AT). We propose to improve model robustness to adversarial attacks by learning feature representations that are consistent under both data augmentations and adversarial perturbations. We leverage contrastive learning to improve adversarial robustness by considering an adversarial example as another positive example, and aim to maximize the similarity between random augmentations of data samples and their adversarial example, while constantly updating the classification head in order to avoid a cognitive dissociation between the classification head and the embedding space. This dissociation is caused by the fact that CL updates the network up to the embedding space, while freezing the classification head which is used to generate new positive adversarial examples. We validate our method, Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Features(CLAF), on the CIFAR-10 dataset on which it outperforms both robust accuracy and clean accuracy over alternative supervised and self-supervised adversarial learning methods.

- **Summary**: Medical image analysis using deep learning has recently been prevalent, showing great performance for various downstream tasks including medical image segmentation and its sibling, volumetric image segmentation. Particularly, a typical volumetric segmentation network strongly relies on a voxel grid representation which treats volumetric data as a stack of individual voxel `slices', which allows learning to segment a voxel grid to be as straightforward as extending existing image-based segmentation networks to the 3D domain. However, using a voxel grid representation requires a large memory footprint, expensive test-time and limiting the scalability of the solutions. In this paper, we propose Point-Unet, a novel method that incorporates the efficiency of deep learning with 3D point clouds into volumetric segmentation. Our key idea is to first predict the regions of interest in the volume by learning an attentional probability map, which is then used for sampling the volume into a sparse point cloud that is subsequently segmented using a point-based neural network. We have conducted the experiments on the medical volumetric segmentation task with both a small-scale dataset Pancreas and large-scale datasets BraTS18, BraTS19, and BraTS20 challenges. A comprehensive benchmark on different metrics has shown that our context-aware Point-Unet robustly outperforms the SOTA voxel-based networks at both accuracies, memory usage during training, and time consumption during testing.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation has been so far achieving promising results with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, it is arguable that in traditional CNNs, its pooling layer tends to discard important information such as positions. Moreover, CNNs are sensitive to rotation and affine transformation. Capsule network is a data-efficient network design proposed to overcome such limitations by replacing pooling layers with dynamic routing and convolutional strides, which aims to preserve the part-whole relationships. Capsule network has shown a great performance in image recognition and natural language processing, but applications for medical image segmentation, particularly volumetric image segmentation, has been limited. In this work, we propose 3D-UCaps, a 3D voxel-based Capsule network for medical volumetric image segmentation. We build the concept of capsules into a CNN by designing a network with two pathways: the first pathway is encoded by 3D Capsule blocks, whereas the second pathway is decoded by 3D CNNs blocks. 3D-UCaps, therefore inherits the merits from both Capsule network to preserve the spatial relationship and CNNs to learn visual representation. We conducted experiments on various datasets to demonstrate the robustness of 3D-UCaps including iSeg-2017, LUNA16, Hippocampus, and Cardiac, where our method outperforms previous Capsule networks and 3D-Unets.

- **Summary**: The last decade has brought forward many great contributions regarding presentation attack detection for the domain of finger and hand vein biometrics. Among those contributions, one is able to find a variety of different attack databases that are either private or made publicly available to the research community. However, it is not always shown whether the used attack samples hold the capability to actually deceive a realistic vein recognition system. Inspired by previous works, this study provides a systematic threat evaluation including three publicly available finger vein attack databases and one private dorsal hand vein database. To do so, 14 distinct vein recognition schemes are confronted with attack samples and the percentage of wrongly accepted attack samples is then reported as the Impostor Attack Presentation Match Rate. As a second step, comparison scores from different recognition schemes are combined using score level fusion with the goal of performing presentation attack detection.



### On the sensitivity of pose estimation neural networks: rotation parameterizations, Lipschitz constants, and provable bounds

- **Summary**: In this paper, we approach the task of determining sensitivity bounds for pose estimation neural networks. This task is particularly challenging as it requires characterizing the sensitivity of 3D rotations. We develop a sensitivity measure that describes the maximum rotational change in a network's output with respect to a Euclidean change in its input. We show that this measure is a type of Lipschitz constant, and that it is bounded by the product of a network's Euclidean Lipschitz constant and an intrinsic property of a rotation parameterization which we call the "distance ratio constant". We derive the distance ratio constant for several rotation parameterizations, and then discuss why the structure of most of these parameterizations makes it difficult to construct a pose estimation network with provable sensitivity bounds. However, we show that sensitivity bounds can be computed for networks which parameterize rotation using unconstrained exponential coordinates. We then construct and train such a network and compute sensitivity bounds for it.

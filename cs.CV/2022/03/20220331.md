- **Summary**: We present a novel method for classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data by combining ideas from graph-based learning and neural network methods within an active learning framework. Graph-based methods in machine learning are based on a similarity graph constructed from the data. When the data consists of raw images composed of scenes, extraneous information can make the classification task more difficult. In recent years, neural network methods have been shown to provide a promising framework for extracting patterns from SAR images. These methods, however, require ample training data to avoid overfitting. At the same time, such training data are often unavailable for applications of interest, such as automatic target recognition (ATR) and SAR data. We use a Convolutional Neural Network Variational Autoencoder (CNNVAE) to embed SAR data into a feature space, and then construct a similarity graph from the embedded data and apply graph-based semi-supervised learning techniques. The CNNVAE feature embedding and graph construction requires no labeled data, which reduces overfitting and improves the generalization performance of graph learning at low label rates. Furthermore, the method easily incorporates a human-in-the-loop for active learning in the data-labeling process. We present promising results and compare them to other standard machine learning methods on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset for ATR with small amounts of labeled data.

- **Summary**: Explaining the generalization characteristics of deep learning is an emerging topic in advanced machine learning. There are several unanswered questions about how learning under stochastic optimization really works and why certain strategies are better than others. In this paper, we address the following question: \textit{can we probe intermediate layers of a deep neural network to identify and quantify the learning quality of each layer?} With this question in mind, we propose new explainability metrics that measure the redundant information in a network's layers using a low-rank factorization framework and quantify a complexity measure that is highly correlated with the generalization performance of a given optimizer, network, and dataset. We subsequently exploit these metrics to augment the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer by adaptively adjusting the learning rate in each layer to improve in generalization performance. Our augmented SGD -- dubbed RMSGD -- introduces minimal computational overhead compared to SOTA methods and outperforms them by exhibiting strong generalization characteristics across application, architecture, and dataset.

- **Summary**: Personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA) is challenging due to its highly subjective nature. People's aesthetic tastes depend on diversified factors, including image characteristics and subject characters. The existing PIAA databases are limited in terms of annotation diversity, especially the subject aspect, which can no longer meet the increasing demands of PIAA research. To solve the dilemma, we conduct so far, the most comprehensive subjective study of personalized image aesthetics and introduce a new Personalized image Aesthetics database with Rich Attributes (PARA), which consists of 31,220 images with annotations by 438 subjects. PARA features wealthy annotations, including 9 image-oriented objective attributes and 4 human-oriented subjective attributes. In addition, desensitized subject information, such as personality traits, is also provided to support study of PIAA and user portraits. A comprehensive analysis of the annotation data is provided and statistic study indicates that the aesthetic preferences can be mirrored by proposed subjective attributes. We also propose a conditional PIAA model by utilizing subject information as conditional prior. Experimental results indicate that the conditional PIAA model can outperform the control group, which is also the first attempt to demonstrate how image aesthetics and subject characters interact to produce the intricate personalized tastes on image aesthetics. We believe the database and the associated analysis would be useful for conducting next-generation PIAA study.

- **Summary**: We propose a memory efficient method, named Stochastic Backpropagation (SBP), for training deep neural networks on videos. It is based on the finding that gradients from incomplete execution for backpropagation can still effectively train the models with minimal accuracy loss, which attributes to the high redundancy of video. SBP keeps all forward paths but randomly and independently removes the backward paths for each network layer in each training step. It reduces the GPU memory cost by eliminating the need to cache activation values corresponding to the dropped backward paths, whose amount can be controlled by an adjustable keep-ratio. Experiments show that SBP can be applied to a wide range of models for video tasks, leading to up to 80.0% GPU memory saving and 10% training speedup with less than 1% accuracy drop on action recognition and temporal action detection.

- **Summary**: Six degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) video provides telepresence by enabling users to move around in the captured scene with a wide field of regard. Compared to methods requiring sophisticated camera setups, the image-based rendering method based on photogrammetry can work with images captured with any poses, which is more suitable for casual users. However, existing image-based rendering methods are based on perspective images. When used to reconstruct 6-DoF views, it often requires capturing hundreds of images, making data capture a tedious and time-consuming process. In contrast to traditional perspective images, 360{\deg} images capture the entire surrounding view in a single shot, thus, providing a faster capturing process for 6-DoF view reconstruction. This paper presents a novel method to provide 6-DoF experiences over a wide area using an unstructured collection of 360{\deg} panoramas captured by a conventional 360{\deg} camera. Our method consists of 360{\deg} data capturing, novel depth estimation to produce a high-quality spherical depth panorama, and high-fidelity free-viewpoint generation. We compared our method against state-of-the-art methods, using data captured in various environments. Our method shows better visual quality and robustness in the tested scenes.

- **Summary**: We propose an online tracking algorithm that performs the object detection and data association under a common framework, capable of linking objects after a long time span. This is realized by preserving a large spatio-temporal memory to store the identity embeddings of the tracked objects, and by adaptively referencing and aggregating useful information from the memory as needed. Our model, called MeMOT, consists of three main modules that are all Transformer-based: 1) Hypothesis Generation that produce object proposals in the current video frame; 2) Memory Encoding that extracts the core information from the memory for each tracked object; and 3) Memory Decoding that solves the object detection and data association tasks simultaneously for multi-object tracking. When evaluated on widely adopted MOT benchmark datasets, MeMOT observes very competitive performance.

- **Summary**: Previous works of video captioning aim to objectively describe the video's actual content, which lacks subjective and attractive expression, limiting its practical application scenarios. Video titling is intended to achieve this goal, but there is a lack of a proper benchmark. In this paper, we propose to CREATE, the first large-scale Chinese shoRt vidEo retrievAl and Title gEneration benchmark, to facilitate research and application in video titling and video retrieval in Chinese. CREATE consists of a high-quality labeled 210K dataset and two large-scale 3M/10M pre-training datasets, covering 51 categories, 50K+ tags, 537K manually annotated titles and captions, and 10M+ short videos. Based on CREATE, we propose a novel model ALWIG which combines video retrieval and video titling tasks to achieve the purpose of multi-modal ALignment WIth Generation with the help of video tags and a GPT pre-trained model. CREATE opens new directions for facilitating future research and applications on video titling and video retrieval in the field of Chinese short videos.



### SpatioTemporal Focus for Skeleton-based Action Recognition

- **Summary**: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are widely adopted in skeleton-based action recognition due to their powerful ability to model data topology. We argue that the performance of recent proposed skeleton-based action recognition methods is limited by the following factors. First, the predefined graph structures are shared throughout the network, lacking the flexibility and capacity to model the multi-grain semantic information. Second, the relations among the global joints are not fully exploited by the graph local convolution, which may lose the implicit joint relevance. For instance, actions such as running and waving are performed by the co-movement of body parts and joints, e.g., legs and arms, however, they are located far away in physical connection. Inspired by the recent attention mechanism, we propose a multi-grain contextual focus module, termed MCF, to capture the action associated relation information from the body joints and parts. As a result, more explainable representations for different skeleton action sequences can be obtained by MCF. In this study, we follow the common practice that the dense sample strategy of the input skeleton sequences is adopted and this brings much redundancy since number of instances has nothing to do with actions. To reduce the redundancy, a temporal discrimination focus module, termed TDF, is developed to capture the local sensitive points of the temporal dynamics. MCF and TDF are integrated into the standard GCN network to form a unified architecture, named STF-Net. It is noted that STF-Net provides the capability to capture robust movement patterns from these skeleton topology structures, based on multi-grain context aggregation and temporal dependency. Extensive experimental results show that our STF-Net significantly achieves state-of-the-art results on three challenging benchmarks NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-skeleton.

- **Summary**: Referring image segmentation is an advanced semantic segmentation task where target is not a predefined class but is described in natural language. Most of existing methods for this task rely heavily on convolutional neural networks, which however have trouble capturing long-range dependencies between entities in the language expression and are not flexible enough for modeling interactions between the two different modalities. To address these issues, we present the first convolution-free model for referring image segmentation using transformers, dubbed ReSTR. Since it extracts features of both modalities through transformer encoders, it can capture long-range dependencies between entities within each modality. Also, ReSTR fuses features of the two modalities by a self-attention encoder, which enables flexible and adaptive interactions between the two modalities in the fusion process. The fused features are fed to a segmentation module, which works adaptively according to the image and language expression in hand. ReSTR is evaluated and compared with previous work on all public benchmarks, where it outperforms all existing models.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion aims at completing geometric and topological shapes from a partial observation. However, some topology of the original shape is missing, existing methods directly predict the location of complete points, without predicting structured and topological information of the complete shape, which leads to inferior performance. To better tackle the missing topology part, we propose LAKe-Net, a novel topology-aware point cloud completion model by localizing aligned keypoints, with a novel Keypoints-Skeleton-Shape prediction manner. Specifically, our method completes missing topology using three steps: 1) Aligned Keypoint Localization. An asymmetric keypoint locator, including an unsupervised multi-scale keypoint detector and a complete keypoint generator, is proposed for localizing aligned keypoints from complete and partial point clouds. We theoretically prove that the detector can capture aligned keypoints for objects within a sub-category. 2) Surface-skeleton Generation. A new type of skeleton, named Surface-skeleton, is generated from keypoints based on geometric priors to fully represent the topological information captured from keypoints and better recover the local details. 3) Shape Refinement. We design a refinement subnet where multi-scale surface-skeletons are fed into each recursive skeleton-assisted refinement module to assist the completion process. Experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on point cloud completion.

- **Summary**: We present Mask Atari, a new benchmark to help solve partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problems with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approaches. To achieve a simulation environment for the POMDP problems, Mask Atari is constructed based on Atari 2600 games with controllable, moveable, and learnable masks as the observation area for the target agent, especially with the active information gathering (AIG) setting in POMDPs. Given that one does not yet exist, Mask Atari provides a challenging, efficient benchmark for evaluating the methods that focus on the above problem. Moreover, the mask operation is a trial for introducing the receptive field in the human vision system into a simulation environment for an agent, which means the evaluations are not biased from the sensing ability and purely focus on the cognitive performance of the methods when compared with the human baseline. We describe the challenges and features of our benchmark and evaluate several baselines with Mask Atari.



### ViSTA: Vision and Scene Text Aggregation for Cross-Modal Retrieval

- **Summary**: Visual appearance is considered to be the most important cue to understand images for cross-modal retrieval, while sometimes the scene text appearing in images can provide valuable information to understand the visual semantics. Most of existing cross-modal retrieval approaches ignore the usage of scene text information and directly adding this information may lead to performance degradation in scene text free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a full transformer architecture to unify these cross-modal retrieval scenarios in a single $\textbf{Vi}$sion and $\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{T}$ext $\textbf{A}$ggregation framework (ViSTA). Specifically, ViSTA utilizes transformer blocks to directly encode image patches and fuse scene text embedding to learn an aggregated visual representation for cross-modal retrieval. To tackle the modality missing problem of scene text, we propose a novel fusion token based transformer aggregation approach to exchange the necessary scene text information only through the fusion token and concentrate on the most important features in each modality. To further strengthen the visual modality, we develop dual contrastive learning losses to embed both image-text pairs and fusion-text pairs into a common cross-modal space. Compared to existing methods, ViSTA enables to aggregate relevant scene text semantics with visual appearance, and hence improve results under both scene text free and scene text aware scenarios. Experimental results show that ViSTA outperforms other methods by at least $\bf{8.4}\%$ at Recall@1 for scene text aware retrieval task. Compared with state-of-the-art scene text free retrieval methods, ViSTA can achieve better accuracy on Flicker30K and MSCOCO while running at least three times faster during the inference stage, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Automatic image-based pavement distress detection and recognition are vital for pavement maintenance and management. However, existing deep learning-based methods largely omit the specific characteristics of pavement images, such as high image resolution and low distress area ratio, and are not end-to-end trainable. In this paper, we present a series of simple yet effective end-to-end deep learning approaches named Weakly Supervised Patch Label Inference Networks (WSPLIN) for efficiently addressing these tasks under various application settings. WSPLIN transforms the fully supervised pavement image classification problem into a weakly supervised pavement patch classification problem for solutions. Specifically, WSPLIN first divides the pavement image under different scales into patches with different collection strategies and then employs a Patch Label Inference Network (PLIN) to infer the labels of these patches to fully exploit the resolution and scale information. Notably, we design a patch label sparsity constraint based on the prior knowledge of distress distribution and leverage the Comprehensive Decision Network (CDN) to guide the training of PLIN in a weakly supervised way. Therefore, the patch labels produced by PLIN provide interpretable intermediate information, such as the rough location and the type of distress. We evaluate our method on a large-scale bituminous pavement distress dataset named CQU-BPDD and the augmented Crack500 (Crack500-PDD) dataset, which is a newly constructed pavement distress detection dataset augmented from the Crack500. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baselines in both performance and efficiency. The source codes of WSPLIN are released on https://github.com/DearCaat/wsplin.

- **Summary**: Learning generic joint representations for video and text by a supervised method requires a prohibitively substantial amount of manually annotated video datasets. As a practical alternative, a large-scale but uncurated and narrated video dataset, HowTo100M, has recently been introduced. But it is still challenging to learn joint embeddings of video and text in a self-supervised manner, due to its ambiguity and non-sequential alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal self-supervised framework Video-Text Temporally Weak Alignment-based Contrastive Learning (VT-TWINS) to capture significant information from noisy and weakly correlated data using a variant of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We observe that the standard DTW inherently cannot handle weakly correlated data and only considers the globally optimal alignment path. To address these problems, we develop a differentiable DTW which also reflects local information with weak temporal alignment. Moreover, our proposed model applies a contrastive learning scheme to learn feature representations on weakly correlated data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VT-TWINS attains significant improvements in multi-modal representation learning and outperforms various challenging downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: The inherent challenge of detecting symmetries stems from arbitrary orientations of symmetry patterns; a reflection symmetry mirrors itself against an axis with a specific orientation while a rotation symmetry matches its rotated copy with a specific orientation. Discovering such symmetry patterns from an image thus benefits from an equivariant feature representation, which varies consistently with reflection and rotation of the image. In this work, we introduce a group-equivariant convolutional network for symmetry detection, dubbed EquiSym, which leverages equivariant feature maps with respect to a dihedral group of reflection and rotation. The proposed network is built end-to-end with dihedrally-equivariant layers and trained to output a spatial map for reflection axes or rotation centers. We also present a new dataset, DENse and DIverse symmetry (DENDI), which mitigates limitations of existing benchmarks for reflection and rotation symmetry detection. Experiments show that our method achieves the state of the arts in symmetry detection on LDRS and DENDI datasets.

- **Summary**: Video transformers have recently emerged as an effective alternative to convolutional networks for action classification. However, most prior video transformers adopt either global space-time attention or hand-defined strategies to compare patches within and across frames. These fixed attention schemes not only have high computational cost but, by comparing patches at predetermined locations, they neglect the motion dynamics in the video. In this paper, we introduce the Deformable Video Transformer (DVT), which dynamically predicts a small subset of video patches to attend for each query location based on motion information, thus allowing the model to decide where to look in the video based on correspondences across frames. Crucially, these motion-based correspondences are obtained at zero-cost from information stored in the compressed format of the video. Our deformable attention mechanism is optimised directly with respect to classification performance, thus eliminating the need for suboptimal hand-design of attention strategies. Experiments on four large-scale video benchmarks (Kinetics-400, Something-Something-V2, EPIC-KITCHENS and Diving-48) demonstrate that, compared to existing video transformers, our model achieves higher accuracy at the same or lower computational cost, and it attains state-of-the-art results on these four datasets.

- **Summary**: Dimension reduction and data quantization are two important methods for reducing data complexity. In the paper, we study the methodology of first reducing data dimension by random projection and then quantizing the projections to ternary or binary codes, which has been widely applied in classification. Usually, the quantization will seriously degrade the accuracy of classification due to high quantization errors. Interestingly, however, we observe that the quantization could provide comparable and often superior accuracy, as the data to be quantized are sparse features generated with common filters. Furthermore, this quantization property could be maintained in the random projections of sparse features, if both the features and random projection matrices are sufficiently sparse. By conducting extensive experiments, we validate and analyze this intriguing property.

- **Summary**: We target at the task of weakly-supervised action localization (WSAL), where only video-level action labels are available during model training. Despite the recent progress, existing methods mainly embrace a localization-by-classification paradigm and overlook the fruitful fine-grained temporal distinctions between video sequences, thus suffering from severe ambiguity in classification learning and classification-to-localization adaption. This paper argues that learning by contextually comparing sequence-to-sequence distinctions offers an essential inductive bias in WSAL and helps identify coherent action instances. Specifically, under a differentiable dynamic programming formulation, two complementary contrastive objectives are designed, including Fine-grained Sequence Distance (FSD) contrasting and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) contrasting, where the first one considers the relations of various action/background proposals by using match, insert, and delete operators and the second one mines the longest common subsequences between two videos. Both contrasting modules can enhance each other and jointly enjoy the merits of discriminative action-background separation and alleviated task gap between classification and localization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/MengyuanChen21/CVPR2022-FTCL.

- **Summary**: Recently, there has been an increasing concern about the privacy issue raised by identifiable information in machine learning. However, previous portrait matting methods were all based on identifiable images. To fill the gap, we present P3M-10k, which is the first large-scale anonymized benchmark for Privacy-Preserving Portrait Matting (P3M). P3M-10k consists of 10,421 high resolution face-blurred portrait images along with high-quality alpha mattes, which enables us to systematically evaluate both trimap-free and trimap-based matting methods and obtain some useful findings about model generalization ability under the privacy preserving training (PPT) setting. We also present a unified matting model dubbed P3M-Net that is compatible with both CNN and transformer backbones. To further mitigate the cross-domain performance gap issue under the PPT setting, we devise a simple yet effective Copy and Paste strategy (P3M-CP), which borrows facial information from public celebrity images and directs the network to reacquire the face context at both data and feature level. Extensive experiments on P3M-10k and public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of P3M-Net over state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of P3M-CP in improving the cross-domain generalization ability, implying a great significance of P3M for future research and real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Semantic scene reconstruction from point cloud is an essential and challenging task for 3D scene understanding. This task requires not only to recognize each instance in the scene, but also to recover their geometries based on the partial observed point cloud. Existing methods usually attempt to directly predict occupancy values of the complete object based on incomplete point cloud proposals from a detection-based backbone. However, this framework always fails to reconstruct high fidelity mesh due to the obstruction of various detected false positive object proposals and the ambiguity of incomplete point observations for learning occupancy values of complete objects. To circumvent the hurdle, we propose a Disentangled Instance Mesh Reconstruction (DIMR) framework for effective point scene understanding. A segmentation-based backbone is applied to reduce false positive object proposals, which further benefits our exploration on the relationship between recognition and reconstruction. Based on the accurate proposals, we leverage a mesh-aware latent code space to disentangle the processes of shape completion and mesh generation, relieving the ambiguity caused by the incomplete point observations. Furthermore, with access to the CAD model pool at test time, our model can also be used to improve the reconstruction quality by performing mesh retrieval without extra training. We thoroughly evaluate the reconstructed mesh quality with multiple metrics, and demonstrate the superiority of our method on the challenging ScanNet dataset.

- **Summary**: Speaker extraction seeks to extract the clean speech of a target speaker from a multi-talker mixture speech. There have been studies to use a pre-recorded speech sample or face image of the target speaker as the speaker cue. In human communication, co-speech gestures that are naturally timed with speech also contribute to speech perception. In this work, we explore the use of co-speech gestures sequence, e.g. hand and body movements, as the speaker cue for speaker extraction, which could be easily obtained from low-resolution video recordings, thus more available than face recordings. We propose two networks using the co-speech gestures cue to perform attentive listening on the target speaker, one that implicitly fuses the co-speech gestures cue in the speaker extraction process, the other performs speech separation first, followed by explicitly using the co-speech gestures cue to associate a separated speech to the target speaker. The experimental results show that the co-speech gestures cue is informative in associating with the target speaker.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of document image dewarping, which aims at eliminating the geometric distortion in document images for document digitization. Instead of designing a better neural network to approximate the optical flow fields between the inputs and outputs, we pursue the best readability by taking the text lines and the document boundaries into account from a constrained optimization perspective. Specifically, our proposed method first learns the boundary points and the pixels in the text lines and then follows the most simple observation that the boundaries and text lines in both horizontal and vertical directions should be kept after dewarping to introduce a novel grid regularization scheme. To obtain the final forward mapping for dewarping, we solve an optimization problem with our proposed grid regularization. The experiments comprehensively demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the prior arts by large margins in terms of readability (with the metrics of Character Errors Rate and the Edit Distance) while maintaining the best image quality on the publicly-available DocUNet benchmark.

- **Summary**: After the 2017 TuSimple Lane Detection Challenge, its dataset and evaluation based on accuracy and F1 score have become the de facto standard to measure the performance of lane detection methods. While they have played a major role in improving the performance of lane detection methods, the validity of this evaluation method in downstream tasks has not been adequately researched. In this study, we design 2 new driving-oriented metrics for lane detection: End-to-End Lateral Deviation metric (E2E-LD) is directly formulated based on the requirements of autonomous driving, a core downstream task of lane detection; Per-frame Simulated Lateral Deviation metric (PSLD) is a lightweight surrogate metric of E2E-LD. To evaluate the validity of the metrics, we conduct a large-scale empirical study with 4 major types of lane detection approaches on the TuSimple dataset and our newly constructed dataset Comma2k19-LD. Our results show that the conventional metrics have strongly negative correlations ($\leq$-0.55) with E2E-LD, meaning that some recent improvements purely targeting the conventional metrics may not have led to meaningful improvements in autonomous driving, but rather may actually have made it worse by overfitting to the conventional metrics. As autonomous driving is a security/safety-critical system, the underestimation of robustness hinders the sound development of practical lane detection models. We hope that our study will help the community achieve more downstream task-aware evaluations for lane detection.

- **Summary**: We focus on the audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) problem that involves detecting audio and visual event labels with temporal boundaries. The task is especially challenging since it is weakly supervised with only event labels available as a bag of labels for each video. An existing state-of-the-art model for AVVP uses a hybrid attention network (HAN) to generate cross-modal features for both audio and visual modalities, and an attentive pooling module that aggregates predicted audio and visual segment-level event probabilities to yield video-level event probabilities. We provide a detailed analysis of modality bias in the existing HAN architecture, where a modality is completely ignored during prediction. We also propose a variant of feature aggregation in HAN that leads to an absolute gain in F-scores of about 2% and 1.6% for visual and audio-visual events at both segment-level and event-level, in comparison to the existing HAN model.

- **Summary**: There has been rapid progress recently on 3D human rendering, including novel view synthesis and pose animation, based on the advances of neural radiance fields (NeRF). However, most existing methods focus on person-specific training and their training typically requires multi-view videos. This paper deals with a new challenging task -- rendering novel views and novel poses for a person unseen in training, using only multiview images as input. For this task, we propose a simple yet effective method to train a generalizable NeRF with multiview images as conditional input. The key ingredient is a dedicated representation combining a canonical NeRF and a volume deformation scheme. Using a canonical space enables our method to learn shared properties of human and easily generalize to different people. Volume deformation is used to connect the canonical space with input and target images and query image features for radiance and density prediction. We leverage the parametric 3D human model fitted on the input images to derive the deformation, which works quite well in practice when combined with our canonical NeRF. The experiments on both real and synthetic data with the novel view synthesis and pose animation tasks collectively demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

- **Summary**: Point cloud scene flow estimation is of practical importance for dynamic scene navigation in autonomous driving. Since scene flow labels are hard to obtain, current methods train their models on synthetic data and transfer them to real scenes. However, large disparities between existing synthetic datasets and real scenes lead to poor model transfer. We make two major contributions to address that. First, we develop a point cloud collector and scene flow annotator for GTA-V engine to automatically obtain diverse realistic training samples without human intervention. With that, we develop a large-scale synthetic scene flow dataset GTA-SF. Second, we propose a mean-teacher-based domain adaptation framework that leverages self-generated pseudo-labels of the target domain. It also explicitly incorporates shape deformation regularization and surface correspondence refinement to address distortions and misalignments in domain transfer. Through extensive experiments, we show that our GTA-SF dataset leads to a consistent boost in model generalization to three real datasets (i.e., Waymo, Lyft and KITTI) as compared to the most widely used FT3D dataset. Moreover, our framework achieves superior adaptation performance on six source-target dataset pairs, remarkably closing the average domain gap by 60%.

- **Summary**: Optical flow estimation aims to find the 2D motion field by identifying corresponding pixels between two images. Despite the tremendous progress of deep learning-based optical flow methods, it remains a challenge to accurately estimate large displacements with motion blur. This is mainly because the correlation volume, the basis of pixel matching, is computed as the dot product of the convolutional features of the two images. The locality of convolutional features makes the computed correlations susceptible to various noises. On large displacements with motion blur, noisy correlations could cause severe errors in the estimated flow. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new architecture "CRoss-Attentional Flow Transformer" (CRAFT), aiming to revitalize the correlation volume computation. In CRAFT, a Semantic Smoothing Transformer layer transforms the features of one frame, making them more global and semantically stable. In addition, the dot-product correlations are replaced with transformer Cross-Frame Attention. This layer filters out feature noises through the Query and Key projections, and computes more accurate correlations. On Sintel (Final) and KITTI (foreground) benchmarks, CRAFT has achieved new state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, to test the robustness of different models on large motions, we designed an image shifting attack that shifts input images to generate large artificial motions. Under this attack, CRAFT performs much more robustly than two representative methods, RAFT and GMA. The code of CRAFT is is available at https://github.com/askerlee/craft.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptive object detection is challenging due to distinctive data distribution between source domain and target domain. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-granularity alignment based object detection framework towards domain-invariant feature learning. To this end, we encode the dependencies across different granularity perspectives including pixel-, instance-, and category-levels simultaneously to align two domains. Based on pixel-level feature maps from the backbone network, we first develop the omni-scale gated fusion module to aggregate discriminative representations of instances by scale-aware convolutions, leading to robust multi-scale object detection. Meanwhile, the multi-granularity discriminators are proposed to identify which domain different granularities of samples(i.e., pixels, instances, and categories) come from. Notably, we leverage not only the instance discriminability in different categories but also the category consistency between two domains. Extensive experiments are carried out on multiple domain adaptation scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework over state-of-the-art algorithms on top of anchor-free FCOS and anchor-based Faster RCNN detectors with different backbones.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in semantic image synthesis, it is still challenging in synthesizing photo-realistic images with rich details. Most previous methods focus on exploiting the given semantic map, which just captures an object-level layout for an image. Obviously, a fine-grained part-level semantic layout will benefit object details generation, and it can be roughly inferred from an object's shape. In order to exploit the part-level layouts, we propose a Shape-aware Position Descriptor (SPD) to describe each pixel's positional feature, where object shape is explicitly encoded into the SPD feature. Furthermore, a Semantic-shape Adaptive Feature Modulation (SAFM) block is proposed to combine the given semantic map and our positional features to produce adaptively modulated features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SPD and SAFM significantly improve the generation of objects with rich details. Moreover, our method performs favorably against the SOTA methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The source code and model are available at https://github.com/cszy98/SAFM.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we aim to forecast a future trajectory distribution of a moving agent in the real world, given the social scene images and historical trajectories. Yet, it is a challenging task because the ground-truth distribution is unknown and unobservable, while only one of its samples can be applied for supervising model learning, which is prone to bias. Most recent works focus on predicting diverse trajectories in order to cover all modes of the real distribution, but they may despise the precision and thus give too much credit to unrealistic predictions. To address the issue, we learn the distribution with symmetric cross-entropy using occupancy grid maps as an explicit and scene-compliant approximation to the ground-truth distribution, which can effectively penalize unlikely predictions. In specific, we present an inverse reinforcement learning based multi-modal trajectory distribution forecasting framework that learns to plan by an approximate value iteration network in an end-to-end manner. Besides, based on the predicted distribution, we generate a small set of representative trajectories through a differentiable Transformer-based network, whose attention mechanism helps to model the relations of trajectories. In experiments, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford Drone Dataset and Intersection Drone Dataset.

- **Summary**: A dataset of street light images is presented. Our dataset consists of $\sim350\textrm{k}$ images, taken from 140 UMBRELLA nodes installed in the South Gloucestershire region in the UK. Each UMBRELLA node is installed on the pole of a lamppost and is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Camera Module v1 facing upwards towards the sky and lamppost light bulb. Each node collects an image at hourly intervals for 24h every day. The data collection spans for a period of six months.   Each image taken is logged as a single entry in the dataset along with the Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of the lamppost. All entries in the dataset have been post-processed and labelled based on the operation of the lamppost, i.e., whether the lamppost is switched ON or OFF. The dataset can be used to train deep neural networks and generate pre-trained models providing feature representations for smart city CCTV applications, smart weather detection algorithms, or street infrastructure monitoring. The dataset can be found at \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6046758}.

- **Summary**: Rain removal aims to remove rain streaks from images/videos and reduce the disruptive effects caused by rain. It not only enhances image/video visibility but also allows many computer vision algorithms to function properly. This paper makes the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive study on the robustness of deep learning-based rain removal methods against adversarial attacks. Our study shows that, when the image/video is highly degraded, rain removal methods are more vulnerable to the adversarial attacks as small distortions/perturbations become less noticeable or detectable. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of various methods at different levels of attacks and with various losses/targets to generate the perturbations from the perspective of human perception and machine analysis tasks. A systematic evaluation of key modules in existing methods is performed in terms of their robustness against adversarial attacks. From the insights of our analysis, we construct a more robust deraining method by integrating these effective modules. Finally, we examine various types of adversarial attacks that are specific to deraining problems and their effects on both human and machine vision tasks, including 1) rain region attacks, adding perturbations only in the rain regions to make the perturbations in the attacked rain images less visible; 2) object-sensitive attacks, adding perturbations only in regions near the given objects.

- **Summary**: Advanced motion models (4 or 6 parameters) are needed for a good representation of the motion experimented by the different objects contained in a sequence of images. If the image is split in very small blocks, then an accurate description of complex movements can be achieved with only 2 parameters. This alternative implies a large set of vectors per image. We propose a new approach to reduce the number of vectors, using different block sizes as a function of the local characteristics of the image, without increasing the error accepted with the smallest blocks. A second algorithm is proposed for an inter/intraframe coder.

- **Summary**: Any city-scale visual localization system has to overcome long-term appearance changes, such as varying illumination conditions or seasonal changes between query and database images. Since semantic content is more robust to such changes, we exploit semantic information to improve visual localization. In our scenario, the database consists of gnomonic views generated from panoramic images (e.g. Google Street View) and query images are collected with a standard field-of-view camera at a different time. To improve localization, we check the semantic similarity between query and database images, which is not trivial since the position and viewpoint of the cameras do not exactly match. To learn similarity, we propose training a CNN in a self-supervised fashion with contrastive learning on a dataset of semantically segmented images. With experiments we showed that this semantic similarity estimation approach works better than measuring the similarity at pixel-level. Finally, we used the semantic similarity scores to verify the retrievals obtained by a state-of-the-art visual localization method and observed that contrastive learning-based pose verification increases top-1 recall value to 0.90 which corresponds to a 2% improvement.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers (ViTs) have been trending in image classification tasks due to their promising performance when compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). As a result, many researchers have tried to incorporate ViTs in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks. To achieve satisfactory performance, close to that of CNNs, transformers need fewer parameters. ViTs and other similar transformers use an external classification (CLS) token which is randomly initialized and often fails to generalize well, whereas other sources of multimodal datasets, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) offer the potential to improve these models by means of a CLS. In this paper, we introduce a new multimodal fusion transformer (MFT) network which comprises a multihead cross patch attention (mCrossPA) for HSI land-cover classification. Our mCrossPA utilizes other sources of complementary information in addition to the HSI in the transformer encoder to achieve better generalization. The concept of tokenization is used to generate CLS and HSI patch tokens, helping to learn a {distinctive representation} in a reduced and hierarchical feature space. Extensive experiments are carried out on {widely used benchmark} datasets {i.e.,} the University of Houston, Trento, University of Southern Mississippi Gulfpark (MUUFL), and Augsburg. We compare the results of the proposed MFT model with other state-of-the-art transformers, classical CNNs, and conventional classifiers models. The superior performance achieved by the proposed model is due to the use of multihead cross patch attention.

- **Summary**: Human video instance segmentation plays an important role in computer understanding of human activities and is widely used in video processing, video surveillance, and human modeling in virtual reality. Most current VIS methods are based on Mask-RCNN framework, where the target appearance and motion information for data matching will increase computational cost and have an impact on segmentation real-time performance; on the other hand, the existing datasets for VIS focus less on all the people appearing in the video. In this paper, to solve the problems, we develop a new method for human video instance segmentation based on single-stage detector. To tracking the instance across the video, we have adopted data association strategy for matching the same instance in the video sequence, where we jointly learn target instance appearances and their affinities in a pair of video frames in an end-to-end fashion. We have also adopted the centroid sampling strategy for enhancing the embedding extraction ability of instance, which is to bias the instance position to the inside of each instance mask with heavy overlap condition. As a result, even there exists a sudden change in the character activity, the instance position will not move out of the mask, so that the problem that the same instance is represented by two different instances can be alleviated. Finally, we collect PVIS dataset by assembling several video instance segmentation datasets to fill the gap of the current lack of datasets dedicated to human video segmentation. Extensive simulations based on such dataset has been conduct. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed work.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has become the mainstream methodological choice for analyzing and interpreting whole-slide digital pathology images (WSIs). It is commonly assumed that tumor regions carry most predictive information. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised clustering-based multiple-instance learning, and apply our method to develop deep-learning models for prediction of gene mutations using WSIs from three cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (CRC, LUAD, and HNSCC). We showed that unsupervised clustering of image patches could help identify predictive patches, exclude patches lack of predictive information, and therefore improve prediction on gene mutations in all three different cancer types, compared with the WSI based method without selection of image patches and models based on only tumor regions. Additionally, our proposed algorithm outperformed two recently published baseline algorithms leveraging unsupervised clustering to assist model prediction. The unsupervised-clustering-based approach for mutation prediction allows identification of the spatial regions related to mutation of a specific gene via the resolved probability scores, highlighting the heterogeneity of a predicted genotype in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, our study also demonstrated that selection of tumor regions of WSIs is not always the best way to identify patches for prediction of gene mutations, and other tissue types in the tumor micro-environment may provide better prediction ability for gene mutations than tumor tissues.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has drawn increasing attention in histopathological image analysis in recent years. Compared to contrastive learning which is troubled with the false negative problem, i.e., semantically similar images are selected as negative samples, masked autoencoders (MAE) building SSL from a generative paradigm is probably a more appropriate pre-training. In this paper, we introduce MAE and verify the effect of visible patches for histopathological image understanding. Moreover, a novel SD-MAE model is proposed to enable a self-distillation augmented MAE. Besides the reconstruction loss on masked image patches, SD-MAE further imposes the self-distillation loss on visible patches to enhance the representational capacity of the encoder located shallow layer. We apply SD-MAE to histopathological image classification, cell segmentation and object detection. Experiments demonstrate that SD-MAE shows highly competitive performance when compared with other SSL methods in these tasks.

- **Summary**: Background: Egocentric video has recently emerged as a potential solution for monitoring hand function in individuals living with tetraplegia in the community, especially for its ability to detect functional use in the home environment. Objective: To develop and validate a wearable vision-based system for measuring hand use in the home among individuals living with tetraplegia. Methods: Several deep learning algorithms for detecting functional hand-object interactions were developed and compared. The most accurate algorithm was used to extract measures of hand function from 65 hours of unscripted video recorded at home by 20 participants with tetraplegia. These measures were: the percentage of interaction time over total recording time (Perc); the average duration of individual interactions (Dur); the number of interactions per hour (Num). To demonstrate the clinical validity of the technology, egocentric measures were correlated with validated clinical assessments of hand function and independence (Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension - GRASSP, Upper Extremity Motor Score - UEMS, and Spinal Cord Independent Measure - SCIM). Results: Hand-object interactions were automatically detected with a median F1-score of 0.80 (0.67-0.87). Our results demonstrated that higher UEMS and better prehension were related to greater time spent interacting, whereas higher SCIM and better hand sensation resulted in a higher number of interactions performed during the egocentric video recordings. Conclusions: For the first time, measures of hand function automatically estimated in an unconstrained environment in individuals with tetraplegia have been validated against internationally accepted measures of hand function. Future work will necessitate a formal evaluation of the reliability and responsiveness of the egocentric-based performance measures for hand use.

- **Summary**: Model quantization is considered as a promising method to greatly reduce the resource requirements of deep neural networks. To deal with the performance drop induced by quantization errors, a popular method is to use training data to fine-tune quantized networks. In real-world environments, however, such a method is frequently infeasible because training data is unavailable due to security, privacy, or confidentiality concerns. Zero-shot quantization addresses such problems, usually by taking information from the weights of a full-precision teacher network to compensate the performance drop of the quantized networks. In this paper, we first analyze the loss surface of state-of-the-art zero-shot quantization techniques and provide several findings. In contrast to usual knowledge distillation problems, zero-shot quantization often suffers from 1) the difficulty of optimizing multiple loss terms together, and 2) the poor generalization capability due to the use of synthetic samples. Furthermore, we observe that many weights fail to cross the rounding threshold during training the quantized networks even when it is necessary to do so for better performance. Based on the observations, we propose AIT, a simple yet powerful technique for zero-shot quantization, which addresses the aforementioned two problems in the following way: AIT i) uses a KL distance loss only without a cross-entropy loss, and ii) manipulates gradients to guarantee that a certain portion of weights are properly updated after crossing the rounding thresholds. Experiments show that AIT outperforms the performance of many existing methods by a great margin, taking over the overall state-of-the-art position in the field.

- **Summary**: Video streams are utilised to guide minimally-invasive surgery and diagnostic procedures in a wide range of procedures, and many computer assisted techniques have been developed to automatically analyse them. These approaches can provide additional information to the surgeon such as lesion detection, instrument navigation, or anatomy 3D shape modeling. However, the necessary image features to recognise these patterns are not always reliably detected due to the presence of irregular light patterns such as specular highlight reflections. In this paper, we aim at removing specular highlights from endoscopic videos using machine learning. We propose using a temporal generative adversarial network (GAN) to inpaint the hidden anatomy under specularities, inferring its appearance spatially and from neighbouring frames where they are not present in the same location. This is achieved using in-vivo data of gastric endoscopy (Hyper-Kvasir) in a fully unsupervised manner that relies on automatic detection of specular highlights. System evaluations show significant improvements to traditional methods through direct comparison as well as other machine learning techniques through an ablation study that depicts the importance of the network's temporal and transfer learning components. The generalizability of our system to different surgical setups and procedures was also evaluated qualitatively on in-vivo data of gastric endoscopy and ex-vivo porcine data (SERV-CT, SCARED). We also assess the effect of our method in computer vision tasks that underpin 3D reconstruction and camera motion estimation, namely stereo disparity, optical flow, and sparse point feature matching. These are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively and results show a positive effect of specular highlight inpainting on these tasks in a novel comprehensive analysis.

- **Summary**: Real-world data exhibiting skewed distributions pose a serious challenge to existing object detectors. Moreover, the samplers in detectors lead to shifted training label distributions, while the tremendous proportion of background to foreground samples severely harms foreground classification. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose Logit Normalization (LogN), a simple technique to self-calibrate the classified logits of detectors in a similar way to batch normalization. In general, our LogN is training- and tuning-free (i.e. require no extra training and tuning process), model- and label distribution-agnostic (i.e. generalization to different kinds of detectors and datasets), and also plug-and-play (i.e. direct application without any bells and whistles). Extensive experiments on the LVIS dataset demonstrate superior performance of LogN to state-of-the-art methods with various detectors and backbones. We also provide in-depth studies on different aspects of our LogN. Further experiments on ImageNet-LT reveal its competitiveness and generalizability. Our LogN can serve as a strong baseline for long-tail object detection and is expected to inspire future research in this field. Code and trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/LogN.

- **Summary**: New classes arise frequently in our ever-changing world, e.g., emerging topics in social media and new types of products in e-commerce. A model should recognize new classes and meanwhile maintain discriminability over old classes. Under severe circumstances, only limited novel instances are available to incrementally update the model. The task of recognizing few-shot new classes without forgetting old classes is called few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL). In this work, we propose a new paradigm for FSCIL based on meta-learning by LearnIng Multi-phase Incremental Tasks (LIMIT), which synthesizes fake FSCIL tasks from the base dataset. The data format of fake tasks is consistent with the `real' incremental tasks, and we can build a generalizable feature space for the unseen tasks through meta-learning. Besides, LIMIT also constructs a calibration module based on transformer, which calibrates the old class classifiers and new class prototypes into the same scale and fills in the semantic gap. The calibration module also adaptively contextualizes the instance-specific embedding with a set-to-set function. LIMIT efficiently adapts to new classes and meanwhile resists forgetting over old classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200) and large-scale dataset, i.e., ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validate that LIMIT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Single frame data contains finite information which limits the performance of the existing vision-based multi-camera 3D object detection paradigms. For fundamentally pushing the performance boundary in this area, a novel paradigm dubbed BEVDet4D is proposed to lift the scalable BEVDet paradigm from the spatial-only 3D space to the spatial-temporal 4D space. We upgrade the naive BEVDet framework with a few modifications just for fusing the feature from the previous frame with the corresponding one in the current frame. In this way, with negligible additional computing budget, we enable BEVDet4D to access the temporal cues by querying and comparing the two candidate features. Beyond this, we simplify the task of velocity prediction by removing the factors of ego-motion and time in the learning target. As a result, BEVDet4D with robust generalization performance reduces the velocity error by up to -62.9%. This makes the vision-based methods, for the first time, become comparable with those relied on LiDAR or radar in this aspect. On challenge benchmark nuScenes, we report a new record of 54.5% NDS with the high-performance configuration dubbed BEVDet4D-Base, which surpasses the previous leading method BEVDet-Base by +7.3% NDS.

- **Summary**: Gesture recognition is one of the most intuitive ways of interaction and has gathered particular attention for human computer interaction. Radar sensors possess multiple intrinsic properties, such as their ability to work in low illumination, harsh weather conditions, and being low-cost and compact, making them highly preferable for a gesture recognition solution. However, most literature work focuses on solutions with a limited range that is lower than a meter. We propose a novel architecture for a long-range (1m - 2m) gesture recognition solution that leverages a point cloud-based cross-learning approach from camera point cloud to 60-GHz FMCW radar point cloud, which allows learning better representations while suppressing noise. We use a variant of Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN) for the cross-learning, enabling us to model relationships between the points at a local and global level and to model the temporal dynamics a Bi-LSTM network is employed. In the experimental results section, we demonstrate our model's overall accuracy of 98.4% for five gestures and its generalization capability.

- **Summary**: In Domain Generalization (DG) tasks, models are trained by using only training data from the source domains to achieve generalization on an unseen target domain, this will suffer from the distribution shift problem. So it's important to learn a classifier to focus on the common representation which can be used to classify on multi-domains, so that this classifier can achieve a high performance on an unseen target domain as well. With the success of cross attention in various cross-modal tasks, we find that cross attention is a powerful mechanism to align the features come from different distributions. So we design a model named CADG (cross attention for domain generalization), wherein cross attention plays a important role, to address distribution shift problem. Such design makes the classifier can be adopted on multi-domains, so the classifier will generalize well on an unseen domain. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of domain generalization benchmarks compared with other single model and can even achieve a better performance than some ensemble-based methods.

- **Summary**: Currently, this paper is under review in IEEE. Transformers have intrigued the vision research community with their state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing. With their superior performance, transformers have found their way in the field of hyperspectral image classification and achieved promising results. In this article, we harness the power of transformers to conquer the task of hyperspectral unmixing and propose a novel deep unmixing model with transformers. We aim to utilize the ability of transformers to better capture the global feature dependencies in order to enhance the quality of the endmember spectra and the abundance maps. The proposed model is a combination of a convolutional autoencoder and a transformer. The hyperspectral data is encoded by the convolutional encoder. The transformer captures long-range dependencies between the representations derived from the encoder. The data are reconstructed using a convolutional decoder. We applied the proposed unmixing model to three widely used unmixing datasets, i.e., Samson, Apex, and Washington DC mall and compared it with the state-of-the-art in terms of root mean squared error and spectral angle distance. The source code for the proposed model will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/preetam22n/DeepTrans-HSU}.

- **Summary**: The best performing learning algorithms devised for event cameras work by first converting events into dense representations that are then processed using standard CNNs. However, these steps discard both the sparsity and high temporal resolution of events, leading to high computational burden and latency. For this reason, recent works have adopted Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which process events as ``static" spatio-temporal graphs, which are inherently "sparse". We take this trend one step further by introducing Asynchronous, Event-based Graph Neural Networks (AEGNNs), a novel event-processing paradigm that generalizes standard GNNs to process events as ``evolving" spatio-temporal graphs. AEGNNs follow efficient update rules that restrict recomputation of network activations only to the nodes affected by each new event, thereby significantly reducing both computation and latency for event-by-event processing. AEGNNs are easily trained on synchronous inputs and can be converted to efficient, "asynchronous" networks at test time. We thoroughly validate our method on object classification and detection tasks, where we show an up to a 11-fold reduction in computational complexity (FLOPs), with similar or even better performance than state-of-the-art asynchronous methods. This reduction in computation directly translates to an 8-fold reduction in computational latency when compared to standard GNNs, which opens the door to low-latency event-based processing.

- **Summary**: Automated facial age estimation has diverse real-world applications in multimedia analysis, e.g., video surveillance, and human-computer interaction. However, due to the randomness and ambiguity of the aging process, age assessment is challenging. Most research work over the topic regards the task as one of age regression, classification, and ranking problems, and cannot well leverage age distribution in representing labels with age ambiguity. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective loss function for robust facial age estimation via distribution learning, i.e., adaptive mean-residue loss, in which, the mean loss penalizes the difference between the estimated age distribution's mean and the ground-truth age, whereas the residue loss penalizes the entropy of age probability out of dynamic top-K in the distribution. Experimental results in the datasets FG-NET and CLAP2016 have validated the effectiveness of the proposed loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/jacobzhaoziyuan/AMR-Loss.

- **Summary**: In recent years, neural implicit representations have made remarkable progress in modeling of 3D shapes with arbitrary topology. In this work, we address two key limitations of such representations, in failing to capture local 3D geometric fine details, and to learn from and generalize to shapes with unseen 3D transformations. To this end, we introduce a novel family of graph implicit functions with equivariant layers that facilitates modeling fine local details and guaranteed robustness to various groups of geometric transformations, through local $k$-NN graph embeddings with sparse point set observations at multiple resolutions. Our method improves over the existing rotation-equivariant implicit function from 0.69 to 0.89 (IoU) on the ShapeNet reconstruction task. We also show that our equivariant implicit function can be extended to other types of similarity transformations and generalizes to unseen translations and scaling.

- **Summary**: Recently, video frame interpolation using a combination of frame- and event-based cameras has surpassed traditional image-based methods both in terms of performance and memory efficiency. However, current methods still suffer from (i) brittle image-level fusion of complementary interpolation results, that fails in the presence of artifacts in the fused image, (ii) potentially temporally inconsistent and inefficient motion estimation procedures, that run for every inserted frame and (iii) low contrast regions that do not trigger events, and thus cause events-only motion estimation to generate artifacts. Moreover, previous methods were only tested on datasets consisting of planar and faraway scenes, which do not capture the full complexity of the real world. In this work, we address the above problems by introducing multi-scale feature-level fusion and computing one-shot non-linear inter-frame motion from events and images, which can be efficiently sampled for image warping. We also collect the first large-scale events and frames dataset consisting of more than 100 challenging scenes with depth variations, captured with a new experimental setup based on a beamsplitter. We show that our method improves the reconstruction quality by up to 0.2 dB in terms of PSNR and up to 15% in LPIPS score.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods aim to learn view-invariant representations by maximizing the similarity between the features extracted from different crops of the same image regardless of cropping size and content. In essence, this strategy ignores the fact that two crops may truly contain different image information, e.g., background and small objects, and thus tends to restrain the diversity of the learned representations. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a new self-supervised learning strategy, LoGo, that explicitly reasons about Local and Global crops. To achieve view invariance, LoGo encourages similarity between global crops from the same image, as well as between a global and a local crop. However, to correctly encode the fact that the content of smaller crops may differ entirely, LoGo promotes two local crops to have dissimilar representations, while being close to global crops. Our LoGo strategy can easily be applied to existing SSL methods. Our extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and using different self-supervised learning frameworks validate its superiority over existing approaches. Noticeably, we achieve better results than supervised models on transfer learning when using only 1/10 of the data.

- **Summary**: Existing work on VQA explores data augmentation to achieve better generalization by perturbing the images in the dataset or modifying the existing questions and answers. While these methods exhibit good performance, the diversity of the questions and answers are constrained by the available image set. In this work we explore using synthetic computer-generated data to fully control the visual and language space, allowing us to provide more diverse scenarios. We quantify the effect of synthetic data in real-world VQA benchmarks and to which extent it produces results that generalize to real data. By exploiting 3D and physics simulation platforms, we provide a pipeline to generate synthetic data to expand and replace type-specific questions and answers without risking the exposure of sensitive or personal data that might be present in real images. We offer a comprehensive analysis while expanding existing hyper-realistic datasets to be used for VQA. We also propose Feature Swapping (F-SWAP) -- where we randomly switch object-level features during training to make a VQA model more domain invariant. We show that F-SWAP is effective for enhancing a currently existing VQA dataset of real images without compromising on the accuracy to answer existing questions in the dataset.

- **Summary**: We present a method that can recognize new objects and estimate their 3D pose in RGB images even under partial occlusions. Our method requires neither a training phase on these objects nor real images depicting them, only their CAD models. It relies on a small set of training objects to learn local object representations, which allow us to locally match the input image to a set of "templates", rendered images of the CAD models for the new objects. In contrast with the state-of-the-art methods, the new objects on which our method is applied can be very different from the training objects. As a result, we are the first to show generalization without retraining on the LINEMOD and Occlusion-LINEMOD datasets. Our analysis of the failure modes of previous template-based approaches further confirms the benefits of local features for template matching. We outperform the state-of-the-art template matching methods on the LINEMOD, Occlusion-LINEMOD and T-LESS datasets.

- **Summary**: Conventional 3D object detection approaches concentrate on bounding boxes representation learning with several parameters, i.e., localization, dimension, and orientation. Despite its popularity and universality, such a straightforward paradigm is sensitive to slight numerical deviations, especially in localization. By exploiting the property that point clouds are naturally captured on the surface of objects along with accurate location and intensity information, we introduce a new perspective that views bounding box regression as an implicit function. This leads to our proposed framework, termed Implicit Detection or ImpDet, which leverages implicit field learning for 3D object detection. Our ImpDet assigns specific values to points in different local 3D spaces, thereby high-quality boundaries can be generated by classifying points inside or outside the boundary. To solve the problem of sparsity on the object surface, we further present a simple yet efficient virtual sampling strategy to not only fill the empty region, but also learn rich semantic features to help refine the boundaries. Extensive experimental results on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of unifying implicit fields into object detection.

- **Summary**: We propose Continuous Scene Representations (CSR), a scene representation constructed by an embodied agent navigating within a space, where objects and their relationships are modeled by continuous valued embeddings. Our method captures feature relationships between objects, composes them into a graph structure on-the-fly, and situates an embodied agent within the representation. Our key insight is to embed pair-wise relationships between objects in a latent space. This allows for a richer representation compared to discrete relations (e.g., [support], [next-to]) commonly used for building scene representations. CSR can track objects as the agent moves in a scene, update the representation accordingly, and detect changes in room configurations. Using CSR, we outperform state-of-the-art approaches for the challenging downstream task of visual room rearrangement, without any task specific training. Moreover, we show the learned embeddings capture salient spatial details of the scene and show applicability to real world data.

- **Summary**: Salient Object Ranking (SOR) involves ranking the degree of saliency of multiple salient objects in an input image. Most recently, a method is proposed for ranking salient objects in an input video based on a predicted fixation map. It relies solely on the density of the fixations within the salient objects to infer their saliency ranks, which is incompatible with human perception of saliency ranking. In this work, we propose to explicitly learn the spatial and temporal relations between different salient objects to produce the saliency ranks. To this end, we propose an end-to-end method for video salient object ranking (VSOR), with two novel modules: an intra-frame adaptive relation (IAR) module to learn the spatial relation among the salient objects in the same frame locally and globally, and an inter-frame dynamic relation (IDR) module to model the temporal relation of saliency across different frames. In addition, to address the limited video types (just sports and movies) and scene diversity in the existing VSOR dataset, we propose a new dataset that covers different video types and diverse scenes on a large scale. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relevant fields. We will make the source code and our proposed dataset available.

- **Summary**: Our work focuses on addressing sample deficiency from low-density regions of data manifold in common image datasets. We leverage diffusion process based generative models to synthesize novel images from low-density regions. We observe that uniform sampling from diffusion models predominantly samples from high-density regions of the data manifold. Therefore, we modify the sampling process to guide it towards low-density regions while simultaneously maintaining the fidelity of synthetic data. We rigorously demonstrate that our process successfully generates novel high fidelity samples from low-density regions. We further examine generated samples and show that the model does not memorize low-density data and indeed learns to generate novel samples from low-density regions.

- **Summary**: Recent research explosion on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) shows the encouraging potential to represent complex scenes with neural networks. One major drawback of NeRF is its prohibitive inference time: Rendering a single pixel requires querying the NeRF network hundreds of times. To resolve it, existing efforts mainly attempt to reduce the number of required sampled points. However, the problem of iterative sampling still exists. On the other hand, Neural Light Field (NeLF) presents a more straightforward representation over NeRF in novel view synthesis -- the rendering of a pixel amounts to one single forward pass without ray-marching. In this work, we present a deep residual MLP network (88 layers) to effectively learn the light field. We show the key to successfully learning such a deep NeLF network is to have sufficient data, for which we transfer the knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model via data distillation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world scenes show the merits of our method over other counterpart algorithms. On the synthetic scenes, we achieve 26-35x FLOPs reduction (per camera ray) and 28-31x runtime speedup, meanwhile delivering significantly better (1.4-2.8 dB average PSNR improvement) rendering quality than NeRF without any customized parallelism requirement.

- **Summary**: Since facial actions such as lip movements contain significant information about speech content, it is not surprising that audio-visual speech enhancement methods are more accurate than their audio-only counterparts. Yet, state-of-the-art approaches still struggle to generate clean, realistic speech without noise artifacts and unnatural distortions in challenging acoustic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel audio-visual speech enhancement framework for high-fidelity telecommunications in AR/VR. Our approach leverages audio-visual speech cues to generate the codes of a neural speech codec, enabling efficient synthesis of clean, realistic speech from noisy signals. Given the importance of speaker-specific cues in speech, we focus on developing personalized models that work well for individual speakers. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a new audio-visual speech dataset collected in an unconstrained, large vocabulary setting, as well as existing audio-visual datasets, outperforming speech enhancement baselines on both quantitative metrics and human evaluation studies.

- **Summary**: Recent advances like StyleGAN have promoted the growth of controllable facial editing. To address its core challenge of attribute decoupling in a single latent space, attempts have been made to adopt dual-space GAN for better disentanglement of style and content representations. Nonetheless, these methods are still incompetent to obtain plausible editing results with high controllability, especially for complicated attributes. In this study, we highlight the importance of interaction in a dual-space GAN for more controllable editing. We propose TransEditor, a novel Transformer-based framework to enhance such interaction. Besides, we develop a new dual-space editing and inversion strategy to provide additional editing flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in image quality and editing capability, suggesting the effectiveness of TransEditor for highly controllable facial editing.

- **Summary**: Continual learning is a setting where machine learning models learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data, while simultaneously avoiding degradation of knowledge on previously seen classes which may disappear from the training data for extended periods of time (a phenomenon known as the catastrophic forgetting problem). Current approaches for continual learning of a single expanding task (aka class-incremental continual learning) require extensive rehearsal of previously seen data to avoid this degradation of knowledge. Unfortunately, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data-privacy. Instead, we explore combining knowledge distillation and parameter regularization in new ways to achieve strong continual learning performance without rehearsal. Specifically, we take a deep dive into common continual learning techniques: prediction distillation, feature distillation, L2 parameter regularization, and EWC parameter regularization. We first disprove the common assumption that parameter regularization techniques fail for rehearsal-free continual learning of a single, expanding task. Next, we explore how to leverage knowledge from a pre-trained model in rehearsal-free continual learning and find that vanilla L2 parameter regularization outperforms EWC parameter regularization and feature distillation. Finally, we explore the recently popular ImageNet-R benchmark, and show that L2 parameter regularization implemented in self-attention blocks of a ViT transformer outperforms recent popular prompting for continual learning methods.

- **Summary**: 3D visual perception tasks, including 3D detection and map segmentation based on multi-camera images, are essential for autonomous driving systems. In this work, we present a new framework termed BEVFormer, which learns unified BEV representations with spatiotemporal transformers to support multiple autonomous driving perception tasks. In a nutshell, BEVFormer exploits both spatial and temporal information by interacting with spatial and temporal space through predefined grid-shaped BEV queries. To aggregate spatial information, we design spatial cross-attention that each BEV query extracts the spatial features from the regions of interest across camera views. For temporal information, we propose temporal self-attention to recurrently fuse the history BEV information. Our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art 56.9\% in terms of NDS metric on the nuScenes \texttt{test} set, which is 9.0 points higher than previous best arts and on par with the performance of LiDAR-based baselines. We further show that BEVFormer remarkably improves the accuracy of velocity estimation and recall of objects under low visibility conditions.

- **Summary**: Vision-language (VL) pretrained models have achieved impressive performance on multimodal reasoning and zero-shot recognition tasks. Many of these VL models are pretrained on unlabeled image and caption pairs from the internet. In this paper, we study whether representations of primitive concepts--such as colors, shapes, or the attributes of object parts--emerge automatically within these pretrained VL models. We propose a two-step framework, Compositional Concept Mapping (CompMap), to investigate this. CompMap first asks a VL model to generate primitive concept activations with text prompts, and then learns to construct a composition model that maps the primitive concept activations (e.g. the likelihood of black tail or red wing) to composite concepts (e.g. a red-winged blackbird). We show that a composition model can be reliably learn from ground truth primitive concepts. We thus hypothesize that if primitive concepts indeed emerge in a VL pretrained model, its primitive concept activations can be used to learn a composition model similar to the one designed by experts. We propose a quantitative metric to measure the degree of similarity, and refer to the metric as the interpretability metric. We also measure the classification accuracy when using the primitive concept activations and the learned composition model to predict the composite concepts, and refer to it as the usefulness metric. Our study reveals that state-of-the-art VL pretrained models learn primitive concepts that are highly useful for fine-grained visual recognition on the CUB dataset, and compositional generalization tasks on the MIT-States dataset. However, we observe that the learned composition models have low interpretability in our qualitative analyses. Our results reveal the limitations of existing VL models, and the necessity of pretraining objectives that encourage the acquisition of primitive concepts.

- **Summary**: We introduce MyStyle, a personalized deep generative prior trained with a few shots of an individual. MyStyle allows to reconstruct, enhance and edit images of a specific person, such that the output is faithful to the person's key facial characteristics. Given a small reference set of portrait images of a person (~100), we tune the weights of a pretrained StyleGAN face generator to form a local, low-dimensional, personalized manifold in the latent space. We show that this manifold constitutes a personalized region that spans latent codes associated with diverse portrait images of the individual. Moreover, we demonstrate that we obtain a personalized generative prior, and propose a unified approach to apply it to various ill-posed image enhancement problems, such as inpainting and super-resolution, as well as semantic editing. Using the personalized generative prior we obtain outputs that exhibit high-fidelity to the input images and are also faithful to the key facial characteristics of the individual in the reference set. We demonstrate our method with fair-use images of numerous widely recognizable individuals for whom we have the prior knowledge for a qualitative evaluation of the expected outcome. We evaluate our approach against few-shots baselines and show that our personalized prior, quantitatively and qualitatively, outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.

- **Summary**: We propose FindIt, a simple and versatile framework that unifies a variety of visual grounding and localization tasks including referring expression comprehension, text-based localization, and object detection. Key to our architecture is an efficient multi-scale fusion module that unifies the disparate localization requirements across the tasks. In addition, we discover that a standard object detector is surprisingly effective in unifying these tasks without a need for task-specific design, losses, or pre-computed detections. Our end-to-end trainable framework responds flexibly and accurately to a wide range of referring expression, localization or detection queries for zero, one, or multiple objects. Jointly trained on these tasks, FindIt outperforms the state of the art on both referring expression and text-based localization, and shows competitive performance on object detection. Finally, FindIt generalizes better to out-of-distribution data and novel categories compared to strong single-task baselines. All of these are accomplished by a single, unified and efficient model. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: We investigate the efficacy of visual prompting to adapt large-scale models in vision. Following the recent approach from prompt tuning and adversarial reprogramming, we learn a single image perturbation such that a frozen model prompted with this perturbation performs a new task. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that visual prompting is particularly effective for CLIP and robust to distribution shift, achieving performance competitive with standard linear probes. We further analyze properties of the downstream dataset, prompt design, and output transformation in regard to adaptation performance. The surprising effectiveness of visual prompting provides a new perspective on adapting pre-trained models in vision. Code is available at http://hjbahng.github.io/visual_prompting .

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of sequential robotic manipulation of deformable objects using tools. Previous works have shown that differentiable physics simulators provide gradients to the environment state and help trajectory optimization to converge orders of magnitude faster than model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for deformable object manipulation. However, such gradient-based trajectory optimization typically requires access to the full simulator states and can only solve short-horizon, single-skill tasks due to local optima. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named DiffSkill, that uses a differentiable physics simulator for skill abstraction to solve long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations. In particular, we first obtain short-horizon skills using individual tools from a gradient-based optimizer, using the full state information in a differentiable simulator; we then learn a neural skill abstractor from the demonstration trajectories which takes RGBD images as input. Finally, we plan over the skills by finding the intermediate goals and then solve long-horizon tasks. We show the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable object manipulation tasks compared to previous reinforcement learning algorithms and compared to the trajectory optimizer.

- **Summary**: We present a learning-based framework, recurrent transformer network (RTN), to restore heavily degraded old films. Instead of performing frame-wise restoration, our method is based on the hidden knowledge learned from adjacent frames that contain abundant information about the occlusion, which is beneficial to restore challenging artifacts of each frame while ensuring temporal coherency. Moreover, contrasting the representation of the current frame and the hidden knowledge makes it possible to infer the scratch position in an unsupervised manner, and such defect localization generalizes well to real-world degradations. To better resolve mixed degradation and compensate for the flow estimation error during frame alignment, we propose to leverage more expressive transformer blocks for spatial restoration. Experiments on both synthetic dataset and real-world old films demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed RTN over existing solutions. In addition, the same framework can effectively propagate the color from keyframes to the whole video, ultimately yielding compelling restored films. The implementation and model will be released at https://github.com/raywzy/Bringing-Old-Films-Back-to-Life.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Identification of abdominal Lymph Nodes (LN) that are suspicious for metastasis in T2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans is critical for staging of lymphoproliferative diseases. Prior work on LN detection has been limited to specific anatomical regions of the body (pelvis, rectum) in single MR slices. Therefore, the development of a universal approach to detect LN in full T2 MRI volumes is highly desirable.   Methods: In this study, a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) pipeline to universally identify abdominal LN in volumetric T2 MRI using neural networks is proposed. First, we trained various neural network models for detecting LN: Faster RCNN with and without Hard Negative Example Mining (HNEM), FCOS, FoveaBox, VFNet, and Detection Transformer (DETR). Next, we show that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) VFNet model with Adaptive Training Sample Selection (ATSS) outperforms Faster RCNN with HNEM. Finally, we ensembled models that surpassed a 45% mAP threshold. We found that the VFNet model and one-stage model ensemble can be interchangeably used in the CAD pipeline.   Results: Experiments on 122 test T2 MRI volumes revealed that VFNet achieved a 51.1% mAP and 78.7% recall at 4 false positives (FP) per volume, while the one-stage model ensemble achieved a mAP of 52.3% and sensitivity of 78.7% at 4FP.   Conclusion: Our contribution is a CAD pipeline that detects LN in T2 MRI volumes, resulting in a sensitivity improvement of $\sim$14 points over the current SOTA method for LN detection (sensitivity of 78.7% at 4 FP vs. 64.6% at 5 FP per volume).

- **Summary**: This paper discusses how to successfully digitize large-scale historical micro-data by augmenting optical character recognition (OCR) engines with pre- and post-processing methods. Although OCR software has improved dramatically in recent years due to improvements in machine learning, off-the-shelf OCR applications still present high error rates which limit their applications for accurate extraction of structured information. Complementing OCR with additional methods can however dramatically increase its success rate, making it a powerful and cost-efficient tool for economic historians. This paper showcases these methods and explains why they are useful. We apply them against two large balance sheet datasets and introduce quipucamayoc, a Python package containing these methods in a unified framework.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common public health issues the world is facing today. This disease has a high prevalence primarily in the elderly accompanying memory loss and cognitive decline. AD detection is a challenging task which many authors have developed numerous computerized automatic diagnosis systems utilizing neuroimaging and other clinical data. MRI scans provide high-intensity visible features, making these scans the most widely used brain imaging technique. In recent years deep learning has achieved leading success in medical image analysis. But a relatively little investigation has been done to apply deep learning techniques for the brain MRI classification. This paper explores the construction of several deep learning architectures evaluated on brain MRI images and segmented images. The idea behind segmented images investigates the influence of image segmentation step on deep learning classification. The image processing presented a pipeline consisting of pre-processing to enhance the MRI scans and post-processing consisting of a segmentation method for segmenting the brain tissues. The results show that the processed images achieved a better accuracy in the binary classification of AD vs. CN (Cognitively Normal) across four different architectures. ResNet architecture resulted in the highest prediction accuracy amongst the other architectures (90.83% for the original brain images and 93.50% for the processed images).

- **Summary**: The principle of Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR$^2$) has recently been proposed as a training objective for learning discriminative low-dimensional structures intrinsic to high-dimensional data to allow for more robust training than standard approaches, such as cross-entropy minimization. However, despite the advantages that have been shown for MCR$^2$ training, MCR$^2$ suffers from a significant computational cost due to the need to evaluate and differentiate a significant number of log-determinant terms that grows linearly with the number of classes. By taking advantage of variational forms of spectral functions of a matrix, we reformulate the MCR$^2$ objective to a form that can scale significantly without compromising training accuracy. Experiments in image classification demonstrate that our proposed formulation results in a significant speed up over optimizing the original MCR$^2$ objective directly and often results in higher quality learned representations. Further, our approach may be of independent interest in other models that require computation of log-determinant forms, such as in system identification or normalizing flow models.

- **Summary**: Modeling statistics of image priors is useful for image super-resolution, but little attention has been paid from the massive works of deep learning-based methods. In this work, we propose a Bayesian image restoration framework, where natural image statistics are modeled with the combination of smoothness and sparsity priors. Concretely, firstly we consider an ideal image as the sum of a smoothness component and a sparsity residual, and model real image degradation including blurring, downscaling, and noise corruption. Then, we develop a variational Bayesian approach to infer their posteriors. Finally, we implement the variational approach for single image super-resolution (SISR) using deep neural networks, and propose an unsupervised training strategy. The experiments on three image restoration tasks, \textit{i.e.,} ideal SISR, realistic SISR, and real-world SISR, demonstrate that our method has superior model generalizability against varying noise levels and degradation kernels and is effective in unsupervised SISR.

- **Summary**: Automatic teeth segmentation in panoramic x-ray images is an important research subject of the image analysis in dentistry. In this study, we propose a post-processing stage to obtain a segmentation map in which the objects in the image are separated, and apply this technique to tooth instance segmentation with U-Net network. The post-processing consists of grayscale morphological and filtering operations, which are applied to the sigmoid output of the network before binarization. A dice overlap score of 95.4 - 0.3% is obtained in overall teeth segmentation. The proposed post-processing stages reduce the mean error of tooth count to 6.15%, whereas the error without post-processing is 26.81%. The performances of both segmentation and tooth counting are the highest in the literature, to our knowledge. Moreover, this is achieved by using a relatively small training dataset, which consists of 105 images. Although the aim in this study is to segment tooth instances, the presented method is applicable to similar problems in other domains, such as separating the cell instances

- **Summary**: The dominant CNN-based methods for cross-view image geo-localization rely on polar transform and fail to model global correlation. We propose a pure transformer-based approach (TransGeo) to address these limitations from a different perspective. TransGeo takes full advantage of the strengths of transformer related to global information modeling and explicit position information encoding. We further leverage the flexibility of transformer input and propose an attention-guided non-uniform cropping method, so that uninformative image patches are removed with negligible drop on performance to reduce computation cost. The saved computation can be reallocated to increase resolution only for informative patches, resulting in performance improvement with no additional computation cost. This "attend and zoom-in" strategy is highly similar to human behavior when observing images. Remarkably, TransGeo achieves state-of-the-art results on both urban and rural datasets, with significantly less computation cost than CNN-based methods. It does not rely on polar transform and infers faster than CNN-based methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Jeff-Zilence/TransGeo2022.

- **Summary**: Deep multimodal learning has achieved great progress in recent years. However, current fusion approaches are static in nature, i.e., they process and fuse multimodal inputs with identical computation, without accounting for diverse computational demands of different multimodal data. In this work, we propose dynamic multimodal fusion (DynMM), a new approach that adaptively fuses multimodal data and generates data-dependent forward paths during inference. To this end, we propose a gating function to provide modality-level or fusion-level decisions on-the-fly based on multimodal features and a resource-aware loss function that encourages computational efficiency. Results on various multimodal tasks demonstrate the efficiency and wide applicability of our approach. For instance, DynMM can reduce the computation costs by 46.5% with only a negligible accuracy loss (CMU-MOSEI sentiment analysis) and improve segmentation performance with over 21% savings in computation (NYU Depth V2 semantic segmentation) when compared with static fusion approaches. We believe our approach opens a new direction towards dynamic multimodal network design, with applications to a wide range of multimodal tasks.

- **Summary**: Compositing-aware object search aims to find the most compatible objects for compositing given a background image and a query bounding box. Previous works focus on learning compatibility between the foreground object and background, but fail to learn other important factors from large-scale data, i.e. geometry and lighting. To move a step further, this paper proposes GALA (Geometry-and-Lighting-Aware), a generic foreground object search method with discriminative modeling on geometry and lighting compatibility for open-world image compositing. Remarkably, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the CAIS dataset and generalizes well on large-scale open-world datasets, i.e. Pixabay and Open Images. In addition, our method can effectively handle non-box scenarios, where users only provide background images without any input bounding box. A web demo (see supplementary materials) is built to showcase applications of the proposed method for compositing-aware search and automatic location/scale prediction for the foreground object.

- **Summary**: In recent years, with the vigorous development of the video game industry, the proportion of gaming videos on major video websites like YouTube has dramatically increased. However, relatively little research has been done on the automatic quality prediction of gaming videos, especially on those that fall in the category of "User-Generated-Content" (UGC). Since current leading general-purpose Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models do not perform well on this type of gaming videos, we have created a new VQA model specifically designed to succeed on UGC gaming videos, which we call the Gaming Video Quality Predictor (GAME-VQP). GAME-VQP successfully predicts the unique statistical characteristics of gaming videos by drawing upon features designed under modified natural scene statistics models, combined with gaming specific features learned by a Convolution Neural Network. We study the performance of GAME-VQP on a very recent large UGC gaming video database called LIVE-YT-Gaming, and find that it both outperforms other mainstream general VQA models as well as VQA models specifically designed for gaming videos. The new model will be made public after paper being accepted.

- **Summary**: This work aims to address the challenges in domain adaptation of 3D object detection using infrastructure LiDARs. We design a model DASE-ProPillars that can detect vehicles in infrastructure-based LiDARs in real-time. Our model uses PointPillars as the baseline model with additional modules to improve the 3D detection performance. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed modules in DASE-ProPillars, we train and evaluate the model on two datasets, the open source A9-Dataset and a semi-synthetic infrastructure dataset created within the Regensburg Next project. We do several sets of experiments for each module in the DASE-ProPillars detector that show that our model outperforms the SE-ProPillars baseline on the real A9 test set and a semi-synthetic A9 test set, while maintaining an inference speed of 45 Hz (22 ms). We apply domain adaptation from the semi-synthetic A9-Dataset to the semi-synthetic dataset from the Regensburg Next project by applying transfer learning and achieve a 3D mAP@0.25 of 93.49% on the Car class of the target test set using 40 recall positions.

- **Summary**: Human-robot handover is a fundamental yet challenging task in human-robot interaction and collaboration. Recently, remarkable progressions have been made in human-to-robot handovers of unknown objects by using learning-based grasp generators. However, how to responsively generate smooth motions to take an object from a human is still an open question. Specifically, planning motions that take human comfort into account is not a part of the human-robot handover process in most prior works. In this paper, we propose to generate smooth motions via an efficient model-predictive control (MPC) framework that integrates perception and complex domain-specific constraints into the optimization problem. We introduce a learning-based grasp reachability model to select candidate grasps which maximize the robot's manipulability, giving it more freedom to satisfy these constraints. Finally, we integrate a neural net force/torque classifier that detects contact events from noisy data. We conducted human-to-robot handover experiments on a diverse set of objects with several users (N=4) and performed a systematic evaluation of each module. The study shows that the users preferred our MPC approach over the baseline system by a large margin.

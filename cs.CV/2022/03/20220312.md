- **Summary**: Although achieving significant progress, existing deep generative inpainting methods are far from real-world applications due to the low generalization across different scenes. As a result, the generated images usually contain artifacts or the filled pixels differ greatly from the ground truth. Image-level predictive filtering is a widely used image restoration technique, predicting suitable kernels adaptively according to different input scenes. Inspired by this inherent advantage, we explore the possibility of addressing image inpainting as a filtering task. To this end, we first study the advantages and challenges of image-level predictive filtering for image inpainting: the method can preserve local structures and avoid artifacts but fails to fill large missing areas. Then, we propose semantic filtering by conducting filtering on the deep feature level, which fills the missing semantic information but fails to recover the details. To address the issues while adopting the respective advantages, we propose a novel filtering technique, i.e., Multilevel Interactive Siamese Filtering (MISF), which contains two branches: kernel prediction branch (KPB) and semantic & image filtering branch (SIFB). These two branches are interactively linked: SIFB provides multi-level features for KPB while KPB predicts dynamic kernels for SIFB. As a result, the final method takes the advantage of effective semantic & image-level filling for high-fidelity inpainting. We validate our method on three challenging datasets, i.e., Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four metrics, i.e., L1, PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

- **Summary**: Radiomics features extract quantitative information from medical images, towards the derivation of biomarkers for clinical tasks, such as diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response assessment. Different image discretization parameters (e.g. bin number or size), convolutional filters, segmentation perturbation, or multi-modality fusion levels can be used to generate radiomics features and ultimately signatures. Commonly, only one set of parameters is used; resulting in only one value or flavour for a given RF. We propose tensor radiomics (TR) where tensors of features calculated with multiple combinations of parameters (i.e. flavours) are utilized to optimize the construction of radiomics signatures. We present examples of TR as applied to PET/CT, MRI, and CT imaging invoking machine learning or deep learning solutions, and reproducibility analyses: (1) TR via varying bin sizes on CT images of lung cancer and PET-CT images of head & neck cancer (HNC) for overall survival prediction. A hybrid deep neural network, referred to as TR-Net, along with two ML-based flavour fusion methods showed improved accuracy compared to regular rediomics features. (2) TR built from different segmentation perturbations and different bin sizes for classification of late-stage lung cancer response to first-line immunotherapy using CT images. TR improved predicted patient responses. (3) TR via multi-flavour generated radiomics features in MR imaging showed improved reproducibility when compared to many single-flavour features. (4) TR via multiple PET/CT fusions in HNC. Flavours were built from different fusions using methods, such as Laplacian pyramids and wavelet transforms. TR improved overall survival prediction. Our results suggest that the proposed TR paradigm has the potential to improve performance capabilities in different medical imaging tasks.

- **Summary**: Video instance segmentation (VIS) task requires classifying, segmenting, and tracking object instances over all frames in a video clip. Recently, VisTR has been proposed as end-to-end transformer-based VIS framework, while demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. However, VisTR is slow to converge during training, requiring around 1000 GPU hours due to the high computational cost of its transformer attention module. To improve the training efficiency, we propose Deformable VisTR, leveraging spatio-temporal deformable attention module that only attends to a small fixed set of key spatio-temporal sampling points around a reference point. This enables Deformable VisTR to achieve linear computation in the size of spatio-temporal feature maps. Moreover, it can achieve on par performance as the original VisTR with 10$\times$ less GPU training hours. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the Youtube-VIS benchmark.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection plays a fundamental role in enabling autonomous driving, which is regarded as the significant key to unlocking the bottleneck of contemporary transportation systems from the perspectives of safety, mobility, and sustainability. Most of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection methods from point clouds are developed based on a single onboard LiDAR, whose performance will be inevitably limited by the range and occlusion, especially in dense traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textit{PillarGrid}, a novel cooperative perception method fusing information from multiple 3D LiDARs (both on-board and roadside), to enhance the situation awareness for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). PillarGrid consists of four main phases: 1) cooperative preprocessing of point clouds, 2) pillar-wise voxelization and feature extraction, 3) grid-wise deep fusion of features from multiple sensors, and 4) convolutional neural network (CNN)-based augmented 3D object detection. A novel cooperative perception platform is developed for model training and testing. Extensive experimentation shows that PillarGrid outperforms the SOTA single-LiDAR-based 3D object detection methods with respect to both accuracy and range by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Remarkable achievements have been attained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image-to-image translation. However, due to a tremendous amount of parameters, state-of-the-art GANs usually suffer from low efficiency and bulky memory usage. To tackle this challenge, firstly, this paper investigates GANs performance from a frequency perspective. The results show that GANs, especially small GANs lack the ability to generate high-quality high frequency information. To address this problem, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method referred to as wavelet knowledge distillation. Instead of directly distilling the generated images of teachers, wavelet knowledge distillation first decomposes the images into different frequency bands with discrete wavelet transformation and then only distills the high frequency bands. As a result, the student GAN can pay more attention to its learning on high frequency bands. Experiments demonstrate that our method leads to 7.08 times compression and 6.80 times acceleration on CycleGAN with almost no performance drop. Additionally, we have studied the relation between discriminators and generators which shows that the compression of discriminators can promote the performance of compressed generators.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of deep learning has significantly boomed the development of photorealistic style transfer. In this review, we reviewed the development of photorealistic style transfer starting from artistic style transfer and the contribution of traditional image processing techniques on photorealistic style transfer, including some work that had been completed in the Multimedia lab at the University of Alberta. Many techniques were discussed in this review. However, our focus is on VGG-based techniques, whitening and coloring transform (WCTs) based techniques, the combination of deep learning with traditional image processing techniques.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that enables collaborative model training while avoiding explicit data sharing. The inherent privacy-preserving property of FL algorithms makes them especially attractive to the medical field. However, in case of heterogeneous client data distributions, standard FL methods are unstable and require intensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. Conventional hyperparameter optimization algorithms are impractical in real-world FL applications as they involve numerous training trials, which are often not affordable with limited compute budgets. In this work, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning (RL)-based federated hyperparameter optimization algorithm, termed Auto-FedRL, in which an online RL agent can dynamically adjust hyperparameters of each client based on the current training progress. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate different search strategies and RL agents. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on a heterogeneous data split of the CIFAR-10 dataset as well as two real-world medical image segmentation datasets for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in chest CT and pancreas segmentation in abdominal CT.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers (ViTs) have gained increasing popularity as they are commonly believed to own higher modeling capacity and representation flexibility, than traditional convolutional networks. However, it is questionable whether such potential has been fully unleashed in practice, as the learned ViTs often suffer from over-smoothening, yielding likely redundant models. Recent works made preliminary attempts to identify and alleviate such redundancy, e.g., via regularizing embedding similarity or re-injecting convolution-like structures. However, a "head-to-toe assessment" regarding the extent of redundancy in ViTs, and how much we could gain by thoroughly mitigating such, has been absent for this field. This paper, for the first time, systematically studies the ubiquitous existence of redundancy at all three levels: patch embedding, attention map, and weight space. In view of them, we advocate a principle of diversity for training ViTs, by presenting corresponding regularizers that encourage the representation diversity and coverage at each of those levels, that enabling capturing more discriminative information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet with a number of ViT backbones validate the effectiveness of our proposals, largely eliminating the observed ViT redundancy and significantly boosting the model generalization. For example, our diversified DeiT obtains 0.70%~1.76% accuracy boosts on ImageNet with highly reduced similarity. Our codes are fully available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/Diverse-ViT.

- **Summary**: Due to the high cost of manually annotating medical images, especially for large-scale datasets, anomaly detection has been explored through training models with only normal data. Lacking prior knowledge of true anomalies is the main reason for the limited application of previous anomaly detection methods, especially in the medical image analysis realm. In this work, we propose a one-shot anomaly detection framework, namely LesionPaste, that utilizes true anomalies from a single annotated sample and synthesizes artificial anomalous samples for anomaly detection. First, a lesion bank is constructed by applying augmentation to randomly selected lesion patches. Then, MixUp is adopted to paste patches from the lesion bank at random positions in normal images to synthesize anomalous samples for training. Finally, a classification network is trained using the synthetic abnormal samples and the true normal data. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly-available medical image datasets with different types of abnormalities. On both datasets, our proposed LesionPaste largely outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection methods, and is on a par with the fully-supervised counterpart. To note, LesionPaste is even better than the fully-supervised method in detecting early-stage diabetic retinopathy.

- **Summary**: Facial action units (AUs) play an indispensable role in human emotion analysis. We observe that although AU-based high-level emotion analysis is urgently needed by real-world applications, frame-level AU results provided by previous works cannot be directly used for such analysis. Moreover, as AUs are dynamic processes, the utilization of global temporal information is important but has been gravely ignored in the literature. To this end, we propose EventFormer for AU event detection, which is the first work directly detecting AU events from a video sequence by viewing AU event detection as a multiple class-specific sets prediction problem. Extensive experiments conducted on a commonly used AU benchmark dataset, BP4D, show the superiority of EventFormer under suitable metrics.

- **Summary**: Translating visual data into natural language is essential for machines to understand the world and interact with humans. In this work, a comprehensive study is conducted on video paragraph captioning, with the goal to generate paragraph-level descriptions for a given video. However, current researches mainly focus on detecting objective facts, ignoring the needs to establish the logical associations between sentences and to discover more accurate emotions related to video contents. Such a problem impairs fluent and abundant expressions of predicted captions, which are far below human language tandards. To solve this problem, we propose to construct a large-scale emotion and logic driven multilingual dataset for this task. This dataset is named EMVPC (standing for "Emotional Video Paragraph Captioning") and contains 53 widely-used emotions in daily life, 376 common scenes corresponding to these emotions, 10,291 high-quality videos and 20,582 elaborated paragraph captions with English and Chinese versions. Relevant emotion categories, scene labels, emotion word labels and logic word labels are also provided in this new dataset. The proposed EMVPC dataset intends to provide full-fledged video paragraph captioning in terms of rich emotions, coherent logic and elaborate expressions, which can also benefit other tasks in vision-language fields. Furthermore, a comprehensive study is conducted through experiments on existing benchmark video paragraph captioning datasets and the proposed EMVPC. The stateof-the-art schemes from different visual captioning tasks are compared in terms of 15 popular metrics, and their detailed objective as well as subjective results are summarized. Finally, remaining problems and future directions of video paragraph captioning are also discussed. The unique perspective of this work is expected to boost further development in video paragraph captioning research.

- **Summary**: Non-exemplar class-incremental learning is to recognize both the old and new classes when old class samples cannot be saved. It is a challenging task since representation optimization and feature retention can only be achieved under supervision from new classes. To address this problem, we propose a novel self-sustaining representation expansion scheme. Our scheme consists of a structure reorganization strategy that fuses main-branch expansion and side-branch updating to maintain the old features, and a main-branch distillation scheme to transfer the invariant knowledge. Furthermore, a prototype selection mechanism is proposed to enhance the discrimination between the old and new classes by selectively incorporating new samples into the distillation process. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate significant incremental performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3%, 3% and 6%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models tend to underperform in the presence of domain shifts. Domain transfer has recently emerged as a promising approach wherein images exhibiting a domain shift are transformed into other domains for augmentation or adaptation. However, with the absence of paired and annotated images, models merely learned by adversarial loss and cycle consistency loss could result in poor consistency of anatomy structures during the translation. Additionally, the complexity of learning multi-domain transfer could significantly increase with the number of target domains and source images. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain transfer network, named MDT-Net, to address the limitations above through perceptual supervision. Specifically, our model consists of a single encoder-decoder network and multiple domain-specific transfer modules to disentangle feature representations of the anatomy content and domain variance. Owing to this architecture, the model could significantly reduce the complexity when the translation is conducted among multiple domains. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we evaluate our model qualitatively and quantitatively on RETOUCH, an OCT dataset comprising scans from three different scanner devices (domains). Furthermore, we take the transfer results as additional training data for fluid segmentation to prove the advantage of our model indirectly, i.e., in the task of data adaptation and augmentation. Experimental results show that our method could bring universal improvement in these segmentation tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of MDT-Net in multi-domain transfer.



### Differentiated Relevances Embedding for Group-based Referring Expression Comprehension

- **Summary**: The key of referring expression comprehension lies in capturing the cross-modal visual-linguistic relevance. Existing works typically model the cross-modal relevance in each image, where the anchor object/expression and their positive expression/object have the same attribute as the negative expression/object, but with different attribute values. These objects/expressions are exclusively utilized to learn the implicit representation of the attribute by a pair of different values, which however impedes the accuracies of the attribute representations, expression/object representations, and their cross-modal relevances since each anchor object/expression usually has multiple attributes while each attribute usually has multiple potential values. To this end, we investigate a novel REC problem named Group-based REC, where each object/expression is simultaneously employed to construct the multiple triplets among the semantically similar images. To tackle the explosion of the negatives and the differentiation of the anchor-negative relevance scores, we propose the multi-group self-paced relevance learning schema to adaptively assign within-group object-expression pairs with different priorities based on their cross-modal relevances. Since the average cross-modal relevance varies a lot across different groups, we further design an across-group relevance constraint to balance the bias of the group priority. Experiments on three standard REC benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: The recent large-scale vision-language pre-training (VLP) of dual-stream architectures (e.g., CLIP) with a tremendous amount of image-text pair data, has shown its superiority on various multimodal alignment tasks. Despite its success, the resulting models are not capable of multimodal generative tasks due to the weak text encoder. To tackle this problem, we propose to augment the dual-stream VLP model with a textual pre-trained language model (PLM) via vision-language knowledge distillation (VLKD), enabling the capability for multimodal generation. VLKD is pretty data- and computation-efficient compared to the pre-training from scratch. Experimental results show that the resulting model has strong zero-shot performance on multimodal generation tasks, such as open-ended visual question answering and image captioning. For example, it achieves 44.5% zero-shot accuracy on the VQAv2 dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art zero-shot model with $7\times$ fewer parameters. Furthermore, the original textual language understanding and generation ability of the PLM is maintained after VLKD, which makes our model versatile for both multimodal and unimodal tasks.



### Joint CNN and Transformer Network via weakly supervised Learning for efficient crowd counting

- **Summary**: Currently, for crowd counting, the fully supervised methods via density map estimation are the mainstream research directions. However, such methods need location-level annotation of persons in an image, which is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, the weakly supervised method just relying upon the count-level annotation is urgently needed. Since CNN is not suitable for modeling the global context and the interactions between image patches, crowd counting with weakly supervised learning via CNN generally can not show good performance. The weakly supervised model via Transformer was sequentially proposed to model the global context and learn contrast features. However, the transformer directly partitions the crowd images into a series of tokens, which may not be a good choice due to each pedestrian being an independent individual, and the parameter number of the network is very large. Hence, we propose a Joint CNN and Transformer Network (JCTNet) via weakly supervised learning for crowd counting in this paper. JCTNet consists of three parts: CNN feature extraction module (CFM), Transformer feature extraction module (TFM), and counting regression module (CRM). In particular, the CFM extracts crowd semantic information features, then sends their patch partitions to TRM for modeling global context, and CRM is used to predict the number of people. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that JCTNet can effectively focus on the crowd regions and obtain superior weakly supervised counting performance on five mainstream datasets. The number of parameters of the model can be reduced by about 67%~73% compared with the pure Transformer works. We also tried to explain the phenomenon that a model constrained only by count-level annotations can still focus on the crowd regions. We believe our work can promote further research in this field.

- **Summary**: Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) leverages a labeled domain to learn an object detector generalizing to a novel domain free of annotations. Recent advances align class-conditional distributions by narrowing down cross-domain prototypes (class centers). Though great success,they ignore the significant within-class variance and the domain-mismatched semantics within the training batch, leading to a sub-optimal adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SemantIc-complete Graph MAtching (SIGMA) framework for DAOD, which completes mismatched semantics and reformulates the adaptation with graph matching. Specifically, we design a Graph-embedded Semantic Completion module (GSC) that completes mismatched semantics through generating hallucination graph nodes in missing categories. Then, we establish cross-image graphs to model class-conditional distributions and learn a graph-guided memory bank for better semantic completion in turn. After representing the source and target data as graphs, we reformulate the adaptation as a graph matching problem, i.e., finding well-matched node pairs across graphs to reduce the domain gap, which is solved with a novel Bipartite Graph Matching adaptor (BGM). In a nutshell, we utilize graph nodes to establish semantic-aware node affinity and leverage graph edges as quadratic constraints in a structure-aware matching loss, achieving fine-grained adaptation with a node-to-node graph matching. Extensive experiments verify that SIGMA outperforms existing works significantly. Our code is available at https://github.com/CityU-AIM-Group/SIGMA.

- **Summary**: Segmentation-based methods have achieved great success for arbitrary shape text detection. However, separating neighboring text instances is still one of the most challenging problems due to the complexity of texts in scene images. In this paper, we propose an innovative Kernel Proposal Network (dubbed KPN) for arbitrary shape text detection. The proposed KPN can separate neighboring text instances by classifying different texts into instance-independent feature maps, meanwhile avoiding the complex aggregation process existing in segmentation-based arbitrary shape text detection methods. To be concrete, our KPN will predict a Gaussian center map for each text image, which will be used to extract a series of candidate kernel proposals (i.e., dynamic convolution kernel) from the embedding feature maps according to their corresponding keypoint positions. To enforce the independence between kernel proposals, we propose a novel orthogonal learning loss (OLL) via orthogonal constraints. Specifically, our kernel proposals contain important self-information learned by network and location information by position embedding. Finally, kernel proposals will individually convolve all embedding feature maps for generating individual embedded maps of text instances. In this way, our KPN can effectively separate neighboring text instances and improve the robustness against unclear boundaries. To our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce the dynamic convolution kernel strategy to efficiently and effectively tackle the adhesion problem of neighboring text instances in text detection. Experimental results on challenging datasets verify the impressive performance and efficiency of our method. The code and model are available at https://github.com/GXYM/KPN.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art video deblurring methods often adopt recurrent neural networks to model the temporal dependency between the frames. While the hidden states play key role in delivering information to the next frame, abrupt motion blur tend to weaken the relevance in the neighbor frames. In this paper, we propose recurrence-in-recurrence network architecture to cope with the limitations of short-ranged memory. We employ additional recurrent units inside the RNN cell. First, we employ inner-recurrence module (IRM) to manage the long-ranged dependency in a sequence. IRM learns to keep track of the cell memory and provides complementary information to find the deblurred frames. Second, we adopt an attention-based temporal blending strategy to extract the necessary part of the information in the local neighborhood. The adpative temporal blending (ATB) can either attenuate or amplify the features by the spatial attention. Our extensive experimental results and analysis validate the effectiveness of IRM and ATB on various RNN architectures.

- **Summary**: Thanks to the diffusion of the Internet of Things, nowadays it is possible to sense human mobility almost in real time using unconventional methods (e.g., number of bikes in a bike station). Due to the diffusion of such technologies, the last years have witnessed a significant growth of human mobility studies, motivated by their importance in a wide range of applications, from traffic management to public security and computational epidemiology. A mobility task that is becoming prominent is crowd flow prediction, i.e., forecasting aggregated incoming and outgoing flows in the locations of a geographic region. Although several deep learning approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, their usage is limited to specific types of spatial tessellations and cannot provide sufficient explanations of their predictions. We propose CrowdNet, a solution to crowd flow prediction based on graph convolutional networks. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, CrowdNet can be used with regions of irregular shapes and provide meaningful explanations of the predicted crowd flows. We conduct experiments on public data varying the spatio-temporal granularity of crowd flows to show the superiority of our model with respect to existing methods, and we investigate CrowdNet's reliability to missing or noisy input data. Our model is a step forward in the design of reliable deep learning models to predict and explain human displacements in urban environments.

- **Summary**: Many video instance segmentation (VIS) methods partition a video sequence into individual frames to detect and segment objects frame by frame. However, such a frame-in frame-out (FiFo) pipeline is ineffective to exploit the temporal information. Based on the fact that adjacent frames in a short clip are highly coherent in content, we propose to extend the one-stage FiFo framework to a clip-in clip-out (CiCo) one, which performs VIS clip by clip. Specifically, we stack FPN features of all frames in a short video clip to build a spatio-temporal feature cube, and replace the 2D conv layers in the prediction heads and the mask branch with 3D conv layers, forming clip-level prediction heads (CPH) and clip-level mask heads (CMH). Then the clip-level masks of an instance can be generated by feeding its box-level predictions from CPH and clip-level features from CMH into a small fully convolutional network. A clip-level segmentation loss is proposed to ensure that the generated instance masks are temporally coherent in the clip. The proposed CiCo strategy is free of inter-frame alignment, and can be easily embedded into existing FiFo based VIS approaches. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our CiCo strategy, we apply it to two representative FiFo methods, Yolact \cite{bolya2019yolact} and CondInst \cite{tian2020conditional}, resulting in two new one-stage VIS models, namely CiCo-Yolact and CiCo-CondInst, which achieve 37.1/37.3\%, 35.2/35.4\% and 17.2/18.0\% mask AP using the ResNet50 backbone, and 41.8/41.4\%, 38.0/38.9\% and 18.0/18.2\% mask AP using the Swin Transformer tiny backbone on YouTube-VIS 2019, 2021 and OVIS valid sets, respectively, recording new state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims at estimating bounding boxes and identities of objects in videos. Most methods can be roughly classified as tracking-by-detection and joint-detection-association paradigms. Although the latter has elicited more attention and demonstrates comparable performance relative than the former, we claim that the tracking-by-detection paradigm is still the optimal solution in terms of tracking accuracy,such as ByteTrack,which achieves 80.3 MOTA, 77.3 IDF1 and 63.1 HOTA on the test set of MOT17 with 30 FPS running speed on a single V100 GPU.However, under complex perspectives such as vehicle and UAV acceleration, the performance of such a tracker using uniform Kalman filter will be greatly affected, resulting in tracking loss.In this paper, we propose a variable speed Kalman filter algorithm based on environmental feedback and improve the matching process, which can greatly improve the tracking effect in complex variable speed scenes while maintaining high tracking accuracy in relatively static scenes. Eventually, higher MOTA and IDF1 results can be achieved on MOT17 test set than ByteTrack

- **Summary**: Estimating clinically-relevant vascular features following vessel segmentation is a standard pipeline for retinal vessel analysis, which provides potential ocular biomarkers for both ophthalmic disease and systemic disease. In this work, we integrate these clinical features into a novel vascular feature optimised loss function (VAFO-Loss), in order to regularise networks to produce segmentation maps, with which more accurate vascular features can be derived. Two common vascular features, vessel density and fractal dimension, are identified to be sensitive to intra-segment misclassification, which is a well-recognised problem in multi-class artery/vein segmentation particularly hindering the estimation of these vascular features. Thus we encode these two features into VAFO-Loss. We first show that incorporating our end-to-end VAFO-Loss in standard segmentation networks indeed improves vascular feature estimation, yielding quantitative improvement in stroke incidence prediction, a clinical downstream task. We also report a technically interesting finding that the trained segmentation network, albeit biased by the feature optimised loss VAFO-Loss, shows statistically significant improvement in segmentation metrics, compared to those trained with other state-of-the-art segmentation losses.

- **Summary**: Automated salient object detection (SOD) plays an increasingly crucial role in many computer vision applications. By reformulating the depth information as supervision rather than as input, depth-supervised convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved promising results on both RGB and RGB-D SOD scenarios with the merits of no requirements for extra depth networks and depth inputs in the inference stage. This paper, for the first time, seeks to expand the applicability of depth supervision to the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we develop a Depth-supervised Fusion TRansformer (DFTR), to further improve the accuracy of both RGB and RGB-D SOD. The proposed DFTR involves three primary features: 1) DFTR, to the best of our knowledge, is the first pure Transformer-based model for depth-supervised SOD; 2) A multi-scale feature aggregation (MFA) module is proposed to fully exploit the multi-scale features encoded by the Swin Transformer in a coarse-to-fine manner; 3) To enable bidirectional information flow across different streams of features, a novel multi-stage feature fusion (MFF) module is further integrated into our DFTR with the emphasis on salient regions at different network learning stages. We extensively evaluate the proposed DFTR on ten benchmarking datasets. Experimental results show that our DFTR consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for both RGB and RGB-D SOD tasks. The code and model will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: 4D CT imaging is an essential component of radiotherapy of thoracic/abdominal tumors. 4D CT images are, however, often affected by artifacts that compromise treatment planning quality. In this work, deep learning (DL)-based conditional inpainting is proposed to restore anatomically correct image information of artifact-affected areas. The restoration approach consists of a two-stage process: DL-based detection of common interpolation (INT) and double structure (DS) artifacts, followed by conditional inpainting applied to the artifact areas. In this context, conditional refers to a guidance of the inpainting process by patient-specific image data to ensure anatomically reliable results. The study is based on 65 in-house 4D CT images of lung cancer patients (48 with only slight artifacts, 17 with pronounced artifacts) and two publicly available 4D CT data sets that serve as independent external test sets. Automated artifact detection revealed a ROC-AUC of 0.99 for INT and of 0.97 for DS artifacts (in-house data). The proposed inpainting method decreased the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 52%(INT) and 59% (DS) for the in-house data. For the external test data sets, the RMSE improvement is similar (50% and 59 %, respectively). Applied to 4D CT data with pronounced artifacts (not part of the training set), 72% of the detectable artifacts were removed. The results highlight the potential of DL-based inpainting for restoration of artifact-affected 4D CT data. Compared to recent 4D CT inpainting and restoration approaches, the proposed methodology illustrates the advantages of exploiting patient-specific prior image information.

- **Summary**: Accurate anatomical landmark detection plays an increasingly vital role in medical image analysis. Although existing methods achieve satisfying performance, they are mostly based on CNN and specialized for a single domain say associated with a particular anatomical region. In this work, we propose a universal model for multi-domain landmark detection by taking advantage of transformer for modeling long dependencies and develop a domain-adaptive transformer model, named as DATR, which is trained on multiple mixed datasets from different anatomies and capable of detecting landmarks of any image from those anatomies. The proposed DATR exhibits three primary features: (i) It is the first universal model which introduces transformer as an encoder for multi-anatomy landmark detection; (ii) We design a domain-adaptive transformer for anatomy-aware landmark detection, which can be effectively extended to any other transformer network; (iii) Following previous studies, we employ a light-weighted guidance network, which encourages the transformer network to detect more accurate landmarks. We carry out experiments on three widely used X-ray datasets for landmark detection, which have 1,588 images and 62 landmarks in total, including three different anatomies (head, hand, and chest). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DATR achieves state-of-the-art performances by most metrics and behaves much better than any previous convolution-based models. The code will be released publicly.

- **Summary**: Rolling shutter (RS) distortion can be interpreted as the result of picking a row of pixels from instant global shutter (GS) frames over time during the exposure of the RS camera. This means that the information of each instant GS frame is partially, yet sequentially, embedded into the row-dependent distortion. Inspired by this fact, we address the challenging task of reversing this process, i.e., extracting undistorted GS frames from images suffering from RS distortion. However, since RS distortion is coupled with other factors such as readout settings and the relative velocity of scene elements to the camera, models that only exploit the geometric correlation between temporally adjacent images suffer from poor generality in processing data with different readout settings and dynamic scenes with both camera motion and object motion. In this paper, instead of two consecutive frames, we propose to exploit a pair of images captured by dual RS cameras with reversed RS directions for this highly challenging task. Grounded on the symmetric and complementary nature of dual reversed distortion, we develop a novel end-to-end model, IFED, to generate dual optical flow sequence through iterative learning of the velocity field during the RS time. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IFED is superior to naive cascade schemes, as well as the state-of-the-art which utilizes adjacent RS images. Most importantly, although it is trained on a synthetic dataset, IFED is shown to be effective at retrieving GS frame sequences from real-world RS distorted images of dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: While NeRF-based 3D-aware image generation methods enable viewpoint control, limitations still remain to be adopted to various 3D applications. Due to their view-dependent and light-entangled volume representation, the 3D geometry presents unrealistic quality and the color should be re-rendered for every desired viewpoint. To broaden the 3D applicability from 3D-aware image generation to 3D-controllable object generation, we propose the factorized representations which are view-independent and light-disentangled, and training schemes with randomly sampled light conditions. We demonstrate the superiority of our method by visualizing factorized representations, re-lighted images, and albedo-textured meshes. In addition, we show that our approach improves the quality of the generated geometry via visualization and quantitative comparison. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that extracts albedo-textured meshes with unposed 2D images without any additional labels or assumptions.

- **Summary**: Echocardiography is widely used to clinical practice for diagnosis and treatment, e.g., on the common congenital heart defects. The traditional manual manipulation is error-prone due to the staff shortage, excess workload, and less experience, leading to the urgent requirement of an automated computer-aided reporting system to lighten the workload of ultrasonologists considerably and assist them in decision making. Despite some recent successful attempts in automatical medical report generation, they are trapped in the ultrasound report generation, which involves unstructured-view images and topic-related descriptions. To this end, we investigate the task of the unstructured-view topic-related ultrasound report generation, and propose a novel factored attention and embedding model (termed FAE-Gen). The proposed FAE-Gen mainly consists of two modules, i.e., view-guided factored attention and topic-oriented factored embedding, which 1) capture the homogeneous and heterogeneous morphological characteristic across different views, and 2) generate the descriptions with different syntactic patterns and different emphatic contents for different topics. Experimental evaluations are conducted on a to-be-released large-scale clinical cardiovascular ultrasound dataset (CardUltData). Both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of FAE-Gen over seven commonly-used metrics.

- **Summary**: Computer vision-based parking lot management methods have been extensively researched upon owing to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness. To evaluate such methods authors often employ publicly available parking lot image datasets. In this study, we surveyed and compared robust publicly available image datasets specifically crafted to test computer vision-based methods for parking lot management approaches and consequently present a systematic and comprehensive review of existing works that employ such datasets. The literature review identified relevant gaps that require further research, such as the requirement of dataset-independent approaches and methods suitable for autonomous detection of position of parking spaces. In addition, we have noticed that several important factors such as the presence of the same cars across consecutive images, have been neglected in most studies, thereby rendering unrealistic assessment protocols. Furthermore, the analysis of the datasets also revealed that certain features that should be present when developing new benchmarks, such as the availability of video sequences and images taken in more diverse conditions, including nighttime and snow, have not been incorporated.

- **Summary**: Existing unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) methods focus on adapting a model trained on a source domain to a fixed target domain. However, an adapted ReID model usually only works well on a certain target domain, but can hardly memorize the source domain knowledge and generalize to upcoming unseen data. In this paper, we propose unsupervised lifelong person ReID, which focuses on continuously conducting unsupervised domain adaptation on new domains without forgetting the knowledge learnt from old domains. To tackle unsupervised lifelong ReID, we conduct a contrastive rehearsal on a small number of stored old samples while sequentially adapting to new domains. We further set an image-to-image similarity constraint between old and new models to regularize the model updates in a way that suits old knowledge. We sequentially train our model on several large-scale datasets in an unsupervised manner and test it on all seen domains as well as several unseen domains to validate the generalizability of our method. Our proposed unsupervised lifelong method achieves strong generalizability, which significantly outperforms previous lifelong methods on both seen and unseen domains. Code will be made available at https://github.com/chenhao2345/UCR.

- **Summary**: Being able to explain the prediction to clinical end-users is a necessity to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) models for clinical decision support. For medical images, a feature attribution map, or heatmap, is the most common form of explanation that highlights important features for AI models' prediction. However, it is unknown how well heatmaps perform on explaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each image modality or channel visualizes distinct clinical information of the same underlying biomedical phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically important but technically ignored problem, we propose the modality-specific feature importance (MSFI) metric. It encodes clinical image and explanation interpretation patterns of modality prioritization and modality-specific feature localization. We conduct a clinical requirement-grounded, systematic evaluation using computational methods and a clinician user study. Results show that the examined 16 heatmap algorithms failed to fulfill clinical requirements to correctly indicate AI model decision process or decision quality. The evaluation and MSFI metric can guide the design and selection of XAI algorithms to meet clinical requirements on multi-modal explanation.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces the novel CNN-based encoder Twin Embedding Network (TEN), for the jigsaw puzzle problem (JPP), which represents a puzzle piece with respect to its boundary in a latent embedding space. Combining this latent representation with a simple distance measure, we demonstrate improved accuracy levels of our newly proposed pairwise compatibility measure (CM), compared to that of various classical methods, for degraded puzzles with eroded tile boundaries. We focus on this problem instance for our case study, as it serves as an appropriate testbed for real-world scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrated an improvement of up to 8.5% and 16.8% in reconstruction accuracy, for so-called Type-1 and Type-2 problem variants, respectively. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that TEN is faster by a few orders of magnitude, on average, than a typical deep neural network (NN) model, i.e., it is as fast as the classical methods. In this regard, the paper makes a significant first attempt at bridging the gap between the relatively low accuracy (of classical methods and the intensive computational complexity (of NN models), for practical, real-world puzzle-like problems.

- **Summary**: Joint source and channel coding (JSCC) for image transmission has attracted increasing attention due to its robustness and high efficiency. However, the existing deep JSCC research mainly focuses on minimizing the distortion between the transmitted and received information under a fixed number of available channels. Therefore, the transmitted rate may be far more than its required minimum value. In this paper, an adaptive information bottleneck (IB) guided joint source and channel coding (AIB-JSCC) method is proposed for image transmission. The goal of AIB-JSCC is to reduce the transmission rate while improving the image reconstruction quality. In particular, a new IB objective for image transmission is proposed so as to minimize the distortion and the transmission rate. A mathematically tractable lower bound on the proposed objective is derived, and then, adopted as the loss function of AIB-JSCC. To trade off compression and reconstruction quality, an adaptive algorithm is proposed to adjust the hyperparameter of the proposed loss function dynamically according to the distortion during the training. Experimental results show that AIB-JSCC can significantly reduce the required amount of transmitted data and improve the reconstruction quality and downstream task accuracy.

- **Summary**: Recovering a high dynamic range (HDR) image from a single low dynamic range (LDR) image, namely inverse tone mapping (ITM), is challenging due to the lack of information in over- and under-exposed regions. Current methods focus exclusively on training high-performing but computationally inefficient ITM models, which in turn hinder deployment of the ITM models in resource-constrained environments with limited computing power such as edge and mobile device applications.   To this end, we propose combining efficient operations of deep neural networks with a novel mixed quantization scheme to construct a well-performing but computationally efficient mixed quantization network (MQN) which can perform single image ITM on mobile platforms. In the ablation studies, we explore the effect of using different attention mechanisms, quantization schemes, and loss functions on the performance of MQN in ITM tasks. In the comparative analyses, ITM models trained using MQN perform on par with the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. MQN models provide up to 10 times improvement on latency and 25 times improvement on memory consumption.

- **Summary**: Continual/lifelong learning from a non-stationary input data stream is a cornerstone of intelligence. Despite their phenomenal performance in a wide variety of applications, deep neural networks are prone to forgetting their previously learned information upon learning new ones. This phenomenon is called "catastrophic forgetting" and is deeply rooted in the stability-plasticity dilemma. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks has become an active field of research in recent years. In particular, gradient projection-based methods have recently shown exceptional performance at overcoming catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes two biologically-inspired mechanisms based on sparsity and heterogeneous dropout that significantly increase a continual learner's performance over a long sequence of tasks. Our proposed approach builds on the Gradient Projection Memory (GPM) framework. We leverage k-winner activations in each layer of a neural network to enforce layer-wise sparse activations for each task, together with a between-task heterogeneous dropout that encourages the network to use non-overlapping activation patterns between different tasks. In addition, we introduce two new benchmarks for continual learning under distributional shift, namely Continual Swiss Roll and ImageNet SuperDog-40. Lastly, we provide an in-depth analysis of our proposed method and demonstrate a significant performance boost on various benchmark continual learning problems.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained significant popularity in orthopedic imaging in recent years due to their ability to solve fracture classification problems. A common criticism of CNNs is their opaque learning and reasoning process, making it difficult to trust machine diagnosis and the subsequent adoption of such algorithms in clinical setting. This is especially true when the CNN is trained with limited amount of medical data, which is a common issue as curating sufficiently large amount of annotated medical imaging data is a long and costly process. While interest has been devoted to explaining CNN learnt knowledge by visualizing network attention, the utilization of the visualized attention to improve network learning has been rarely investigated. This paper explores the effectiveness of regularizing CNN network with human-provided attention guidance on where in the image the network should look for answering clues. On two orthopedics radiographic fracture classification datasets, through extensive experiments we demonstrate that explicit human-guided attention indeed can direct correct network attention and consequently significantly improve classification performance. The development code for the proposed attention guidance is publicly available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: We present an algorithm, Fourier Activity Recognition (FAR), for UAV video activity recognition. Our formulation uses a novel Fourier object disentanglement method to innately separate out the human agent (which is typically small) from the background. Our disentanglement technique operates in the frequency domain to characterize the extent of temporal change of spatial pixels, and exploits convolution-multiplication properties of Fourier transform to map this representation to the corresponding object-background entangled features obtained from the network. To encapsulate contextual information and long-range space-time dependencies, we present a novel Fourier Attention algorithm, which emulates the benefits of self-attention by modeling the weighted outer product in the frequency domain. Our Fourier attention formulation uses much fewer computations than self-attention. We have evaluated our approach on multiple UAV datasets including UAV Human RGB, UAV Human Night, Drone Action, and NEC Drone. We demonstrate a relative improvement of 8.02% - 38.69% in top-1 accuracy and up to 3 times faster over prior works.

- **Summary**: Capsule networks are designed to present the objects by a set of parts and their relationships, which provide an insight into the procedure of visual perception. Although recent works have shown the success of capsule networks on simple objects like digits, the human faces with homologous structures, which are suitable for capsules to describe, have not been explored. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Parsing Capsule Network (HP-Capsule) for unsupervised face subpart-part discovery. When browsing large-scale face images without labels, the network first encodes the frequently observed patterns with a set of explainable subpart capsules. Then, the subpart capsules are assembled into part-level capsules through a Transformer-based Parsing Module (TPM) to learn the compositional relations between them. During training, as the face hierarchy is progressively built and refined, the part capsules adaptively encode the face parts with semantic consistency. HP-Capsule extends the application of capsule networks from digits to human faces and takes a step forward to show how the neural networks understand homologous objects without human intervention. Besides, HP-Capsule gives unsupervised face segmentation results by the covered regions of part capsules, enabling qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Experiments on BP4D and Multi-PIE datasets show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) has greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the \textit{homogeneous word embeddings} caused by reduced capacity, and \textit{varied distribution of weights}. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rates on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.

- **Summary**: Advanced driver assistance and automated driving systems should be capable of predicting and avoiding dangerous situations. This study proposes a method to predict potentially dangerous cut-in maneuvers happening in the ego lane. We follow a computer vision-based approach that only employs a single in-vehicle RGB camera, and we classify the target vehicle's maneuver based on the recent video frames. Our algorithm consists of a CNN-based vehicle detection and tracking step and an LSTM-based maneuver classification step. It is more computationally efficient than other vision-based methods since it exploits a small number of features for the classification step rather than feeding CNNs with RGB frames. We evaluated our approach on a publicly available driving dataset and a lane change detection dataset. We obtained 0.9585 accuracy with side-aware two-class (cut-in vs. lane-pass) classification models. Experiment results also reveal that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches when used for lane change detection.

- **Summary**: How important are training details and datasets to recent optical flow models like RAFT? And do they generalize? To explore these questions, rather than develop a new model, we revisit three prominent models, PWC-Net, IRR-PWC and RAFT, with a common set of modern training techniques and datasets, and observe significant performance gains, demonstrating the importance and generality of these training details. Our newly trained PWC-Net and IRR-PWC models show surprisingly large improvements, up to 30% versus original published results on Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks. They outperform the more recent Flow1D on KITTI 2015 while being 3x faster during inference. Our newly trained RAFT achieves an Fl-all score of 4.31% on KITTI 2015, more accurate than all published optical flow methods at the time of writing. Our results demonstrate the benefits of separating the contributions of models, training techniques and datasets when analyzing performance gains of optical flow methods. Our source code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Face clustering is an essential task in computer vision due to the explosion of related applications such as augmented reality or photo album management. The main challenge of this task lies in the imperfectness of similarities among image feature representations. Given an existing feature extraction model, it is still an unresolved problem that how can the inherent characteristics of similarities of unlabelled images be leveraged to improve the clustering performance. Motivated by answering the question, we develop an effective unsupervised method, named as FaceMap, by formulating face clustering as a process of non-overlapping community detection, and minimizing the entropy of information flows on a network of images. The entropy is denoted by the map equation and its minimum represents the least description of paths among images in expectation. Inspired by observations on the ranked transition probabilities in the affinity graph constructed from facial images, we develop an outlier detection strategy to adaptively adjust transition probabilities among images. Experiments with ablation studies demonstrate that FaceMap significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-arts on three popular large-scale datasets for face clustering, e.g., an absolute improvement of more than $10\%$ and $4\%$ comparing with prior unsupervised and supervised methods respectively in terms of average of Pairwise F-score. Our code is publicly available on github.

- **Summary**: Understanding a person's behavior from their 3D motion is a fundamental problem in computer vision with many applications. An important component of this problem is 3D Temporal Action Localization (3D-TAL), which involves recognizing what actions a person is performing, and when. State-of-the-art 3D-TAL methods employ a two-stage approach in which the action span detection task and the action recognition task are implemented as a cascade. This approach, however, limits the possibility of error-correction. In contrast, we propose LocATe, an end-to-end approach that jointly localizes and recognizes actions in a 3D sequence. Further, unlike existing autoregressive models that focus on modeling the local context in a sequence, LocATe's transformer model is capable of capturing long-term correlations between actions in a sequence. Unlike transformer-based object-detection and classification models which consider image or patch features as input, the input in 3D-TAL is a long sequence of highly correlated frames. To handle the high-dimensional input, we implement an effective input representation, and overcome the diffuse attention across long time horizons by introducing sparse attention in the model. LocATe outperforms previous approaches on the existing PKU-MMD 3D-TAL benchmark (mAP=93.2%). Finally, we argue that benchmark datasets are most useful where there is clear room for performance improvement. To that end, we introduce a new, challenging, and more realistic benchmark dataset, BABEL-TAL-20 (BT20), where the performance of state-of-the-art methods is significantly worse. The dataset and code for the method will be available for research purposes.

- **Summary**: This paper substantially extends our work published at ECCV, in which an intermediate-level attack was proposed to improve the transferability of some baseline adversarial examples. Specifically, we advocate a framework in which a direct linear mapping from the intermediate-level discrepancies (between adversarial features and benign features) to prediction loss of the adversarial example is established. By delving deep into the core components of such a framework, we show that 1) a variety of linear regression models can all be considered in order to establish the mapping, 2) the magnitude of the finally obtained intermediate-level adversarial discrepancy is correlated with the transferability, 3) further boost of the performance can be achieved by performing multiple runs of the baseline attack with random initialization. In addition, by leveraging these findings, we achieve new state-of-the-arts on transfer-based $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ attacks.

- **Summary**: Combining information from multi-view images is crucial to improve the performance and robustness of automated methods for disease diagnosis. However, due to the non-alignment characteristics of multi-view images, building correlation and data fusion across views largely remain an open problem. In this study, we present TransFusion, a Transformer-based architecture to merge divergent multi-view imaging information using convolutional layers and powerful attention mechanisms. In particular, the Divergent Fusion Attention (DiFA) module is proposed for rich cross-view context modeling and semantic dependency mining, addressing the critical issue of capturing long-range correlations between unaligned data from different image views. We further propose the Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) to collect global correspondence of multi-scale feature representations. We evaluate TransFusion on the Multi-Disease, Multi-View \& Multi-Center Right Ventricular Segmentation in Cardiac MRI (M\&Ms-2) challenge cohort. TransFusion demonstrates leading performance against the state-of-the-art methods and opens up new perspectives for multi-view imaging integration towards robust medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Many multi-object tracking (MOT) methods follow the framework of "tracking by detection", which associates the target objects-of-interest based on the detection results. However, due to the separate models for detection and association, the tracking results are not optimal.Moreover, the speed is limited by some cumbersome association methods to achieve high tracking performance. In this work, we propose an end-to-end MOT method, with a Gaussian filter-inspired dynamic search region refinement module to dynamically filter and refine the search region by considering both the template information from the past frames and the detection results from the current frame with little computational burden, and a lightweight attention-based tracking head to achieve the effective fine-grained instance association. Extensive experiments and ablation study on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance with reasonable speed.

- **Summary**: Using deep learning, we now have the ability to create exceptionally good semantic segmentation systems; however, collecting the prerequisite pixel-wise annotations for training images remains expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it would be ideal to minimize the number of human annotations needed when creating a new dataset. Here, we address this problem by proposing a novel algorithm that combines active learning and semi-supervised learning. Active learning is an approach for identifying the best unlabeled samples to annotate. While there has been work on active learning for segmentation, most methods require annotating all pixel objects in each image, rather than only the most informative regions. We argue that this is inefficient. Instead, our active learning approach aims to minimize the number of annotations per-image. Our method is enriched with semi-supervised learning, where we use pseudo labels generated with a teacher-student framework to identify image regions that help disambiguate confused classes. We also integrate mechanisms that enable better performance on imbalanced label distributions, which have not been studied previously for active learning in semantic segmentation. In experiments on the CamVid and CityScapes datasets, our method obtains over 95% of the network's performance on the full-training set using less than 17% of the training data, whereas the previous state of the art required 40% of the training data.

- **Summary**: Sparsely annotated semantic segmentation (SASS) aims to train a segmentation network with coarse-grained (i.e., point-, scribble-, and block-wise) supervisions, where only a small proportion of pixels are labeled in each image. In this paper, we propose a novel tree energy loss for SASS by providing semantic guidance for unlabeled pixels. The tree energy loss represents images as minimum spanning trees to model both low-level and high-level pair-wise affinities. By sequentially applying these affinities to the network prediction, soft pseudo labels for unlabeled pixels are generated in a coarse-to-fine manner, achieving dynamic online self-training. The tree energy loss is effective and easy to be incorporated into existing frameworks by combining it with a traditional segmentation loss. Compared with previous SASS methods, our method requires no multistage training strategies, alternating optimization procedures, additional supervised data, or time-consuming post-processing while outperforming them in all SASS settings.

- **Summary**: Training CNN for detection is time-consuming due to the large dataset and complex network modules, making it hard to search architectures on detection datasets directly, which usually requires vast search costs (usually tens and even hundreds of GPU-days). In contrast, this paper introduces an efficient framework, named EAutoDet, that can discover practical backbone and FPN architectures for object detection in 1.4 GPU-days. Specifically, we construct a supernet for both backbone and FPN modules and adopt the differentiable method. To reduce the GPU memory requirement and computational cost, we propose a kernel reusing technique by sharing the weights of candidate operations on one edge and consolidating them into one convolution. A dynamic channel refinement strategy is also introduced to search channel numbers. Extensive experiments show significant efficacy and efficiency of our method. In particular, the discovered architectures surpass state-of-the-art object detection NAS methods and achieve 40.1 mAP with 120 FPS and 49.2 mAP with 41.3 FPS on COCO test-dev set. We also transfer the discovered architectures to rotation detection task, which achieve 77.05 mAP$_{\text{50}}$ on DOTA-v1.0 test set with 21.1M parameters.

- **Summary**: Mixup is an efficient data augmentation approach that improves the generalization of neural networks by smoothing the decision boundary with mixed data. Recently, dynamic mixup methods have improved previous static policies effectively (e.g., linear interpolation) by maximizing salient regions or maintaining the target in mixed samples. The discrepancy is that the generated mixed samples from dynamic policies are more instance discriminative than the static ones, e.g., the foreground objects are decoupled from the background. However, optimizing mixup policies with dynamic methods in input space is an expensive computation compared to static ones. Hence, we are trying to transfer the decoupling mechanism of dynamic methods from the data level to the objective function level and propose the general decoupled mixup (DM) loss. The primary effect is that DM can adaptively focus on discriminative features without losing the original smoothness of the mixup while avoiding heavy computational overhead. As a result, DM enables static mixup methods to achieve comparable or even exceed the performance of dynamic methods. This also leads to an interesting objective design problem for mixup training that we need to focus on both smoothing the decision boundaries and identifying discriminative features. Extensive experiments on supervised and semi-supervised learning benchmarks across seven classification datasets validate the effectiveness of DM by equipping it with various mixup methods.

- **Summary**: In computer-aided design (CAD) community, the point cloud data is pervasively applied in reverse engineering, where the point cloud analysis plays an important role. While a large number of supervised learning methods have been proposed to handle the unordered point clouds and demonstrated their remarkable success, their performance and applicability are limited to the costly data annotation. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised pretraining model for point cloud learning without human annotations, which relies solely on upsampling operation to perform feature learning of point cloud in an effective manner. The key premise of our approach is that upsampling operation encourages the network to capture both high-level semantic information and low-level geometric information of the point cloud, thus the downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation will benefit from the pre-trained model. Specifically, our method first conducts the random subsampling from the input point cloud at a low proportion e.g., 12.5%. Then, we feed them into an encoder-decoder architecture, where an encoder is devised to operate only on the subsampled points, along with a upsampling decoder is adopted to reconstruct the original point cloud based on the learned features. Finally, we design a novel joint loss function which enforces the upsampled points to be similar with the original point cloud and uniformly distributed on the underlying shape surface. By adopting the pre-trained encoder weights as initialisation of models for downstream tasks, we find that our UAE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in shape classification, part segmentation and point cloud upsampling tasks. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel frame-interpolation-based method for slice imputation to improve segmentation accuracy for anisotropic 3D medical images, in which the number of slices and their corresponding segmentation labels can be increased between two consecutive slices in anisotropic 3D medical volumes. Unlike previous inter-slice imputation methods, which only focus on the smoothness in the axial direction, this study aims to improve the smoothness of the interpolated 3D medical volumes in all three directions: axial, sagittal, and coronal. The proposed multitask inter-slice imputation method, in particular, incorporates a smoothness loss function to evaluate the smoothness of the interpolated 3D medical volumes in the through-plane direction (sagittal and coronal). It not only improves the resolution of the interpolated 3D medical volumes in the through-plane direction but also transforms them into isotropic representations, which leads to better segmentation performances. Experiments on whole tumor segmentation in the brain, liver tumor segmentation, and prostate segmentation indicate that our method outperforms the competing slice imputation methods on both computed tomography and magnetic resonance images volumes in most cases.

- **Summary**: Decreasing magnetic resonance (MR) image acquisition times can potentially make MR examinations more accessible. Prior arts including the deep learning models have been devoted to solving the problem of long MRI imaging time. Recently, deep generative models have exhibited great potentials in algorithm robustness and usage flexibility. Nevertheless, none of existing schemes can be learned or employed to the k-space measurement directly. Furthermore, how do the deep generative models work well in hybrid domain is also worth being investigated. In this work, by taking advantage of the deep energy-based models, we propose a k-space and image domain collaborative generative model to comprehensively estimate the MR data from under-sampled measurement. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-arts demonstrated that the proposed hybrid method has less error in reconstruction accuracy and is more stable under different acceleration factors

- **Summary**: Batch normalization (BN) is a milestone technique in deep learning. It normalizes the activation using mini-batch statistics during training but the estimated population statistics during inference. This paper focuses on investigating the estimation of population statistics. We define the estimation shift magnitude of BN to quantitatively measure the difference between its estimated population statistics and expected ones. Our primary observation is that the estimation shift can be accumulated due to the stack of BN in a network, which has detriment effects for the test performance. We further find a batch-free normalization (BFN) can block such an accumulation of estimation shift. These observations motivate our design of XBNBlock that replace one BN with BFN in the bottleneck block of residual-style networks. Experiments on the ImageNet and COCO benchmarks show that XBNBlock consistently improves the performance of different architectures, including ResNet and ResNeXt, by a significant margin and seems to be more robust to distribution shift.

- **Summary**: Scene-dependent adaptive compressive sensing (CS) has been a long pursuing goal which has huge potential in significantly improving the performance of CS. However, without accessing to the ground truth image, how to design the scene-dependent adaptive strategy is still an open-problem and the improvement in sampling efficiency is still quite limited. In this paper, a restricted isometry property (RIP) condition based error clamping is proposed, which could directly predict the reconstruction error, i.e. the difference between the currently-stage reconstructed image and the ground truth image, and adaptively allocate samples to different regions at the successive sampling stage. Furthermore, we propose a cascaded feature fusion reconstruction network that could efficiently utilize the information derived from different adaptive sampling stages. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive and cascaded CS method is demonstrated with extensive quantitative and qualitative results, compared with the state-of-the-art CS algorithms.

- **Summary**: Salient object detection on RGB-D images is an active topic in computer vision. Although the existing methods have achieved appreciable performance, there are still some challenges. The locality of convolutional neural network requires that the model has a sufficiently deep global receptive field, which always leads to the loss of local details. To address the challenge, we propose a novel Group Transformer Network (GroupTransNet) for RGB-D salient object detection. This method is good at learning the long-range dependencies of cross layer features to promote more perfect feature expression. At the beginning, the features of the slightly higher classes of the middle three levels and the latter three levels are soft grouped to absorb the advantages of the high-level features. The input features are repeatedly purified and enhanced by the attention mechanism to purify the cross modal features of color modal and depth modal. The features of the intermediate process are first fused by the features of different layers, and then processed by several transformers in multiple groups, which not only makes the size of the features of each scale unified and interrelated, but also achieves the effect of sharing the weight of the features within the group. The output features in different groups complete the clustering staggered by two owing to the level difference, and combine with the low-level features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTransNet outperforms the comparison models and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Classification of skull fracture is a challenging task for both radiologists and researchers. Skull fractures result in broken pieces of bone, which can cut into the brain and cause bleeding and other injury types. So it is vital to detect and classify the fracture very early. In real world, often fractures occur at multiple sites. This makes it harder to detect the fracture type where many fracture types might summarize a skull fracture. Unfortunately, manual detection of skull fracture and the classification process is time-consuming, threatening a patient's life. Because of the emergence of deep learning, this process could be automated. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most widely used deep learning models for image categorization because they deliver high accuracy and outstanding outcomes compared to other models. We propose a new model called SkullNetV1 comprising a novel CNN by taking advantage of CNN for feature extraction and lazy learning approach which acts as a classifier for classification of skull fractures from brain CT images to classify five fracture types. Our suggested model achieved a subset accuracy of 88%, an F1 score of 93%, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89 to 0.98, a Hamming score of 92% and a Hamming loss of 0.04 for this seven-class multi-labeled classification.

- **Summary**: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a generalized model to an unseen target domain using only limited source domains. Previous attempts to DG fail to learn domain-invariant representations only from the source domains due to the significant domain shifts between training and test domains. Instead, we re-formulate the DG objective using mutual information with the oracle model, a model generalized to any possible domain. We derive a tractable variational lower bound via approximating the oracle model by a pre-trained model, called Mutual Information Regularization with Oracle (MIRO). Our extensive experiments show that MIRO significantly improves the out-of-distribution performance. Furthermore, our scaling experiments show that the larger the scale of the pre-trained model, the greater the performance improvement of MIRO.

- **Summary**: The vanilla self-attention mechanism inherently relies on pre-defined and steadfast computational dimensions. Such inflexibility restricts it from possessing context-oriented generalization that can bring more contextual cues and global representations. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Scalable Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism that leverages two scaling factors to release dimensions of query, key, and value matrices while unbinding them with the input. This scalability fetches context-oriented generalization and enhances object sensitivity, which pushes the whole network into a more effective trade-off state between accuracy and cost. Furthermore, we propose an Interactive Window-based Self-Attention (IWSA), which establishes interaction between non-overlapping regions by re-merging independent value tokens and aggregating spatial information from adjacent windows. By stacking the SSA and IWSA alternately, the Scalable Vision Transformer (ScalableViT) achieves state-of-the-art performance in general-purpose vision tasks. For example, ScalableViT-S outperforms Twins-SVT-S by 1.4% and Swin-T by 1.8% on ImageNet-1K classification.

- **Summary**: Quantifying COVID-19 infection over time is an important task to manage the hospitalization of patients during a global pandemic. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have been proposed to help radiologists automatically quantify COVID-19 pathologies on longitudinal CT scans. However, the learning process of deep learning methods demands extensive training data to learn the complex characteristics of infected regions over longitudinal scans. It is challenging to collect a large-scale dataset, especially for longitudinal training. In this study, we want to address this problem by proposing a new self-supervised learning method to effectively train longitudinal networks for the quantification of COVID-19 infections. For this purpose, longitudinal self-supervision schemes are explored on clinical longitudinal COVID-19 CT scans. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective, helping the model better exploit the semantics of longitudinal data and improve two COVID-19 quantification tasks.

- **Summary**: Most of the existing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection algorithms depend on single input source: the feature, the logit, or the softmax probability. However, the immense diversity of the OOD examples makes such methods fragile. There are OOD samples that are easy to identify in the feature space while hard to distinguish in the logit space and vice versa. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel OOD scoring method named Virtual-logit Matching (ViM), which combines the class-agnostic score from feature space and the In-Distribution (ID) class-dependent logits. Specifically, an additional logit representing the virtual OOD class is generated from the residual of the feature against the principal space, and then matched with the original logits by a constant scaling. The probability of this virtual logit after softmax is the indicator of OOD-ness. To facilitate the evaluation of large-scale OOD detection in academia, we create a new OOD dataset for ImageNet-1K, which is human-annotated and is 8.8x the size of existing datasets. We conducted extensive experiments, including CNNs and vision transformers, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ViM score. In particular, using the BiT-S model, our method gets an average AUROC 90.91% on four difficult OOD benchmarks, which is 4% ahead of the best baseline.

- **Summary**: Image anomaly detection problems aim to determine whether an image is abnormal, and to detect anomalous areas. These methods are actively used in various fields such as manufacturing, medical care, and intelligent information. Encoder-decoder structures have been widely used in the field of anomaly detection because they can easily learn normal patterns in an unsupervised learning environment and calculate a score to identify abnormalities through a reconstruction error indicating the difference between input and reconstructed images. Therefore, current image anomaly detection methods have commonly used convolutional encoder-decoders to extract normal information through the local features of images. However, they are limited in that only local features of the image can be utilized when constructing a normal representation owing to the characteristics of convolution operations using a filter of fixed size. Therefore, we propose a vision transformer-based encoder-decoder model, named AnoViT, designed to reflect normal information by additionally learning the global relationship between image patches, which is capable of both image anomaly detection and localization. The proposed approach constructs a feature map that maintains the existing location information of individual patches by using the embeddings of all patches passed through multiple self-attention layers. The proposed AnoViT model performed better than the convolution-based model on three benchmark datasets. In MVTecAD, which is a representative benchmark dataset for anomaly localization, it showed improved results on 10 out of 15 classes compared with the baseline. Furthermore, the proposed method showed good performance regardless of the class and type of the anomalous area when localization results were evaluated qualitatively.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an Any-time super-Resolution Method (ARM) to tackle the over-parameterized single image super-resolution (SISR) models. Our ARM is motivated by three observations: (1) The performance of different image patches varies with SISR networks of different sizes. (2) There is a tradeoff between computation overhead and performance of the reconstructed image. (3) Given an input image, its edge information can be an effective option to estimate its PSNR. Subsequently, we train an ARM supernet containing SISR subnets of different sizes to deal with image patches of various complexity. To that effect, we construct an Edge-to-PSNR lookup table that maps the edge score of an image patch to the PSNR performance for each subnet, together with a set of computation costs for the subnets. In the inference, the image patches are individually distributed to different subnets for a better computation-performance tradeoff. Moreover, each SISR subnet shares weights of the ARM supernet, thus no extra parameters are introduced. The setting of multiple subnets can well adapt the computational cost of SISR model to the dynamically available hardware resources, allowing the SISR task to be in service at any time. Extensive experiments on resolution datasets of different sizes with popular SISR networks as backbones verify the effectiveness and the versatility of our ARM.

- **Summary**: Image translation and manipulation have gain increasing attention along with the rapid development of deep generative models. Although existing approaches have brought impressive results, they mainly operated in 2D space. In light of recent advances in NeRF-based 3D-aware generative models, we introduce a new task, Semantic-to-NeRF translation, that aims to reconstruct a 3D scene modelled by NeRF, conditioned on one single-view semantic mask as input. To kick-off this novel task, we propose the Sem2NeRF framework. In particular, Sem2NeRF addresses the highly challenging task by encoding the semantic mask into the latent code that controls the 3D scene representation of a pre-trained decoder. To further improve the accuracy of the mapping, we integrate a new region-aware learning strategy into the design of both the encoder and the decoder. We verify the efficacy of the proposed Sem2NeRF and demonstrate that it outperforms several strong baselines on two benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Metric learning aims to learn a highly discriminative model encouraging the embeddings of similar classes to be close in the chosen metrics and pushed apart for dissimilar ones. The common recipe is to use an encoder to extract embeddings and a distance-based loss function to match the representations -- usually, the Euclidean distance is utilized. An emerging interest in learning hyperbolic data embeddings suggests that hyperbolic geometry can be beneficial for natural data. Following this line of work, we propose a new hyperbolic-based model for metric learning. At the core of our method is a vision transformer with output embeddings mapped to hyperbolic space. These embeddings are directly optimized using modified pairwise cross-entropy loss. We evaluate the proposed model with six different formulations on four datasets achieving the new state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/htdt/hyp_metric.

- **Summary**: The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation is an essential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of glioma. It is promising to better predict glioma genotype by integrating focal tumor image and geometric features with brain network features derived from MRI. Convolutions neural networks show reasonable performance in predicting IDH mutation, which, however, cannot learn from non-Euclidean data, e.g., geometric and network data. In this study, we propose a multi-modal learning framework using three separate encoders to extract features of focal tumor image, tumor geometrics and global brain networks. To mitigate the limited availability of diffusion MRI, we develop a self-supervised approach to generate brain networks from anatomical multi-sequence MRI. Moreover, to extract tumor-related features from the brain network, we design a hierarchical attention module for the brain network encoder. Further, we design a bi-level multi-modal contrastive loss to align the multi-modal features and tackle the domain gap at the focal tumor and global brain. Finally, we propose a weighted population graph to integrate the multi-modal features for genotype prediction. Experimental results on the testing set show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline deep learning models. The ablation experiments validate the performance of different components of the framework. The visualized interpretation corresponds to clinical knowledge with further validation. In conclusion, the proposed learning framework provides a novel approach for predicting the genotype of glioma.

- **Summary**: Conventional deep models predict a test sample with a single forward propagation, which, however, may not be sufficient for predicting hard-classified samples. On the contrary, we human beings may need to carefully check the sample many times before making a final decision. During the recheck process, one may refine/adjust the prediction by referring to related samples. Motivated by this, we propose to predict those hard-classified test samples in a looped manner to boost the model performance. However, this idea may pose a critical challenge: how to construct looped inference, so that the original erroneous predictions on these hard test samples can be corrected with little additional effort. To address this, we propose a general Closed-Loop Inference (CLI) method. Specifically, we first devise a filtering criterion to identify those hard-classified test samples that need additional inference loops. For each hard sample, we construct an additional auxiliary learning task based on its original top-$K$ predictions to calibrate the model, and then use the calibrated model to obtain the final prediction. Promising results on ImageNet (in-distribution test samples) and ImageNet-C (out-of-distribution test samples) demonstrate the effectiveness of CLI in improving the performance of any pre-trained model.



### RGB-Depth Fusion GAN for Indoor Depth Completion

- **Summary**: The raw depth image captured by the indoor depth sensor usually has an extensive range of missing depth values due to inherent limitations such as the inability to perceive transparent objects and limited distance range. The incomplete depth map burdens many downstream vision tasks, and a rising number of depth completion methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue. While most existing methods can generate accurate dense depth maps from sparse and uniformly sampled depth maps, they are not suitable for complementing the large contiguous regions of missing depth values, which is common and critical. In this paper, we design a novel two-branch end-to-end fusion network, which takes a pair of RGB and incomplete depth images as input to predict a dense and completed depth map. The first branch employs an encoder-decoder structure to regress the local dense depth values from the raw depth map, with the help of local guidance information extracted from the RGB image. In the other branch, we propose an RGB-depth fusion GAN to transfer the RGB image to the fine-grained textured depth map. We adopt adaptive fusion modules named W-AdaIN to propagate the features across the two branches, and we append a confidence fusion head to fuse the two outputs of the branches for the final depth map. Extensive experiments on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate that our proposed method clearly improves the depth completion performance, especially in a more realistic setting of indoor environments with the help of the pseudo depth map.

- **Summary**: Left ventricular (LV) function is an important factor in terms of patient management, outcome, and long-term survival of patients with heart disease. The most recently published clinical guidelines for heart failure recognise that over reliance on only one measure of cardiac function (LV ejection fraction) as a diagnostic and treatment stratification biomarker is suboptimal. Recent advances in AI-based echocardiography analysis have shown excellent results on automated estimation of LV volumes and LV ejection fraction. However, from time-varying 2-D echocardiography acquisition, a richer description of cardiac function can be obtained by estimating functional biomarkers from the complete cardiac cycle. In this work we propose for the first time an AI approach for deriving advanced biomarkers of systolic and diastolic LV function from 2-D echocardiography based on segmentations of the full cardiac cycle. These biomarkers will allow clinicians to obtain a much richer picture of the heart in health and disease. The AI model is based on the 'nn-Unet' framework and was trained and tested using four different databases. Results show excellent agreement between manual and automated analysis and showcase the potential of the advanced systolic and diastolic biomarkers for patient stratification. Finally, for a subset of 50 cases, we perform a correlation analysis between clinical biomarkers derived from echocardiography and CMR and we show excellent agreement between the two modalities.

- **Summary**: We present a lightweight neural model for remote heart rate estimation focused on the efficient spatio-temporal learning of facial photoplethysmography (PPG) based on i) modelling of PPG dynamics by combinations of multiple convolutional derivatives, and ii) increased flexibility of the model to learn possible offsets between the facial video PPG and the ground truth. PPG dynamics are modelled by a Temporal Derivative Module (TDM) constructed by the incremental aggregation of multiple convolutional derivatives, emulating a Taylor series expansion up to the desired order. Robustness to ground truth offsets is handled by the introduction of TALOS (Temporal Adaptive LOcation Shift), a new temporal loss to train learning-based models. We verify the effectiveness of our model by reporting accuracy and efficiency metrics on the public PURE and UBFC-rPPG datasets. Compared to existing models, our approach shows competitive heart rate estimation accuracy with a much lower number of parameters and lower computational cost.

- **Summary**: The importance of plastic waste recycling is undeniable. In this respect, computer vision and deep learning enable solutions through the automated analysis of short-wave-infrared hyper-spectral images of plastics. In this paper, we offer an exhaustive empirical study to show the importance of efficient model selection for resolving the task of hyper-spectral image segmentation of various plastic flakes using deep learning. We assess the complexity level of generic and specialized models and infer their performance capacity: generic models are often unnecessarily complex. We introduce two variants of a specialized hyper-spectral architecture, PlasticNet, that outperforms several well-known segmentation architectures in both performance as well as computational complexity. In addition, we shed lights on the significance of signal pre-processing within the realm of hyper-spectral imaging. To complete our contribution, we introduce the largest, most versatile hyper-spectral dataset of plastic flakes of four primary polymer types.

- **Summary**: Recently, learned image compression techniques have achieved remarkable performance, even surpassing the best manually designed lossy image coders. They are promising to be large-scale adopted. For the sake of practicality, a thorough investigation of the architecture design of learned image compression, regarding both compression performance and running speed, is essential. In this paper, we first propose uneven channel-conditional adaptive coding, motivated by the observation of energy compaction in learned image compression. Combining the proposed uneven grouping model with existing context models, we obtain a spatial-channel contextual adaptive model to improve the coding performance without damage to running speed. Then we study the structure of the main transform and propose an efficient model, ELIC, to achieve state-of-the-art speed and compression ability. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports extremely fast preview decoding and progressive decoding, which makes the coming application of learning-based image compression more promising.

- **Summary**: Despite recent stereo matching networks achieving impressive performance given sufficient training data, they suffer from domain shifts and generalize poorly to unseen domains. We argue that maintaining feature consistency between matching pixels is a vital factor for promoting the generalization capability of stereo matching networks, which has not been adequately considered. Here we address this issue by proposing a simple pixel-wise contrastive learning across the viewpoints. The stereo contrastive feature loss function explicitly constrains the consistency between learned features of matching pixel pairs which are observations of the same 3D points. A stereo selective whitening loss is further introduced to better preserve the stereo feature consistency across domains, which decorrelates stereo features from stereo viewpoint-specific style information. Counter-intuitively, the generalization of feature consistency between two viewpoints in the same scene translates to the generalization of stereo matching performance to unseen domains. Our method is generic in nature as it can be easily embedded into existing stereo networks and does not require access to the samples in the target domain. When trained on synthetic data and generalized to four real-world testing sets, our method achieves superior performance over several state-of-the-art networks.

- **Summary**: Modeling latent variables with priors and hyperpriors is an essential problem in variational image compression. Formally, trade-off between rate and distortion is handled well if priors and hyperpriors precisely describe latent variables. Current practices only adopt univariate priors and process each variable individually. However, we find inter-correlations and intra-correlations exist when observing latent variables in a vectorized perspective. These findings reveal visual redundancies to improve rate-distortion performance and parallel processing ability to speed up compression. This encourages us to propose a novel vectorized prior. Specifically, a multivariate Gaussian mixture is proposed with means and covariances to be estimated. Then, a novel probabilistic vector quantization is utilized to effectively approximate means, and remaining covariances are further induced to a unified mixture and solved by cascaded estimation without context models involved. Furthermore, codebooks involved in quantization are extended to multi-codebooks for complexity reduction, which formulates an efficient compression procedure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art indicate our model has better rate-distortion performance and an impressive $3.18\times$ compression speed up, giving us the ability to perform real-time, high-quality variational image compression in practice.

- **Summary**: An effective way to model the complex real world is to view the world as a composition of basic components of objects and transformations. Although humans through development understand the compositionality of the real world, it is extremely difficult to equip robots with such a learning mechanism. In recent years, there has been significant research on autonomously learning representations of the world using the deep learning; however, most studies have taken a statistical approach, which requires a large number of training data. Contrary to such existing methods, we take a novel algebraic approach for representation learning based on a simpler and more intuitive formulation that the observed world is the combination of multiple independent patterns and transformations that are invariant to the shape of patterns. Since the shape of patterns can be viewed as the invariant features against symmetric transformations such as translation or rotation, we can expect that the patterns can naturally be extracted by expressing transformations with symmetric Lie group transformers and attempting to reconstruct the scene with them. Based on this idea, we propose a model that disentangles the scenes into the minimum number of basic components of patterns and Lie transformations from only one sequence of images, by introducing the learnable shape-invariant Lie group transformers as transformation components. Experiments show that given one sequence of images in which two objects are moving independently, the proposed model can discover the hidden distinct objects and multiple shape-invariant transformations that constitute the scenes.

- **Summary**: Exploiting internal spatial geometric constraints of sparse LiDARs is beneficial to depth completion, however, has been not explored well. This paper proposes an efficient method to learn geometry-aware embedding, which encodes the local and global geometric structure information from 3D points, e.g., scene layout, object's sizes and shapes, to guide dense depth estimation. Specifically, we utilize the dynamic graph representation to model generalized geometric relationship from irregular point clouds in a flexible and efficient manner. Further, we joint this embedding and corresponded RGB appearance information to infer missing depths of the scene with well structure-preserved details. The key to our method is to integrate implicit 3D geometric representation into a 2D learning architecture, which leads to a better trade-off between the performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous works and could reconstruct fine depths with crisp boundaries in regions that are over-smoothed by them. The ablation study gives more insights into our method that could achieve significant gains with a simple design, while having better generalization capability and stability.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation, aiming to learn scene depths from single images in a self-supervised manner, has received much attention recently. In spite of recent efforts in this field, how to learn accurate scene depths and alleviate the negative influence of occlusions for self-supervised depth estimation, still remains an open problem. Addressing this problem, we firstly empirically analyze the effects of both the continuous and discrete depth constraints which are widely used in the training process of many existing works. Then inspired by the above empirical analysis, we propose a novel network to learn an Occlusion-aware Coarse-to-Fine Depth map for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, called OCFD-Net. Given an arbitrary training set of stereo image pairs, the proposed OCFD-Net does not only employ a discrete depth constraint for learning a coarse-level depth map, but also employ a continuous depth constraint for learning a scene depth residual, resulting in a fine-level depth map. In addition, an occlusion-aware module is designed under the proposed OCFD-Net, which is able to improve the capability of the learnt fine-level depth map for handling occlusions. Experimental results on KITTI demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparative state-of-the-art methods under seven commonly used metrics in most cases. In addition, experimental results on Make3D demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the cross-dataset generalization ability under four commonly used metrics.

- **Summary**: Online 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) has witnessed significant research interest in recent years, largely driven by demand from the autonomous systems community. However, 3D offline MOT is relatively less explored. Labeling 3D trajectory scene data at a large scale while not relying on high-cost human experts is still an open research question. In this work, we propose Batch3DMOT which follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm and represents real-world scenes as directed, acyclic, and category-disjoint tracking graphs that are attributed using various modalities such as camera, LiDAR, and radar. We present a multi-modal graph neural network that uses a cross-edge attention mechanism mitigating modality intermittence, which translates into sparsity in the graph domain. Additionally, we present attention-weighted convolutions over frame-wise k-NN neighborhoods as suitable means to allow information exchange across disconnected graph components. We evaluate our approach using various sensor modalities and model configurations on the challenging nuScenes and KITTI datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach yields an overall improvement of 3.3% in the AMOTA score on nuScenes thereby setting the new state-of-the-art for 3D tracking and further enhancing false positive filtering.

- **Summary**: Recent joint embedding-based self-supervised methods have surpassed standard supervised approaches on various image recognition tasks such as image classification. These self-supervised methods aim at maximizing agreement between features extracted from two differently transformed views of the same image, which results in learning an invariant representation with respect to appearance and geometric image transformations. However, the effectiveness of these approaches remains unclear in the context of gaze estimation, a structured regression task that requires equivariance under geometric transformations (e.g., rotations, horizontal flip). In this work, we propose SwAT, an equivariant version of the online clustering-based self-supervised approach SwAV, to learn more informative representations for gaze estimation. We demonstrate that SwAT, with ResNet-50 and supported with uncurated unlabeled face images, outperforms state-of-the-art gaze estimation methods and supervised baselines in various experiments. In particular, we achieve up to 57% and 25% improvements in cross-dataset and within-dataset evaluation tasks on existing benchmarks (ETH-XGaze, Gaze360, and MPIIFaceGaze).

- **Summary**: Anatomical segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image computing, generally tackled with fully convolutional neural networks which produce dense segmentation masks. These models are often trained with loss functions such as cross-entropy or Dice, which assume pixels to be independent of each other, thus ignoring topological errors and anatomical inconsistencies. We address this limitation by moving from pixel-level to graph representations, which allow to naturally incorporate anatomical constraints by construction. To this end, we introduce HybridGNet, an encoder-decoder neural architecture that leverages standard convolutions for image feature encoding and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) to decode plausible representations of anatomical structures. We also propose a novel image-to-graph skip connection layer which allows localized features to flow from standard convolutional blocks to GCNN blocks, and show that it improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed architecture is extensively evaluated in a variety of domain shift and image occlusion scenarios, and audited considering different types of demographic domain shift. Our comprehensive experimental setup compares HybridGNet with other landmark and pixel-based models for anatomical segmentation in chest x-ray images, and shows that it produces anatomically plausible results in challenging scenarios where other models tend to fail.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D object detection is an important yet challenging task in autonomous driving. Some existing methods leverage depth information from an off-the-shelf depth estimator to assist 3D detection, but suffer from the additional computational burden and achieve limited performance caused by inaccurate depth priors. To alleviate this, we propose MonoDTR, a novel end-to-end depth-aware transformer network for monocular 3D object detection. It mainly consists of two components: (1) the Depth-Aware Feature Enhancement (DFE) module that implicitly learns depth-aware features with auxiliary supervision without requiring extra computation, and (2) the Depth-Aware Transformer (DTR) module that globally integrates context- and depth-aware features. Moreover, different from conventional pixel-wise positional encodings, we introduce a novel depth positional encoding (DPE) to inject depth positional hints into transformers. Our proposed depth-aware modules can be easily plugged into existing image-only monocular 3D object detectors to improve the performance. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art monocular-based methods and achieves real-time detection.

- **Summary**: With rising powerful, low-cost embedded devices, the edge computing has become an increasingly popular choice. In this paper, we propose a new incremental local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) tailored on the Raspberry Pi to deal with large ImageNet ILSVRC 2010 dataset having 1,261,405 images with 1,000 classes. The local SGD splits the data block into $k$ partitions using $k$means algorithm and then it learns in the parallel way SGD models in each data partition to classify the data locally. The incremental local SGD sequentially loads small data blocks of the training dataset to learn local SGD models. The numerical test results on Imagenet dataset show that our incremental local SGD algorithm with the Raspberry Pi 4 is faster and more accurate than the state-of-the-art linear SVM run on a PC Intel(R) Core i7-4790 CPU, 3.6 GHz, 4 cores.

- **Summary**: Aiming for higher-level scene understanding, this work presents a neural network approach that takes a road-layout map in bird's-eye-view as input, and predicts a human-interpretable graph that represents the road's topological layout. Our approach elevates the understanding of road layouts from pixel level to the level of graphs. To achieve this goal, an image-graph-image auto-encoder is utilized. The network is designed to learn to regress the graph representation at its auto-encoder bottleneck. This learning is self-supervised by an image reconstruction loss, without needing any external manual annotations. We create a synthetic dataset containing common road layout patterns and use it for training of the auto-encoder in addition to the real-world Argoverse dataset. By using this additional synthetic dataset, which conceptually captures human knowledge of road layouts and makes this available to the network for training, we are able to stabilize and further improve the performance of topological road layout understanding on the real-world Argoverse dataset. The evaluation shows that our approach exhibits comparable performance to a strong fully-supervised baseline.

- **Summary**: Underwater Image Rendering aims to generate a true-tolife underwater image from a given clean one, which could be applied to various practical applications such as underwater image enhancement, camera filter, and virtual gaming. We explore two less-touched but challenging problems in underwater image rendering, namely, i) how to render diverse underwater scenes by a single neural network? ii) how to adaptively learn the underwater light fields from natural exemplars, i,e., realistic underwater images? To this end, we propose a neural rendering method for underwater imaging, dubbed UWNR (Underwater Neural Rendering). Specifically, UWNR is a data-driven neural network that implicitly learns the natural degenerated model from authentic underwater images, avoiding introducing erroneous biases by hand-craft imaging models. Compared with existing underwater image generation methods, UWNR utilizes the natural light field to simulate the main characteristics ofthe underwater scene. Thus, it is able to synthesize a wide variety ofunderwater images from one clean image with various realistic underwater images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves better visual effects and quantitative metrics over previous methods. Moreover, we adopt UWNR to build an open Large Neural Rendering Underwater Dataset containing various types of water quality, dubbed LNRUD. The source code and LNRUD are available at https: //github.com/Ephemeral182/UWNR.

- **Summary**: The high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) could be addressed by optimizing Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) frameworks for manufacturing applications. In this context, this paper proposes two hypotheses for ergonomically effective task delegation and HRC. The first hypothesis states that it is possible to quantify ergonomically professional tasks using motion data from a reduced set of sensors. Then, the most dangerous tasks can be delegated to a collaborative robot. The second hypothesis is that by including gesture recognition and spatial adaptation, the ergonomics of an HRC scenario can be improved by avoiding needless motions that could expose operators to ergonomic risks and by lowering the physical effort required of operators. An HRC scenario for a television manufacturing process is optimized to test both hypotheses. For the ergonomic evaluation, motion primitives with known ergonomic risks were modeled for their detection in professional tasks and to estimate a risk score based on the European Assembly Worksheet (EAWS). A Deep Learning gesture recognition module trained with egocentric television assembly data was used to complement the collaboration between the human operator and the robot. Additionally, a skeleton-tracking algorithm provided the robot with information about the operator's pose, allowing it to spatially adapt its motion to the operator's anthropometrics. Three experiments were conducted to determine the effect of gesture recognition and spatial adaptation on the operator's range of motion. The rate of spatial adaptation was used as a key performance indicator (KPI), and a new KPI for measuring the reduction in the operator's motion is presented in this paper.

- **Summary**: We apply the TrOCR framework to real-world, historical manuscripts and show that TrOCR per se is a strong model, ideal for transfer learning. TrOCR has been trained on English only, but it can adapt to other languages that use the Latin alphabet fairly easily and with little training material. We compare TrOCR against a SOTA HTR framework (Transkribus) and show that it can beat such systems. This finding is essential since Transkribus performs best when it has access to baseline information, which is not needed at all to fine-tune TrOCR.

- **Summary**: Graph-based reasoning over skeleton data has emerged as a promising approach for human action recognition. However, the application of prior graph-based methods, which predominantly employ whole temporal sequences as their input, to the setting of online inference entails considerable computational redundancy. In this paper, we tackle this issue by reformulating the Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network as a Continual Inference Network, which can perform step-by-step predictions in time without repeat frame processing. To evaluate our method, we create a continual version of ST-GCN, CoST-GCN, alongside two derived methods with different self-attention mechanisms, CoAGCN and CoS-TR. We investigate weight transfer strategies and architectural modifications for inference acceleration, and perform experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and Kinetics Skeleton 400 datasets. Retaining similar predictive accuracy, we observe up to 109x reduction in time complexity, on-hardware accelerations of 26x, and reductions in maximum allocated memory of 52% during online inference.

- **Summary**: We propose a new object-centric framework for learning-based stereo 3D object detection. Previous studies build scene-centric representations that do not consider the significant variation among outdoor instances and thus lack the flexibility and functionalities that an instance-level model can offer. We build such an instance-level model by formulating and tackling a local update problem, i.e., how to predict a refined update given an initial 3D cuboid guess. We demonstrate how solving this problem can complement scene-centric approaches in (i) building a coarse-to-fine multi-resolution system, (ii) performing model-agnostic object location refinement, and (iii) conducting stereo 3D tracking-by-detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.

- **Summary**: Glioma is the most common and aggressive brain tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role to evaluate tumors for the arrangement of tumor surgery and the treatment of subsequent procedures. However, the manual segmentation of the MRI image is strenuous, which limits its clinical application. With the development of deep learning, a large number of automatic segmentation methods have been developed, but most of them stay in 2D images, which leads to subpar performance. Moreover, the serious voxel imbalance between the brain tumor and the background as well as the different sizes and locations of the brain tumor makes the segmentation of 3D images a challenging problem. Aiming at segmenting 3D MRI, we propose a model for brain tumor segmentation with multiple encoders. The structure contains four encoders and one decoder. The four encoders correspond to the four modalities of the MRI image, perform one-to-one feature extraction, and then merge the feature maps of the four modalities into the decoder. This method reduces the difficulty of feature extraction and greatly improves model performance. We also introduced a new loss function named "Categorical Dice", and set different weights for different segmented regions at the same time, which solved the problem of voxel imbalance. We evaluated our approach using the online BraTS 2020 Challenge verification. Our proposed method can achieve promising results in the validation set compared to the state-of-the-art approaches with Dice scores of 0.70249, 0.88267, and 0.73864 for the intact tumor, tumor core, and enhanced tumor, respectively.

- **Summary**: Color constancy aims to restore the constant colors of a scene under different illuminants. However, due to the existence of camera spectral sensitivity, the network trained on a certain sensor, cannot work well on others. Also, since the training datasets are collected in certain environments, the diversity of illuminants is limited for complex real world prediction. In this paper, we tackle these problems via two aspects. First, we propose cross-sensor self-supervised training to train the network. In detail, we consider both the general sRGB images and the white-balanced RAW images from current available datasets as the white-balanced agents. Then, we train the network by randomly sampling the artificial illuminants in a sensor-independent manner for scene relighting and supervision. Second, we analyze a previous cascaded framework and present a more compact and accurate model by sharing the backbone parameters with learning attention specifically. Experiments show that our cross-sensor model and single-sensor model outperform other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on cross and single sensor evaluations, respectively, with only 16% parameters of the previous best model.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Dense Siamese Network (DenseSiam), a simple unsupervised learning framework for dense prediction tasks. It learns visual representations by maximizing the similarity between two views of one image with two types of consistency, i.e., pixel consistency and region consistency. Concretely, DenseSiam first maximizes the pixel level spatial consistency according to the exact location correspondence in the overlapped area. It also extracts a batch of region embeddings that correspond to some sub-regions in the overlapped area to be contrasted for region consistency. In contrast to previous methods that require negative pixel pairs, momentum encoders or heuristic masks, DenseSiam benefits from the simple Siamese network and optimizes the consistency of different granularities. It also proves that the simple location correspondence and interacted region embeddings are effective enough to learn the similarity. We apply DenseSiam on ImageNet and obtain competitive improvements on various downstream tasks. We also show that only with some extra task-specific losses, the simple framework can directly conduct dense prediction tasks. On an existing unsupervised semantic segmentation benchmark, it surpasses state-of-the-art segmentation methods by 2.1 mIoU with 28% training costs. Code and models are released at https://github.com/ZwwWayne/DenseSiam.

- **Summary**: Despite abundant data on the spatial distribution of contemporary human settlements, historical data on the long-term evolution of human settlements at fine spatial and temporal granularity is scarce, limiting our quantitative understanding of long-term changes of built-up areas. This is because commonly used mapping methods (e.g., image classification) and suitable data sources (i.e., aerial imagery, multi-spectral remote sensing data, LiDAR) have only been available in recent decades. However, there are alternative data sources such as cadastral records that are digitally available, containing relevant information such as building age information, allowing for an approximate, digital reconstruction of past building distributions. We conducted a non-exhaustive search of open and publicly available data resources from administrative institutions in the United States and gathered, integrated, and harmonized cadastral parcel data, tax assessment data, and building footprint data for 33 counties, wherever building footprint geometries and building construction year information was available. The result of this effort is a unique dataset which we call the Multi-Temporal Building Footprint Dataset for 33 U.S. Counties (MTBF-33). MTBF-33 contains over 6.2 million building footprints including their construction year, and can be used to derive retrospective depictions of built-up areas from 1900 to 2015, at fine spatial and temporal grain and can be used for data validation purposes, or to train statistical learning approaches aiming to extract historical information on human settlements from remote sensing data, historical maps, or similar data sources.

- **Summary**: For image classification problems, various neural network models are commonly used due to their success in yielding high accuracies. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most frequently used deep learning methods for image classification applications. It may produce extraordinarily accurate results with regard to its complexity. However, the more complex the model is the longer it takes to train. In this paper, an acceleration design that uses the power of FPGA is given for a basic CNN model which consists of one convolutional layer and one fully connected layer for the training phase of the fully connected layer. Nonetheless, inference phase is also accelerated automatically due to the fact that training phase includes inference. In this design, the convolutional layer is calculated by the host computer and the fully connected layer is calculated by an FPGA board. It should be noted that the training of convolutional layer is not taken into account in this design and is left for future research. The results are quite encouraging as this FPGA design tops the performance of some of the state-of-the-art deep learning platforms such as Tensorflow on the host computer approximately 2 times in both training and inference.

- **Summary**: Tracking often uses a multi-stage pipeline of feature extraction, target information integration, and bounding box estimation. To simplify this pipeline and unify the process of feature extraction and target information integration, we present a compact tracking framework, termed as MixFormer, built upon transformers. Our core design is to utilize the flexibility of attention operations, and propose a Mixed Attention Module (MAM) for simultaneous feature extraction and target information integration. This synchronous modeling scheme allows to extract target-specific discriminative features and perform extensive communication between target and search area. Based on MAM, we build our MixFormer tracking framework simply by stacking multiple MAMs with progressive patch embedding and placing a localization head on top. In addition, to handle multiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric attention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective score prediction module to select high-quality templates. Our MixFormer sets a new state-of-the-art performance on five tracking benchmarks, including LaSOT, TrackingNet, VOT2020, GOT-10k, and UAV123. In particular, our MixFormer-L achieves NP score of 79.9% on LaSOT, 88.9% on TrackingNet and EAO of 0.555 on VOT2020. We also perform in-depth ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of simultaneous feature extraction and information integration.

- **Summary**: Methods for 3D lane detection have been recently proposed to address the issue of inaccurate lane layouts in many autonomous driving scenarios (uphill/downhill, bump, etc.). Previous work struggled in complex cases due to their simple designs of the spatial transformation between front view and bird's eye view (BEV) and the lack of a realistic dataset. Towards these issues, we present PersFormer: an end-to-end monocular 3D lane detector with a novel Transformer-based spatial feature transformation module. Our model generates BEV features by attending to related front-view local regions with camera parameters as a reference. PersFormer adopts a unified 2D/3D anchor design and an auxiliary task to detect 2D/3D lanes simultaneously, enhancing the feature consistency and sharing the benefits of multi-task learning. Moreover, we release one of the first large-scale real-world 3D lane datasets: OpenLane, with high-quality annotation and scenario diversity. OpenLane contains 200,000 frames, over 880,000 instance-level lanes, 14 lane categories, along with scene tags and the closed-in-path object annotations to encourage the development of lane detection and more industrial-related autonomous driving methods. We show that PersFormer significantly outperforms competitive baselines in the 3D lane detection task on our new OpenLane dataset as well as Apollo 3D Lane Synthetic dataset, and is also on par with state-of-the-art algorithms in the 2D task on OpenLane.

- **Summary**: Gameplay videos contain rich information about how players interact with the game and how the game responds. Sharing gameplay videos on social media platforms, such as Reddit, has become a common practice for many players. Often, players will share gameplay videos that showcase video game bugs. Such gameplay videos are software artifacts that can be utilized for game testing, as they provide insight for bug analysis. Although large repositories of gameplay videos exist, parsing and mining them in an effective and structured fashion has still remained a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a search method that accepts any English text query as input to retrieve relevant videos from large repositories of gameplay videos. Our approach does not rely on any external information (such as video metadata); it works solely based on the content of the video. By leveraging the zero-shot transfer capabilities of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model, our approach does not require any data labeling or training. To evaluate our approach, we present the $\texttt{GamePhysics}$ dataset consisting of 26,954 videos from 1,873 games, that were collected from the GamePhysics section on the Reddit website. Our approach shows promising results in our extensive analysis of simple queries, compound queries, and bug queries, indicating that our approach is useful for object and event detection in gameplay videos. An example application of our approach is as a gameplay video search engine to aid in reproducing video game bugs.

- **Summary**: Inverting a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) facilitates a wide range of image editing tasks using pre-trained generators. Existing methods typically employ the latent space of GANs as the inversion space yet observe the insufficient recovery of spatial details. In this work, we propose to involve the padding space of the generator to complement the latent space with spatial information. Concretely, we replace the constant padding (e.g., usually zeros) used in convolution layers with some instance-aware coefficients. In this way, the inductive bias assumed in the pre-trained model can be appropriately adapted to fit each individual image. Through learning a carefully designed encoder, we manage to improve the inversion quality both qualitatively and quantitatively, outperforming existing alternatives. We then demonstrate that such a space extension barely affects the native GAN manifold, hence we can still reuse the prior knowledge learned by GANs for various downstream applications. Beyond the editing tasks explored in prior arts, our approach allows a more flexible image manipulation, such as the separate control of face contour and facial details, and enables a novel editing manner where users can customize their own manipulations highly efficiently.

- **Summary**: Video-based analysis of facial expressions has been increasingly applied to infer health states of individuals, such as depression and pain. Among the existing approaches, deep learning models composed of structures for multiscale spatiotemporal processing have shown strong potential for encoding facial dynamics. However, such models have high computational complexity, making for a difficult deployment of these solutions. To address this issue, we introduce a new technique to decompose the extraction of multiscale spatiotemporal features. Particularly, a building block structure called Decomposed Multiscale Spatiotemporal Network (DMSN) is presented along with three variants: DMSN-A, DMSN-B, and DMSN-C blocks. The DMSN-A block generates multiscale representations by analyzing spatiotemporal features at multiple temporal ranges, while the DMSN-B block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple ranges, and the DMSN-C block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple spatial sizes. Using these variants, we design our DMSN architecture which has the ability to explore a variety of multiscale spatiotemporal features, favoring the adaptation to different facial behaviors. Our extensive experiments on challenging datasets show that the DMSN-C block is effective for depression detection, whereas the DMSN-A block is efficient for pain estimation. Results also indicate that our DMSN architecture provides a cost-effective solution for expressions that range from fewer facial variations over time, as in depression detection, to greater variations, as in pain estimation.

- **Summary**: Scene flow is a powerful tool for capturing the motion field of 3D point clouds. However, it is difficult to directly apply flow-based models to dynamic point cloud classification since the unstructured points make it hard or even impossible to efficiently and effectively trace point-wise correspondences. To capture 3D motions without explicitly tracking correspondences, we propose a kinematics-inspired neural network (Kinet) by generalizing the kinematic concept of ST-surfaces to the feature space. By unrolling the normal solver of ST-surfaces in the feature space, Kinet implicitly encodes feature-level dynamics and gains advantages from the use of mature backbones for static point cloud processing. With only minor changes in network structures and low computing overhead, it is painless to jointly train and deploy our framework with a given static model. Experiments on NvGesture, SHREC'17, MSRAction-3D, and NTU-RGBD demonstrate its efficacy in performance, efficiency in both the number of parameters and computational complexity, as well as its versatility to various static backbones. Noticeably, Kinet achieves the accuracy of 93.27% on MSRAction-3D with only 3.20M parameters and 10.35G FLOPS.

- **Summary**: In order for AI to be safely deployed in real-world scenarios such as hospitals, schools, and the workplace, it must be able to robustly reason about the physical world. Fundamental to this reasoning is physical common sense: understanding the physical properties and affordances of available objects, how they can be manipulated, and how they interact with other objects. Physical commonsense reasoning is fundamentally a multi-sensory task, since physical properties are manifested through multiple modalities - two of them being vision and acoustics. Our paper takes a step towards real-world physical commonsense reasoning by contributing PACS: the first audiovisual benchmark annotated for physical commonsense attributes. PACS contains 13,400 question-answer pairs, involving 1,377 unique physical commonsense questions and 1,526 videos. Our dataset provides new opportunities to advance the research field of physical reasoning by bringing audio as a core component of this multimodal problem. Using PACS, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models on our new challenging task. While some models show promising results (70% accuracy), they all fall short of human performance (95% accuracy). We conclude the paper by demonstrating the importance of multimodal reasoning and providing possible avenues for future research.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are commonly used for medical purposes such as image generation, segmentation, or classification. Besides this, they are often criticized as black boxes as their decision process is often not human interpretable. Encouraging the latent representation of a generative model to be disentangled offers new perspectives of control and interpretability. Understanding the data generation process could help to create artificial medical data sets without violating patient privacy, synthesizing different data modalities, or discovering data generating characteristics. These characteristics might unravel novel relationships that can be related to genetic traits or patient outcomes. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of popular generative models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Flow-based Models. Furthermore, we summarize the different notions of disentanglement, review approaches to disentangle latent space representations and metrics to evaluate the degree of disentanglement. After introducing the theoretical frameworks, we give an overview of recent medical applications and discuss the impact and importance of disentanglement approaches for medical applications.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of efficient object detection of 3D LiDAR point clouds. To reduce the memory and computational cost, existing point-based pipelines usually adopt task-agnostic random sampling or farthest point sampling to progressively downsample input point clouds, despite the fact that not all points are equally important to the task of object detection. In particular, the foreground points are inherently more important than background points for object detectors. Motivated by this, we propose a highly-efficient single-stage point-based 3D detector in this paper, termed IA-SSD. The key of our approach is to exploit two learnable, task-oriented, instance-aware downsampling strategies to hierarchically select the foreground points belonging to objects of interest. Additionally, we also introduce a contextual centroid perception module to further estimate precise instance centers. Finally, we build our IA-SSD following the encoder-only architecture for efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on several large-scale detection benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of our IA-SSD. Thanks to the low memory footprint and a high degree of parallelism, it achieves a superior speed of 80+ frames-per-second on the KITTI dataset with a single RTX2080Ti GPU.

The pixel value recorded is the reflection radiation from the earth's surface at that location. Multispectral images are those that capture image data at specific frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum as compared to Panchromatic images which are sensitive to all wavelength of visible light. Because of the high resolution and high dimensions of these images, they create difficulties for clustering techniques to efficiently detect clusters of different sizes, shapes and densities as a trade off for fast processing time. In this paper we propose a grid-density based clustering technique for identification of objects. We also introduce an approach to classify a satellite image data using a rule induction based machine learning algorithm. The object identification and classification methods have been validated using several synthetic and benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: In this work we propose a new paradigm for designing efficient deep unrolling networks using operator sketching. The deep unrolling networks are currently the state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially the 3D cone-beam X-ray CT and 4D MRI imaging, the deep unrolling schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of memory and computation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional forward and adjoint operators. Recently researchers have found that such limitations can be partially addressed by stochastic unrolling with subsets of operators, inspired by the success of stochastic first-order optimization. In this work, we propose a further acceleration upon stochastic unrolling, using sketching techniques to approximate products in the high-dimensional image space. The operator sketching can be jointly applied with stochastic unrolling for the best acceleration and compression performance. Our numerical experiments on X-ray CT image reconstruction demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our sketched unrolling schemes.

- **Summary**: This work investigates learning pixel-wise semantic image segmentation in urban scenes without any manual annotation, just from the raw non-curated data collected by cars which, equipped with cameras and LiDAR sensors, drive around a city. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a novel method for cross-modal unsupervised learning of semantic image segmentation by leveraging synchronized LiDAR and image data. The key ingredient of our method is the use of an object proposal module that analyzes the LiDAR point cloud to obtain proposals for spatially consistent objects. Second, we show that these 3D object proposals can be aligned with the input images and reliably clustered into semantically meaningful pseudo-classes. Finally, we develop a cross-modal distillation approach that leverages image data partially annotated with the resulting pseudo-classes to train a transformer-based model for image semantic segmentation. We show the generalization capabilities of our method by testing on four different testing datasets (Cityscapes, Dark Zurich, Nighttime Driving and ACDC) without any finetuning, and demonstrate significant improvements compared to the current state of the art on this problem.

- **Summary**: Understanding the mechanism of generative adversarial networks (GANs) helps us better use GANs for downstream applications. Existing efforts mainly target interpreting unconditional models, leaving it less explored how a conditional GAN learns to render images regarding various categories. This work fills in this gap by investigating how a class conditional generator unifies the synthesis of multiple classes. For this purpose, we dive into the widely used class-conditional batch normalization (CCBN), and observe that each feature channel is activated at varying degrees given different categorical embeddings. To describe such a phenomenon, we propose channel awareness, which quantitatively characterizes how a single channel contributes to the final synthesis. Extensive evaluations and analyses on the BigGAN model pre-trained on ImageNet reveal that only a subset of channels is primarily responsible for the generation of a particular category, similar categories (e.g., cat and dog) usually get related to some same channels, and some channels turn out to share information across all classes. For good measure, our algorithm enables several novel applications with conditional GANs. Concretely, we achieve (1) versatile image editing via simply altering a single channel and manage to (2) harmoniously hybridize two different classes. We further verify that the proposed channel awareness shows promising potential in (3) segmenting the synthesized image and (4) evaluating the category-wise synthesis performance.

- **Summary**: Current deep neural network approaches for camera pose estimation rely on scene structure for 3D motion estimation, but this decreases the robustness and thereby makes cross-dataset generalization difficult. In contrast, classical approaches to structure from motion estimate 3D motion utilizing optical flow and then compute depth. Their accuracy, however, depends strongly on the quality of the optical flow. To avoid this issue, direct methods have been proposed, which separate 3D motion from depth estimation but compute 3D motion using only image gradients in the form of normal flow. In this paper, we introduce a network NFlowNet, for normal flow estimation which is used to enforce robust and direct constraints. In particular, normal flow is used to estimate relative camera pose based on the cheirality (depth positivity) constraint. We achieve this by formulating the optimization problem as a differentiable cheirality layer, which allows for end-to-end learning of camera pose. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed DiffPoseNet's sensitivity to noise and its generalization across datasets. We compare our approach to existing state-of-the-art methods on KITTI, TartanAir, and TUM-RGBD datasets.

- **Summary**: Masked autoencoding has achieved great success for self-supervised learning in the image and language domains. However, mask based pretraining has yet to show benefits for point cloud understanding, likely due to standard backbones like PointNet being unable to properly handle the training versus testing distribution mismatch introduced by masking during training. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a discriminative mask pretraining Transformer framework, MaskPoint}, for point clouds. Our key idea is to represent the point cloud as discrete occupancy values (1 if part of the point cloud; 0 if not), and perform simple binary classification between masked object points and sampled noise points as the proxy task. In this way, our approach is robust to the point sampling variance in point clouds, and facilitates learning rich representations. We evaluate our pretrained models across several downstream tasks, including 3D shape classification, segmentation, and real-word object detection, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results while achieving a significant pretraining speedup (e.g., 4.1x on ScanNet) compared to the prior state-of-the-art Transformer baseline.

- **Summary**: Estimating the target extent poses a fundamental challenge in visual object tracking. Typically, trackers are box-centric and fully rely on a bounding box to define the target in the scene. In practice, objects often have complex shapes and are not aligned with the image axis. In these cases, bounding boxes do not provide an accurate description of the target and often contain a majority of background pixels. We propose a segmentation-centric tracking pipeline that not only produces a highly accurate segmentation mask, but also internally works with segmentation masks instead of bounding boxes. Thus, our tracker is able to better learn a target representation that clearly differentiates the target in the scene from background content. In order to achieve the necessary robustness for the challenging tracking scenario, we propose a separate instance localization component that is used to condition the segmentation decoder when producing the output mask. We infer a bounding box from the segmentation mask, validate our tracker on challenging tracking datasets and achieve the new state of the art on LaSOT with a success AUC score of 69.7%. Since most tracking datasets do not contain mask annotations, we cannot use them to evaluate predicted segmentation masks. Instead, we validate our segmentation quality on two popular video object segmentation datasets.

- **Summary**: Optimization based tracking methods have been widely successful by integrating a target model prediction module, providing effective global reasoning by minimizing an objective function. While this inductive bias integrates valuable domain knowledge, it limits the expressivity of the tracking network. In this work, we therefore propose a tracker architecture employing a Transformer-based model prediction module. Transformers capture global relations with little inductive bias, allowing it to learn the prediction of more powerful target models. We further extend the model predictor to estimate a second set of weights that are applied for accurate bounding box regression. The resulting tracker relies on training and on test frame information in order to predict all weights transductively. We train the proposed tracker end-to-end and validate its performance by conducting comprehensive experiments on multiple tracking datasets. Our tracker sets a new state of the art on three benchmarks, achieving an AUC of 68.5% on the challenging LaSOT dataset.

- **Summary**: Current visual detectors, though impressive within their training distribution, often fail to parse out-of-distribution scenes into their constituent entities. Recent test-time adaptation methods use auxiliary self-supervised losses to adapt the network parameters to each test example independently and have shown promising results towards generalization outside the training distribution for the task of image classification. In our work, we find evidence that these losses are insufficient for the task of scene decomposition, without also considering architectural inductive biases. Recent slot-centric generative models attempt to decompose scenes into entities in a self-supervised manner by reconstructing pixels. Drawing upon these two lines of work, we propose Slot-TTA, a semi-supervised slot-centric scene decomposition model that at test time is adapted per scene through gradient descent on reconstruction or cross-view synthesis objectives. We evaluate Slot-TTA across multiple input modalities, images or 3D point clouds, and show substantial out-of-distribution performance improvements against state-of-the-art supervised feed-forward detectors, and alternative test-time adaptation methods.

- **Summary**: In the last few years, there have been several revolutions in the field of deep learning, mainly headlined by the large impact of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs not only provide an unique architecture when defining their models, but also generate incredible results which have had a direct impact on society. Due to the significant improvements and new areas of research that GANs have brought, the community is constantly coming up with new researches that make it almost impossible to keep up with the times. Our survey aims to provide a general overview of GANs, showing the latest architectures, optimizations of the loss functions, validation metrics and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. The efficiency of the different variants of the model architecture will be evaluated, as well as showing the best application area; as a vital part of the process, the different metrics for evaluating the performance of GANs and the frequently used loss functions will be analyzed. The final objective of this survey is to provide a summary of the evolution and performance of the GANs which are having better results to guide future researchers in the field.

- **Summary**: While NeRF has shown great success for neural reconstruction and rendering, its limited MLP capacity and long per-scene optimization times make it challenging to model large-scale indoor scenes. In contrast, classical 3D reconstruction methods can handle large-scale scenes but do not produce realistic renderings. We propose NeRFusion, a method that combines the advantages of NeRF and TSDF-based fusion techniques to achieve efficient large-scale reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering. We process the input image sequence to predict per-frame local radiance fields via direct network inference. These are then fused using a novel recurrent neural network that incrementally reconstructs a global, sparse scene representation in real-time at 22 fps. This global volume can be further fine-tuned to boost rendering quality. We demonstrate that NeRFusion achieves state-of-the-art quality on both large-scale indoor and small-scale object scenes, with substantially faster reconstruction than NeRF and other recent methods.

- **Summary**: Learning representations of images that are invariant to sensitive or unwanted attributes is important for many tasks including bias removal and cross domain retrieval. Here, our objective is to learn representations that are invariant to the domain (sensitive attribute) for which labels are provided, while being informative over all other image attributes, which are unlabeled. We present a new approach, proposing a new domain-wise contrastive objective for ensuring invariant representations. This objective crucially restricts negative image pairs to be drawn from the same domain, which enforces domain invariance whereas the standard contrastive objective does not. This domain-wise objective is insufficient on its own as it suffers from shortcut solutions resulting in feature suppression. We overcome this issue by a combination of a reconstruction constraint, image augmentations and initialization with pre-trained weights. Our analysis shows that the choice of augmentations is important, and that a misguided choice of augmentations can harm the invariance and informativeness objectives. In an extensive evaluation, our method convincingly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of representation invariance, representation informativeness, and training speed. Furthermore, we find that in some cases our method can achieve excellent results even without the reconstruction constraint, leading to a much faster and resource efficient training.

- **Summary**: We introduce the novel problem of anticipating a time series of future hand masks from egocentric video. A key challenge is to model the stochasticity of future head motions, which globally impact the head-worn camera video analysis. To this end, we propose a novel deep generative model -- EgoGAN, which uses a 3D Fully Convolutional Network to learn a spatio-temporal video representation for pixel-wise visual anticipation, generates future head motion using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and then predicts the future hand masks based on the video representation and the generated future head motion. We evaluate our method on both the EPIC-Kitchens and the EGTEA Gaze+ datasets. We conduct detailed ablation studies to validate the design choices of our approach. Furthermore, we compare our method with previous state-of-the-art methods on future image segmentation and show that our method can more accurately predict future hand masks.

- **Summary**: Training quantised neural networks (QNNs) is a non-differentiable optimisation problem since weights and features are output by piecewise constant functions. The standard solution is to apply the straight-through estimator (STE), using different functions during the inference and gradient computation steps. Several STE variants have been proposed in the literature aiming to maximise the task accuracy of the trained network. In this paper, we analyse STE variants and study their impact on QNN training. We first observe that most such variants can be modelled as stochastic regularisations of stair functions; although this intuitive interpretation is not new, our rigorous discussion generalises to further variants. Then, we analyse QNNs mixing different regularisations, finding that some suitably synchronised smoothing of each layer map is required to guarantee pointwise compositional convergence to the target discontinuous function. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose additive noise annealing (ANA), a new algorithm to train QNNs encompassing standard STE and its variants as special cases. When testing ANA on the CIFAR-10 image classification benchmark, we find that the major impact on task accuracy is not due to the qualitative shape of the regularisations but to the proper synchronisation of the different STE variants used in a network, in accordance with the theoretical results.

- **Summary**: Optical flow estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recent direct-regression methods using deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance improvement. However, they do not explicitly capture long-term motion correspondences and thus cannot handle large motions effectively. In this paper, inspired by the traditional matching-optimization methods where matching is introduced to handle large displacements before energy-based optimizations, we introduce a simple but effective global matching step before the direct regression and develop a learning-based matching-optimization framework, namely GMFlowNet. In GMFlowNet, global matching is efficiently calculated by applying argmax on 4D cost volumes. Additionally, to improve the matching quality, we propose patch-based overlapping attention to extract large context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlowNet outperforms RAFT, the most popular optimization-only method, by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Thanks to the matching and overlapping attention, GMFlowNet obtains major improvements on the predictions for textureless regions and large motions.

- **Summary**: Precisely locating and segmenting medical instruments in images of minimally invasive surgeries, medical instrument segmentation, is an essential first step for several tasks in medical image processing. However, image degradations, small instruments, and the generalization between different surgery types make medical instrument segmentation challenging. To cope with these challenges, we adapt the object proposal generation system AttentionMask and propose a dedicated post-processing to select promising proposals. The results on the ROBUST-MIS Challenge 2019 show that our adapted AttentionMask system is a strong foundation for generating state-of-the-art performance. Our evaluation in an object proposal generation framework shows that our adapted AttentionMask system is robust to image degradations, generalizes well to unseen types of surgeries, and copes well with small instruments.

- **Summary**: An essential goal of computational media intelligence is to support understanding how media stories -- be it news, commercial or entertainment media -- represent and reflect society and these portrayals are perceived. People are a central element of media stories. This paper focuses on understanding the representation and depiction of background characters in media depictions, primarily movies and TV shows. We define the background characters as those who do not participate vocally in any scene throughout the movie and address the problem of localizing background characters in videos. We use an active speaker localization system to extract high-confidence face-speech associations and generate audio-visual profiles for talking characters in a movie by automatically clustering them. Using a face verification system, we then prune all the face-tracks which match any of the generated character profiles and obtain the background character face-tracks. We curate a background character dataset which provides annotations for background character for a set of TV shows, and use it to evaluate the performance of the background character detection framework.

- **Summary**: Few-shot models aim at making predictions using a minimal number of labeled examples from a given task. The main challenge in this area is the one-shot setting where only one element represents each class. We propose HyperShot - the fusion of kernels and hypernetwork paradigm. Compared to reference approaches that apply a gradient-based adjustment of the parameters, our model aims to switch the classification module parameters depending on the task's embedding. In practice, we utilize a hypernetwork, which takes the aggregated information from support data and returns the classifier's parameters handcrafted for the considered problem. Moreover, we introduce the kernel-based representation of the support examples delivered to hypernetwork to create the parameters of the classification module. Consequently, we rely on relations between embeddings of the support examples instead of direct feature values provided by the backbone models. Thanks to this approach, our model can adapt to highly different tasks.

- **Summary**: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is an inexorably progressive fibrotic lung disease with a variable and unpredictable rate of progression. CT scans of the lungs inform clinical assessment of IPF patients and contain pertinent information related to disease progression. In this work, we propose a multi-modal method that uses neural networks and memory banks to predict the survival of IPF patients using clinical and imaging data. The majority of clinical IPF patient records have missing data (e.g. missing lung function tests). To this end, we propose a probabilistic model that captures the dependencies between the observed clinical variables and imputes missing ones. This principled approach to missing data imputation can be naturally combined with a deep survival analysis model. We show that the proposed framework yields significantly better survival analysis results than baselines in terms of concordance index and integrated Brier score. Our work also provides insights into novel image-based biomarkers that are linked to mortality.

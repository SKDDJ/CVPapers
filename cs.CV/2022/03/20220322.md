- **Summary**: Convexity prior is one of the main cue for human vision and shape completion with important applications in image processing, computer vision. This paper focuses on characterization methods for convex objects and applications in image processing. We present a new method for convex objects representations using binary functions, that is, the convexity of a region is equivalent to a simple quadratic inequality constraint on its indicator function. Models are proposed firstly by incorporating this result for image segmentation with convexity prior and convex hull computation of a given set with and without noises. Then, these models are summarized to a general optimization problem on binary function(s) with the quadratic inequality. Numerical algorithm is proposed based on linearization technique, where the linearized problem is solved by a proximal alternating direction method of multipliers with guaranteed convergent. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods for image segmentation and convex hull computation in accuracy and computing time.

- **Summary**: We present a dataset of 998 3D models of everyday tabletop objects along with their 847,000 real world RGB and depth images. Accurate annotations of camera poses and object poses for each image are performed in a semi-automated fashion to facilitate the use of the dataset for myriad 3D applications like shape reconstruction, object pose estimation, shape retrieval etc. We primarily focus on learned multi-view 3D reconstruction due to the lack of appropriate real world benchmark for the task and demonstrate that our dataset can fill that gap. The entire annotated dataset along with the source code for the annotation tools and evaluation baselines is available at http://www.ocrtoc.org/3d-reconstruction.html.

- **Summary**: Self-driving cars must detect vehicles, pedestrians, and other traffic participants accurately to operate safely. Small, far-away, or highly occluded objects are particularly challenging because there is limited information in the LiDAR point clouds for detecting them. To address this challenge, we leverage valuable information from the past: in particular, data collected in past traversals of the same scene. We posit that these past data, which are typically discarded, provide rich contextual information for disambiguating the above-mentioned challenging cases. To this end, we propose a novel, end-to-end trainable Hindsight framework to extract this contextual information from past traversals and store it in an easy-to-query data structure, which can then be leveraged to aid future 3D object detection of the same scene. We show that this framework is compatible with most modern 3D detection architectures and can substantially improve their average precision on multiple autonomous driving datasets, most notably by more than 300% on the challenging cases.

- **Summary**: For Domain Generalizable Object Detection (DGOD), Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) helps a lot by explicitly disentangling Domain-Invariant Representations (DIR) from Domain-Specific Representations (DSR). Considering the domain category is an attribute of input data, it should be feasible for networks to fit a specific mapping which projects DSR into feature channels exclusive to domain-specific information, and thus much cleaner disentanglement of DIR from DSR can be achieved simply on channel dimension. Inspired by this idea, we propose a novel DRL method for DGOD, which is termed Gated Domain-Invariant Feature Disentanglement (GDIFD). In GDIFD, a Channel Gate Module (CGM) learns to output channel gate signals close to either 0 or 1, which can mask out the channels exclusive to domain-specific information helpful for domain recognition. With the proposed GDIFD, the backbone in our framework can fit the desired mapping easily, which enables the channel-wise disentanglement. In experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is highly effective and achieves state-of-the-art DGOD performance.

- **Summary**: DeepFakes are raising significant social concerns. Although various DeepFake detectors have been developed as forensic countermeasures, these detectors are still vulnerable to attacks. Recently, a few attacks, principally adversarial attacks, have succeeded in cloaking DeepFake images to evade detection. However, these attacks have typical detector-specific designs, which require prior knowledge about the detector, leading to poor transferability. Moreover, these attacks only consider simple security scenarios. Less is known about how effective they are in high-level scenarios where either the detectors or the attacker's knowledge varies. In this paper, we solve the above challenges with presenting a novel detector-agnostic trace removal attack for DeepFake anti-forensics. Instead of investigating the detector side, our attack looks into the original DeepFake creation pipeline, attempting to remove all detectable natural DeepFake traces to render the fake images more "authentic". To implement this attack, first, we perform a DeepFake trace discovery, identifying three discernible traces. Then a trace removal network (TR-Net) is proposed based on an adversarial learning framework involving one generator and multiple discriminators. Each discriminator is responsible for one individual trace representation to avoid cross-trace interference. These discriminators are arranged in parallel, which prompts the generator to remove various traces simultaneously. To evaluate the attack efficacy, we crafted heterogeneous security scenarios where the detectors were embedded with different levels of defense and the attackers' background knowledge of data varies. The experimental results show that the proposed attack can significantly compromise the detection accuracy of six state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors while causing only a negligible loss in visual quality to the original DeepFake samples.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) method is proposed, which learns not only representations but also representations uncertainties by considering SSL in terms of variational inference. SSL is a method of learning representation without labels by maximizing the similarity between image representations of different augmented views of the same image. Variational autoencoder (VAE) is an unsupervised representation learning method that trains a probabilistic generative model with variational inference. VAE and SSL can learn representations without labels, but the relationship between VAE and SSL has not been revealed. In this paper, the theoretical relationship between SSL and variational inference is clarified. In addition, variational inference SimSiam (VI-SimSiam) is proposed, which can predict the representation uncertainty by interpreting SimSiam with variational inference and defining the latent space distribution. The experiment qualitatively showed that VISimSiam could learn uncertainty by comparing input images and predicted uncertainties. We also revealed a relationship between estimated uncertainty and classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal learning has been intensified in recent years, especially for applications in facial analysis and action unit detection whilst there still exist two main challenges in terms of 1) relevant feature learning for representation and 2) efficient fusion for multi-modalities. Recently, there are a number of works have shown the effectiveness in utilizing the attention mechanism for AU detection, however, most of them are binding the region of interest (ROI) with features but rarely apply attention between features of each AU. On the other hand, the transformer, which utilizes a more efficient self-attention mechanism, has been widely used in natural language processing and computer vision tasks but is not fully explored in AU detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Multi-Head Fused Transformer (MFT) method for AU detection, which learns AU encoding features representation from different modalities by transformer encoder and fuses modalities by another fusion transformer module. Multi-head fusion attention is designed in the fusion transformer module for the effective fusion of multiple modalities. Our approach is evaluated on two public multi-modal AU databases, BP4D, and BP4D+, and the results are superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms and baseline models. We further analyze the performance of AU detection from different modalities.



### Scalable Video Object Segmentation with Identification Mechanism

- **Summary**: This paper delves into the challenges of achieving scalable and effective multi-object modeling for semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (VOS). Previous VOS methods decode features with a single positive object, limiting the learning of multi-object representation as they must match and segment each target separately under multi-object scenarios. Additionally, earlier techniques catered to specific application objectives and lacked the flexibility to fulfill different speed-accuracy requirements. To address these problems, we present two innovative approaches, Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) and Associating Objects with Scalable Transformers (AOST). In pursuing effective multi-object modeling, AOT introduces the IDentification (ID) mechanism to allocate each object a unique identity. This approach enables the network to model the associations among all objects simultaneously, thus facilitating the tracking and segmentation of objects in a single network pass. To address the challenge of inflexible deployment, AOST further integrates scalable long short-term transformers that incorporate layer-wise ID-based attention and scalable supervision. This overcomes ID embeddings' representation limitations and enables online architecture scalability in VOS for the first time. Given the absence of a benchmark for VOS involving densely multi-object annotations, we propose a challenging Video Object Segmentation in the Wild (VOSW) benchmark to validate our approaches. We evaluated various AOT and AOST variants using extensive experiments across VOSW and five commonly-used VOS benchmarks. Our approaches surpass the state-of-the-art competitors and display exceptional efficiency and scalability consistently across all six benchmarks. Moreover, we notably achieved the 1st position in the 3rd Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

- **Summary**: Modern livestock farming is increasingly data driven and frequently relies on efficient remote sensing to gather data over wide areas. High resolution satellite imagery is one such data source, which is becoming more accessible for farmers as coverage increases and cost falls. Such images can be used to detect and track animals, monitor pasture changes, and understand land use. Many of the data driven models being applied to these tasks require ground truthing at resolutions higher than satellites can provide. Simultaneously, there is a lack of available aerial imagery focused on farmland changes that occur over days or weeks, such as herd movement. With this goal in mind, we present a new multi-temporal dataset of high resolution UAV imagery which is artificially degraded to match satellite data quality. An empirical blurring metric is used to calibrate the degradation process against actual satellite imagery of the area. UAV surveys were flown repeatedly over several weeks, for specific farm locations. This 5cm/pixel data is sufficiently high resolution to accurately ground truth cattle locations, and other factors such as grass cover. From 33 wide area UAV surveys, 1869 patches were extracted and artificially degraded using an accurate satellite optical model to simulate satellite data. Geographic patches from multiple time periods are aligned and presented as sets, providing a multi-temporal dataset that can be used for detecting changes on farms. The geo-referenced images and 27,853 manually annotated cattle labels are made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Limited by the computational efficiency and accuracy, generating complex 3D scenes remains a challenging problem for existing generation networks. In this work, we propose DepthGAN, a novel method of generating depth maps with only semantic layouts as input. First, we introduce a well-designed cascade of transformer blocks as our generator to capture the structural correlations in depth maps, which makes a balance between global feature aggregation and local attention. Meanwhile, we propose a cross-attention fusion module to guide edge preservation efficiently in depth generation, which exploits additional appearance supervision information. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the perspective views of the Structured3d panorama dataset and demonstrate that our DepthGAN achieves superior performance both on quantitative results and visual effects in the depth generation task.Furthermore, 3D indoor scenes can be reconstructed by our generated depth maps with reasonable structure and spatial coherency.

- **Summary**: Alignment or registration of functions is a fundamental problem in statistical analysis of functions and shapes. While there are several approaches available, a more recent approach based on Fisher-Rao metric and square-root velocity functions (SRVFs) has been shown to have good performance. However, this SRVF method has two limitations: (1) it is susceptible to over alignment, i.e., alignment of noise as well as the signal, and (2) in case there is additional information in form of landmarks, the original formulation does not prescribe a way to incorporate that information. In this paper we propose an extension that allows for incorporation of landmark information to seek a compromise between matching curves and landmarks. This results in a soft landmark alignment that pushes landmarks closer, without requiring their exact overlays to finds a compromise between contributions from functions and landmarks. The proposed method is demonstrated to be superior in certain practical scenarios.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel monocular ray-based 3D (Ray3D) absolute human pose estimation with calibrated camera. Accurate and generalizable absolute 3D human pose estimation from monocular 2D pose input is an ill-posed problem. To address this challenge, we convert the input from pixel space to 3D normalized rays. This conversion makes our approach robust to camera intrinsic parameter changes. To deal with the in-the-wild camera extrinsic parameter variations, Ray3D explicitly takes the camera extrinsic parameters as an input and jointly models the distribution between the 3D pose rays and camera extrinsic parameters. This novel network design is the key to the outstanding generalizability of Ray3D approach. To have a comprehensive understanding of how the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameter variations affect the accuracy of absolute 3D key-point localization, we conduct in-depth systematic experiments on three single person 3D benchmarks as well as one synthetic benchmark. These experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and the synthetic dataset are available at https://github.com/YxZhxn/Ray3D .



### Remember Intentions: Retrospective-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: To realize trajectory prediction, most previous methods adopt the parameter-based approach, which encodes all the seen past-future instance pairs into model parameters. However, in this way, the model parameters come from all seen instances, which means a huge amount of irrelevant seen instances might also involve in predicting the current situation, disturbing the performance. To provide a more explicit link between the current situation and the seen instances, we imitate the mechanism of retrospective memory in neuropsychology and propose MemoNet, an instance-based approach that predicts the movement intentions of agents by looking for similar scenarios in the training data. In MemoNet, we design a pair of memory banks to explicitly store representative instances in the training set, acting as prefrontal cortex in the neural system, and a trainable memory addresser to adaptively search a current situation with similar instances in the memory bank, acting like basal ganglia. During prediction, MemoNet recalls previous memory by using the memory addresser to index related instances in the memory bank. We further propose a two-step trajectory prediction system, where the first step is to leverage MemoNet to predict the destination and the second step is to fulfill the whole trajectory according to the predicted destinations. Experiments show that the proposed MemoNet improves the FDE by 20.3%/10.2%/28.3% from the previous best method on SDD/ETH-UCY/NBA datasets. Experiments also show that our MemoNet has the ability to trace back to specific instances during prediction, promoting more interpretability.

- **Summary**: Compared with the domain-specific model, the vision-language pre-training models (VLPMs) have shown superior performance on downstream tasks with fast fine-tuning process. For example, ERNIE-ViL, Oscar and UNIMO trained VLPMs with a uniform transformers stack architecture and large amounts of image-text paired data, achieving remarkable results on downstream tasks such as image-text reference(IR and TR), vision question answering (VQA) and image captioning (IC) etc. During the training phase, VLPMs are always fed with a combination of multiple public datasets to meet the demand of large-scare training data. However, due to the unevenness of data distribution including size, task type and quality, using the mixture of multiple datasets for model training can be problematic. In this work, we introduce a large-scale multi-modal corpora named WuDaoMM, totally containing more than 650M image-text pairs. Specifically, about 600 million pairs of data are collected from multiple webpages in which image and caption present weak correlation, and the other 50 million strong-related image-text pairs are collected from some high-quality graphic websites. We also release a base version of WuDaoMM with 5 million strong-correlated image-text pairs, which is sufficient to support the common cross-modal model pre-training. Besides, we trained both an understanding and a generation vision-language (VL) model to test the dataset effectiveness. The results show that WuDaoMM can be applied as an efficient dataset for VLPMs, especially for the model in text-to-image generation task. The data is released at https://data.wudaoai.cn

- **Summary**: We introduce AdaMix, an adaptive differentially private algorithm for training deep neural network classifiers using both private and public image data. While pre-training language models on large public datasets has enabled strong differential privacy (DP) guarantees with minor loss of accuracy, a similar practice yields punishing trade-offs in vision tasks. A few-shot or even zero-shot learning baseline that ignores private data can outperform fine-tuning on a large private dataset. AdaMix incorporates few-shot training, or cross-modal zero-shot learning, on public data prior to private fine-tuning, to improve the trade-off. AdaMix reduces the error increase from the non-private upper bound from the 167-311\% of the baseline, on average across 6 datasets, to 68-92\% depending on the desired privacy level selected by the user. AdaMix tackles the trade-off arising in visual classification, whereby the most privacy sensitive data, corresponding to isolated points in representation space, are also critical for high classification accuracy. In addition, AdaMix comes with strong theoretical privacy guarantees and convergence analysis.

- **Summary**: With the advent of convolutional neural networks, stereo matching algorithms have recently gained tremendous progress. However, it remains a great challenge to accurately extract disparities from real-world image pairs taken by consumer-level devices like smartphones, due to practical complicating factors such as thin structures, non-ideal rectification, camera module inconsistencies and various hard-case scenes. In this paper, we propose a set of innovative designs to tackle the problem of practical stereo matching: 1) to better recover fine depth details, we design a hierarchical network with recurrent refinement to update disparities in a coarse-to-fine manner, as well as a stacked cascaded architecture for inference; 2) we propose an adaptive group correlation layer to mitigate the impact of erroneous rectification; 3) we introduce a new synthetic dataset with special attention to difficult cases for better generalizing to real-world scenes. Our results not only rank 1st on both Middlebury and ETH3D benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin, but also exhibit high-quality details for real-life photos, which clearly demonstrates the efficacy of our contributions.

- **Summary**: Skin cancer is one of the most common types of malignancy, affecting a large population and causing a heavy economic burden worldwide. Over the last few years, computer-aided diagnosis has been rapidly developed and make great progress in healthcare and medical practices due to the advances in artificial intelligence. However, most studies in skin cancer detection keep pursuing high prediction accuracies without considering the limitation of computing resources on portable devices. In this case, knowledge distillation (KD) has been proven as an efficient tool to help improve the adaptability of lightweight models under limited resources, meanwhile keeping a high-level representation capability. To bridge the gap, this study specifically proposes a novel method, termed SSD-KD, that unifies diverse knowledge into a generic KD framework for skin diseases classification. Our method models an intra-instance relational feature representation and integrates it with existing KD research. A dual relational knowledge distillation architecture is self-supervisedly trained while the weighted softened outputs are also exploited to enable the student model to capture richer knowledge from the teacher model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on ISIC 2019, a large-scale open-accessed benchmark of skin diseases dermoscopic images. Experiments show that our distilled lightweight model can achieve an accuracy as high as 85% for the classification tasks of 8 different skin diseases with minimal parameters and computing requirements. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our intra- and inter-instance relational knowledge integration strategy. Compared with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques, the proposed method demonstrates improved performances for multi-diseases classification on the large-scale dermoscopy database.

- **Summary**: Detection-driven real-time video analytics require continuous detection of objects contained in the video frames using deep learning models like YOLOV3, EfficientDet. However, running these detectors on each and every frame in resource-constrained edge devices is computationally intensive. By taking the temporal correlation between consecutive video frames into account, we note that detection outputs tend to be overlapping in successive frames. Elimination of similar consecutive frames will lead to a negligible drop in performance while offering significant performance benefits by reducing overall computation and communication costs. The key technical questions are, therefore, (a) how to identify which frames to be processed by the object detector, and (b) how many successive frames can be skipped (called skip-length) once a frame is selected to be processed. The overall goal of the process is to keep the error due to skipping frames as small as possible. We introduce a novel error vs processing rate optimization problem with respect to the object detection task that balances between the error rate and the fraction of frames filtering. Subsequently, we propose an off-line Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based algorithm to determine these skip-lengths as a state-action policy of the RL agent from a recorded video and then deploy the agent online for live video streams. To this end, we develop FrameHopper, an edge-cloud collaborative video analytics framework, that runs a lightweight trained RL agent on the camera and passes filtered frames to the server where the object detection model runs for a set of applications. We have tested our approach on a number of live videos captured from real-life scenarios and show that FrameHopper processes only a handful of frames but produces detection results closer to the oracle solution and outperforms recent state-of-the-art solutions in most cases.

- **Summary**: LiDAR and camera are two important sensors for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Despite the increasing popularity of sensor fusion in this field, the robustness against inferior image conditions, e.g., bad illumination and sensor misalignment, is under-explored. Existing fusion methods are easily affected by such conditions, mainly due to a hard association of LiDAR points and image pixels, established by calibration matrices. We propose TransFusion, a robust solution to LiDAR-camera fusion with a soft-association mechanism to handle inferior image conditions. Specifically, our TransFusion consists of convolutional backbones and a detection head based on a transformer decoder. The first layer of the decoder predicts initial bounding boxes from a LiDAR point cloud using a sparse set of object queries, and its second decoder layer adaptively fuses the object queries with useful image features, leveraging both spatial and contextual relationships. The attention mechanism of the transformer enables our model to adaptively determine where and what information should be taken from the image, leading to a robust and effective fusion strategy. We additionally design an image-guided query initialization strategy to deal with objects that are difficult to detect in point clouds. TransFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate its robustness against degenerated image quality and calibration errors. We also extend the proposed method to the 3D tracking task and achieve the 1st place in the leaderboard of nuScenes tracking, showing its effectiveness and generalization capability.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks perform poorly on heavily class-imbalanced datasets. Given the promising performance of contrastive learning, we propose Rebalanced Siamese Contrastive Mining (ResCom) to tackle imbalanced recognition. Based on the mathematical analysis and simulation results, we claim that supervised contrastive learning suffers a dual class-imbalance problem at both the original batch and Siamese batch levels, which is more serious than long-tailed classification learning. In this paper, at the original batch level, we introduce a class-balanced supervised contrastive loss to assign adaptive weights for different classes. At the Siamese batch level, we present a class-balanced queue, which maintains the same number of keys for all classes. Furthermore, we note that the imbalanced contrastive loss gradient with respect to the contrastive logits can be decoupled into the positives and negatives, and easy positives and easy negatives will make the contrastive gradient vanish. We propose supervised hard positive and negative pairs mining to pick up informative pairs for contrastive computation and improve representation learning. Finally, to approximately maximize the mutual information between the two views, we propose Siamese Balanced Softmax and joint it with the contrastive loss for one-stage training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResCom outperforms the previous methods by large margins on multiple long-tailed recognition benchmarks. Our code and models are made publicly available at: https://github.com/dvlab-research/ResCom.

- **Summary**: Image deraining is a typical low-level image restoration task, which aims at decomposing the rainy image into two distinguishable layers: the clean image layer and the rain layer. Most of the existing learning-based deraining methods are supervisedly trained on synthetic rainy-clean pairs. The domain gap between the synthetic and real rains makes them less generalized to different real rainy scenes. Moreover, the existing methods mainly utilize the property of the two layers independently, while few of them have considered the mutually exclusive relationship between the two layers. In this work, we propose a novel non-local contrastive learning (NLCL) method for unsupervised image deraining. Consequently, we not only utilize the intrinsic self-similarity property within samples but also the mutually exclusive property between the two layers, so as to better differ the rain layer from the clean image. Specifically, the non-local self-similarity image layer patches as the positives are pulled together and similar rain layer patches as the negatives are pushed away. Thus the similar positive/negative samples that are close in the original space benefit us to enrich more discriminative representation. Apart from the self-similarity sampling strategy, we analyze how to choose an appropriate feature encoder in NLCL. Extensive experiments on different real rainy datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance in real deraining.

- **Summary**: Dense point cloud generation from a sparse or incomplete point cloud is a crucial and challenging problem in 3D computer vision and computer graphics. So far, the existing methods are either computationally too expensive, suffer from limited resolution, or both. In addition, some methods are strictly limited to watertight surfaces -- another major obstacle for a number of applications. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network that learns and predicts the unsigned distance field for arbitrary 3D shapes for dense point cloud generation using the recently emerged concept of implicit function learning. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms the state of the art by 87% less model parameters, 36% reduced inference time and improved generated point cloud accuracy.

- **Summary**: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted various levels of society. The use of masks is essential in preventing the spread of COVID-19 by identifying an image of a person using a mask. Although only 23.1% of people use masks correctly, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can help classify the use of good masks to help slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus. However, it requires a large dataset to train an ANN that can classify the use of masks correctly. MaskedFace-Net is a suitable dataset consisting of 137016 digital images with 4 class labels, namely Mask, Mask Chin, Mask Mouth Chin, and Mask Nose Mouth. Mask classification training utilizes Vision Transformers (ViT) architecture with transfer learning method using pre-trained weights on ImageNet-21k, with random augmentation. In addition, the hyper-parameters of training of 20 epochs, an Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.03, a batch size of 64, a Gaussian Cumulative Distribution (GeLU) activation function, and a Cross-Entropy loss function are used to be applied on the training of three architectures of ViT, namely Base-16, Large-16, and Huge-14. Furthermore, comparisons of with and without augmentation and transfer learning are conducted. This study found that the best classification is transfer learning and augmentation using ViT Huge-14. Using this method on MaskedFace-Net dataset, the research reaches an accuracy of 0.9601 on training data, 0.9412 on validation data, and 0.9534 on test data. This research shows that training the ViT model with data augmentation and transfer learning improves classification of the mask usage, even better than convolutional-based Residual Network (ResNet).

- **Summary**: In this paper, we devise a novel interactive satellite image change detection algorithm based on active learning. The proposed framework is iterative and relies on a question and answer model which asks the oracle (user) questions about the most informative display (subset of critical images), and according to the user's responses, updates change detections. The contribution of our framework resides in a novel display model which selects the most representative and diverse virtual exemplars that adversely challenge the learned change detection functions, thereby leading to highly discriminating functions in the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments, conducted on the challenging task of interactive satellite image change detection, show the superiority of the proposed virtual display model against the related work.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel interactive satellite image change detection algorithm based on active learning. The proposed approach is iterative and asks the user (oracle) questions about the targeted changes and according to the oracle's responses updates change detections. We consider a probabilistic framework which assigns to each unlabeled sample a relevance measure modeling how critical is that sample when training change detection functions. These relevance measures are obtained by minimizing an objective function mixing diversity, representativity and uncertainty. These criteria when combined allow exploring different data modes and also refining change detections. To further explore the potential of this objective function, we consider a reinforcement learning approach that finds the best combination of diversity, representativity and uncertainty, through active learning iterations, leading to better generalization as corroborated through experiments in interactive satellite image change detection.

- **Summary**: The recently proposed sparsifying transform models incur low computational cost and have been applied to medical imaging. Meanwhile, deep models with nested network structure reveal great potential for learning features in different layers. In this study, we propose a network-structured sparsifying transform learning approach for X-ray computed tomography (CT), which we refer to as multi-layer clustering-based residual sparsifying transform (MCST) learning. The proposed MCST scheme learns multiple different unitary transforms in each layer by dividing each layer's input into several classes. We apply the MCST model to low-dose CT (LDCT) reconstruction by deploying the learned MCST model into the regularizer in penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) reconstruction. We conducted LDCT reconstruction experiments on XCAT phantom data and Mayo Clinic data and trained the MCST model with 2 (or 3) layers and with 5 clusters in each layer. The learned transforms in the same layer showed rich features while additional information is extracted from representation residuals. Our simulation results demonstrate that PWLS-MCST achieves better image reconstruction quality than the conventional FBP method and PWLS with edge-preserving (EP) regularizer. It also outperformed recent advanced methods like PWLS with a learned multi-layer residual sparsifying transform prior (MARS) and PWLS with a union of learned transforms (ULTRA), especially for displaying clear edges and preserving subtle details.

- **Summary**: Since the future of computing is heterogeneous, scalability is a crucial problem for single image super-resolution. Recent works try to train one network, which can be deployed on platforms with different capacities. However, they rely on the pixel-wise sparse convolution, which is not hardware-friendly and achieves limited practical speedup. As image can be divided into patches, which have various restoration difficulties, we present a scalable method based on Adaptive Patch Exiting (APE) to achieve more practical speedup. Specifically, we propose to train a regressor to predict the incremental capacity of each layer for the patch. Once the incremental capacity is below the threshold, the patch can exit at the specific layer. Our method can easily adjust the trade-off between performance and efficiency by changing the threshold of incremental capacity. Furthermore, we propose a novel strategy to enable the network training of our method. We conduct extensive experiments across various backbones, datasets and scaling factors to demonstrate the advantages of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/littlepure2333/APE

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the problem of temporally interpolating dynamic 3D point clouds with large non-rigid deformation. We formulate the problem as estimation of point-wise trajectories (i.e., smooth curves) and further reason that temporal irregularity and under-sampling are two major challenges. To tackle the challenges, we propose IDEA-Net, an end-to-end deep learning framework, which disentangles the problem under the assistance of the explicitly learned temporal consistency. Specifically, we propose a temporal consistency learning module to align two consecutive point cloud frames point-wisely, based on which we can employ linear interpolation to obtain coarse trajectories/in-between frames. To compensate the high-order nonlinear components of trajectories, we apply aligned feature embeddings that encode local geometry properties to regress point-wise increments, which are combined with the coarse estimations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various point cloud sequences and observe large improvement over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually. Our framework can bring benefits to 3D motion data acquisition. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZENGYIMING-EAMON/IDEA-Net.git.

- **Summary**: Pre-training has been adopted in a few of recent works for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). However, previous pre-training methods for VLN either lack the ability to predict future actions or ignore the trajectory contexts, which are essential for a greedy navigation process. In this work, to promote the learning of spatio-temporal visual-textual correspondence as well as the agent's capability of decision making, we propose a novel history-and-order aware pre-training paradigm (HOP) with VLN-specific objectives that exploit the past observations and support future action prediction. Specifically, in addition to the commonly used Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Trajectory-Instruction Matching (TIM), we design two proxy tasks to model temporal order information: Trajectory Order Modeling (TOM) and Group Order Modeling (GOM). Moreover, our navigation action prediction is also enhanced by introducing the task of Action Prediction with History (APH), which takes into account the history visual perceptions. Extensive experimental results on four downstream VLN tasks (R2R, REVERIE, NDH, RxR) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared against several state-of-the-art agents.



### Unified Negative Pair Generation toward Well-discriminative Feature Space for Face Recognition

- **Summary**: The goal of face recognition (FR) can be viewed as a pair similarity optimization problem, maximizing a similarity set $\mathcal{S}^p$ over positive pairs, while minimizing similarity set $\mathcal{S}^n$ over negative pairs. Ideally, it is expected that FR models form a well-discriminative feature space (WDFS) that satisfies $\inf{\mathcal{S}^p} > \sup{\mathcal{S}^n}$. With regard to WDFS, the existing deep feature learning paradigms (i.e., metric and classification losses) can be expressed as a unified perspective on different pair generation (PG) strategies. Unfortunately, in the metric loss (ML), it is infeasible to generate negative pairs taking all classes into account in each iteration because of the limited mini-batch size. In contrast, in classification loss (CL), it is difficult to generate extremely hard negative pairs owing to the convergence of the class weight vectors to their center. This leads to a mismatch between the two similarity distributions of the sampled pairs and all negative pairs. Thus, this paper proposes a unified negative pair generation (UNPG) by combining two PG strategies (i.e., MLPG and CLPG) from a unified perspective to alleviate the mismatch. UNPG introduces useful information about negative pairs using MLPG to overcome the CLPG deficiency. Moreover, it includes filtering the similarities of noisy negative pairs to guarantee reliable convergence and improved performance. Exhaustive experiments show the superiority of UNPG by achieving state-of-the-art performance across recent loss functions on public benchmark datasets. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available.

This in consequence has lent progress to the domain of Autonomous Driving and Navigation Systems. Most of the present research work has been focused on driving scenarios in the European or American roads. Our paper draws special attention to the Indian driving context. To this effect, we propose a novel architecture, DR-Gaze, which is used to map the driver's gaze onto the road. We compare our results with previous works and state-of-the-art results on the DGAZE dataset. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of our paper.

- **Summary**: Spotting camouflaged objects that are visually assimilated into the background is tricky for both object detection algorithms and humans who are usually confused or cheated by the perfectly intrinsic similarities between the foreground objects and the background surroundings. To tackle this challenge, we aim to extract the high-resolution texture details to avoid the detail degradation that causes blurred vision in edges and boundaries. We introduce a novel HitNet to refine the low-resolution representations by high-resolution features in an iterative feedback manner, essentially a global loop-based connection among the multi-scale resolutions. In addition, an iterative feedback loss is proposed to impose more constraints on each feedback connection. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate that our \ourmodel~breaks the performance bottleneck and achieves significant improvements compared with 29 state-of-the-art methods. To address the data scarcity in camouflaged scenarios, we provide an application example by employing cross-domain learning to extract the features that can reflect the camouflaged object properties and embed the features into salient objects, thereby generating more camouflaged training samples from the diverse salient object datasets The code will be available at https://github.com/HUuxiaobin/HitNet.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the task of conditional Human Motion Animation (cHMA). Given a source image and a driving video, the model should animate the new frame sequence, in which the person in the source image should perform a similar motion as the pose sequence from the driving video. Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) methods in image and video synthesis, it is still very challenging to conduct cHMA due to the difficulty in efficiently utilizing the conditional guided information such as images or poses, and generating images of good visual quality. To this end, this paper proposes a novel model of learning to Quantize, Scrabble, and Craft (QS-Craft) for conditional human motion animation. The key novelties come from the newly introduced three key steps: quantize, scrabble and craft. Particularly, our QS-Craft employs transformer in its structure to utilize the attention architectures. The guided information is represented as a pose coordinate sequence extracted from the driving videos. Extensive experiments on human motion datasets validate the efficacy of our model.

- **Summary**: Human actions often induce changes of object states such as "cutting an apple", "cleaning shoes" or "pouring coffee". In this paper, we seek to temporally localize object states (e.g. "empty" and "full" cup) together with the corresponding state-modifying actions ("pouring coffee") in long uncurated videos with minimal supervision. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we develop a self-supervised model for jointly learning state-modifying actions together with the corresponding object states from an uncurated set of videos from the Internet. The model is self-supervised by the causal ordering signal, i.e. initial object state $\rightarrow$ manipulating action $\rightarrow$ end state. Second, to cope with noisy uncurated training data, our model incorporates a noise adaptive weighting module supervised by a small number of annotated still images, that allows to efficiently filter out irrelevant videos during training. Third, we collect a new dataset with more than 2600 hours of video and 34 thousand changes of object states, and manually annotate a part of this data to validate our approach. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over prior work in both action and object state-recognition in video.

- **Summary**: Understanding of deformable object manipulations such as textiles is a challenge due to the complexity and high dimensionality of the problem. Particularly, the lack of a generic representation of semantic states (e.g., \textit{crumpled}, \textit{diagonally folded}) during a continuous manipulation process introduces an obstacle to identify the manipulation type. In this paper, we aim to solve the problem of semantic state estimation in cloth manipulation tasks. For this purpose, we introduce a new large-scale fully-annotated RGB image dataset showing various human demonstrations of different complicated cloth manipulations. We provide a set of baseline deep networks and benchmark them on the problem of semantic state estimation using our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we investigate the scalability of our semantic state estimation framework in robot monitoring tasks of long and complex cloth manipulations.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art saliency detection models rely heavily on large datasets of accurate pixel-wise annotations, but manually labeling pixels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. There are some weakly supervised methods developed for alleviating the problem, such as image label, bounding box label, and scribble label, while point label still has not been explored in this field. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised salient object detection method using point supervision. To infer the saliency map, we first design an adaptive masked flood filling algorithm to generate pseudo labels. Then we develop a transformer-based point-supervised saliency detection model to produce the first round of saliency maps. However, due to the sparseness of the label, the weakly supervised model tends to degenerate into a general foreground detection model. To address this issue, we propose a Non-Salient Suppression (NSS) method to optimize the erroneous saliency maps generated in the first round and leverage them for the second round of training. Moreover, we build a new point-supervised dataset (P-DUTS) by relabeling the DUTS dataset. In P-DUTS, there is only one labeled point for each salient object. Comprehensive experiments on five largest benchmark datasets demonstrate our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods trained with the stronger supervision and even surpass several fully supervised state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Scene graph generation (SGG) is designed to extract (subject, predicate, object) triplets in images. Recent works have made a steady progress on SGG, and provide useful tools for high-level vision and language understanding. However, due to the data distribution problems including long-tail distribution and semantic ambiguity, the predictions of current SGG models tend to collapse to several frequent but uninformative predicates (e.g., on, at), which limits practical application of these models in downstream tasks. To deal with the problems above, we propose a novel Internal and External Data Transfer (IETrans) method, which can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion and expanded to large SGG with 1,807 predicate classes. Our IETrans tries to relieve the data distribution problem by automatically creating an enhanced dataset that provides more sufficient and coherent annotations for all predicates. By training on the enhanced dataset, a Neural Motif model doubles the macro performance while maintaining competitive micro performance. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/waxnkw/IETrans-SGG.pytorch.

- **Summary**: Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in the online knowledge distillation. Adopting an one-stage and end-to-end training fashion, online knowledge distillation uses aggregated intermediated predictions of multiple peer models for training. However, the absence of a powerful teacher model may result in the homogeneity problem between group peers, affecting the effectiveness of group distillation adversely. In this paper, we propose a novel online knowledge distillation method, \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}upervision for Online Knowledge Distillation (CSS), which structures diversity in terms of input, target, and network to alleviate the homogenization problem. Specifically, we construct a dual-network multi-branch structure and enhance inter-branch diversity through self-supervised learning, adopting the feature-level transformation and augmenting the corresponding labels. Meanwhile, the dual network structure has a larger space of independent parameters to resist the homogenization problem during distillation. Extensive quantitative experiments on CIFAR-100 illustrate that our method provides greater diversity than OKDDip and we also give pretty performance improvement, even over the state-of-the-art such as PCL. The results on three fine-grained datasets (StanfordDogs, StanfordCars, CUB-200-211) also show the significant generalization capability of our approach.

- **Summary**: Continual learning is a longstanding research topic due to its crucial role in tackling continually arriving tasks. Up to now, the study of continual learning in computer vision is mainly restricted to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, recently there is a tendency that the newly emerging vision transformers (ViTs) are gradually dominating the field of computer vision, which leaves CNN-based continual learning lagging behind as they can suffer from severe performance degradation if straightforwardly applied to ViTs. In this paper, we study ViT-backed continual learning to strive for higher performance riding on recent advances of ViTs. Inspired by mask-based continual learning methods in CNNs, where a mask is learned per task to adapt the pre-trained ViT to the new task, we propose MEta-ATtention (MEAT), i.e., attention to self-attention, to adapt a pre-trained ViT to new tasks without sacrificing performance on already learned tasks. Unlike prior mask-based methods like Piggyback, where all parameters are associated with corresponding masks, MEAT leverages the characteristics of ViTs and only masks a portion of its parameters. It renders MEAT more efficient and effective with less overhead and higher accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEAT exhibits significant superiority to its state-of-the-art CNN counterparts, with 4.0~6.0% absolute boosts in accuracy.

- **Summary**: Learned image compression research has achieved state-of-the-art compression performance with auto-encoder based neural network architectures, where the image is mapped via convolutional neural networks (CNN) into a latent representation that is quantized and processed again with CNN to obtain the reconstructed image. CNN operate on entire input images. On the other hand, traditional state-of-the-art image and video compression methods process images with a block-by-block processing approach for various reasons. Very recently, work on learned image compression with block based approaches have also appeared, which use the auto-encoder architecture on large blocks of the input image and introduce additional neural networks that perform intra/spatial prediction and deblocking/post-processing functions. This paper explores an alternative learned block-based image compression approach in which neither an explicit intra prediction neural network nor an explicit deblocking neural network is used. A single auto-encoder neural network with block-level masked convolutions is used and the block size is much smaller (8x8). By using block-level masked convolutions, each block is processed using reconstructed neighboring left and upper blocks both at the encoder and decoder. Hence, the mutual information between adjacent blocks is exploited during compression and each block is reconstructed using neighboring blocks, resolving the need for explicit intra prediction and deblocking neural networks. Since the explored system is a closed loop system, a special optimization procedure, the asymptotic closed loop design, is used with standard stochastic gradient descent based training. The experimental results indicate competitive image compression performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in self-supervised contrastive learning yield good image-level representation, which favors classification tasks but usually neglects pixel-level detailed information, leading to unsatisfactory transfer performance to dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. In this work, we propose a pixel-wise contrastive learning method called CP2 (Copy-Paste Contrastive Pretraining), which facilitates both image- and pixel-level representation learning and therefore is more suitable for downstream dense prediction tasks. In detail, we copy-paste a random crop from an image (the foreground) onto different background images and pretrain a semantic segmentation model with the objective of 1) distinguishing the foreground pixels from the background pixels, and 2) identifying the composed images that share the same foreground.Experiments show the strong performance of CP2 in downstream semantic segmentation: By finetuning CP2 pretrained models on PASCAL VOC 2012, we obtain 78.6% mIoU with a ResNet-50 and 79.5% with a ViT-S.

- **Summary**: Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) exams should utilize the lowest possible radiation dose while maintaining sufficiently good image quality for accurate medical diagnosis. In this work, we propose a convolution neural network (CNN) to restore low-dose (LD) DBT projections to achieve an image quality equivalent to a standard full-dose (FD) acquisition. The proposed network architecture benefits from priors in terms of layers that were inspired by traditional model-based (MB) restoration methods, considering a model-based deep learning approach, where the network is trained to operate in the variance stabilization transformation (VST) domain. To accurately control the network operation point, in terms of noise and blur of the restored image, we propose a loss function that minimizes the bias and matches residual noise between the input and the output. The training dataset was composed of clinical data acquired at the standard FD and low-dose pairs obtained by the injection of quantum noise. The network was tested using real DBT projections acquired with a physical anthropomorphic breast phantom. The proposed network achieved superior results in terms of the mean normalized squared error (MNSE), training time and noise spatial correlation compared with networks trained with traditional data-driven methods. The proposed approach can be extended for other medical imaging application that requires LD acquisitions.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to find anomalous images by optimising a detector using a training set that contains only normal images. UAD approaches can be based on reconstruction methods, self-supervised approaches, and Imagenet pre-trained models. Reconstruction methods, which detect anomalies from image reconstruction errors, are advantageous because they do not rely on the design of problem-specific pretext tasks needed by self-supervised approaches, and on the unreliable translation of models pre-trained from non-medical datasets. However, reconstruction methods may fail because they can have low reconstruction errors even for anomalous images. In this paper, we introduce a new reconstruction-based UAD approach that addresses this low-reconstruction error issue for anomalous images. Our UAD approach, the memory-augmented multi-level cross-attentional masked autoencoder (MemMC-MAE), is a transformer-based approach, consisting of a novel memory-augmented self-attention operator for the encoder and a new multi-level cross-attention operator for the decoder. MemMCMAE masks large parts of the input image during its reconstruction, reducing the risk that it will produce low reconstruction errors because anomalies are likely to be masked and cannot be reconstructed. However, when the anomaly is not masked, then the normal patterns stored in the encoder's memory combined with the decoder's multi-level cross attention will constrain the accurate reconstruction of the anomaly. We show that our method achieves SOTA anomaly detection and localisation on colonoscopy, pneumonia, and covid-19 chest x-ray datasets.

- **Summary**: Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) can asynchronously output the events reflecting apparent motion of objects with microsecond resolution, and shows great application potential in monitoring and other fields. However, the output event stream of existing DVS inevitably contains background activity noise (BA noise) due to dark current and junction leakage current, which will affect the temporal correlation of objects, resulting in deteriorated motion estimation performance. Particularly, the existing filter-based denoising methods cannot be directly applied to suppress the noise in event stream, since there is no spatial correlation. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel progressive framework, in which a Motion Estimation (ME) module and an Event Denoising (ED) module are jointly optimized in a mutually reinforced manner. Specifically, based on the maximum sharpness criterion, ME module divides the input event into several segments by adaptive clustering in a motion compensating warp field, and captures the temporal correlation of event stream according to the clustered motion parameters. Taking temporal correlation as guidance, ED module calculates the confidence that each event belongs to real activity events, and transmits it to ME module to update energy function of motion segmentation for noise suppression. The two steps are iteratively updated until stable motion segmentation results are obtained. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approaches against the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: In dynamic scenes, images often suffer from dynamic blur due to superposition of motions or low signal-noise ratio resulted from quick shutter speed when avoiding motions. Recovering sharp and clean results from the captured images heavily depends on the ability of restoration methods and the quality of the input. Although existing research on image restoration focuses on developing models for obtaining better restored results, fewer have studied to evaluate how and which input image leads to superior restored quality. In this paper, to better study an image's potential value that can be explored for restoration, we propose a novel concept, referring to image restoration potential (IRP). Specifically, We first establish a dynamic scene imaging dataset containing composite distortions and applied image restoration processes to validate the rationality of the existence to IRP. Based on this dataset, we investigate several properties of IRP and propose a novel deep model to accurately predict IRP values. By gradually distilling and selective fusing the degradation features, the proposed model shows its superiority in IRP prediction. Thanks to the proposed model, we are then able to validate how various image restoration related applications are benefited from IRP prediction. We show the potential usages of IRP as a filtering principle to select valuable frames, an auxiliary guidance to improve restoration models, and even an indicator to optimize camera settings for capturing better images under dynamic scenarios.

Despite the significant progress, the performance of such detectors are often assessed in public benchmarks under non-realistic conditions. Specifically, impact of conventional distortions and processing operations such as compression, noise, and enhancement are not sufficiently studied. This paper proposes a rigorous framework to assess performance of learning-based detectors in more realistic situations. An illustrative example is shown under deepfake detection context. Inspired by the assessment results, a data augmentation strategy based on natural image degradation process is designed, which significantly improves the generalization ability of two deepfake detectors.

- **Summary**: Blind-spot network (BSN) and its variants have made significant advances in self-supervised denoising. Nevertheless, they are still bound to synthetic noisy inputs due to less practical assumptions like pixel-wise independent noise. Hence, it is challenging to deal with spatially correlated real-world noise using self-supervised BSN. Recently, pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) has been proposed to remove the spatial correlation of real-world noise. However, it is not trivial to integrate PD and BSN directly, which prevents the fully self-supervised denoising model on real-world images. We propose an Asymmetric PD (AP) to address this issue, which introduces different PD stride factors for training and inference. We systematically demonstrate that the proposed AP can resolve inherent trade-offs caused by specific PD stride factors and make BSN applicable to practical scenarios. To this end, we develop AP-BSN, a state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising method for real-world sRGB images. We further propose random-replacing refinement, which significantly improves the performance of our AP-BSN without any additional parameters. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method outperforms the other self-supervised and even unpaired denoising methods by a large margin, without using any additional knowledge, e.g., noise level, regarding the underlying unknown noise.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved exceptional results on multiple detection and recognition tasks. However, the performance of such detectors are often evaluated in public benchmarks under constrained and non-realistic situations. The impact of conventional distortions and processing operations found in imaging workflows such as compression, noise, and enhancement are not sufficiently studied. Currently, only a few researches have been done to improve the detector robustness to unseen perturbations. This paper proposes a more effective data augmentation scheme based on real-world image degradation process. This novel technique is deployed for deepfake detection tasks and has been evaluated by a more realistic assessment framework. Extensive experiments show that the proposed data augmentation scheme improves generalization ability to unpredictable data distortions and unseen datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep models must learn robust and transferable representations in order to perform well on new domains. While domain transfer methods (e.g., domain adaptation, domain generalization) have been proposed to learn transferable representations across domains, they are typically applied to ResNet backbones pre-trained on ImageNet. Thus, existing works pay little attention to the effects of pre-training on domain transfer tasks. In this paper, we provide a broad study and in-depth analysis of pre-training for domain adaptation and generalization, namely: network architectures, size, pre-training loss, and datasets. We observe that simply using a state-of-the-art backbone outperforms existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation baselines and set new baselines on Office-Home and DomainNet improving by 10.7\% and 5.5\%. We hope that this work can provide more insights for future domain transfer research.

- **Summary**: When doctors are trained to diagnose a specific disease, they learn faster when presented with cases in order of increasing difficulty. This creates the need for automatically estimating how difficult it is for doctors to classify a given case. In this paper, we introduce methods for estimating how hard it is for a doctor to diagnose a case represented by a medical image, both when ground truth difficulties are available for training, and when they are not. Our methods are based on embeddings obtained with deep metric learning. Additionally, we introduce a practical method for obtaining ground truth human difficulty for each image case in a dataset using self-assessed certainty. We apply our methods to two different medical datasets, achieving high Kendall rank correlation coefficients, showing that we outperform existing methods by a large margin on our problem and data.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we tackle the problem of synthesizing a ground-view panorama image conditioned on a top-view aerial image, which is a challenging problem due to the large gap between the two image domains with different view-points. Instead of learning cross-view mapping in a feedforward pass, we propose a novel adversarial feedback GAN framework named PanoGAN with two key components: an adversarial feedback module and a dual branch discrimination strategy. First, the aerial image is fed into the generator to produce a target panorama image and its associated segmentation map in favor of model training with layout semantics. Second, the feature responses of the discriminator encoded by our adversarial feedback module are fed back to the generator to refine the intermediate representations, so that the generation performance is continually improved through an iterative generation process. Third, to pursue high-fidelity and semantic consistency of the generated panorama image, we propose a pixel-segmentation alignment mechanism under the dual branch discrimiantion strategy to facilitate cooperation between the generator and the discriminator. Extensive experimental results on two challenging cross-view image datasets show that PanoGAN enables high-quality panorama image generation with more convincing details than state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Models trained in federated settings often suffer from degraded performances and fail at generalizing, especially when facing heterogeneous scenarios. In this work, we investigate such behavior through the lens of geometry of the loss and Hessian eigenspectrum, linking the model's lack of generalization capacity to the sharpness of the solution. Motivated by prior studies connecting the sharpness of the loss surface and the generalization gap, we show that i) training clients locally with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) or its adaptive version (ASAM) and ii) averaging stochastic weights (SWA) on the server-side can substantially improve generalization in Federated Learning and help bridging the gap with centralized models. By seeking parameters in neighborhoods having uniform low loss, the model converges towards flatter minima and its generalization significantly improves in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of those optimizers across a variety of benchmark vision datasets (e.g. CIFAR10/100, Landmarks-User-160k, IDDA) and tasks (large scale classification, semantic segmentation, domain generalization).

- **Summary**: $ $As a result of bad eating habits, humanity may be destroyed. People are constantly on the lookout for tasty foods, with junk foods being the most common source. As a consequence, our eating patterns are shifting, and we're gravitating toward junk food more than ever, which is bad for our health and increases our risk of acquiring health problems. Machine learning principles are applied in every aspect of our lives, and one of them is object recognition via image processing. However, because foods vary in nature, this procedure is crucial, and traditional methods like ANN, SVM, KNN, PLS etc., will result in a low accuracy rate. All of these issues were defeated by the Deep Neural Network. In this work, we created a fresh dataset of 10,000 data points from 20 junk food classifications to try to recognize junk foods. All of the data in the data set was gathered using the Google search engine, which is thought to be one-of-a-kind in every way. The goal was achieved using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) technology, which is well-known for image processing. We achieved a 98.05\% accuracy rate throughout the research, which was satisfactory. In addition, we conducted a test based on a real-life event, and the outcome was extraordinary. Our goal is to advance this research to the next level, so that it may be applied to a future study. Our ultimate goal is to create a system that would encourage people to avoid eating junk food and to be health-conscious. \keywords{ Machine Learning \and junk food \and object detection \and YOLOv3 \and custom food dataset.}

- **Summary**: Recent image inpainting methods have made great progress but often struggle to generate plausible image structures when dealing with large holes in complex images. This is partially due to the lack of effective network structures that can capture both the long-range dependency and high-level semantics of an image. We propose cascaded modulation GAN (CM-GAN), a new network design consisting of an encoder with Fourier convolution blocks that extract multi-scale feature representations from the input image with holes and a dual-stream decoder with a novel cascaded global-spatial modulation block at each scale level. In each decoder block, global modulation is first applied to perform coarse and semantic-aware structure synthesis, followed by spatial modulation to further adjust the feature map in a spatially adaptive fashion. In addition, we design an object-aware training scheme to prevent the network from hallucinating new objects inside holes, fulfilling the needs of object removal tasks in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

- **Summary**: Many traditional computer vision algorithms generate realistic images by requiring that each patch in the generated image be similar to a patch in a training image and vice versa. Recently, this classical approach has been replaced by adversarial training with a patch discriminator. The adversarial approach avoids the computational burden of finding nearest neighbors of patches but often requires very long training times and may fail to match the distribution of patches. In this paper we leverage the recently developed Sliced Wasserstein Distance and develop an algorithm that explicitly and efficiently minimizes the distance between patch distributions in two images. Our method is conceptually simple, requires no training and can be implemented in a few lines of codes. On a number of image generation tasks we show that our results are often superior to single-image-GANs, require no training, and can generate high quality images in a few seconds. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/ariel415el/GPDM

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary object detection, which is concerned with the problem of detecting novel objects guided by natural language, has gained increasing attention from the community. Ideally, we would like to extend an open-vocabulary detector such that it can produce bounding box predictions based on user inputs in form of either natural language or exemplar image. This offers great flexibility and user experience for human-computer interaction. To this end, we propose a novel open-vocabulary detector based on DETR -- hence the name OV-DETR -- which, once trained, can detect any object given its class name or an exemplar image. The biggest challenge of turning DETR into an open-vocabulary detector is that it is impossible to calculate the classification cost matrix of novel classes without access to their labeled images. To overcome this challenge, we formulate the learning objective as a binary matching one between input queries (class name or exemplar image) and the corresponding objects, which learns useful correspondence to generalize to unseen queries during testing. For training, we choose to condition the Transformer decoder on the input embeddings obtained from a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP, in order to enable matching for both text and image queries. With extensive experiments on LVIS and COCO datasets, we demonstrate that our OV-DETR -- the first end-to-end Transformer-based open-vocabulary detector -- achieves non-trivial improvements over current state of the arts.

- **Summary**: Transformer Networks have established themselves as the de-facto state-of-the-art for trajectory forecasting but there is currently no systematic study on their capability to model the motion patterns of people, without interactions with other individuals nor the social context. This paper proposes the first in-depth study of Transformer Networks (TF) and Bidirectional Transformers (BERT) for the forecasting of the individual motion of people, without bells and whistles. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation of input/output representations, problem formulations and sequence modeling, including a novel analysis of their capability to predict multi-modal futures. Out of comparative evaluation on the ETH+UCY benchmark, both TF and BERT are top performers in predicting individual motions, definitely overcoming RNNs and LSTMs. Furthermore, they remain within a narrow margin wrt more complex techniques, which include both social interactions and scene contexts. Source code will be released for all conducted experiments.

- **Summary**: A long-term goal of AI research is to build intelligent agents that can communicate with humans in natural language, perceive the environment, and perform real-world tasks. Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental and interdisciplinary research topic towards this goal, and receives increasing attention from natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and machine learning communities. In this paper, we review contemporary studies in the emerging field of VLN, covering tasks, evaluation metrics, methods, etc. Through structured analysis of current progress and challenges, we highlight the limitations of current VLN and opportunities for future work. This paper serves as a thorough reference for the VLN research community.

- **Summary**: In this work we demonstrate the vulnerability of vision transformers (ViTs) to gradient-based inversion attacks. During this attack, the original data batch is reconstructed given model weights and the corresponding gradients. We introduce a method, named GradViT, that optimizes random noise into naturally looking images via an iterative process. The optimization objective consists of (i) a loss on matching the gradients, (ii) image prior in the form of distance to batch-normalization statistics of a pretrained CNN model, and (iii) a total variation regularization on patches to guide correct recovery locations. We propose a unique loss scheduling function to overcome local minima during optimization. We evaluate GadViT on ImageNet1K and MS-Celeb-1M datasets, and observe unprecedentedly high fidelity and closeness to the original (hidden) data. During the analysis we find that vision transformers are significantly more vulnerable than previously studied CNNs due to the presence of the attention mechanism. Our method demonstrates new state-of-the-art results for gradient inversion in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Project page at https://gradvit.github.io/.

- **Summary**: For humans, object detection, recognition, and tracking are innate. These provide the ability for human to perceive their environment and objects within their environment. This ability however doesn't translate well in computers. In Computer Vision and Multimedia, it is becoming increasingly more important to detect, recognize and track objects in images and/or videos. Many of these applications, such as facial recognition, surveillance, animation, are used for tracking features and/or people. However, these tasks prove challenging for computers to do effectively, as there is a significant amount of data to parse through. Therefore, many techniques and algorithms are needed and therefore researched to try to achieve human like perception. In this literature review, we focus on some novel techniques on object detection and recognition, and how to apply tracking algorithms to the detected features to track the objects' movements.

- **Summary**: Fetal ultrasounds are an essential part of prenatal care and can be used to estimate gestational age (GA). Accurate GA assessment is important for providing appropriate prenatal care throughout pregnancy and identifying complications such as fetal growth disorders. Since derivation of GA from manual fetal biometry measurements (head, abdomen, femur) are operator-dependent and time-consuming, there have been a number of research efforts focused on using artificial intelligence (AI) models to estimate GA using standard biometry images, but there is still room to improve the accuracy and reliability of these AI systems for widescale adoption. To improve GA estimates, without significant change to provider workflows, we leverage AI to interpret standard plane ultrasound images as well as 'fly-to' ultrasound videos, which are 5-10s videos automatically recorded as part of the standard of care before the still image is captured. We developed and validated three AI models: an image model using standard plane images, a video model using fly-to videos, and an ensemble model (combining both image and video). All three were statistically superior to standard fetal biometry-based GA estimates derived by expert sonographers, the ensemble model has the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the clinical standard fetal biometry (mean difference: -1.51 $\pm$ 3.96 days, 95% CI [-1.9, -1.1]) on a test set that consisted of 404 participants. We showed that our models outperform standard biometry by a more substantial margin on fetuses that were small for GA. Our AI models have the potential to empower trained operators to estimate GA with higher accuracy while reducing the amount of time required and user variability in measurement acquisition.

- **Summary**: Computational models of vision have traditionally been developed in a bottom-up fashion, by hierarchically composing a series of straightforward operations - i.e. convolution and pooling - with the aim of emulating simple and complex cells in the visual cortex, resulting in the introduction of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Nevertheless, data obtained with recent neuronal recording techniques support that the nature of the computations carried out in the ventral visual stream is not completely captured by current deep CNN models. To fill the gap between the ventral visual stream and deep models, several benchmarks have been designed and organized into the Brain-Score platform, granting a way to perform multi-layer (V1, V2, V4, IT) and behavioral comparisons between the two counterparts. In our work, we aim to shift the focus on architectures that take into account lateral recurrent connections, a ubiquitous feature of the ventral visual stream, to devise adaptive receptive fields. Through recurrent connections, the input s long-range spatial dependencies can be captured in a local multi-step fashion and, as introduced with Gated Recurrent CNNs (GRCNN), the unbounded expansion of the neuron s receptive fields can be modulated through the use of gates. In order to increase the robustness of our approach and the biological fidelity of the activations, we employ specific data augmentation techniques in line with several of the scoring benchmarks. Enforcing some form of invariance, through heuristics, was found to be beneficial for better neural predictivity.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its   content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/microsoft/FocalNet.

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation is the task of synthesizing a small dataset such that a model trained on the synthetic set will match the test accuracy of the model trained on the full dataset. In this paper, we propose a new formulation that optimizes our distilled data to guide networks to a similar state as those trained on real data across many training steps. Given a network, we train it for several iterations on our distilled data and optimize the distilled data with respect to the distance between the synthetically trained parameters and the parameters trained on real data. To efficiently obtain the initial and target network parameters for large-scale datasets, we pre-compute and store training trajectories of expert networks trained on the real dataset. Our method handily outperforms existing methods and also allows us to distill higher-resolution visual data.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models can encode societal biases and stereotypes, but there are challenges to measuring and mitigating these multimodal harms due to lacking measurement robustness and feature degradation. To address these challenges, we investigate bias measures and apply ranking metrics for image-text representations. We then investigate debiasing methods and show that prepending learned embeddings to text queries that are jointly trained with adversarial debiasing and a contrastive loss reduces various bias measures with minimal degradation to the image-text representation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a system to train driving policies from experiences collected not just from the ego-vehicle, but all vehicles that it observes. This system uses the behaviors of other agents to create more diverse driving scenarios without collecting additional data. The main difficulty in learning from other vehicles is that there is no sensor information. We use a set of supervisory tasks to learn an intermediate representation that is invariant to the viewpoint of the controlling vehicle. This not only provides a richer signal at training time but also allows more complex reasoning during inference. Learning how all vehicles drive helps predict their behavior at test time and can avoid collisions. We evaluate this system in closed-loop driving simulations. Our system outperforms all prior methods on the public CARLA Leaderboard by a wide margin, improving driving score by 25 and route completion rate by 24 points. Our method won the 2021 CARLA Autonomous Driving challenge. Code and data are available at https://github.com/dotchen/LAV.

- **Summary**: Surgical procedures are conducted in highly complex operating rooms (OR), comprising different actors, devices, and interactions. To date, only medically trained human experts are capable of understanding all the links and interactions in such a demanding environment. This paper aims to bring the community one step closer to automated, holistic and semantic understanding and modeling of OR domain. Towards this goal, for the first time, we propose using semantic scene graphs (SSG) to describe and summarize the surgical scene. The nodes of the scene graphs represent different actors and objects in the room, such as medical staff, patients, and medical equipment, whereas edges are the relationships between them. To validate the possibilities of the proposed representation, we create the first publicly available 4D surgical SSG dataset, 4D-OR, containing ten simulated total knee replacement surgeries recorded with six RGB-D sensors in a realistic OR simulation center. 4D-OR includes 6734 frames and is richly annotated with SSGs, human and object poses, and clinical roles. We propose an end-to-end neural network-based SSG generation pipeline, with a rate of success of 0.75 macro F1, indeed being able to infer semantic reasoning in the OR. We further demonstrate the representation power of our scene graphs by using it for the problem of clinical role prediction, where we achieve 0.85 macro F1. The code and dataset will be made available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods estimate 3D surface deformations from a single monocular RGB camera while assuming a 3D state known in advance (a template). This is an important yet challenging problem due to the under-constrained nature of the monocular setting. Existing SfT techniques predominantly use geometric and simplified deformation models, which often limits their reconstruction abilities. In contrast to previous works, this paper proposes a new SfT approach explaining 2D observations through physical simulations accounting for forces and material properties. Our differentiable physics simulator regularises the surface evolution and optimises the material elastic properties such as bending coefficients, stretching stiffness and density. We use a differentiable renderer to minimise the dense reprojection error between the estimated 3D states and the input images and recover the deformation parameters using an adaptive gradient-based optimisation. For the evaluation, we record with an RGB-D camera challenging real surfaces exposed to physical forces with various material properties and textures.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are built on the assumption of treating image patches as ``visual tokens" and learn patch-to-patch attention. The patch embedding based tokenizer has a semantic gap with respect to its counterpart, the textual tokenizer. The patch-to-patch attention suffers from the quadratic complexity issue, and also makes it non-trivial to explain learned ViTs. To address these issues in ViT, this paper proposes to learn Patch-to-Cluster attention (PaCa) in ViT. Queries in our PaCa-ViT starts with patches, while keys and values are directly based on clustering (with a predefined small number of clusters). The clusters are learned end-to-end, leading to better tokenizers and inducing joint clustering-for-attention and attention-for-clustering for better and interpretable models. The quadratic complexity is relaxed to linear complexity. The proposed PaCa module is used in designing efficient and interpretable ViT backbones and semantic segmentation head networks. In experiments, the proposed methods are tested on ImageNet-1k image classification, MS-COCO object detection and instance segmentation and MIT-ADE20k semantic segmentation. Compared with the prior art, it obtains better performance in all the three benchmarks than the SWin and the PVTs by significant margins in ImageNet-1k and MIT-ADE20k. It is also significantly more efficient than PVT models in MS-COCO and MIT-ADE20k due to the linear complexity. The learned clusters are semantically meaningful.

- **Summary**: The current popular two-stream, two-stage tracking framework extracts the template and the search region features separately and then performs relation modeling, thus the extracted features lack the awareness of the target and have limited target-background discriminability. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel one-stream tracking (OSTrack) framework that unifies feature learning and relation modeling by bridging the template-search image pairs with bidirectional information flows. In this way, discriminative target-oriented features can be dynamically extracted by mutual guidance. Since no extra heavy relation modeling module is needed and the implementation is highly parallelized, the proposed tracker runs at a fast speed. To further improve the inference efficiency, an in-network candidate early elimination module is proposed based on the strong similarity prior calculated in the one-stream framework. As a unified framework, OSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, in particular, it shows impressive results on the one-shot tracking benchmark GOT-10k, i.e., achieving 73.7% AO, improving the existing best result (SwinTrack) by 4.3\%. Besides, our method maintains a good performance-speed trade-off and shows faster convergence. The code and models are available at https://github.com/botaoye/OSTrack.

- **Summary**: If a unit cannot receive intelligence from a source due to external factors, we consider them disadvantaged users. We categorize this as a preoccupied unit working on a low connectivity device on the edge. This case requires that we use a different approach to deliver intelligence, particularly satellite imagery information, than normally employed. To address this, we propose a survey of information reduction techniques to deliver the information from a satellite image in a smaller package. We investigate four techniques to aid in the reduction of delivered information: traditional image compression, neural network image compression, object detection image cutout, and image to caption. Each of these mechanisms have their benefits and tradeoffs when considered for a disadvantaged user.

- **Summary**: Most of the existing handcrafted and learning-based local descriptors are still at best approximately invariant to affine image transformations, often disregarding deformable surfaces. In this paper, we take one step further by proposing a new approach to compute descriptors from RGB-D images (where RGB refers to the pixel color brightness and D stands for depth information) that are invariant to isometric non-rigid deformations, as well as to scale changes and rotation. Our proposed description strategies are grounded on the key idea of learning feature representations on undistorted local image patches using surface geodesics. We design two complementary local descriptors strategies to compute geodesic-aware features efficiently: one efficient binary descriptor based on handcrafted binary tests (named GeoBit), and one learning-based descriptor (GeoPatch) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to compute features. In different experiments using real and publicly available RGB-D data benchmarks, they consistently outperforms state-of-the-art handcrafted and learning-based image and RGB-D descriptors in matching scores, as well as in object retrieval and non-rigid surface tracking experiments, with comparable processing times. We also provide to the community a new dataset with accurate matching annotations of RGB-D images of different objects (shirts, cloths, paintings, bags), subjected to strong non-rigid deformations, for evaluation benchmark of deformable surface correspondence algorithms.

- **Summary**: Many promising applications of supervised machine learning face hurdles in the acquisition of labeled data in sufficient quantity and quality, creating an expensive bottleneck. To overcome such limitations, techniques that do not depend on ground truth labels have been studied, including weak supervision and generative modeling. While these techniques would seem to be usable in concert, improving one another, how to build an interface between them is not well-understood. In this work, we propose a model fusing programmatic weak supervision and generative adversarial networks and provide theoretical justification motivating this fusion. The proposed approach captures discrete latent variables in the data alongside the weak supervision derived label estimate. Alignment of the two allows for better modeling of sample-dependent accuracies of the weak supervision sources, improving the estimate of unobserved labels. It is the first approach to enable data augmentation through weakly supervised synthetic images and pseudolabels. Additionally, its learned latent variables can be inspected qualitatively. The model outperforms baseline weak supervision label models on a number of multiclass image classification datasets, improves the quality of generated images, and further improves end-model performance through data augmentation with synthetic samples.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the success of self-supervised autoregressive representation learning in natural language (GPT and its variants), and advances in recent visual architecture design with Vision Transformers (ViTs), in this paper, we explore the effect various design choices have on the success of applying such training strategies for visual feature learning. Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy that we call Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC). In RandSAC, we group patch representations (image tokens) into hierarchically arranged segments; within each segment, tokens are predicted in parallel, similar to BERT, while across segment predictions are sequential, similar to GPT. We illustrate that randomized serialization of the segments significantly improves the performance and results in distribution over spatially-long (across-segments) and -short (within-segment) predictions which are effective for feature learning. We illustrate the pertinence of these design choices and explore alternatives on a number of datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet). While our pre-training strategy works with a vanilla Transformer, we also propose a conceptually simple, but highly effective, addition to the decoder that allows learnable skip-connections to encoder$'$s feature layers, which further improves the performance.

- **Summary**: We present a self-supervised approach for learning to predict traversable paths for wheeled mobile robots that require good traction to navigate. Our algorithm, termed WayFAST (Waypoint Free Autonomous Systems for Traversability), uses RGB and depth data, along with navigation experience, to autonomously generate traversable paths in outdoor unstructured environments. Our key inspiration is that traction can be estimated for rolling robots using kinodynamic models. Using traction estimates provided by an online receding horizon estimator, we are able to train a traversability prediction neural network in a self-supervised manner, without requiring heuristics utilized by previous methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of WayFAST through extensive field testing in varying environments, ranging from sandy dry beaches to forest canopies and snow covered grass fields. Our results clearly demonstrate that WayFAST can learn to avoid geometric obstacles as well as untraversable terrain, such as snow, which would be difficult to avoid with sensors that provide only geometric data, such as LiDAR. Furthermore, we show that our training pipeline based on online traction estimates is more data-efficient than other heuristic-based methods.

- **Summary**: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been increasingly used in the classification of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). However, MIL approaches for this specific classification problem still face unique challenges, particularly those related to small sample cohorts. In these, there are limited number of WSI slides (bags), while the resolution of a single WSI is huge, which leads to a large number of patches (instances) cropped from this slide. To address this issue, we propose to virtually enlarge the number of bags by introducing the concept of pseudo-bags, on which a double-tier MIL framework is built to effectively use the intrinsic features. Besides, we also contribute to deriving the instance probability under the framework of attention-based MIL, and utilize the derivation to help construct and analyze the proposed framework. The proposed method outperforms other latest methods on the CAMELYON-16 by substantially large margins, and is also better in performance on the TCGA lung cancer dataset. The proposed framework is ready to be extended for wider MIL applications. The code is available at: https://github.com/hrzhang1123/DTFD-MIL

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework named PlaneMVS for 3D plane reconstruction from multiple input views with known camera poses. Most previous learning-based plane reconstruction methods reconstruct 3D planes from single images, which highly rely on single-view regression and suffer from depth scale ambiguity. In contrast, we reconstruct 3D planes with a multi-view-stereo (MVS) pipeline that takes advantage of multi-view geometry. We decouple plane reconstruction into a semantic plane detection branch and a plane MVS branch. The semantic plane detection branch is based on a single-view plane detection framework but with differences. The plane MVS branch adopts a set of slanted plane hypotheses to replace conventional depth hypotheses to perform plane sweeping strategy and finally learns pixel-level plane parameters and its planar depth map. We present how the two branches are learned in a balanced way, and propose a soft-pooling loss to associate the outputs of the two branches and make them benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on various indoor datasets show that PlaneMVS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-view plane reconstruction methods on both plane detection and 3D geometry metrics. Our method even outperforms a set of SOTA learning-based MVS methods thanks to the learned plane priors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on 3D plane reconstruction within an end-to-end MVS framework.

- **Summary**: We present a deep neural network for removing undesirable shading features from an unconstrained portrait image, recovering the underlying texture. Our training scheme incorporates three regularization strategies: masked loss, to emphasize high-frequency shading features; soft-shadow loss, which improves sensitivity to subtle changes in lighting; and shading-offset estimation, to supervise separation of shading and texture. Our method demonstrates improved delighting quality and generalization when compared with the state-of-the-art. We further demonstrate how our delighting method can enhance the performance of light-sensitive computer vision tasks such as face relighting and semantic parsing, allowing them to handle extreme lighting conditions.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in a wide range of computer vision tasks, with the state-of-the-art results obtained through complex and deep structures that require intensive computation and memory. Now-a-days, efficient model inference is crucial for consumer applications on resource-constrained platforms. As a result, there is much interest in the research and development of dedicated deep learning (DL) hardware to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of DNNs. Low-precision representation of DNN data-structures through quantization would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware. However, the rigorous quantization leads to a severe accuracy drop. As such, quantization opens a large hyper-parameter space at bit-precision levels, the exploration of which is a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework referred to as the Fixed-Point Quantizer of deep neural Networks (FxP-QNet) that flexibly designs a mixed low-precision DNN for integer-arithmetic-only deployment. Specifically, the FxP-QNet gradually adapts the quantization level for each data-structure of each layer based on the trade-off between the network accuracy and the low-precision requirements. Additionally, it employs post-training self-distillation and network prediction error statistics to optimize the quantization of floating-point values into fixed-point numbers. Examining FxP-QNet on state-of-the-art architectures and the benchmark ImageNet dataset, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FxP-QNet in achieving the accuracy-compression trade-off without the need for training. The results show that FxP-QNet-quantized AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-18 reduce the overall memory requirements of their full-precision counterparts by 7.16x, 10.36x, and 6.44x with less than 0.95%, 0.95%, and 1.99% accuracy drop, respectively.

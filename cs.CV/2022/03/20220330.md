- **Summary**: We present a novel high-resolution face swapping method using the inherent prior knowledge of a pre-trained GAN model. Although previous research can leverage generative priors to produce high-resolution results, their quality can suffer from the entangled semantics of the latent space. We explicitly disentangle the latent semantics by utilizing the progressive nature of the generator, deriving structure attributes from the shallow layers and appearance attributes from the deeper ones. Identity and pose information within the structure attributes are further separated by introducing a landmark-driven structure transfer latent direction. The disentangled latent code produces rich generative features that incorporate feature blending to produce a plausible swapping result. We further extend our method to video face swapping by enforcing two spatio-temporal constraints on the latent space and the image space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image/video face swapping methods in terms of hallucination quality and consistency.

- **Summary**: Speaker diarization is one of the critical components of computational media intelligence as it enables a character-level analysis of story portrayals and media content understanding. Automated audio-based speaker diarization of entertainment media poses challenges due to the diverse acoustic conditions present in media content, be it background music, overlapping speakers, or sound effects. At the same time, speaking faces in the visual modality provide complementary information and not prone to the errors seen in the audio modality. In this paper, we address the problem of speaker diarization in TV shows using the active speaker faces. We perform face clustering on the active speaker faces and show superior speaker diarization performance compared to the state-of-the-art audio-based diarization methods. We additionally report a systematic analysis of the impact of active speaker face detection quality on the diarization performance. We also observe that a moderately well-performing active speaker system could outperform the audio-based diarization systems.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based method for estimating room layout given a pair of 360 panoramas. Our system, called Position-aware Stereo Merging Network or PSMNet, is an end-to-end joint layout-pose estimator. PSMNet consists of a Stereo Pano Pose (SP2) transformer and a novel Cross-Perspective Projection (CP2) layer. The stereo-view SP2 transformer is used to implicitly infer correspondences between views, and can handle noisy poses. The pose-aware CP2 layer is designed to render features from the adjacent view to the anchor (reference) view, in order to perform view fusion and estimate the visible layout. Our experiments and analysis validate our method, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art layout estimators, especially for large and complex room spaces.

- **Summary**: Referring video segmentation aims to segment the corresponding video object described by the language expression. To address this task, we first design a two-stream encoder to extract CNN-based visual features and transformer-based linguistic features hierarchically, and a vision-language mutual guidance (VLMG) module is inserted into the encoder multiple times to promote the hierarchical and progressive fusion of multi-modal features. Compared with the existing multi-modal fusion methods, this two-stream encoder takes into account the multi-granularity linguistic context, and realizes the deep interleaving between modalities with the help of VLGM. In order to promote the temporal alignment between frames, we further propose a language-guided multi-scale dynamic filtering (LMDF) module to strengthen the temporal coherence, which uses the language-guided spatial-temporal features to generate a set of position-specific dynamic filters to more flexibly and effectively update the feature of current frame. Extensive experiments on four datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: We propose Iterative Homography Network, namely IHN, a new deep homography estimation architecture. Different from previous works that achieve iterative refinement by network cascading or untrainable IC-LK iterator, the iterator of IHN has tied weights and is completely trainable. IHN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on several datasets including challenging scenes. We propose 2 versions of IHN: (1) IHN for static scenes, (2) IHN-mov for dynamic scenes with moving objects. Both versions can be arranged in 1-scale for efficiency or 2-scale for accuracy. We show that the basic 1-scale IHN already outperforms most of the existing methods. On a variety of datasets, the 2-scale IHN outperforms all competitors by a large gap. We introduce IHN-mov by producing an inlier mask to further improve the estimation accuracy of moving-objects scenes. We experimentally show that the iterative framework of IHN can achieve 95% error reduction while considerably saving network parameters. When processing sequential image pairs, IHN can achieve 32.7 fps, which is about 8x the speed of IC-LK iterator. Source code is available at https://github.com/imdumpl78/IHN.

  Systems (IROS 2022)
- **Summary**: One of the key challenges in high speed off road navigation on ground vehicles is that the kinodynamics of the vehicle terrain interaction can differ dramatically depending on the terrain. Previous approaches to addressing this challenge have considered learning an inverse kinodynamics (IKD) model, conditioned on inertial information of the vehicle to sense the kinodynamic interactions. In this paper, we hypothesize that to enable accurate high-speed off-road navigation using a learned IKD model, in addition to inertial information from the past, one must also anticipate the kinodynamic interactions of the vehicle with the terrain in the future. To this end, we introduce Visual-Inertial Inverse Kinodynamics (VI-IKD), a novel learning based IKD model that is conditioned on visual information from a terrain patch ahead of the robot in addition to past inertial information, enabling it to anticipate kinodynamic interactions in the future. We validate the effectiveness of VI-IKD in accurate high-speed off-road navigation experimentally on a scale 1/5 UT-AlphaTruck off-road autonomous vehicle in both indoor and outdoor environments and show that compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, VI-IKD enables more accurate and robust off-road navigation on a variety of different terrains at speeds of up to 3.5 m/s.

- **Summary**: Semantic patterns of fine-grained objects are determined by subtle appearance difference of local parts, which thus inspires a number of part-based methods. However, due to uncontrollable object poses in images, distinctive details carried by local regions can be spatially distributed or even self-occluded, leading to a large variation on object representation. For discounting pose variations, this paper proposes to learn a novel graph based object representation to reveal a global configuration of local parts for self-supervised pose alignment across classes, which is employed as an auxiliary feature regularization on a deep representation learning network.Moreover, a coarse-to-fine supervision together with the proposed pose-insensitive constraint on shallow-to-deep sub-networks encourages discriminative features in a curriculum learning manner. We evaluate our method on three popular fine-grained object classification benchmarks, consistently achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: In the task of audio-visual sound source separation, which leverages visual information for sound source separation, identifying objects in an image is a crucial step prior to separating the sound source. However, existing methods that assign sound on detected bounding boxes suffer from a problem that their approach heavily relies on pre-trained object detectors. Specifically, when using these existing methods, it is required to predetermine all the possible categories of objects that can produce sound and use an object detector applicable to all such categories. To tackle this problem, we propose a fully unsupervised method that learns to detect objects in an image and separate sound source simultaneously. As our method does not rely on any pre-trained detector, our method is applicable to arbitrary categories without any additional annotation. Furthermore, although being fully unsupervised, we found that our method performs comparably in separation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Video classification systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can create severe security problems in video verification. Current black-box attacks need a large number of queries to succeed, resulting in high computational overhead in the process of attack. On the other hand, attacks with restricted perturbations are ineffective against defenses such as denoising or adversarial training. In this paper, we focus on unrestricted perturbations and propose StyleFool, a black-box video adversarial attack via style transfer to fool the video classification system. StyleFool first utilizes color theme proximity to select the best style image, which helps avoid unnatural details in the stylized videos. Meanwhile, the target class confidence is additionally considered in targeted attacks to influence the output distribution of the classifier by moving the stylized video closer to or even across the decision boundary. A gradient-free method is then employed to further optimize the adversarial perturbations. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate StyleFool on two standard datasets, UCF-101 and HMDB-51. The experimental results demonstrate that StyleFool outperforms the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks in terms of both the number of queries and the robustness against existing defenses. Moreover, 50% of the stylized videos in untargeted attacks do not need any query since they can already fool the video classification model. Furthermore, we evaluate the indistinguishability through a user study to show that the adversarial samples of StyleFool look imperceptible to human eyes, despite unrestricted perturbations.



### Meta-Sampler: Almost-Universal yet Task-Oriented Sampling for Point Clouds

- **Summary**: Sampling is a key operation in point-cloud task and acts to increase computational efficiency and tractability by discarding redundant points. Universal sampling algorithms (e.g., Farthest Point Sampling) work without modification across different tasks, models, and datasets, but by their very nature are agnostic about the downstream task/model. As such, they have no implicit knowledge about which points would be best to keep and which to reject. Recent work has shown how task-specific point cloud sampling (e.g., SampleNet) can be used to outperform traditional sampling approaches by learning which points are more informative. However, these learnable samplers face two inherent issues: i) overfitting to a model rather than a task, and \ii) requiring training of the sampling network from scratch, in addition to the task network, somewhat countering the original objective of down-sampling to increase efficiency. In this work, we propose an almost-universal sampler, in our quest for a sampler that can learn to preserve the most useful points for a particular task, yet be inexpensive to adapt to different tasks, models, or datasets. We first demonstrate how training over multiple models for the same task (e.g., shape reconstruction) significantly outperforms the vanilla SampleNet in terms of accuracy by not overfitting the sample network to a particular task network. Second, we show how we can train an almost-universal meta-sampler across multiple tasks. This meta-sampler can then be rapidly fine-tuned when applied to different datasets, networks, or even different tasks, thus amortizing the initial cost of training.

- **Summary**: Unpaired image-to-image translation is to translate an image from a source domain to a target domain without paired training data. By utilizing CNN in extracting local semantics, various techniques have been developed to improve the translation performance. However, CNN-based generators lack the ability to capture long-range dependency to well exploit global semantics. Recently, Vision Transformers have been widely investigated for recognition tasks. Though appealing, it is inappropriate to simply transfer a recognition-based vision transformer to image-to-image translation due to the generation difficulty and the computation limitation. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient architecture for unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Transformers (ITTR). It has two main designs: 1) hybrid perception block (HPB) for token mixing from different receptive fields to utilize global semantics; 2) dual pruned self-attention (DPSA) to sharply reduce the computational complexity. Our ITTR outperforms the state-of-the-arts for unpaired image-to-image translation on six benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Attention mechanism, being frequently used to train networks for better feature representations, can effectively disentangle the target object from irrelevant objects in the background. Given an arbitrary image, we find that the background's irrelevant objects are most likely to occlude/block the target object. We propose, based on this finding, a ReplaceBlock to simulate the situations when the target object is partially occluded by the objects that are deemed as background. Specifically, ReplaceBlock erases the target object in the image, and then generates a feature map with only irrelevant objects and background by the model. Finally, some regions in the background feature map are used to replace some regions of the target object in the original image feature map. In this way, ReplaceBlock can effectively simulate the feature map of the occluded image. The experimental results show that ReplaceBlock works better than DropBlock in regularizing convolutional networks.

- **Summary**: Mathematical modeling and aesthetic rule extraction of works of art are complex activities. This is because art is a multidimensional, subjective discipline. Perception and interpretation of art are, to many extents, relative and open-ended rather than measurable. Following the explainable Artificial Intelligence paradigm, this paper investigated in a human-understandable fashion the limits to which a single-task, single-modality benchmark computer vision model performs in classifying contemporary 2D visual arts. It is important to point out that this work does not introduce an interpreting method to open the black box of Deep Neural Networks, instead it uses existing evaluating metrics derived from the confusion matrix to try to uncover the mechanism with which Deep Neural Networks understand art. To achieve so, VGG-11, pre-trained on ImageNet and discriminatively fine-tuned, was used on handcrafted small-data datasets designed from real-world photography gallery shows. We demonstrated that the artwork's Exhibited Properties or formal factors such as shape and color, rather than Non-Exhibited Properties or content factors such as history and intention, have much higher potential to be the determinant when art pieces have very similar Exhibited Properties. We also showed that a single-task and single-modality model's understanding of art is inadequate as it largely ignores Non-Exhibited Properties.

- **Summary**: We propose a method to infer a dense depth map from a single image, its calibration, and the associated sparse point cloud. In order to leverage existing models (teachers) that produce putative depth maps, we propose an adaptive knowledge distillation approach that yields a positive congruent training process, wherein a student model avoids learning the error modes of the teachers. In the absence of ground truth for model selection and training, our method, termed Monitored Distillation, allows a student to exploit a blind ensemble of teachers by selectively learning from predictions that best minimize the reconstruction error for a given image. Monitored Distillation yields a distilled depth map and a confidence map, or ``monitor'', for how well a prediction from a particular teacher fits the observed image. The monitor adaptively weights the distilled depth where if all of the teachers exhibit high residuals, the standard unsupervised image reconstruction loss takes over as the supervisory signal. On indoor scenes (VOID), we outperform blind ensembling baselines by 17.53% and unsupervised methods by 24.25%; we boast a 79% model size reduction while maintaining comparable performance to the best supervised method. For outdoors (KITTI), we tie for 5th overall on the benchmark despite not using ground truth. Code available at: https://github.com/alexklwong/mondi-python.

- **Summary**: Establishing dense correspondences across semantically similar images remains a challenging task due to the significant intra-class variations and background clutters. Traditionally, a supervised learning was used for training the models, which required tremendous manually-labeled data, while some methods suggested a self-supervised or weakly-supervised learning to mitigate the reliance on the labeled data, but with limited performance. In this paper, we present a simple, but effective solution for semantic correspondence that learns the networks in a semi-supervised manner by supplementing few ground-truth correspondences via utilization of a large amount of confident correspondences as pseudo-labels, called SemiMatch. Specifically, our framework generates the pseudo-labels using the model's prediction itself between source and weakly-augmented target, and uses pseudo-labels to learn the model again between source and strongly-augmented target, which improves the robustness of the model. We also present a novel confidence measure for pseudo-labels and data augmentation tailored for semantic correspondence. In experiments, SemiMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, especially on PF-Willow by a large margin.



### An Iterative Co-Training Transductive Framework for Zero Shot Learning

- **Summary**: In zero-shot learning (ZSL) community, it is generally recognized that transductive learning performs better than inductive one as the unseen-class samples are also used in its training stage. How to generate pseudo labels for unseen-class samples and how to use such usually noisy pseudo labels are two critical issues in transductive learning. In this work, we introduce an iterative co-training framework which contains two different base ZSL models and an exchanging module. At each iteration, the two different ZSL models are co-trained to separately predict pseudo labels for the unseen-class samples, and the exchanging module exchanges the predicted pseudo labels, then the exchanged pseudo-labeled samples are added into the training sets for the next iteration. By such, our framework can gradually boost the ZSL performance by fully exploiting the potential complementarity of the two models' classification capabilities. In addition, our co-training framework is also applied to the generalized ZSL (GZSL), in which a semantic-guided OOD detector is proposed to pick out the most likely unseen-class samples before class-level classification to alleviate the bias problem in GZSL. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our proposed methods could significantly outperform about $31$ state-of-the-art ones.



### Threshold Matters in WSSS: Manipulating the Activation for the Robust and Accurate Segmentation Model Against Thresholds

- **Summary**: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has recently gained much attention for its promise to train segmentation models only with image-level labels. Existing WSSS methods commonly argue that the sparse coverage of CAM incurs the performance bottleneck of WSSS. This paper provides analytical and empirical evidence that the actual bottleneck may not be sparse coverage but a global thresholding scheme applied after CAM. Then, we show that this issue can be mitigated by satisfying two conditions; 1) reducing the imbalance in the foreground activation and 2) increasing the gap between the foreground and the background activation. Based on these findings, we propose a novel activation manipulation network with a per-pixel classification loss and a label conditioning module. Per-pixel classification naturally induces two-level activation in activation maps, which can penalize the most discriminative parts, promote the less discriminative parts, and deactivate the background regions. Label conditioning imposes that the output label of pseudo-masks should be any of true image-level labels; it penalizes the wrong activation assigned to non-target classes. Based on extensive analysis and evaluations, we demonstrate that each component helps produce accurate pseudo-masks, achieving the robustness against the choice of the global threshold. Finally, our model achieves state-of-the-art records on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.



### Progressively Generating Better Initial Guesses Towards Next Stages for High-Quality Human Motion Prediction

- **Summary**: This paper presents a high-quality human motion prediction method that accurately predicts future human poses given observed ones. Our method is based on the observation that a good initial guess of the future poses is very helpful in improving the forecasting accuracy. This motivates us to propose a novel two-stage prediction framework, including an init-prediction network that just computes the good guess and then a formal-prediction network that predicts the target future poses based on the guess. More importantly, we extend this idea further and design a multi-stage prediction framework where each stage predicts initial guess for the next stage, which brings more performance gain. To fulfill the prediction task at each stage, we propose a network comprising Spatial Dense Graph Convolutional Networks (S-DGCN) and Temporal Dense Graph Convolutional Networks (T-DGCN). Alternatively executing the two networks helps extract spatiotemporal features over the global receptive field of the whole pose sequence. All the above design choices cooperating together make our method outperform previous approaches by large margins: 6%-7% on Human3.6M, 5%-10% on CMU-MoCap, and 13%-16% on 3DPW.

- **Summary**: Automatic assessment and understanding of facial skin condition have several applications, including the early detection of underlying health problems, lifestyle and dietary treatment, skin-care product recommendation, etc. Selfies in the wild serve as an excellent data resource to democratize skin quality assessment, but suffer from several data collection challenges.The key to guaranteeing an accurate assessment is accurate detection of different skin features. We present an automatic facial skin feature detection method that works across a variety of skin tones and age groups for selfies in the wild. To be specific, we annotate the locations of acne, pigmentation, and wrinkle for selfie images with different skin tone colors, severity levels, and lighting conditions. The annotation is conducted in a two-phase scheme with the help of a dermatologist to train volunteers for annotation. We employ Unet++ as the network architecture for feature detection. This work shows that the two-phase annotation scheme can robustly detect the accurate locations of acne, pigmentation, and wrinkle for selfie images with different ethnicities, skin tone colors, severity levels, age groups, and lighting conditions.

- **Summary**: We present the first self-supervised method to train panoramic room layout estimation models without any labeled data. Unlike per-pixel dense depth that provides abundant correspondence constraints, layout representation is sparse and topological, hindering the use of self-supervised reprojection consistency on images. To address this issue, we propose Differentiable Layout View Rendering, which can warp a source image to the target camera pose given the estimated layout from the target image. As each rendered pixel is differentiable with respect to the estimated layout, we can now train the layout estimation model by minimizing reprojection loss. Besides, we introduce regularization losses to encourage Manhattan alignment, ceiling-floor alignment, cycle consistency, and layout stretch consistency, which further improve our predictions. Finally, we present the first self-supervised results on ZilloIndoor and MatterportLayout datasets. Our approach also shows promising solutions in data-scarce scenarios and active learning, which would have an immediate value in the real estate virtual tour software.

- **Summary**: Evaluation measures have a crucial impact on the direction of research. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop appropriate and reliable evaluation measures for new applications where conventional measures are not well suited. Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) is one such application, and the current practice is to use R@$K,\theta$ for evaluating VMR systems. However, this measure has two disadvantages. First, it is rank-insensitive: It ignores the rank positions of successfully localised moments in the top-$K$ ranked list by treating the list as a set. Second, it binarizes the Intersection over Union (IoU) of each retrieved video moment using the threshold $\theta$ and thereby ignoring fine-grained localisation quality of ranked moments.   We propose an alternative measure for evaluating VMR, called Average Max IoU (AxIoU), which is free from the above two problems. We show that AxIoU satisfies two important axioms for VMR evaluation, namely, \textbf{Invariance against Redundant Moments} and \textbf{Monotonicity with respect to the Best Moment}, and also that R@$K,\theta$ satisfies the first axiom only. We also empirically examine how AxIoU agrees with R@$K,\theta$, as well as its stability with respect to change in the test data and human-annotated temporal boundaries.

- **Summary**: Video deblurring models exploit information in the neighboring frames to remove blur caused by the motion of the camera and the objects. Recurrent Neural Networks~(RNNs) are often adopted to model the temporal dependency between frames via hidden states. When motion blur is strong, however, hidden states are hard to deliver proper information due to the displacement between different frames. While there have been attempts to update the hidden states, it is difficult to handle misaligned features beyond the receptive field of simple modules. Thus, we propose 2 modules to supplement the RNN architecture for video deblurring. First, we design Ping-Pong RNN~(PPRNN) that acts on updating the hidden states by referring to the features from the current and the previous time steps alternately. PPRNN gathers relevant information from the both features in an iterative and balanced manner by utilizing its recurrent architecture. Second, we use a Selective Non-Local Attention~(SNLA) module to additionally refine the hidden state by aligning it with the positional information from the input frame feature. The attention score is scaled by the relevance to the input feature to focus on the necessary information. By paying attention to hidden states with both modules, which have strong synergy, our PAHS framework improves the representation powers of RNN structures and achieves state-of-the-art deblurring performance on standard benchmarks and real-world videos.

- **Summary**: Breakthroughs in transformer-based models have revolutionized not only the NLP field, but also vision and multimodal systems. However, although visualization and interpretability tools have become available for NLP models, internal mechanisms of vision and multimodal transformers remain largely opaque. With the success of these transformers, it is increasingly critical to understand their inner workings, as unraveling these black-boxes will lead to more capable and trustworthy models. To contribute to this quest, we propose VL-InterpreT, which provides novel interactive visualizations for interpreting the attentions and hidden representations in multimodal transformers. VL-InterpreT is a task agnostic and integrated tool that (1) tracks a variety of statistics in attention heads throughout all layers for both vision and language components, (2) visualizes cross-modal and intra-modal attentions through easily readable heatmaps, and (3) plots the hidden representations of vision and language tokens as they pass through the transformer layers. In this paper, we demonstrate the functionalities of VL-InterpreT through the analysis of KD-VLP, an end-to-end pretraining vision-language multimodal transformer-based model, in the tasks of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) and WebQA, two visual question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, we also present a few interesting findings about multimodal transformer behaviors that were learned through our tool.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we are interested in modeling a how-to instructional procedure, such as a cooking recipe, with a meaningful and rich high-level representation. Specifically, we propose to represent cooking recipes and food images as cooking programs. Programs provide a structured representation of the task, capturing cooking semantics and sequential relationships of actions in the form of a graph. This allows them to be easily manipulated by users and executed by agents. To this end, we build a model that is trained to learn a joint embedding between recipes and food images via self-supervision and jointly generate a program from this embedding as a sequence. To validate our idea, we crowdsource programs for cooking recipes and show that: (a) projecting the image-recipe embeddings into programs leads to better cross-modal retrieval results; (b) generating programs from images leads to better recognition results compared to predicting raw cooking instructions; and (c) we can generate food images by manipulating programs via optimizing the latent code of a GAN. Code, data, and models are available online.

- **Summary**: Existing universal lesion detection (ULD) methods utilize compute-intensive anchor-based architectures which rely on predefined anchor boxes, resulting in unsatisfactory detection performance, especially in small and mid-sized lesions. Further, these default fixed anchor-sizes and ratios do not generalize well to different datasets. Therefore, we propose a robust one-stage anchor-free lesion detection network that can perform well across varying lesions sizes by exploiting the fact that the box predictions can be sorted for relevance based on their center rather than their overlap with the object. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ULD can be improved by explicitly providing it the domain-specific information in the form of multi-intensity images generated using multiple HU windows, followed by self-attention based feature-fusion and backbone initialization using weights learned via self-supervision over CT-scans. We obtain comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods, achieving an overall sensitivity of 86.05% on the DeepLesion dataset, which comprises of approximately 32K CT-scans with lesions annotated across various body organs.

- **Summary**: Although many video prediction methods have obtained good performance in low-resolution (64$\sim$128) videos, predictive models for high-resolution (512$\sim$4K) videos have not been fully explored yet, which are more meaningful due to the increasing demand for high-quality videos. Compared with low-resolution videos, high-resolution videos contain richer appearance (spatial) information and more complex motion (temporal) information. In this paper, we propose a Spatiotemporal Residual Predictive Model (STRPM) for high-resolution video prediction. On the one hand, we propose a Spatiotemporal Encoding-Decoding Scheme to preserve more spatiotemporal information for high-resolution videos. In this way, the appearance details for each frame can be greatly preserved. On the other hand, we design a Residual Predictive Memory (RPM) which focuses on modeling the spatiotemporal residual features (STRF) between previous and future frames instead of the whole frame, which can greatly help capture the complex motion information in high-resolution videos. In addition, the proposed RPM can supervise the spatial encoder and temporal encoder to extract different features in the spatial domain and the temporal domain, respectively. Moreover, the proposed model is trained using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a learned perceptual loss (LP-loss) to improve the perceptual quality of the predictions. Experimental results show that STRPM can generate more satisfactory results compared with various existing methods.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of omni-supervised object detection, which can use unlabeled, fully labeled and weakly labeled annotations, such as image tags, counts, points, etc., for object detection. This is enabled by a unified architecture, Omni-DETR, based on the recent progress on student-teacher framework and end-to-end transformer based object detection. Under this unified architecture, different types of weak labels can be leveraged to generate accurate pseudo labels, by a bipartite matching based filtering mechanism, for the model to learn. In the experiments, Omni-DETR has achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets and settings. And we have found that weak annotations can help to improve detection performance and a mixture of them can achieve a better trade-off between annotation cost and accuracy than the standard complete annotation. These findings could encourage larger object detection datasets with mixture annotations. The code is available at https://github.com/amazon-research/omni-detr.



### Global Tracking via Ensemble of Local Trackers

- **Summary**: The crux of long-term tracking lies in the difficulty of tracking the target with discontinuous moving caused by out-of-view or occlusion. Existing long-term tracking methods follow two typical strategies. The first strategy employs a local tracker to perform smooth tracking and uses another re-detector to detect the target when the target is lost. While it can exploit the temporal context like historical appearances and locations of the target, a potential limitation of such strategy is that the local tracker tends to misidentify a nearby distractor as the target instead of activating the re-detector when the real target is out of view. The other long-term tracking strategy tracks the target in the entire image globally instead of local tracking based on the previous tracking results. Unfortunately, such global tracking strategy cannot leverage the temporal context effectively. In this work, we combine the advantages of both strategies: tracking the target in a global view while exploiting the temporal context. Specifically, we perform global tracking via ensemble of local trackers spreading the full image. The smooth moving of the target can be handled steadily by one local tracker. When the local tracker accidentally loses the target due to suddenly discontinuous moving, another local tracker close to the target is then activated and can readily take over the tracking to locate the target. While the activated local tracker performs tracking locally by leveraging the temporal context, the ensemble of local trackers renders our model the global view for tracking. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: When focusing an image, depth of field, aperture and distance from the camera to the object, must be taking into account, both, in visible and in infrared spectrum. Our experiments reveal that in addition, the focusing problem in thermal spectrum is also hardly dependent of the temperature of the object itself (and/or the scene).

- **Summary**: In this paper we summarize several applications based on thermal imaging. We emphasize the importance of emissivity adjustment for a proper temperature measurement. A new set of face images acquired at different emissivity values with steps of 0.01 is also presented and will be distributed for free for research purposes. Among the utilities, we can mention: a) the possibility to apply corrections once an image is acquired with a wrong emissivity value and it is not possible to acquire a new one; b) privacy protection in thermal images, which can be obtained with a low emissivity factor, which is still suitable for several applications, but hides the identity of a user; c) image processing for improving temperature detection in scenes containing objects of different emissivity.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have piqued researchers' interest because of their capacity to process temporal information and low power consumption. However, current state-of-the-art methods limited their biological plausibility and performance because their neurons are generally built on the simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model. Due to the high level of dynamic complexity, modern neuron models have seldom been implemented in SNN practice. In this study, we adopt the Phase Plane Analysis (PPA) technique, a technique often utilized in neurodynamics field, to integrate a recent neuron model, namely, the Izhikevich neuron. Based on the findings in the advancement of neuroscience, the Izhikevich neuron model can be biologically plausible while maintaining comparable computational cost with LIF neurons. By utilizing the adopted PPA, we have accomplished putting neurons built with the modified Izhikevich model into SNN practice, dubbed as the Standardized Izhikevich Tonic (SIT) neuron. For performance, we evaluate the suggested technique for image classification tasks in self-built LIF-and-SIT-consisted SNNs, named Hybrid Neural Network (HNN) on static MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 datasets and neuromorphic N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture datasets. The experimental results indicate that the suggested method achieves comparable accuracy while exhibiting more biologically realistic behaviors on nearly all test datasets, demonstrating the efficiency of this novel strategy in bridging the gap between neurodynamics and SNN practice.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving technology has drawn a lot of attention due to its fast development and extremely high commercial values. The recent technological leap of autonomous driving can be primarily attributed to the progress in the environment perception. Good environment perception provides accurate high-level environment information which is essential for autonomous vehicles to make safe and precise driving decisions and strategies. Moreover, such progress in accurate environment perception would not be possible without deep learning models and advanced onboard sensors, such as optical sensors (LiDARs and cameras), radars, GPS. However, the advanced sensors and deep learning models are prone to recently invented attack methods. For example, LiDARs and cameras can be compromised by optical attacks, and deep learning models can be attacked by adversarial examples. The attacks on advanced sensors and deep learning models can largely impact the accuracy of the environment perception, posing great threats to the safety and security of autonomous vehicles. In this thesis, we study the detection methods against the attacks on onboard sensors and the linkage between attacked deep learning models and driving safety for autonomous vehicles. To detect the attacks, redundant data sources can be exploited, since information distortions caused by attacks in victim sensor data result in inconsistency with the information from other redundant sources. To study the linkage between attacked deep learning models and driving safety...

- **Summary**: The unprecedented availability of spatial and temporal high-resolution satellite image time series (SITS) for crop type mapping is believed to necessitate deep learning architectures to accommodate challenges arising from both dimensions. Recent state-of-the-art deep learning models have shown promising results by stacking spatial and temporal encoders. However, we present a Pyramid Time-Series Transformer (PTST) that operates solely on the temporal dimension, i.e., neglecting the spatial dimension, can produce superior results with a drastic reduction in GPU memory consumption and easy extensibility. Furthermore, we augment it to perform semi-supervised learning by proposing a classification-friendly VAE framework that introduces clustering mechanisms into latent space and can promote linear separability therein. Consequently, a few principal axes of the latent space can explain the majority of variance in raw data. Meanwhile, the VAE framework with proposed tweaks can maintain competitive classification performance as its purely discriminative counterpart when only $40\%$ of labelled data is used. We hope the proposed framework can serve as a baseline for crop classification with SITS for its modularity and simplicity.

- **Summary**: Recommendation in the fashion domain has seen a recent surge in research in various areas, for example, shop-the-look, context-aware outfit creation, personalizing outfit creation, etc. The majority of state of the art approaches in the domain of outfit recommendation pursue to improve compatibility among items so as to produce high quality outfits. Some recent works have realized that style is an important factor in fashion and have incorporated it in compatibility learning and outfit generation. These methods often depend on the availability of fine-grained product categories or the presence of rich item attributes (e.g., long-skirt, mini-skirt, etc.). In this work, we aim to generate outfits conditional on styles or themes as one would dress in real life, operating under the practical assumption that each item is mapped to a high level category as driven by the taxonomy of an online portal, like outdoor, formal etc and an image. We use a novel style encoder network that renders outfit styles in a smooth latent space. We present an extensive analysis of different aspects of our method and demonstrate its superiority over existing state of the art baselines through rigorous experiments.

- **Summary**: Recent machine learning algorithms such as neural networks can classify objects and actions in video frames with high accuracy. Here, I discuss a classification of objects based on basal dynamic patterns referencing one tradition, the link between rabbit, toad, and the Moon, which can be seen in several cultures. In order for them to be classified into one class, a basic pattern of behavior (cyclic appearance and disappearance) works as a feature point. A static character such as the shape and time scale of the behavior are not essential for this classification. In cognitive semantics, image schemas are introduced to describe basal patterns of events. If learning of these image schemas is attained, a machine may be able to categorize rabbit, toad, and the Moon as the same class. For learning, video frames that show boundary boxes or segmentation may be helpful. Although this discussion is preliminary and many tasks remain to be solved, the classification based on basal behaviors can be an important topic for cognitive processes and computer science.

- **Summary**: Multi-object multi-part scene parsing is a challenging task which requires detecting multiple object classes in a scene and segmenting the semantic parts within each object. In this paper, we propose FLOAT, a factorized label space framework for scalable multi-object multi-part parsing. Our framework involves independent dense prediction of object category and part attributes which increases scalability and reduces task complexity compared to the monolithic label space counterpart. In addition, we propose an inference-time 'zoom' refinement technique which significantly improves segmentation quality, especially for smaller objects/parts. Compared to state of the art, FLOAT obtains an absolute improvement of 2.0% for mean IOU (mIOU) and 4.8% for segmentation quality IOU (sqIOU) on the Pascal-Part-58 dataset. For the larger Pascal-Part-108 dataset, the improvements are 2.1% for mIOU and 3.9% for sqIOU. We incorporate previously excluded part attributes and other minor parts of the Pascal-Part dataset to create the most comprehensive and challenging version which we dub Pascal-Part-201. FLOAT obtains improvements of 8.6% for mIOU and 7.5% for sqIOU on the new dataset, demonstrating its parsing effectiveness across a challenging diversity of objects and parts.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) shows a bright promise as a powerful regularization strategy to boost generalization ability by leveraging learned sample-level soft targets. Yet, employing a complex pre-trained teacher network or an ensemble of peer students in existing KD is both time-consuming and computationally costly. Various self KD methods have been proposed to achieve higher distillation efficiency. However, they either require extra network architecture modification or are difficult to parallelize. To cope with these challenges, we propose an efficient and reliable self-distillation framework, named Self-Distillation from Last Mini-Batch (DLB). Specifically, we rearrange the sequential sampling by constraining half of each mini-batch coinciding with the previous iteration. Meanwhile, the rest half will coincide with the upcoming iteration. Afterwards, the former half mini-batch distills on-the-fly soft targets generated in the previous iteration. Our proposed mechanism guides the training stability and consistency, resulting in robustness to label noise. Moreover, our method is easy to implement, without taking up extra run-time memory or requiring model structure modification. Experimental results on three classification benchmarks illustrate that our approach can consistently outperform state-of-the-art self-distillation approaches with different network architectures. Additionally, our method shows strong compatibility with augmentation strategies by gaining additional performance improvement. The code is available at https://github.com/Meta-knowledge-Lab/DLB.

- **Summary**: We introduce optical Flow transFormer, dubbed as FlowFormer, a transformer-based neural network architecture for learning optical flow. FlowFormer tokenizes the 4D cost volume built from an image pair, encodes the cost tokens into a cost memory with alternate-group transformer (AGT) layers in a novel latent space, and decodes the cost memory via a recurrent transformer decoder with dynamic positional cost queries. On the Sintel benchmark, FlowFormer achieves 1.159 and 2.088 average end-point-error (AEPE) on the clean and final pass, a 16.5% and 15.5% error reduction from the best published result (1.388 and 2.47). Besides, FlowFormer also achieves strong generalization performance. Without being trained on Sintel, FlowFormer achieves 1.01 AEPE on the clean pass of Sintel training set, outperforming the best published result (1.29) by 21.7%.

- **Summary**: We propose a new problem formulation and a corresponding evaluation framework to advance research on unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic image segmentation. The overall goal is fostering the development of adaptive learning systems that will continuously learn, without supervision, in ever-changing environments. Typical protocols that study adaptation algorithms for segmentation models are limited to few domains, adaptation happens offline, and human intervention is generally required, at least to annotate data for hyper-parameter tuning. We argue that such constraints are incompatible with algorithms that can continuously adapt to different real-world situations. To address this, we propose a protocol where models need to learn online, from sequences of temporally correlated images, requiring continuous, frame-by-frame adaptation. We accompany this new protocol with a variety of baselines to tackle the proposed formulation, as well as an extensive analysis of their behaviors, which can serve as a starting point for future research.

- **Summary**: We propose an approach to estimate arm and hand dynamics from monocular video by utilizing the relationship between arm and hand. Although monocular full human motion capture technologies have made great progress in recent years, recovering accurate and plausible arm twists and hand gestures from in-the-wild videos still remains a challenge. To solve this problem, our solution is proposed based on the fact that arm poses and hand gestures are highly correlated in most real situations. To fully exploit arm-hand correlation as well as inter-frame information, we carefully design a Spatial-Temporal Parallel Arm-Hand Motion Transformer (PAHMT) to predict the arm and hand dynamics simultaneously. We also introduce new losses to encourage the estimations to be smooth and accurate. Besides, we collect a motion capture dataset including 200K frames of hand gestures and use this data to train our model. By integrating a 2D hand pose estimation model and a 3D human pose estimation model, the proposed method can produce plausible arm and hand dynamics from monocular video. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method has advantages over previous state-of-the-art approaches and shows robustness under various challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Learning visual representation of high quality is essential for image classification. Recently, a series of contrastive representation learning methods have achieved preeminent success. Particularly, SupCon outperformed the dominant methods based on cross-entropy loss in representation learning. However, we notice that there could be potential ethical risks in supervised contrastive learning. In this paper, we for the first time analyze unfairness caused by supervised contrastive learning and propose a new Fair Supervised Contrastive Loss (FSCL) for fair visual representation learning. Inheriting the philosophy of supervised contrastive learning, it encourages representation of the same class to be closer to each other than that of different classes, while ensuring fairness by penalizing the inclusion of sensitive attribute information in representation. In addition, we introduce a group-wise normalization to diminish the disparities of intra-group compactness and inter-class separability between demographic groups that arouse unfair classification. Through extensive experiments on CelebA and UTK Face, we validate that the proposed method significantly outperforms SupCon and existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of the trade-off between top-1 accuracy and fairness. Moreover, our method is robust to the intensity of data bias and effectively works in incomplete supervised settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/sungho-CoolG/FSCL.

- **Summary**: This paper concerns the problem of multi-object tracking based on the min-cost flow (MCF) formulation, which is conventionally studied as an instance of linear program. Given its computationally tractable inference, the success of MCF tracking largely relies on the learned cost function of underlying linear program. Most previous studies focus on learning the cost function by only taking into account two frames during training, therefore the learned cost function is sub-optimal for MCF where a multi-frame data association must be considered during inference. In order to address this problem, in this paper we propose a novel differentiable framework that ties training and inference together during learning by solving a bi-level optimization problem, where the lower-level solves a linear program and the upper-level contains a loss function that incorporates global tracking result. By back-propagating the loss through differentiable layers via gradient descent, the globally parameterized cost function is explicitly learned and regularized. With this approach, we are able to learn a better objective for global MCF tracking. As a result, we achieve competitive performances compared to the current state-of-the-art methods on the popular multi-object tracking benchmarks such as MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20.

- **Summary**: Due to the difficulty of collecting exhaustive multi-label annotations, multi-label datasets often contain partial labels. We consider an extreme of this weakly supervised learning problem, called single positive multi-label learning (SPML), where each multi-label training image has only one positive label. Traditionally, all unannotated labels are assumed as negative labels in SPML, which introduces false negative labels and causes model training to be dominated by assumed negative labels. In this work, we choose to treat all unannotated labels from an alternative perspective, i.e. acknowledging they are unknown. Hence, we propose entropy-maximization (EM) loss to attain a special gradient regime for providing proper supervision signals. Moreover, we propose asymmetric pseudo-labeling (APL), which adopts asymmetric-tolerance strategies and a self-paced procedure, to cooperate with EM loss and then provide more precise supervision. Experiments show that our method significantly improves performance and achieves state-of-the-art results on all four benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This study addresses the issue of fusing infrared and visible images that appear differently for object detection. Aiming at generating an image of high visual quality, previous approaches discover commons underlying the two modalities and fuse upon the common space either by iterative optimization or deep networks. These approaches neglect that modality differences implying the complementary information are extremely important for both fusion and subsequent detection task. This paper proposes a bilevel optimization formulation for the joint problem of fusion and detection, and then unrolls to a target-aware Dual Adversarial Learning (TarDAL) network for fusion and a commonly used detection network. The fusion network with one generator and dual discriminators seeks commons while learning from differences, which preserves structural information of targets from the infrared and textural details from the visible. Furthermore, we build a synchronized imaging system with calibrated infrared and optical sensors, and collect currently the most comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments on several public datasets and our benchmark demonstrate that our method outputs not only visually appealing fusion but also higher detection mAP than the state-of-the-art approaches.

Our solution finds an optimal alignment using a dual-domain recurrent neural network that is trained on synthetic data we generate by dropping and duplicating video frames. Once the alignment is found, we modify the video in order to sync the two sources. Our method is shown to greatly outperform the literature methods on a variety of existing and new benchmarks. As an application, we demonstrate our ability to robustly align text-to-speech generated audio with an existing video stream.

- **Summary**: Biclustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that simultaneously clusters rows and columns in a data matrix. Biclustering has emerged as an important approach and plays an essential role in various applications such as bioinformatics, text mining, and pattern recognition. However, finding significant biclusters is an NP-hard problem that can be formulated as an optimization problem. Therefore, different metaheuristics have been applied to biclustering problems because of their exploratory capability of solving complex optimization problems in reasonable computation time. Although various surveys on biclustering have been proposed, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey on the biclustering problem using metaheuristics. This chapter will present a survey of metaheuristics approaches to address the biclustering problem. The review focuses on the underlying optimization methods and their main search components: representation, objective function, and variation operators. A specific discussion on single versus multi-objective approaches is presented. Finally, some emerging research directions are presented.

- **Summary**: Although action recognition has achieved impressive results over recent years, both collection and annotation of video training data are still time-consuming and cost intensive. Therefore, image-to-video adaptation has been proposed to exploit labeling-free web image source for adapting on unlabeled target videos. This poses two major challenges: (1) spatial domain shift between web images and video frames; (2) modality gap between image and video data. To address these challenges, we propose Cycle Domain Adaptation (CycDA), a cycle-based approach for unsupervised image-to-video domain adaptation by leveraging the joint spatial information in images and videos on the one hand and, on the other hand, training an independent spatio-temporal model to bridge the modality gap. We alternate between the spatial and spatio-temporal learning with knowledge transfer between the two in each cycle. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets for image-to-video as well as for mixed-source domain adaptation achieving state-of-the-art results and demonstrating the benefits of our cyclic adaptation.

- **Summary**: We present a novel Transformer-based network architecture for instance-aware image-to-image translation, dubbed InstaFormer, to effectively integrate global- and instance-level information. By considering extracted content features from an image as tokens, our networks discover global consensus of content features by considering context information through a self-attention module in Transformers. By augmenting such tokens with an instance-level feature extracted from the content feature with respect to bounding box information, our framework is capable of learning an interaction between object instances and the global image, thus boosting the instance-awareness. We replace layer normalization (LayerNorm) in standard Transformers with adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) to enable a multi-modal translation with style codes. In addition, to improve the instance-awareness and translation quality at object regions, we present an instance-level content contrastive loss defined between input and translated image. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our InstaFormer over the latest methods and provide extensive ablation studies.

- **Summary**: Segmenting or detecting objects in sparse Lidar point clouds are two important tasks in autonomous driving to allow a vehicle to act safely in its 3D environment. The best performing methods in 3D semantic segmentation or object detection rely on a large amount of annotated data. Yet annotating 3D Lidar data for these tasks is tedious and costly. In this context, we propose a self-supervised pre-training method for 3D perception models that is tailored to autonomous driving data. Specifically, we leverage the availability of synchronized and calibrated image and Lidar sensors in autonomous driving setups for distilling self-supervised pre-trained image representations into 3D models. Hence, our method does not require any point cloud nor image annotations. The key ingredient of our method is the use of superpixels which are used to pool 3D point features and 2D pixel features in visually similar regions. We then train a 3D network on the self-supervised task of matching these pooled point features with the corresponding pooled image pixel features. The advantages of contrasting regions obtained by superpixels are that: (1) grouping together pixels and points of visually coherent regions leads to a more meaningful contrastive task that produces features well adapted to 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection; (2) all the different regions have the same weight in the contrastive loss regardless of the number of 3D points sampled in these regions; (3) it mitigates the noise produced by incorrect matching of points and pixels due to occlusions between the different sensors. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate the ability of our image-to-Lidar distillation strategy to produce 3D representations that transfer well on semantic segmentation and object detection tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a simple yet universal network termed SeqTR for visual grounding tasks, e.g., phrase localization, referring expression comprehension (REC) and segmentation (RES). The canonical paradigms for visual grounding often require substantial expertise in designing network architectures and loss functions, making them hard to generalize across tasks. To simplify and unify the modeling, we cast visual grounding as a point prediction problem conditioned on image and text inputs, where either the bounding box or binary mask is represented as a sequence of discrete coordinate tokens. Under this paradigm, visual grounding tasks are unified in our SeqTR network without task-specific branches or heads, e.g., the convolutional mask decoder for RES, which greatly reduces the complexity of multi-task modeling. In addition, SeqTR also shares the same optimization objective for all tasks with a simple cross-entropy loss, further reducing the complexity of deploying hand-crafted loss functions. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeqTR outperforms (or is on par with) the existing state-of-the-arts, proving that a simple yet universal approach for visual grounding is indeed feasible.

- **Summary**: Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a significant task in achieving autonomous driving. Traditional works attempt to complete this task, either based on point clouds (PC) collected by LiDAR, or based on images captured from cameras. However, relying on one single sensor is not robust enough, because it might fail during the tracking process. On the other hand, feature fusion from multiple modalities contributes to the improvement of accuracy. As a result, new techniques based on different sensors integrating features from multiple modalities are being developed. Texture information from RGB cameras and 3D structure information from Lidar have respective advantages under different circumstances. However, it's not easy to achieve effective feature fusion because of completely distinct information modalities. Previous fusion methods usually fuse the top-level features after the backbones extract the features from different modalities. In this paper, we first introduce PointNet++ to obtain multi-scale deep representations of point cloud to make it adaptive to our proposed Interactive Feature Fusion between multi-scale features of images and point clouds. Specifically, through multi-scale interactive query and fusion between pixel-level and point-level features, our method, can obtain more distinguishing features to improve the performance of multiple object tracking. Besides, we explore the effectiveness of pre-training on each single modality and fine-tuning on the fusion-based model. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve good performance on the KITTI benchmark and outperform other approaches without using multi-scale feature fusion. Moreover, the ablation studies indicates the effectiveness of multi-scale feature fusion and pre-training on single modality.

- **Summary**: Do black-box neural network models learn clinically relevant features for fracture diagnosis? The answer not only establishes reliability quenches scientific curiosity but also leads to explainable and verbose findings that can assist the radiologists in the final and increase trust. This work identifies the concepts networks use for vertebral fracture diagnosis in CT images. This is achieved by associating concepts to neurons highly correlated with a specific diagnosis in the dataset. The concepts are either associated with neurons by radiologists pre-hoc or are visualized during a specific prediction and left for the user's interpretation. We evaluate which concepts lead to correct diagnosis and which concepts lead to false positives. The proposed frameworks and analysis pave the way for reliable and explainable vertebral fracture diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Neural 3D implicit representations learn priors that are useful for diverse applications, such as single- or multiple-view 3D reconstruction. A major downside of existing approaches while rendering an image is that they require evaluating the network multiple times per camera ray so that the high computational time forms a bottleneck for downstream applications. We address this problem by introducing a novel neural scene representation that we call the directional distance function (DDF). To this end, we learn a signed distance function (SDF) along with our DDF model to represent a class of shapes. Specifically, our DDF is defined on the unit sphere and predicts the distance to the surface along any given direction. Therefore, our DDF allows rendering images with just a single network evaluation per camera ray. Based on our DDF, we present a novel fast algorithm (FIRe) to reconstruct 3D shapes given a posed depth map. We evaluate our proposed method on 3D reconstruction from single-view depth images, where we empirically show that our algorithm reconstructs 3D shapes more accurately and it is more than 15 times faster (per iteration) than competing methods.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a method for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from zero-echo-time (ZTE) MRI aimed at structural and quantitative accuracies of the image, with a particular focus on the accurate bone density value prediction. We propose a loss function that favors a spatially sparse region in the image. We harness the ability of a multi-task network to produce correlated outputs as a framework to enable localisation of region of interest (RoI) via classification, emphasize regression of values within RoI and still retain the overall accuracy via global regression. The network is optimized by a composite loss function that combines a dedicated loss from each task. We demonstrate how the multi-task network with RoI focused loss offers an advantage over other configurations of the network to achieve higher accuracy of performance. This is relevant to sCT where failure to accurately estimate high Hounsfield Unit values of bone could lead to impaired accuracy in clinical applications. We compare the dose calculation maps from the proposed sCT and the real CT in a radiation therapy treatment planning setup.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce AmsterTime: a challenging dataset to benchmark visual place recognition (VPR) in presence of a severe domain shift. AmsterTime offers a collection of 2,500 well-curated images matching the same scene from a street view matched to historical archival image data from Amsterdam city. The image pairs capture the same place with different cameras, viewpoints, and appearances. Unlike existing benchmark datasets, AmsterTime is directly crowdsourced in a GIS navigation platform (Mapillary). We evaluate various baselines, including non-learning, supervised and self-supervised methods, pre-trained on different relevant datasets, for both verification and retrieval tasks. Our result credits the best accuracy to the ResNet-101 model pre-trained on the Landmarks dataset for both verification and retrieval tasks by 84% and 24%, respectively. Additionally, a subset of Amsterdam landmarks is collected for feature evaluation in a classification task. Classification labels are further used to extract the visual explanations using Grad-CAM for inspection of the learned similar visuals in a deep metric learning models.

- **Summary**: Object detection and forecasting are fundamental components of embodied perception. These two problems, however, are largely studied in isolation by the community. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for detection and motion forecasting based on raw sensor measurement as opposed to ground truth tracks. Instead of predicting the current frame locations and forecasting forward in time, we directly predict future object locations and backcast to determine where each trajectory began. Our approach not only improves overall accuracy compared to other modular or end-to-end baselines, it also prompts us to rethink the role of explicit tracking for embodied perception. Additionally, by linking future and current locations in a many-to-one manner, our approach is able to reason about multiple futures, a capability that was previously considered difficult for end-to-end approaches. We conduct extensive experiments on the popular nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach. In addition, we investigate the appropriateness of reusing standard forecasting metrics for an end-to-end setup, and find a number of limitations which allow us to build simple baselines to game these metrics. We address this issue with a novel set of joint forecasting and detection metrics that extend the commonly used AP metrics from the detection community to measuring forecasting accuracy.

- **Summary**: Vision-based grasp estimation is an essential part of robotic manipulation tasks in the real world. Existing planar grasp estimation algorithms have been demonstrated to work well in relatively simple scenes. But when it comes to complex scenes, such as cluttered scenes with messy backgrounds and moving objects, the algorithms from previous works are prone to generate inaccurate and unstable grasping contact points. In this work, we first study the existing planar grasp estimation algorithms and analyze the related challenges in complex scenes. Secondly, we design a Pixel-wise Efficient Grasp Generation Network (PEGG-Net) to tackle the problem of grasping in complex scenes. PEGG-Net can achieve improved state-of-the-art performance on the Cornell dataset (98.9%) and second-best performance on the Jacquard dataset (93.8%), outperforming other existing algorithms without the introduction of complex structures. Thirdly, PEGG-Net could operate in a closed-loop manner for added robustness in dynamic environments using position-based visual servoing (PBVS). Finally, we conduct real-world experiments on static, dynamic, and cluttered objects in different complex scenes. The results show that our proposed network achieves a high success rate in grasping irregular objects, household objects, and workshop tools.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we delve into two key techniques in Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD), namely pseudo labeling and consistency training. We observe that these two techniques currently neglect some important properties of object detection, hindering efficient learning on unlabeled data. Specifically, for pseudo labeling, existing works only focus on the classification score yet fail to guarantee the localization precision of pseudo boxes; For consistency training, the widely adopted random-resize training only considers the label-level consistency but misses the feature-level one, which also plays an important role in ensuring the scale invariance. To address the problems incurred by noisy pseudo boxes, we design Noisy Pseudo box Learning (NPL) that includes Prediction-guided Label Assignment (PLA) and Positive-proposal Consistency Voting (PCV). PLA relies on model predictions to assign labels and makes it robust to even coarse pseudo boxes; while PCV leverages the regression consistency of positive proposals to reflect the localization quality of pseudo boxes. Furthermore, in consistency training, we propose Multi-view Scale-invariant Learning (MSL) that includes mechanisms of both label- and feature-level consistency, where feature consistency is achieved by aligning shifted feature pyramids between two images with identical content but varied scales. On COCO benchmark, our method, termed PSEudo labeling and COnsistency training (PseCo), outperforms the SOTA (Soft Teacher) by 2.0, 1.8, 2.0 points under 1%, 5%, and 10% labelling ratios, respectively. It also significantly improves the learning efficiency for SSOD, e.g., PseCo halves the training time of the SOTA approach but achieves even better performance.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of multi-robot active mapping, which aims for complete scene map construction in minimum time steps. The key to this problem lies in the goal position estimation to enable more efficient robot movements. Previous approaches either choose the frontier as the goal position via a myopic solution that hinders the time efficiency, or maximize the long-term value via reinforcement learning to directly regress the goal position, but does not guarantee the complete map construction. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely NeuralCoMapping, which takes advantage of both approaches. We reduce the problem to bipartite graph matching, which establishes the node correspondences between two graphs, denoting robots and frontiers. We introduce a multiplex graph neural network (mGNN) that learns the neural distance to fill the affinity matrix for more effective graph matching. We optimize the mGNN with a differentiable linear assignment layer by maximizing the long-term values that favor time efficiency and map completeness via reinforcement learning. We compare our algorithm with several state-of-the-art multi-robot active mapping approaches and adapted reinforcement-learning baselines. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and exceptional generalization ability of our algorithm on various indoor scenes and unseen number of robots, when only trained with 9 indoor scenes.

- **Summary**: JPEG is a popular image compression method widely used by individuals, data center, cloud storage and network filesystems. However, most recent progress on image compression mainly focuses on uncompressed images while ignoring trillions of already-existing JPEG images. To compress these JPEG images adequately and restore them back to JPEG format losslessly when needed, we propose a deep learning based JPEG recompression method that operates on DCT domain and propose a Multi-Level Cross-Channel Entropy Model to compress the most informative Y component. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with traditional JPEG recompression methods including Lepton, JPEG XL and CMIX. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learned compression method that losslessly transcodes JPEG images to more storage-saving bitstreams.

- **Summary**: Existing works have identified the limitation of top-$1$ attack success rate (ASR) as a metric to evaluate the attack strength but exclusively investigated it in the white-box setting, while our work extends it to a more practical black-box setting: transferable attack. It is widely reported that stronger I-FGSM transfers worse than simple FGSM, leading to a popular belief that transferability is at odds with the white-box attack strength. Our work challenges this belief with empirical finding that stronger attack actually transfers better for the general top-$k$ ASR indicated by the interest class rank (ICR) after attack. For increasing the attack strength, with an intuitive interpretation of the logit gradient from the geometric perspective, we identify that the weakness of the commonly used losses lie in prioritizing the speed to fool the network instead of maximizing its strength. To this end, we propose a new normalized CE loss that guides the logit to be updated in the direction of implicitly maximizing its rank distance from the ground-truth class. Extensive results in various settings have verified that our proposed new loss is simple yet effective for top-$k$ attack. Code is available at: \url{https://bit.ly/3uCiomP}

- **Summary**: Cardiac patterns are being used to obtain hard-to-forge biometric signatures and have led to high accuracy in state-of-the-art (SoA) identification applications. However, this performance is obtained under controlled scenarios where cardiac signals maintain a relatively uniform pattern, facilitating the identification process. In this work, we analyze cardiac signals collected in more realistic (uncontrolled) scenarios and show that their high signal variability (i.e., irregularity) makes it harder to obtain stable and distinct user features. Furthermore, SoA usually fails to identify specific groups of users, rendering existing identification methods futile in uncontrolled scenarios. To solve these problems, we propose a framework with three novel properties. First, we design an adaptive method that achieves stable and distinct features by tailoring the filtering spectrum to each user. Second, we show that users can have multiple cardiac morphologies, offering us a much bigger pool of cardiac signals and users compared to SoA. Third, we overcome other distortion effects present in authentication applications with a multi-cluster approach and the Mahalanobis distance. Our evaluation shows that the average balanced accuracy (BAC) of SoA drops from above 90% in controlled scenarios to 75% in uncontrolled ones, while our method maintains an average BAC above 90% in uncontrolled scenarios.

- **Summary**: Most current approaches to undersampled multi-coil MRI reconstruction focus on learning the reconstruction model for a fixed, equidistant acquisition trajectory. In this paper, we study the problem of joint learning of the reconstruction model together with acquisition policies. To this end, we extend the End-to-End Variational Network with learnable acquisition policies that can adapt to different data points. We validate our model on a coil-compressed version of the large scale undersampled multi-coil fastMRI dataset using two undersampling factors: $4\times$ and $8\times$. Our experiments show on-par performance with the learnable non-adaptive and handcrafted equidistant strategies at $4\times$, and an observed improvement of more than $2\%$ in SSIM at $8\times$ acceleration, suggesting that potentially-adaptive $k$-space acquisition trajectories can improve reconstructed image quality for larger acceleration factors. However, and perhaps surprisingly, our best performing policies learn to be explicitly non-adaptive.

- **Summary**: Motion style transfer is highly desired for motion generation systems for gaming. Compared to its offline counterpart, the research on online motion style transfer under interactive control is limited. In this work, we propose an end-to-end neural network that can generate motions with different styles and transfer motion styles in real-time under user control. Our approach eliminates the use of handcrafted phase features, and could be easily trained and directly deployed in game systems. In the experiment part, we evaluate our approach from three aspects that are essential for industrial game design: accuracy, flexibility, and variety, and our model performs a satisfying result.



### Recognition of polar lows in Sentinel-1 SAR images with deep learning

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting polar lows in C-band SAR images by means of deep learning. Specifically, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of Sentinel-1 images divided into two classes, representing the presence and absence of a maritime mesocyclone, respectively. The dataset is constructed using the ERA5 dataset as baseline and it consists of 2004 annotated images. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset of its kind to be publicly released. The dataset is used to train a deep learning model to classify the labeled images. Evaluated on an independent test set, the model yields an F-1 score of 0.95, indicating that polar lows can be consistently detected from SAR images. Interpretability techniques applied to the deep learning model reveal that atmospheric fronts and cyclonic eyes are key features in the classification. Moreover, experimental results show that the model is accurate even if: (i) such features are significantly cropped due to the limited swath width of the SAR, (ii) the features are partly covered by sea ice and (iii) land is covering significant parts of the images. By evaluating the model performance on multiple input image resolutions (pixel sizes of 500m, 1km and 2km), it is found that higher resolution yield the best performance. This emphasises the potential of using high resolution sensors like SAR for detecting polar lows, as compared to conventionally used sensors such as scatterometers.

- **Summary**: The extension of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to non-Euclidean geometries has led to multiple frameworks for studying manifolds. Many of those methods have shown design limitations resulting in poor modelling of long-range associations, as the generalisation of convolutions to irregular surfaces is non-trivial. Motivated by the success of attention-modelling in computer vision, we translate convolution-free vision transformer approaches to surface data, to introduce a domain-agnostic architecture to study any surface data projected onto a spherical manifold. Here, surface patching is achieved by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches, extracted from a subdivided icosphere. A transformer model encodes the sequence of patches via successive multi-head self-attention layers while preserving the sequence resolution. We validate the performance of the proposed Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) on the task of phenotype regression from cortical surface metrics derived from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Experiments show that the SiT generally outperforms surface CNNs, while performing comparably on registered and unregistered data. Analysis of transformer attention maps offers strong potential to characterise subtle cognitive developmental patterns.



### The impact of using voxel-level segmentation metrics on evaluating multifocal prostate cancer localisation

- **Summary**: Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD) are widely used for evaluating medical image segmentation. They have also been criticised, when reported alone, for their unclear or even misleading clinical interpretation. DSCs may also differ substantially from HDs, due to boundary smoothness or multiple regions of interest (ROIs) within a subject. More importantly, either metric can also have a nonlinear, non-monotonic relationship with outcomes based on Type 1 and 2 errors, designed for specific clinical decisions that use the resulting segmentation. Whilst cases causing disagreement between these metrics are not difficult to postulate. This work first proposes a new asymmetric detection metric, adapting those used in object detection, for planning prostate cancer procedures. The lesion-level metrics is then compared with the voxel-level DSC and HD, whereas a 3D UNet is used for segmenting lesions from multiparametric MR (mpMR) images. Based on experimental results we report pairwise agreement and correlation 1) between DSC and HD, and 2) between voxel-level DSC and recall-controlled precision at lesion-level, with Cohen's [0.49, 0.61] and Pearson's [0.66, 0.76] (p-values}<0.001) at varying cut-offs. However, the differences in false-positives and false-negatives, between the actual errors and the perceived counterparts if DSC is used, can be as high as 152 and 154, respectively, out of the 357 test set lesions. We therefore carefully conclude that, despite of the significant correlations, voxel-level metrics such as DSC can misrepresent lesion-level detection accuracy for evaluating localisation of multifocal prostate cancer and should be interpreted with caution.

- **Summary**: We address the task of predicting what parts of an object can open and how they move when they do so. The input is a single image of an object, and as output we detect what parts of the object can open, and the motion parameters describing the articulation of each openable part. To tackle this task, we create two datasets of 3D objects: OPDSynth based on existing synthetic objects, and OPDReal based on RGBD reconstructions of real objects. We then design OPDRCNN, a neural architecture that detects openable parts and predicts their motion parameters. Our experiments show that this is a challenging task especially when considering generalization across object categories, and the limited amount of information in a single image. Our architecture outperforms baselines and prior work especially for RGB image inputs. Short video summary at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P85iCaD0rfc

- **Summary**: Data imbalance exists ubiquitously in real-world visual regressions, e.g., age estimation and pose estimation, hurting the model's generalizability and fairness. Thus, imbalanced regression gains increasing research attention recently. Compared to imbalanced classification, imbalanced regression focuses on continuous labels, which can be boundless and high-dimensional and hence more challenging. In this work, we identify that the widely used Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function can be ineffective in imbalanced regression. We revisit MSE from a statistical view and propose a novel loss function, Balanced MSE, to accommodate the imbalanced training label distribution. We further design multiple implementations of Balanced MSE to tackle different real-world scenarios, particularly including the one that requires no prior knowledge about the training label distribution. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, Balanced MSE is the first general solution to high-dimensional imbalanced regression. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and three real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Balanced MSE.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of localizing a spatio-temporal tube in a video corresponding to a given text query. This is a challenging task that requires the joint and efficient modeling of temporal, spatial and multi-modal interactions. To address this task, we propose TubeDETR, a transformer-based architecture inspired by the recent success of such models for text-conditioned object detection. Our model notably includes: (i) an efficient video and text encoder that models spatial multi-modal interactions over sparsely sampled frames and (ii) a space-time decoder that jointly performs spatio-temporal localization. We demonstrate the advantage of our proposed components through an extensive ablation study. We also evaluate our full approach on the spatio-temporal video grounding task and demonstrate improvements over the state of the art on the challenging VidSTG and HC-STVG benchmarks. Code and trained models are publicly available at https://antoyang.github.io/tubedetr.html.

- **Summary**: We present ConceptEvo, a unified interpretation framework for deep neural networks (DNNs) that reveals the inception and evolution of learned concepts during training. Our work addresses a critical gap in DNN interpretation research, as existing methods primarily focus on post-training interpretation. ConceptEvo introduces two novel technical contributions: (1) an algorithm that generates a unified semantic space, enabling side-by-side comparison of different models during training, and (2) an algorithm that discovers and quantifies important concept evolutions for class predictions. Through a large-scale human evaluation and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that ConceptEvo successfully identifies concept evolutions across different models, which are not only comprehensible to humans but also crucial for class predictions. ConceptEvo is applicable to both modern DNN architectures, such as ConvNeXt, and classic DNNs, such as VGGs and InceptionV3.

- **Summary**: Object reconstruction from 3D point clouds has achieved impressive progress in the computer vision and computer graphics research field. However, reconstruction from time-varying point clouds (a.k.a. 4D point clouds) is generally overlooked. In this paper, we propose a new network architecture, namely RFNet-4D, that jointly reconstruct objects and their motion flows from 4D point clouds. The key insight is that simultaneously performing both tasks via learning spatial and temporal features from a sequence of point clouds can leverage individual tasks, leading to improved overall performance. To prove this ability, we design a temporal vector field learning module using unsupervised learning approach for flow estimation, leveraged by supervised learning of spatial structures for object reconstruction. Extensive experiments and analyses on benchmark dataset validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. As shown in experimental results, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both flow estimation and object reconstruction while performing much faster than existing methods in both training and inference.

- **Summary**: The requirements of much larger file sizes, different storage formats, and immersive viewing conditions of VR pose significant challenges to the goals of acquiring, transmitting, compressing, and displaying high-quality VR content. At the same time, the great potential of deep learning to advance progress on the video compression problem has driven a significant research effort. Because of the high bandwidth requirements of VR, there has also been significant interest in the use of space-variant, foveated compression protocols. We have integrated these techniques to create an end-to-end deep learning video compression framework. A feature of our new compression model is that it dispenses with the need for expensive search-based motion prediction computations. This is accomplished by exploiting statistical regularities inherent in video motion expressed by displaced frame differences. Foveation protocols are desirable since only a small portion of a video viewed in VR may be visible as a user gazes in any given direction. Moreover, even within a current field of view (FOV), the resolution of retinal neurons rapidly decreases with distance (eccentricity) from the projected point of gaze. In our learning based approach, we implement foveation by introducing a Foveation Generator Unit (FGU) that generates foveation masks which direct the allocation of bits, significantly increasing compression efficiency while making it possible to retain an impression of little to no additional visual loss given an appropriate viewing geometry. Our experiment results reveal that our new compression model, which we call the Foveated MOtionless VIdeo Codec (Foveated MOVI-Codec), is able to efficiently compress videos without computing motion, while outperforming foveated version of both H.264 and H.265 on the widely used UVG dataset and on the HEVC Standard Class B Test Sequences.

- **Summary**: Previous partial permutation synchronization (PPS) algorithms, which are commonly used for multi-object matching, often involve computation-intensive and memory-demanding matrix operations. These operations become intractable for large scale structure-from-motion datasets. For pure permutation synchronization, the recent Cycle-Edge Message Passing (CEMP) framework suggests a memory-efficient and fast solution. Here we overcome the restriction of CEMP to compact groups and propose an improved algorithm, CEMP-Partial, for estimating the corruption levels of the observed partial permutations. It allows us to subsequently implement a nonconvex weighted projected power method without the need of spectral initialization. The resulting new PPS algorithm, MatchFAME (Fast, Accurate and Memory-Efficient Matching), only involves sparse matrix operations, and thus enjoys lower time and space complexities in comparison to previous PPS algorithms. We prove that under adversarial corruption, though without additive noise and with certain assumptions, CEMP-Partial is able to exactly classify corrupted and clean partial permutations. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy, speed and memory efficiency of our method on both synthetic and real datasets.

- **Summary**: Coronavirus 2019 has brought severe challenges to social stability and public health worldwide. One effective way of curbing the epidemic is to require people to wear masks in public places and monitor mask-wearing states by utilizing suitable automatic detectors. However, existing deep learning based models struggle to simultaneously achieve the requirements of both high precision and real-time performance. To solve this problem, we propose an improved lightweight face mask detector based on YOLOv5, which can achieve an excellent balance of precision and speed. Firstly, a novel backbone ShuffleCANet that combines ShuffleNetV2 network with Coordinate Attention mechanism is proposed as the backbone. Afterwards, an efficient path aggression network BiFPN is applied as the feature fusion neck. Furthermore, the localization loss is replaced with alpha-CIoU in model training phase to obtain higher-quality anchors. Some valuable strategies such as data augmentation, adaptive image scaling, and anchor cluster operation are also utilized. Experimental results on AIZOO face mask dataset show the superiority of the proposed model. Compared with the original YOLOv5, the proposed model increases the inference speed by 28.3% while still improving the precision by 0.58%. It achieves the best mean average precision of 95.2% compared with other seven existing models, which is 4.4% higher than the baseline.

- **Summary**: Traditional object detectors employ the dense paradigm of scanning over locations and scales in an image. The recent query-based object detectors break this convention by decoding image features with a set of learnable queries. However, this paradigm still suffers from slow convergence, limited performance, and design complexity of extra networks between backbone and decoder. In this paper, we find that the key to these issues is the adaptability of decoders for casting queries to varying objects. Accordingly, we propose a fast-converging query-based detector, named AdaMixer, by improving the adaptability of query-based decoding processes in two aspects. First, each query adaptively samples features over space and scales based on estimated offsets, which allows AdaMixer to efficiently attend to the coherent regions of objects. Then, we dynamically decode these sampled features with an adaptive MLP-Mixer under the guidance of each query. Thanks to these two critical designs, AdaMixer enjoys architectural simplicity without requiring dense attentional encoders or explicit pyramid networks. On the challenging MS COCO benchmark, AdaMixer with ResNet-50 as the backbone, with 12 training epochs, reaches up to 45.0 AP on the validation set along with 27.9 APs in detecting small objects. With the longer training scheme, AdaMixer with ResNeXt-101-DCN and Swin-S reaches 49.5 and 51.3 AP. Our work sheds light on a simple, accurate, and fast converging architecture for query-based object detectors. The code is made available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/AdaMixer

- **Summary**: The goal of this work is to establish a scalable pipeline for expanding an object detector towards novel/unseen categories, using zero manual annotations. To achieve that, we make the following four contributions: (i) in pursuit of generalisation, we propose a two-stage open-vocabulary object detector, where the class-agnostic object proposals are classified with a text encoder from pre-trained visual-language model; (ii) To pair the visual latent space (of RPN box proposals) with that of the pre-trained text encoder, we propose the idea of regional prompt learning to align the textual embedding space with regional visual object features; (iii) To scale up the learning procedure towards detecting a wider spectrum of objects, we exploit the available online resource via a novel self-training framework, which allows to train the proposed detector on a large corpus of noisy uncurated web images. Lastly, (iv) to evaluate our proposed detector, termed as PromptDet, we conduct extensive experiments on the challenging LVIS and MS-COCO dataset. PromptDet shows superior performance over existing approaches with fewer additional training images and zero manual annotations whatsoever.

- **Summary**: We introduce the first end-to-end learning-based solution to near-field Photometric Stereo (PS), where the light sources are close to the object of interest. This setup is especially useful for reconstructing large immobile objects. Our method is fast, producing a mesh from 52 512$\times$384 resolution images in about 1 second on a commodity GPU, thus potentially unlocking several AR/VR applications. Existing approaches rely on optimization coupled with a far-field PS network operating on pixels or small patches. Using optimization makes these approaches slow and memory intensive (requiring 17GB GPU and 27GB of CPU memory) while using only pixels or patches makes them highly susceptible to noise and calibration errors. To address these issues, we develop a recursive multi-resolution scheme to estimate surface normal and depth maps of the whole image at each step. The predicted depth map at each scale is then used to estimate `per-pixel lighting' for the next scale. This design makes our approach almost 45$\times$ faster and 2$^{\circ}$ more accurate (11.3$^{\circ}$ vs. 13.3$^{\circ}$ Mean Angular Error) than the state-of-the-art near-field PS reconstruction technique, which uses iterative optimization.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recent progress towards learning from limited supervision has encouraged efforts towards designing models that can recognize novel classes at test time (generalized zero-shot learning or GZSL). GZSL approaches assume knowledge of all classes, with or without labeled data, beforehand. However, practical scenarios demand models that are adaptable and can handle dynamic addition of new seen and unseen classes on the fly (that is continual generalized zero-shot learning or CGZSL). One solution is to sequentially retrain and reuse conventional GZSL methods, however, such an approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting leading to suboptimal generalization performance. A few recent efforts towards tackling CGZSL have been limited by difference in settings, practicality, data splits and protocols followed-inhibiting fair comparison and a clear direction forward. Motivated from these observations, in this work, we firstly consolidate the different CGZSL setting variants and propose a new Online-CGZSL setting which is more practical and flexible. Secondly, we introduce a unified feature-generative framework for CGZSL that leverages bi-directional incremental alignment to dynamically adapt to addition of new classes, with or without labeled data, that arrive over time in any of these CGZSL settings. Our comprehensive experiments and analysis on five benchmark datasets and comparison with baselines show that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods, especially on the more practical Online setting.

- **Summary**: Grounded situation recognition is the task of predicting the main activity, entities playing certain roles within the activity, and bounding-box groundings of the entities in the given image. To effectively deal with this challenging task, we introduce a novel approach where the two processes for activity classification and entity estimation are interactive and complementary. To implement this idea, we propose Collaborative Glance-Gaze TransFormer (CoFormer) that consists of two modules: Glance transformer for activity classification and Gaze transformer for entity estimation. Glance transformer predicts the main activity with the help of Gaze transformer that analyzes entities and their relations, while Gaze transformer estimates the grounded entities by focusing only on the entities relevant to the activity predicted by Glance transformer. Our CoFormer achieves the state of the art in all evaluation metrics on the SWiG dataset. Training code and model weights are available at https://github.com/jhcho99/CoFormer.

- **Summary**: Recent advances show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize images with smooth variations along semantically meaningful latent directions, such as pose, expression, layout, etc. While this indicates that GANs implicitly learn pixel-level correspondences across images, few studies explored how to extract them explicitly. In this work, we introduce Coordinate GAN (CoordGAN), a structure-texture disentangled GAN that learns a dense correspondence map for each generated image. We represent the correspondence maps of different images as warped coordinate frames transformed from a canonical coordinate frame, i.e., the correspondence map, which describes the structure (e.g., the shape of a face), is controlled via a transformation. Hence, finding correspondences boils down to locating the same coordinate in different correspondence maps. In CoordGAN, we sample a transformation to represent the structure of a synthesized instance, while an independent texture branch is responsible for rendering appearance details orthogonal to the structure. Our approach can also extract dense correspondence maps for real images by adding an encoder on top of the generator. We quantitatively demonstrate the quality of the learned dense correspondences through segmentation mask transfer on multiple datasets. We also show that the proposed generator achieves better structure and texture disentanglement compared to existing approaches. Project page: https://jitengmu.github.io/CoordGAN/

- **Summary**: We explore the plain, non-hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone network for object detection. This design enables the original ViT architecture to be fine-tuned for object detection without needing to redesign a hierarchical backbone for pre-training. With minimal adaptations for fine-tuning, our plain-backbone detector can achieve competitive results. Surprisingly, we observe: (i) it is sufficient to build a simple feature pyramid from a single-scale feature map (without the common FPN design) and (ii) it is sufficient to use window attention (without shifting) aided with very few cross-window propagation blocks. With plain ViT backbones pre-trained as Masked Autoencoders (MAE), our detector, named ViTDet, can compete with the previous leading methods that were all based on hierarchical backbones, reaching up to 61.3 AP_box on the COCO dataset using only ImageNet-1K pre-training. We hope our study will draw attention to research on plain-backbone detectors. Code for ViTDet is available in Detectron2.

- **Summary**: While neural representations for static 3D shapes are widely studied, representations for deformable surfaces are limited to be template-dependent or lack efficiency. We introduce Canonical Deformation Coordinate Space (CaDeX), a unified representation of both shape and nonrigid motion. Our key insight is the factorization of the deformation between frames by continuous bijective canonical maps (homeomorphisms) and their inverses that go through a learned canonical shape. Our novel deformation representation and its implementation are simple, efficient, and guarantee cycle consistency, topology preservation, and, if needed, volume conservation. Our modelling of the learned canonical shapes provides a flexible and stable space for shape prior learning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in modelling a wide range of deformable geometries: human bodies, animal bodies, and articulated objects.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a test-time adaptation method for cross-domain image segmentation. Our method is simple: Given a new unseen instance at test time, we adapt a pre-trained model by conducting instance-specific BatchNorm (statistics) calibration. Our approach has two core components. First, we replace the manually designed BatchNorm calibration rule with a learnable module. Second, we leverage strong data augmentation to simulate random domain shifts for learning the calibration rule. In contrast to existing domain adaptation methods, our method does not require accessing the target domain data at training time or conducting computationally expensive test-time model training/optimization. Equipping our method with models trained by standard recipes achieves significant improvement, comparing favorably with several state-of-the-art domain generalization and one-shot unsupervised domain adaptation approaches. Combining our method with the domain generalization methods further improves performance, reaching a new state of the art.

- **Summary**: We propose to investigate detecting and characterizing the 3D planar articulation of objects from ordinary videos. While seemingly easy for humans, this problem poses many challenges for computers. We propose to approach this problem by combining a top-down detection system that finds planes that can be articulated along with an optimization approach that solves for a 3D plane that can explain a sequence of observed articulations. We show that this system can be trained on a combination of videos and 3D scan datasets. When tested on a dataset of challenging Internet videos and the Charades dataset, our approach obtains strong performance. Project site: https://jasonqsy.github.io/Articulation3D

- **Summary**: This paper aims to address the problem of pre-training for person re-identification (Re-ID) with noisy labels. To setup the pre-training task, we apply a simple online multi-object tracking system on raw videos of an existing unlabeled Re-ID dataset "LUPerson" nd build the Noisy Labeled variant called "LUPerson-NL". Since theses ID labels automatically derived from tracklets inevitably contain noises, we develop a large-scale Pre-training framework utilizing Noisy Labels (PNL), which consists of three learning modules: supervised Re-ID learning, prototype-based contrastive learning, and label-guided contrastive learning. In principle, joint learning of these three modules not only clusters similar examples to one prototype, but also rectifies noisy labels based on the prototype assignment. We demonstrate that learning directly from raw videos is a promising alternative for pre-training, which utilizes spatial and temporal correlations as weak supervision. This simple pre-training task provides a scalable way to learn SOTA Re-ID representations from scratch on "LUPerson-NL" without bells and whistles. For example, by applying on the same supervised Re-ID method MGN, our pre-trained model improves the mAP over the unsupervised pre-training counterpart by 5.7%, 2.2%, 2.3% on CUHK03, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17 respectively. Under the small-scale or few-shot setting, the performance gain is even more significant, suggesting a better transferability of the learned representation.

- **Summary**: Light field applications, especially light field rendering and depth estimation, developed rapidly in recent years. While state-of-the-art light field rendering methods handle semi-transparent and reflective objects well, depth estimation methods either ignore these cases altogether or only deliver a weak performance. We argue that this is due current methods only considering a single "true" depth, even when multiple objects at different depths contributed to the color of a single pixel. Based on the simple idea of outputting a posterior depth distribution instead of only a single estimate, we develop and explore several different deep-learning-based approaches to the problem. Additionally, we contribute the first "multimodal light field depth dataset" that contains the depths of all objects which contribute to the color of a pixel. This allows us to supervise the multimodal depth prediction and also validate all methods by measuring the KL divergence of the predicted posteriors. With our thorough analysis and novel dataset, we aim to start a new line of depth estimation research that overcomes some of the long-standing limitations of this field.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning-based medical image segmentation studies achieve nearly human-level performance when in fully supervised condition. However, acquiring pixel-level expert annotations is extremely expensive and laborious in medical imaging fields. Unsupervised domain adaptation can alleviate this problem, which makes it possible to use annotated data in one imaging modality to train a network that can successfully perform segmentation on target imaging modality with no labels. In this work, we propose a self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 3D medical image segmentation named COSMOS and validate it with automatic segmentation of Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea on high-resolution T2 Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). Our target-aware contrast conversion network translates source domain annotated T1 MRI to pseudo T2 MRI to enable segmentation training on target domain, while preserving important anatomical features of interest in the converted images. Iterative self-training is followed to incorporate unlabeled data to training and incrementally improve the quality of pseudo-labels, thereby leading to improved performance of segmentation. COSMOS won the 1\textsuperscript{st} place in the Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge held in conjunction with the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2021). It achieves mean Dice score and Average Symmetric Surface Distance of 0.871(0.063) and 0.437(0.270) for VS, and 0.842(0.020) and 0.152(0.030) for cochlea.

- **Summary**: Since the rise of vision-language navigation (VLN), great progress has been made in instruction following -- building a follower to navigate environments under the guidance of instructions. However, far less attention has been paid to the inverse task: instruction generation -- learning a speaker~to generate grounded descriptions for navigation routes. Existing VLN methods train a speaker independently and often treat it as a data augmentation tool to strengthen the follower while ignoring rich cross-task relations. Here we describe an approach that learns the two tasks simultaneously and exploits their intrinsic correlations to boost the training of each: the follower judges whether the speaker-created instruction explains the original navigation route correctly, and vice versa. Without the need of aligned instruction-path pairs, such cycle-consistent learning scheme is complementary to task-specific training targets defined on labeled data, and can also be applied over unlabeled paths (sampled without paired instructions). Another agent, called~creator is added to generate counterfactual environments. It greatly changes current scenes yet leaves novel items -- which are vital for the execution of original instructions -- unchanged. Thus more informative training scenes are synthesized and the three agents compose a powerful VLN learning system. Extensive experiments on a standard benchmark show that our approach improves the performance of various follower models and produces accurate navigation instructions.

- **Summary**: Continually learning new classes from fresh data without forgetting previous knowledge of old classes is a very challenging research problem. Moreover, it is imperative that such learning must respect certain memory and computational constraints such as (i) training samples are limited to only a few per class, (ii) the computational cost of learning a novel class remains constant, and (iii) the memory footprint of the model grows at most linearly with the number of classes observed. To meet the above constraints, we propose C-FSCIL, which is architecturally composed of a frozen meta-learned feature extractor, a trainable fixed-size fully connected layer, and a rewritable dynamically growing memory that stores as many vectors as the number of encountered classes. C-FSCIL provides three update modes that offer a trade-off between accuracy and compute-memory cost of learning novel classes. C-FSCIL exploits hyperdimensional embedding that allows to continually express many more classes than the fixed dimensions in the vector space, with minimal interference. The quality of class vector representations is further improved by aligning them quasi-orthogonally to each other by means of novel loss functions. Experiments on the CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and Omniglot datasets show that C-FSCIL outperforms the baselines with remarkable accuracy and compression. It also scales up to the largest problem size ever tried in this few-shot setting by learning 423 novel classes on top of 1200 base classes with less than 1.6% accuracy drop.

- **Summary**: Entity recognition is a fundamental task in understanding document images. Traditional sequence labeling frameworks treat the entity types as class IDs and rely on extensive data and high-quality annotations to learn semantics which are typically expensive in practice. In this paper, we aim to build an entity recognition model requiring only a few shots of annotated document images. To overcome the data limitation, we propose to leverage the label surface names to better inform the model of the target entity type semantics and also embed the labels into the spatial embedding space to capture the spatial correspondence between regions and labels. Specifically, we go beyond sequence labeling and develop a novel label-aware seq2seq framework, LASER. The proposed model follows a new labeling scheme that generates the label surface names word-by-word explicitly after generating the entities. During training, LASER refines the label semantics by updating the label surface name representations and also strengthens the label-region correlation. In this way, LASER recognizes the entities from document images through both semantic and layout correspondence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of LASER under the few-shot setting.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel approach aimed at object and semantic scene completion from a partial scan represented as a 3D point cloud. Our architecture relies on three novel layers that are used successively within an encoder-decoder structure and specifically developed for the task at hand. The first one carries out feature extraction by matching the point features to a set of pre-trained local descriptors. Then, to avoid losing individual descriptors as part of standard operations such as max-pooling, we propose an alternative neighbor-pooling operation that relies on adopting the feature vectors with the highest activations. Finally, up-sampling in the decoder modifies our feature extraction in order to increase the output dimension. While this model is already able to achieve competitive results with the state of the art, we further propose a way to increase the versatility of our approach to process point clouds. To this aim, we introduce a second model that assembles our layers within a transformer architecture. We evaluate both architectures on object and indoor scene completion tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Lung cancer screening (LCS) using annual low-dose computed tomography (CT) scanning has been proven to significantly reduce lung cancer mortality by detecting cancerous lung nodules at an earlier stage. Improving risk stratification of malignancy risk in lung nodules can be enhanced using machine/deep learning algorithms. However most existing algorithms: a) have primarily assessed single time-point CT data alone thereby failing to utilize the inherent advantages contained within longitudinal imaging datasets; b) have not integrated into computer models pertinent clinical data that might inform risk prediction; c) have not assessed algorithm performance on the spectrum of nodules that are most challenging for radiologists to interpret and where assistance from analytic tools would be most beneficial.   Here we show the performance of our time-series deep learning model (DeepCAD-NLM-L) which integrates multi-model information across three longitudinal data domains: nodule-specific, lung-specific, and clinical demographic data. We compared our time-series deep learning model to a) radiologist performance on CTs from the National Lung Screening Trial enriched with the most challenging nodules for diagnosis; b) a nodule management algorithm from a North London LCS study (SUMMIT). Our model demonstrated comparable and complementary performance to radiologists when interpreting challenging lung nodules and showed improved performance (AUC=88\%) against models utilizing single time-point data only. The results emphasise the importance of time-series, multi-modal analysis when interpreting malignancy risk in LCS.

- **Summary**: Knowledge-based entity prediction (KEP) is a novel task that aims to improve machine perception in autonomous systems. KEP leverages relational knowledge from heterogeneous sources in predicting potentially unrecognized entities. In this paper, we provide a formal definition of KEP as a knowledge completion task. Three potential solutions are then introduced, which employ several machine learning and data mining techniques. Finally, the applicability of KEP is demonstrated on two autonomous systems from different domains; namely, autonomous driving and smart manufacturing. We argue that in complex real-world systems, the use of KEP would significantly improve machine perception while pushing the current technology one step closer to achieving full autonomy.

- **Summary**: We introduce Dessurt, a relatively simple document understanding transformer capable of being fine-tuned on a greater variety of document tasks than prior methods. It receives a document image and task string as input and generates arbitrary text autoregressively as output. Because Dessurt is an end-to-end architecture that performs text recognition in addition to the document understanding, it does not require an external recognition model as prior methods do. Dessurt is a more flexible model than prior methods and is able to handle a variety of document domains and tasks. We show that this model is effective at 9 different dataset-task combinations.

- **Summary**: Multi-object Tracking (MOT) generally can be split into two sub-tasks, i.e., detection and association. Many previous methods follow the tracking by detection paradigm, which first obtain detections at each frame and then associate them between adjacent frames. Though with an impressive performance by utilizing a strong detector, it will degrade their detection and association performance under scenes with many occlusions and large motion if not using temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel Reference Search (RS) module to provide a more reliable association based on the deformable transformer structure, which is natural to learn the feature alignment for each object among frames. RS takes previous detected results as references to aggregate the corresponding features from the combined features of the adjacent frames and makes a one-to-one track state prediction for each reference in parallel. Therefore, RS can attain a reliable association coping with unexpected motions by leveraging visual temporal features while maintaining the strong detection performance by decoupling from the detector. Our RS module can also be compatible with the structure of the other tracking by detection frameworks. Furthermore, we propose a joint training strategy and an effective matching pipeline for our online MOT framework with the RS module. Our method achieves competitive results on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets.

- **Summary**: We evaluate the performance of federated learning (FL) in developing deep learning models for analysis of digitized tissue sections. A classification application was considered as the example use case, on quantifiying the distribution of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes within whole slide images (WSIs). A deep learning classification model was trained using 50*50 square micron patches extracted from the WSIs. We simulated a FL environment in which a dataset, generated from WSIs of cancer from numerous anatomical sites available by The Cancer Genome Atlas repository, is partitioned in 8 different nodes. Our results show that the model trained with the federated training approach achieves similar performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to that of a model trained with all the training data pooled at a centralized location. Our study shows that FL has tremendous potential for enabling development of more robust and accurate models for histopathology image analysis without having to collect large and diverse training data at a single location.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the field of implicit neural representation has progressed significantly. Models such as neural radiance fields (NeRF), which uses relatively small neural networks, can represent high-quality scenes and achieve state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. Training these types of networks, however, is still computationally very expensive. We present depth distribution neural radiance field (DDNeRF), a new method that significantly increases sampling efficiency along rays during training while achieving superior results for a given sampling budget. DDNeRF achieves this by learning a more accurate representation of the density distribution along rays. More specifically, we train a coarse model to predict the internal distribution of the transparency of an input volume in addition to the volume's total density. This finer distribution then guides the sampling procedure of the fine model. This method allows us to use fewer samples during training while reducing computational resources.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on self-supervised video representation learning. Most existing approaches follow the contrastive learning pipeline to construct positive and negative pairs by sampling different clips. However, this formulation tends to bias to static background and have difficulty establishing global temporal structures. The major reason is that the positive pairs, i.e., different clips sampled from the same video, have limited temporal receptive field, and usually share similar background but differ in motions. To address these problems, we propose a framework to jointly utilize local clips and global videos to learn from detailed region-level correspondence as well as general long-term temporal relations. Based on a set of controllable augmentations, we achieve accurate appearance and motion pattern alignment through soft spatio-temporal region contrast. Our formulation is able to avoid the low-level redundancy shortcut by mutual information minimization to improve the generalization. We also introduce local-global temporal order dependency to further bridge the gap between clip-level and video-level representations for robust temporal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior on three video benchmarks in action recognition and video retrieval, capturing more accurate temporal dynamics.

- **Summary**: Ball 3D localization in team sports has various applications including automatic offside detection in soccer, or shot release localization in basketball. Today, this task is either resolved by using expensive multi-views setups, or by restricting the analysis to ballistic trajectories. In this work, we propose to address the task on a single image from a calibrated monocular camera by estimating ball diameter in pixels and use the knowledge of real ball diameter in meters. This approach is suitable for any game situation where the ball is (even partly) visible. To achieve this, we use a small neural network trained on image patches around candidates generated by a conventional ball detector. Besides predicting ball diameter, our network outputs the confidence of having a ball in the image patch. Validations on 3 basketball datasets reveals that our model gives remarkable predictions on ball 3D localization. In addition, through its confidence output, our model improves the detection rate by filtering the candidates produced by the detector. The contributions of this work are (i) the first model to address 3D ball localization on a single image, (ii) an effective method for ball 3D annotation from single calibrated images, (iii) a high quality 3D ball evaluation dataset annotated from a single viewpoint.

- **Summary**: We present a meta-learning framework for learning new visual concepts quickly, from just one or a few examples, guided by multiple naturally occurring data streams: simultaneously looking at images, reading sentences that describe the objects in the scene, and interpreting supplemental sentences that relate the novel concept with other concepts. The learned concepts support downstream applications, such as answering questions by reasoning about unseen images. Our model, namely FALCON, represents individual visual concepts, such as colors and shapes, as axis-aligned boxes in a high-dimensional space (the "box embedding space"). Given an input image and its paired sentence, our model first resolves the referential expression in the sentence and associates the novel concept with particular objects in the scene. Next, our model interprets supplemental sentences to relate the novel concept with other known concepts, such as "X has property Y" or "X is a kind of Y". Finally, it infers an optimal box embedding for the novel concept that jointly 1) maximizes the likelihood of the observed instances in the image, and 2) satisfies the relationships between the novel concepts and the known ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: In Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), the objective is to match faces across two different domains such as visible and thermal. Large domain discrepancy makes HFR a difficult problem. Recent methods attempting to fill the gap via synthesis have achieved promising results, but their performance is still limited by the scarcity of paired training data. In practice, large-scale heterogeneous face data are often inaccessible due to the high cost of acquisition and annotation process as well as privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose a new face hallucination paradigm for HFR, which not only enables data-efficient synthesis but also allows to scale up model training without breaking any privacy policy. Unlike existing methods that learn face synthesis entirely from scratch, our approach is particularly designed to take advantage of rich and diverse facial priors from visible domain for more faithful hallucination. On the other hand, large-scale training is enabled by introducing a new federated learning scheme to allow institution-wise collaborations while avoiding explicit data sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach in tackling HFR under current data limitations. In a unified framework, our method yields the state-of-the-art hallucination results on multiple HFR datasets.

- **Summary**: Intrinsic image decomposition is the process of recovering the image formation components (reflectance and shading) from an image. Previous methods employ either explicit priors to constrain the problem or implicit constraints as formulated by their losses (deep learning). These methods can be negatively influenced by strong illumination conditions causing shading-reflectance leakages.   Therefore, in this paper, an end-to-end edge-driven hybrid CNN approach is proposed for intrinsic image decomposition. Edges correspond to illumination invariant gradients. To handle hard negative illumination transitions, a hierarchical approach is taken including global and local refinement layers. We make use of attention layers to further strengthen the learning process.   An extensive ablation study and large scale experiments are conducted showing that it is beneficial for edge-driven hybrid IID networks to make use of illumination invariant descriptors and that separating global and local cues helps in improving the performance of the network. Finally, it is shown that the proposed method obtains state of the art performance and is able to generalise well to real world images.

- **Summary**: Recent studies on the automatic detection of facial action unit (AU) have extensively relied on large-sized annotations. However, manually AU labeling is difficult, time-consuming, and costly. Most existing semi-supervised works ignore the informative cues from the temporal domain, and are highly dependent on densely annotated videos, making the learning process less efficient. To alleviate these problems, we propose a deep semi-supervised framework Knowledge-Spreader (KS), which differs from conventional methods in two aspects. First, rather than only encoding human knowledge as constraints, KS also learns the Spatial-Temporal AU correlation knowledge in order to strengthen its out-of-distribution generalization ability. Second, we approach KS by applying consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling in multiple student networks alternately and dynamically. It spreads the spatial knowledge from labeled frames to unlabeled data, and completes the temporal information of partially labeled video clips. Thus, the design allows KS to learn AU dynamics from video clips with only one label allocated, which significantly reduce the requirements of using annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed KS achieves competitive performance as compared to the state of the arts under the circumstances of using only 2% labels on BP4D and 5% labels on DISFA. In addition, we test it on our newly developed large-scale comprehensive emotion database, which contains considerable samples across well-synchronized and aligned sensor modalities for easing the scarcity issue of annotations and identities in human affective computing. The new database will be released to the research community.

- **Summary**: We introduce HyperMorph, a framework that facilitates efficient hyperparameter tuning in learning-based deformable image registration. Classical registration algorithms perform an iterative pair-wise optimization to compute a deformation field that aligns two images. Recent learning-based approaches leverage large image datasets to learn a function that rapidly estimates a deformation for a given image pair. In both strategies, the accuracy of the resulting spatial correspondences is strongly influenced by the choice of certain hyperparameter values. However, an effective hyperparameter search consumes substantial time and human effort as it often involves training multiple models for different fixed hyperparameter values and may lead to suboptimal registration. We propose an amortized hyperparameter learning strategy to alleviate this burden by learning the impact of hyperparameters on deformation fields. We design a meta network, or hypernetwork, that predicts the parameters of a registration network for input hyperparameters, thereby comprising a single model that generates the optimal deformation field corresponding to given hyperparameter values. This strategy enables fast, high-resolution hyperparameter search at test-time, reducing the inefficiency of traditional approaches while increasing flexibility. We also demonstrate additional benefits of HyperMorph, including enhanced robustness to model initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter values specific to a dataset, image contrast, task, or even anatomical region, all without the need to retrain models. We make our code publicly available at http://hypermorph.voxelmorph.net.

- **Summary**: Most face relighting methods are able to handle diffuse shadows, but struggle to handle hard shadows, such as those cast by the nose. Methods that propose techniques for handling hard shadows often do not produce geometrically consistent shadows since they do not directly leverage the estimated face geometry while synthesizing them. We propose a novel differentiable algorithm for synthesizing hard shadows based on ray tracing, which we incorporate into training our face relighting model. Our proposed algorithm directly utilizes the estimated face geometry to synthesize geometrically consistent hard shadows. We demonstrate through quantitative and qualitative experiments on Multi-PIE and FFHQ that our method produces more geometrically consistent shadows than previous face relighting methods while also achieving state-of-the-art face relighting performance under directional lighting. In addition, we demonstrate that our differentiable hard shadow modeling improves the quality of the estimated face geometry over diffuse shading models.

- **Summary**: We present a debiased dataset for the Person-centric Visual Grounding (PCVG) task first proposed by Cui et al. (2021) in the Who's Waldo dataset. Given an image and a caption, PCVG requires pairing up a person's name mentioned in a caption with a bounding box that points to the person in the image. We find that the original Who's Waldo dataset compiled for this task contains a large number of biased samples that are solvable simply by heuristic methods; for instance, in many cases the first name in the sentence corresponds to the largest bounding box, or the sequence of names in the sentence corresponds to an exact left-to-right order in the image. Naturally, models trained on these biased data lead to over-estimation of performance on the benchmark. To enforce models being correct for the correct reasons, we design automated tools to filter and debias the original dataset by ruling out all examples of insufficient context, such as those with no verb or with a long chain of conjunct names in their captions. Our experiments show that our new sub-sampled dataset contains less bias with much lowered heuristic performances and widened gaps between heuristic and supervised methods. We also demonstrate the same benchmark model trained on our debiased training set outperforms that trained on the original biased (and larger) training set on our debiased test set. We argue our debiased dataset offers the PCVG task a more practical baseline for reliable benchmarking and future improvements.

- **Summary**: Adapting pre-trained models with broad capabilities has become standard practice for learning a wide range of downstream tasks. The typical approach of fine-tuning different models for each task is performant, but incurs a substantial memory cost. To efficiently learn multiple downstream tasks we introduce Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing (TAPS), a general method for tuning a base model to a new task by adaptively modifying a small, task-specific subset of layers. This enables multi-task learning while minimizing resources used and competition between tasks. TAPS solves a joint optimization problem which determines which layers to share with the base model and the value of the task-specific weights. Further, a sparsity penalty on the number of active layers encourages weight sharing with the base model. Compared to other methods, TAPS retains high accuracy on downstream tasks while introducing few task-specific parameters. Moreover, TAPS is agnostic to the model architecture and requires only minor changes to the training scheme. We evaluate our method on a suite of fine-tuning tasks and architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, ViT) and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being simple to implement.

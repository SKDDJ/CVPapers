- **Summary**: This paper presents a method for time-lapse 3D cell analysis. Specifically, we consider the problem of accurately localizing and quantitatively analyzing sub-cellular features, and for tracking individual cells from time-lapse 3D confocal cell image stacks. The heterogeneity of cells and the volume of multi-dimensional images presents a major challenge for fully automated analysis of morphogenesis and development of cells. This paper is motivated by the pavement cell growth process, and building a quantitative morphogenesis model. We propose a deep feature based segmentation method to accurately detect and label each cell region. An adjacency graph based method is used to extract sub-cellular features of the segmented cells. Finally, the robust graph based tracking algorithm using multiple cell features is proposed for associating cells at different time instances. Extensive experiment results are provided and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. The code is available on Github and the method is available as a service through the BisQue portal.

- **Summary**: The goal of Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification (CDFSC) is to accurately classify a target dataset with limited labelled data by exploiting the knowledge of a richly labelled auxiliary dataset, despite the differences between the domains of the two datasets. Some existing approaches require labelled samples from multiple domains for model training. However, these methods fail when the sample labels are scarce. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a solution that makes use of multiple source domains without the need for additional labeling costs. Specifically, one of the source domains is completely tagged, while the others are untagged. An Inter-Source Stylization Network (ISSNet) is then introduced to enhance stylisation across multiple source domains, enriching data distribution and model's generalization capabilities. Experiments on 8 target datasets show that ISSNet leverages unlabelled data from multiple source data and significantly reduces the negative impact of domain gaps on classification performance compared to several baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Conditional graphic layout generation, which generates realistic layouts according to user constraints, is a challenging task that has not been well-studied yet. First, there is limited discussion about how to handle diverse user constraints flexibly and uniformly. Second, to make the layouts conform to user constraints, existing work often sacrifices generation quality significantly. In this work, we propose LayoutFormer++ to tackle the above problems. First, to flexibly handle diverse constraints, we propose a constraint serialization scheme, which represents different user constraints as sequences of tokens with a predefined format. Then, we formulate conditional layout generation as a sequence-to-sequence transformation, and leverage encoder-decoder framework with Transformer as the basic architecture. Furthermore, to make the layout better meet user requirements without harming quality, we propose a decoding space restriction strategy. Specifically, we prune the predicted distribution by ignoring the options that definitely violate user constraints and likely result in low-quality layouts, and make the model samples from the restricted distribution. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutFormer++ outperforms existing approaches on all the tasks in terms of both better generation quality and less constraint violation.

- **Summary**: 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is a key problem for autonomous vehicles, required to perform well-informed motion planning in dynamic environments. Particularly for densely occupied scenes, associating existing tracks to new detections remains challenging as existing systems tend to omit critical contextual information. Our proposed solution, InterTrack, introduces the Interaction Transformer for 3D MOT to generate discriminative object representations for data association. We extract state and shape features for each track and detection, and efficiently aggregate global information via attention. We then perform a learned regression on each track/detection feature pair to estimate affinities, and use a robust two-stage data association and track management approach to produce the final tracks. We validate our approach on the nuScenes 3D MOT benchmark, where we observe significant improvements, particularly on classes with small physical sizes and clustered objects. As of submission, InterTrack ranks 1st in overall AMOTA among methods using CenterPoint detections.

- **Summary**: Analysis of overhead imagery using computer vision is a problem that has received considerable attention in academic literature. Most techniques that operate in this space are both highly specialised and require expensive manual annotation of large datasets. These problems are addressed here through the development of a more generic framework, incorporating advances in representation learning which allows for more flexibility in analysing new categories of imagery with limited labeled data. First, a robust representation of an unlabeled aerial imagery dataset was created based on the momentum contrast mechanism. This was subsequently specialised for different tasks by building accurate classifiers with as few as 200 labeled images. The successful low-level detection of urban infrastructure evolution over a 10-year period from 60 million unlabeled images, exemplifies the substantial potential of our approach to advance quantitative urban research.

- **Summary**: It is a long-standing challenge to reconstruct Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) of the lung under respiratory motion. This work takes a step further to address a challenging setting in reconstructing a multi-phase}4D lung image from just a single}3D CBCT acquisition. To this end, we introduce REpiratory-GAted Synthesis of views, or REGAS. REGAS proposes a self-supervised method to synthesize the undersampled tomographic views and mitigate aliasing artifacts in reconstructed images. This method allows a much better estimation of between-phase Deformation Vector Fields (DVFs), which are used to enhance reconstruction quality from direct observations without synthesis. To address the large memory cost of deep neural networks on high resolution 4D data, REGAS introduces a novel Ray Path Transformation (RPT) that allows for distributed, differentiable forward projections. REGAS require no additional measurements like prior scans, air-flow volume, or breathing velocity. Our extensive experiments show that REGAS significantly outperforms comparable methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality.

- **Summary**: We present Progressively Deblurring Radiance Field (PDRF), a novel approach to efficiently reconstruct high quality radiance fields from blurry images. While current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) scene reconstruction methods achieve photo-realistic rendering results from clean source views, their performances suffer when the source views are affected by blur, which is commonly observed for images in the wild. Previous deblurring methods either do not account for 3D geometry, or are computationally intense. To addresses these issues, PDRF, a progressively deblurring scheme in radiance field modeling, accurately models blur by incorporating 3D scene context. PDRF further uses an efficient importance sampling scheme, which results in fast scene optimization. Specifically, PDRF proposes a Coarse Ray Renderer to quickly estimate voxel density and feature; a Fine Voxel Renderer is then used to achieve high quality ray tracing. We perform extensive experiments and show that PDRF is 15X faster than previous SoTA while achieving better performance on both synthetic and real scenes.



### Imperceptible and Robust Backdoor Attack in 3D Point Cloud

- **Summary**: With the thriving of deep learning in processing point cloud data, recent works show that backdoor attacks pose a severe security threat to 3D vision applications. The attacker injects the backdoor into the 3D model by poisoning a few training samples with trigger, such that the backdoored model performs well on clean samples but behaves maliciously when the trigger pattern appears. Existing attacks often insert some additional points into the point cloud as the trigger, or utilize a linear transformation (e.g., rotation) to construct the poisoned point cloud. However, the effects of these poisoned samples are likely to be weakened or even eliminated by some commonly used pre-processing techniques for 3D point cloud, e.g., outlier removal or rotation augmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel imperceptible and robust backdoor attack (IRBA) to tackle this challenge. We utilize a nonlinear and local transformation, called weighted local transformation (WLT), to construct poisoned samples with unique transformations. As there are several hyper-parameters and randomness in WLT, it is difficult to produce two similar transformations. Consequently, poisoned samples with unique transformations are likely to be resistant to aforementioned pre-processing techniques. Besides, as the controllability and smoothness of the distortion caused by a fixed WLT, the generated poisoned samples are also imperceptible to human inspection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four models show that IRBA achieves 80%+ ASR in most cases even with pre-processing techniques, which is significantly higher than previous state-of-the-art attacks.

- **Summary**: With the fast growth of immersive video sequences, achieving seamless and high-quality compressed 3D content is even more critical. MPEG recently developed a video-based point cloud compression (V-PCC) standard for dynamic point cloud coding. However, reconstructed point clouds using V-PCC suffer from different artifacts, including losing data during pre-processing before applying existing video coding techniques, e.g., High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Patch generations and self-occluded points in the 3D to the 2D projection are the main reasons for missing data using V-PCC. This paper proposes a new method that introduces overlapping slicing as an alternative to patch generation to decrease the number of patches generated and the amount of data lost. In the proposed method, the entire point cloud has been cross-sectioned into variable-sized slices based on the number of self-occluded points so that data loss can be minimized in the patch generation process and projection. For this, a variable number of layers are considered, partially overlapped to retain the self-occluded points. The proposed method's added advantage is to reduce the bits requirement and to encode geometric data using the slicing base position. The experimental results show that the proposed method is much more flexible than the standard V-PCC method, improves the rate-distortion performance, and decreases the data loss significantly compared to the standard V-PCC method.

- **Summary**: The idea of \textit{Virtual Try-ON} (VTON) benefits e-retailing by giving an user the convenience of trying a clothing at the comfort of their home. In general, most of the existing VTON methods produce inconsistent results when a person posing with his arms folded i.e., bent or crossed, wants to try an outfit. The problem becomes severe in the case of long-sleeved outfits. As then, for crossed arm postures, overlap among different clothing parts might happen. The existing approaches, especially the warping-based methods employing \textit{Thin Plate Spline (TPS)} transform can not tackle such cases. To this end, we attempt a solution approach where the clothing from the source person is segmented into semantically meaningful parts and each part is warped independently to the shape of the person. To address the bending issue, we employ hand-crafted geometric features consistent with human body geometry for warping the source outfit. In addition, we propose two learning-based modules: a synthesizer network and a mask prediction network. All these together attempt to produce a photo-realistic, pose-robust VTON solution without requiring any paired training data. Comparison with some of the benchmark methods clearly establishes the effectiveness of the approach.

- **Summary**: Cell instance segmentation is a new and challenging task aiming at joint detection and segmentation of every cell in an image. Recently, many instance segmentation methods have applied in this task. Despite their great success, there still exists two main weaknesses caused by uncertainty of localizing cell center points. First, densely packed cells can easily be recognized into one cell. Second, elongated cell can easily be recognized into two cells. To overcome these two weaknesses, we propose a novel cell instance segmentation network based on multi-scheme regression guidance. With multi-scheme regression guidance, the network has the ability to look each cell in different views. Specifically, we first propose a gaussian guidance attention mechanism to use gaussian labels for guiding the network's attention. We then propose a point-regression module for assisting the regression of cell center. Finally, we utilize the output of the above two modules to further guide the instance segmentation. With multi-scheme regression guidance, we can take full advantage of the characteristics of different regions, especially the central region of the cell. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, DSB2018, CA2.5 and SCIS. The encouraging results show that our network achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) performance. On the DSB2018 and CA2.5, our network surpasses previous methods by 1.2% (AP50). Particularly on SCIS dataset, our network performs stronger by large margin (3.0% higher AP50). Visualization and analysis further prove that our proposed method is interpretable.

- **Summary**: Lecture slide presentations, a sequence of pages that contain text and figures accompanied by speech, are constructed and presented carefully in order to optimally transfer knowledge to students. Previous studies in multimedia and psychology attribute the effectiveness of lecture presentations to their multimodal nature. As a step toward developing AI to aid in student learning as intelligent teacher assistants, we introduce the Multimodal Lecture Presentations dataset as a large-scale benchmark testing the capabilities of machine learning models in multimodal understanding of educational content. Our dataset contains aligned slides and spoken language, for 180+ hours of video and 9000+ slides, with 10 lecturers from various subjects (e.g., computer science, dentistry, biology). We introduce two research tasks which are designed as stepping stones towards AI agents that can explain (automatically captioning a lecture presentation) and illustrate (synthesizing visual figures to accompany spoken explanations) educational content. We provide manual annotations to help implement these two research tasks and evaluate state-of-the-art models on them. Comparing baselines and human student performances, we find that current models struggle in (1) weak crossmodal alignment between slides and spoken text, (2) learning novel visual mediums, (3) technical language, and (4) long-range sequences. Towards addressing this issue, we also introduce PolyViLT, a multimodal transformer trained with a multi-instance learning loss that is more effective than current approaches. We conclude by shedding light on the challenges and opportunities in multimodal understanding of educational presentations.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, in which DNNs are misled to false outputs due to inputs containing imperceptible perturbations. Adversarial training, a reliable and effective method of defense, may significantly reduce the vulnerability of neural networks and becomes the de facto standard for robust learning. While many recent works practice the data-centric philosophy, such as how to generate better adversarial examples or use generative models to produce additional training data, we look back to the models themselves and revisit the adversarial robustness from the perspective of deep feature distribution as an insightful complementarity. In this paper, we propose Branch Orthogonality adveRsarial Training (BORT) to obtain state-of-the-art performance with solely the original dataset for adversarial training. To practice our design idea of integrating multiple orthogonal solution spaces, we leverage a simple and straightforward multi-branch neural network that eclipses adversarial attacks with no increase in inference time. We heuristically propose a corresponding loss function, branch-orthogonal loss, to make each solution space of the multi-branch model orthogonal. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN against \ell_{\infty} norm-bounded perturbations of size \epsilon = 8/255, respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted to show that our method goes beyond all state-of-the-art methods without any tricks. Compared to all methods that do not use additional data for training, our models achieve 67.3% and 41.5% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (improving upon the state-of-the-art by +7.23% and +9.07%). We also outperform methods using a training set with a far larger scale than ours. All our models and codes are available online at https://github.com/huangd1999/BORT.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) in which weights and activations are both binarized into 1-bit values, thus greatly reducing the memory usage and computational complexity. Since the modern deep neural networks are of sophisticated design with complex architecture for the accuracy reason, the diversity on distributions of weights and activations is very high. Therefore, the conventional sign function cannot be well used for effectively binarizing full-precision values in BNNs. To this end, we present a simple yet effective approach called AdaBin to adaptively obtain the optimal binary sets $\{b_1, b_2\}$ ($b_1, b_2\in \mathbb{R}$) of weights and activations for each layer instead of a fixed set (\textit{i.e.}, $\{-1, +1\}$). In this way, the proposed method can better fit different distributions and increase the representation ability of binarized features. In practice, we use the center position and distance of 1-bit values to define a new binary quantization function. For the weights, we propose an equalization method to align the symmetrical center of binary distribution to real-valued distribution, and minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence of them. Meanwhile, we introduce a gradient-based optimization method to get these two parameters for activations, which are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on benchmark models and datasets demonstrate that the proposed AdaBin is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. For instance, we obtain a 66.4% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet using ResNet-18 architecture, and a 69.4 mAP on PASCAL VOC using SSD300. The PyTorch code is available at \url{https://github.com/huawei-noah/Efficient-Computing/tree/master/BinaryNetworks/AdaBin} and the MindSpore code is available at \url{https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/research/cv/AdaBin}.

- **Summary**: Resource allocation is one of the most critical issues in planning construction projects, due to its direct impact on cost, time, and quality. There are usually specific allocation methods for autonomous resource management according to the projects objectives. However, integrated planning and optimization of utilizing resources in an entire construction organization are scarce. The purpose of this study is to present an automatic resource allocation structure for construction companies based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which can be used in various situations. In this structure, Data Harvesting (DH) gathers resource information from the distributed Internet of Things (IoT) sensor devices all over the companys projects to be employed in the autonomous resource management approach. Then, Coverage Resources Allocation (CRA) is compared to the information obtained from DH in which the Autonomous Resource Management (ARM) determines the project of interest. Likewise, Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQNs) with similar models are trained on two distinct assignment situations based on structured resource information of the company to balance objectives with resource constraints. The suggested technique in this paper can efficiently adjust to large resource management systems by combining portfolio information with adopted individual project information. Also, the effects of important information processing parameters on resource allocation performance are analyzed in detail. Moreover, the results of the generalizability of management approaches are presented, indicating no need for additional training when the variables of situations change.

- **Summary**: Wearable sensor-based Human Action Recognition (HAR) has achieved remarkable success recently. However, the accuracy performance of wearable sensor-based HAR is still far behind the ones from the visual modalities-based system (i.e., RGB video, skeleton, and depth). Diverse input modalities can provide complementary cues and thus improve the accuracy performance of HAR, but how to take advantage of multi-modal data on wearable sensor-based HAR has rarely been explored. Currently, wearable devices, i.e., smartwatches, can only capture limited kinds of non-visual modality data. This hinders the multi-modal HAR association as it is unable to simultaneously use both visual and non-visual modality data. Another major challenge lies in how to efficiently utilize multimodal data on wearable devices with their limited computation resources. In this work, we propose a novel Progressive Skeleton-to-sensor Knowledge Distillation (PSKD) model which utilizes only time-series data, i.e., accelerometer data, from a smartwatch for solving the wearable sensor-based HAR problem. Specifically, we construct multiple teacher models using data from both teacher (human skeleton sequence) and student (time-series accelerometer data) modalities. In addition, we propose an effective progressive learning scheme to eliminate the performance gap between teacher and student models. We also designed a novel loss function called Adaptive-Confidence Semantic (ACS), to allow the student model to adaptively select either one of the teacher models or the ground-truth label it needs to mimic. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PSKD method, we conduct extensive experiments on Berkeley-MHAD, UTD-MHAD, and MMAct datasets. The results confirm that the proposed PSKD method has competitive performance compared to the previous mono sensor-based HAR methods.

However, the algorithms and datasets that exist for alertness monitoring are primarily aimed at younger adults (18-50 years old). We present a system for in-vehicle alertness monitoring for older adults. Through a design study, we ascertained the variables and parameters that are suitable for older adults traveling independently in Level 5 vehicles. We implemented a prototype traveler monitoring system and evaluated the alertness detection algorithm on ten older adults (70 years and older). We report on the system design and implementation at a level of detail that is suitable for the beginning researcher or practitioner. Our study suggests that dataset development is the foremost challenge for developing alertness monitoring systems targeted at older adults. This study is the first of its kind for a hitherto under-studied population and has implications for future work on algorithm development and system design through participatory methods.

- **Summary**: Controllable image synthesis with user scribbles is a topic of keen interest in the computer vision community. In this paper, for the first time we study the problem of photorealistic image synthesis from incomplete and primitive human paintings. In particular, we propose a novel approach paint2pix, which learns to predict (and adapt) "what a user wants to draw" from rudimentary brushstroke inputs, by learning a mapping from the manifold of incomplete human paintings to their realistic renderings. When used in conjunction with recent works in autonomous painting agents, we show that paint2pix can be used for progressive image synthesis from scratch. During this process, paint2pix allows a novice user to progressively synthesize the desired image output, while requiring just few coarse user scribbles to accurately steer the trajectory of the synthesis process. Furthermore, we find that our approach also forms a surprisingly convenient approach for real image editing, and allows the user to perform a diverse range of custom fine-grained edits through the addition of only a few well-placed brushstrokes.

- **Summary**: Attention mechanism has been used as an important component across Vision-and-Language(VL) tasks in order to bridge the semantic gap between visual and textual features. While attention has been widely used in VL tasks, it has not been examined the capability of different attention alignment calculation in bridging the semantic gap between visual and textual clues. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on understanding the role of attention alignment by looking into the attention score calculation methods and check how it actually represents the visual region's and textual token's significance for the global assessment. We also analyse the conditions which attention score calculation mechanism would be more (or less) interpretable, and which may impact the model performance on three different VL tasks, including visual question answering, text-to-image generation, text-and-image matching (both sentence and image retrieval). Our analysis is the first of its kind and provides useful insights of the importance of each attention alignment score calculation when applied at the training phase of VL tasks, commonly ignored in attention-based cross modal models, and/or pretrained models.

### Disentangling Identity and Pose for Facial Expression Recognition

- **Summary**: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging problem because the expression component is always entangled with other irrelevant factors, such as identity and head pose. In this work, we propose an identity and pose disentangled facial expression recognition (IPD-FER) model to learn more discriminative feature representation. We regard the holistic facial representation as the combination of identity, pose and expression. These three components are encoded with different encoders. For identity encoder, a well pre-trained face recognition model is utilized and fixed during training, which alleviates the restriction on specific expression training data in previous works and makes the disentanglement practicable on in-the-wild datasets. At the same time, the pose and expression encoder are optimized with corresponding labels. Combining identity and pose feature, a neutral face of input individual should be generated by the decoder. When expression feature is added, the input image should be reconstructed. By comparing the difference between synthesized neutral and expressional images of the same individual, the expression component is further disentangled from identity and pose. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method on both lab-controlled and in-the-wild databases and we achieve state-of-the-art recognition performance.

- **Summary**: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) in free-layout pages is a challenging image understanding task that can provide a relevant boost to the digitization of handwritten documents and reuse of their content. The task becomes even more challenging when dealing with historical documents due to the variability of the writing style and degradation of the page quality. State-of-the-art HTR approaches typically couple recurrent structures for sequence modeling with Convolutional Neural Networks for visual feature extraction. Since convolutional kernels are defined on fixed grids and focus on all input pixels independently while moving over the input image, this strategy disregards the fact that handwritten characters can vary in shape, scale, and orientation even within the same document and that the ink pixels are more relevant than the background ones. To cope with these specific HTR difficulties, we propose to adopt deformable convolutions, which can deform depending on the input at hand and better adapt to the geometric variations of the text. We design two deformable architectures and conduct extensive experiments on both modern and historical datasets. Experimental results confirm the suitability of deformable convolutions for the HTR task.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained representation is one of the key elements in the success of modern deep learning. However, existing works on continual learning methods have mostly focused on learning models incrementally from scratch. In this paper, we explore an alternative framework to incremental learning where we continually fine-tune the model from a pre-trained representation. Our method takes advantage of linearization technique of a pre-trained neural network for simple and effective continual learning. We show that this allows us to design a linear model where quadratic parameter regularization method is placed as the optimal continual learning policy, and at the same time enjoying the high performance of neural networks. We also show that the proposed algorithm enables parameter regularization methods to be applied to class-incremental problems. Additionally, we provide a theoretical reason why the existing parameter-space regularization algorithms such as EWC underperform on neural networks trained with cross-entropy loss. We show that the proposed method can prevent forgetting while achieving high continual fine-tuning performance on image classification tasks. To show that our method can be applied to general continual learning settings, we evaluate our method in data-incremental, task-incremental, and class-incremental learning problems.

- **Summary**: Road detection based on remote sensing images is of great significance to intelligent traffic management. The performances of the mainstream road detection methods are mainly determined by their extracted features, whose richness and robustness can be enhanced by fusing features of different types and cross-layer connections. However, the features in the existing mainstream model frameworks are often similar in the same layer by the single-task training, and the traditional cross-layer fusion ways are too simple to obtain an efficient effect, so more complex fusion ways besides concatenation and addition deserve to be explored. Aiming at the above defects, we propose a dual-task network (DTnet) for road detection and cross-layer graph fusion module (CGM): the DTnet consists of two parallel branches for road area and edge detection, respectively, while enhancing the feature diversity by fusing features between two branches through our designed feature bridge modules (FBM). The CGM improves the cross-layer fusion effect by a complex feature stream graph, and four graph patterns are evaluated. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method effectively improves the final detection result.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore an interesting question of what can be obtained from an $8\times8$ pixel video sequence. Surprisingly, it turns out to be quite a lot. We show that when we process this $8\times8$ video with the right set of audio and image priors, we can obtain a full-length, $256\times256$ video. We achieve this $32\times$ scaling of an extremely low-resolution input using our novel audio-visual upsampling network. The audio prior helps to recover the elemental facial details and precise lip shapes and a single high-resolution target identity image prior provides us with rich appearance details. Our approach is an end-to-end multi-stage framework. The first stage produces a coarse intermediate output video that can be then used to animate single target identity image and generate realistic, accurate and high-quality outputs. Our approach is simple and performs exceedingly well (an $8\times$ improvement in FID score) compared to previous super-resolution methods. We also extend our model to talking-face video compression, and show that we obtain a $3.5\times$ improvement in terms of bits/pixel over the previous state-of-the-art. The results from our network are thoroughly analyzed through extensive ablation experiments (in the paper and supplementary material). We also provide the demo video along with code and models on our website: \url{http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/talking-face-video-upsampling}.

- **Summary**: Meta-learning is an effective method to handle imbalanced and noisy-label learning, but it depends on a validation set containing randomly selected, manually labelled and balanced distributed samples. The random selection and manual labelling and balancing of this validation set is not only sub-optimal for meta-learning, but it also scales poorly with the number of classes. Hence, recent meta-learning papers have proposed ad-hoc heuristics to automatically build and label this validation set, but these heuristics are still sub-optimal for meta-learning. In this paper, we analyse the meta-learning algorithm and propose new criteria to characterise the utility of the validation set, based on: 1) the informativeness of the validation set; 2) the class distribution balance of the set; and 3) the correctness of the labels of the set. Furthermore, we propose a new imbalanced noisy-label meta-learning (INOLML) algorithm that automatically builds a validation set by maximising its utility using the criteria above. Our method shows significant improvements over previous meta-learning approaches and sets the new state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Stereo superpixel segmentation aims at grouping the discretizing pixels into perceptual regions through left and right views more collaboratively and efficiently. Existing superpixel segmentation algorithms mostly utilize color and spatial features as input, which may impose strong constraints on spatial information while utilizing the disparity information in terms of stereo image pairs. To alleviate this issue, we propose a stereo superpixel segmentation method with a decoupling mechanism of spatial information in this work. To decouple stereo disparity information and spatial information, the spatial information is temporarily removed before fusing the features of stereo image pairs, and a decoupled stereo fusion module (DSFM) is proposed to handle the stereo features alignment as well as occlusion problems. Moreover, since the spatial information is vital to superpixel segmentation, we further design a dynamic spatiality embedding module (DSEM) to re-add spatial information, and the weights of spatial information will be adaptively adjusted through the dynamic fusion (DF) mechanism in DSEM for achieving a finer segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI2015 and Cityscapes datasets, and also verify the efficiency when applied in salient object detection on NJU2K dataset. The source code will be available publicly after paper is accepted.

- **Summary**: In this work, a parameter-efficient attention module is presented for emotion classification using a limited, or relatively small, number of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This module is called the Monotonicity Constrained Attention Module (MCAM) due to its capability of incorporating priors on the monotonicity when converting features' Gram matrices into attention matrices for better feature refinement. Our experiments have shown that MCAM's effectiveness is comparable to state-of-the-art attention modules in boosting the backbone network's performance in prediction while requiring less parameters. Several accompanying sensitivity analyses on trained models' prediction concerning different attacks are also performed. These attacks include various frequency domain filtering levels and gradually morphing between samples associated with multiple labels. Our results can help better understand different modules' behaviour in prediction and can provide guidance in applications where data is limited and are with noises.

- **Summary**: In this work, a kernel attention module is presented for the task of EEG-based emotion classification with neural networks. The proposed module utilizes a self-attention mechanism by performing a kernel trick, demanding significantly fewer trainable parameters and computations than standard attention modules. The design also provides a scalar for quantitatively examining the amount of attention assigned during deep feature refinement, hence help better interpret a trained model. Using EEGNet as the backbone model, extensive experiments are conducted on the SEED dataset to assess the module's performance on within-subject classification tasks compared to other SOTA attention modules. Requiring only one extra parameter, the inserted module is shown to boost the base model's mean prediction accuracy up to more than 1\% across 15 subjects. A key component of the method is the interpretability of solutions, which is addressed using several different techniques, and is included throughout as part of the dependency analysis.

- **Summary**: Scene graph generation (SGG) is a fundamental task aimed at detecting visual relations between objects in an image. The prevailing SGG methods require all object classes to be given in the training set. Such a closed setting limits the practical application of SGG. In this paper, we introduce open-vocabulary scene graph generation, a novel, realistic and challenging setting in which a model is trained on a set of base object classes but is required to infer relations for unseen target object classes. To this end, we propose a two-step method that firstly pre-trains on large amounts of coarse-grained region-caption data and then leverages two prompt-based techniques to finetune the pre-trained model without updating its parameters. Moreover, our method can support inference over completely unseen object classes, which existing methods are incapable of handling. On extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, Visual Genome, GQA, and Open-Image, our method significantly outperforms recent, strong SGG methods on the setting of Ov-SGG, as well as on the conventional closed SGG.



### Data-Efficient Vision Transformers for Multi-Label Disease Classification on Chest Radiographs

- **Summary**: Radiographs are a versatile diagnostic tool for the detection and assessment of pathologies, for treatment planning or for navigation and localization purposes in clinical interventions. However, their interpretation and assessment by radiologists can be tedious and error-prone. Thus, a wide variety of deep learning methods have been proposed to support radiologists interpreting radiographs. Mostly, these approaches rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract features from images. Especially for the multi-label classification of pathologies on chest radiographs (Chest X-Rays, CXR), CNNs have proven to be well suited. On the Contrary, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have not been applied to this task despite their high classification performance on generic images and interpretable local saliency maps which could add value to clinical interventions. ViTs do not rely on convolutions but on patch-based self-attention and in contrast to CNNs, no prior knowledge of local connectivity is present. While this leads to increased capacity, ViTs typically require an excessive amount of training data which represents a hurdle in the medical domain as high costs are associated with collecting large medical data sets. In this work, we systematically compare the classification performance of ViTs and CNNs for different data set sizes and evaluate more data-efficient ViT variants (DeiT). Our results show that while the performance between ViTs and CNNs is on par with a small benefit for ViTs, DeiTs outperform the former if a reasonably large data set is available for training.

- **Summary**: With the recent development of Deep Learning applied to Computer Vision, sport video understanding has gained a lot of attention, providing much richer information for both sport consumers and leagues. This paper introduces DeepSportradar-v1, a suite of computer vision tasks, datasets and benchmarks for automated sport understanding. The main purpose of this framework is to close the gap between academic research and real world settings. To this end, the datasets provide high-resolution raw images, camera parameters and high quality annotations. DeepSportradar currently supports four challenging tasks related to basketball: ball 3D localization, camera calibration, player instance segmentation and player re-identification. For each of the four tasks, a detailed description of the dataset, objective, performance metrics, and the proposed baseline method are provided. To encourage further research on advanced methods for sport understanding, a competition is organized as part of the MMSports workshop from the ACM Multimedia 2022 conference, where participants have to develop state-of-the-art methods to solve the above tasks. The four datasets, development kits and baselines are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Vision-Transformers are widely used in various vision tasks. Meanwhile, there is another line of works starting with the MLP-mixer trying to achieve similar performance using mlp-based architectures. Interestingly, until now those mlp-based architectures have not been adapted for NLP tasks. Additionally, until now, mlp-based architectures have failed to achieve state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks. In this paper, we analyze the expressive power of mlp-based architectures in modeling dependencies between multiple different inputs simultaneously, and show an exponential gap between the attention and the mlp-based mechanisms. Our results suggest a theoretical explanation for the mlp inability to compete with attention-based mechanisms in NLP problems, they also suggest that the performance gap in vision tasks may be due to the mlp relative weakness in modeling dependencies between multiple different locations, and that combining smart input permutations with mlp architectures may not be enough to close the performance gap alone.

- **Summary**: The vast progress in synthetic image synthesis enables the generation of facial images in high resolution and photorealism. In biometric applications, the main motivation for using synthetic data is to solve the shortage of publicly-available biometric data while reducing privacy risks when processing such sensitive information. These advantages are exploited in this work by simulating human face ageing with recent face age modification algorithms to generate mated samples, thereby studying the impact of ageing on the performance of an open-source biometric recognition system. Further, a real dataset is used to evaluate the effects of short-term ageing, comparing the biometric performance to the synthetic domain. The main findings indicate that short-term ageing in the range of 1-5 years has only minor effects on the general recognition performance. However, the correct verification of mated faces with long-term age differences beyond 20 years poses still a significant challenge and requires further investigation.



### How does the degree of novelty impacts semi-supervised representation learning for novel class retrieval?

- **Summary**: Supervised representation learning with deep networks tends to overfit the training classes and the generalization to novel classes is a challenging question. It is common to evaluate a learned embedding on held-out images of the same training classes. In real applications however, data comes from new sources and novel classes are likely to arise. We hypothesize that incorporating unlabelled images of novel classes in the training set in a semi-supervised fashion would be beneficial for the efficient retrieval of novel-class images compared to a vanilla supervised representation. To verify this hypothesis in a comprehensive way, we propose an original evaluation methodology that varies the degree of novelty of novel classes by partitioning the dataset category-wise either randomly, or semantically, i.e. by minimizing the shared semantics between base and novel classes. This evaluation procedure allows to train a representation blindly to any novel-class labels and evaluate the frozen representation on the retrieval of base or novel classes. We find that a vanilla supervised representation falls short on the retrieval of novel classes even more so when the semantics gap is higher. Semi-supervised algorithms allow to partially bridge this performance gap but there is still much room for improvement.

- **Summary**: Although the smart camera parking system concept has existed for decades, a few approaches have fully addressed the system's scalability and reliability. As the cornerstone of a smart parking system is the ability to detect occupancy, traditional methods use the classification backbone to predict spots from a manual labeled grid. This is time-consuming and loses the system's scalability. Additionally, most of the approaches use deep learning models, making them not error-free and not reliable at scale. Thus, we propose an end-to-end smart camera parking system where we provide an autonomous detecting occupancy by an object detector called OcpDet. Our detector also provides meaningful information from contrastive modules: training and spatial knowledge, which avert false detections during inference. We benchmark OcpDet on the existing PKLot dataset and reach competitive results compared to traditional classification solutions. We also introduce an additional SNU-SPS dataset, in which we estimate the system performance from various views and conduct system evaluation in parking assignment tasks. The result from our dataset shows that our system is promising for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Buses and heavy vehicles have more blind spots compared to cars and other road vehicles due to their large sizes. Therefore, accidents caused by these heavy vehicles are more fatal and result in severe injuries to other road users. These possible blind-spot collisions can be identified early using vision-based object detection approaches. Yet, the existing state-of-the-art vision-based object detection models rely heavily on a single feature descriptor for making decisions. In this research, the design of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on high-level feature descriptors and their integration with faster R-CNN is proposed to detect blind-spot collisions for heavy vehicles. Moreover, a fusion approach is proposed to integrate two pre-trained networks (i.e., Resnet 50 and Resnet 101) for extracting high level features for blind-spot vehicle detection. The fusion of features significantly improves the performance of faster R-CNN and outperformed the existing state-of-the-art methods. Both approaches are validated on a self-recorded blind-spot vehicle detection dataset for buses and an online LISA dataset for vehicle detection. For both proposed approaches, a false detection rate (FDR) of 3.05% and 3.49% are obtained for the self recorded dataset, making these approaches suitable for real time applications.

- **Summary**: Accurate geometry representation is essential in developing finite element models. Although generally good, deep-learning segmentation approaches with only few data have difficulties in accurately segmenting fine features, e.g., gaps and thin structures. Subsequently, segmented geometries need labor-intensive manual modifications to reach a quality where they can be used for simulation purposes. We propose a strategy that uses transfer learning to reuse datasets with poor segmentation combined with an interactive learning step where fine-tuning of the data results in anatomically accurate segmentations suitable for simulations. We use a modified MultiPlanar UNet that is pre-trained using inferior hip joint segmentation combined with a dedicated loss function to learn the gap regions and post-processing to correct tiny inaccuracies on symmetric classes due to rotational invariance. We demonstrate this robust yet conceptually simple approach applied with clinically validated results on publicly available computed tomography scans of hip joints.

- **Summary**: Controlling the text generated by language models and customizing the content has been a long-standing challenge. Existing prompting techniques proposed in pursuit of providing control are task-specific and lack generality; this provides overwhelming choices for non-expert users to find a suitable method for their task. The effort associated with those techniques, such as in writing examples, explanations, instructions, etc. further limits their adoption among non-expert users. In this paper, we propose a simple prompting strategy HELP ME THINK where we encourage GPT3 to help non-expert users by asking a set of relevant questions and leveraging user answers to execute the task. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique HELP ME THINK on a variety of tasks. Specifically, we focus on tasks that are hard for average humans and require significant thinking to perform. We hope our work will encourage the development of unconventional ways to harness the power of large language models.

- **Summary**: Bootstrapping from pre-trained language models has been proven to be an efficient approach for building vision-language models (VLM) for tasks such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, outputs of these models rarely align with user's rationales for specific answers. In order to improve this alignment and reinforce commonsense reasons, we propose a tuning paradigm based on human interactions with machine-generated data. Our ILLUME executes the following loop: Given an image-question-answer prompt, the VLM samples multiple candidate rationales, and a human critic provides feedback via preference selection, used for fine-tuning. This loop increases the training data and gradually carves out the VLM's rationalization capabilities that are aligned with human intent. Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate that ILLUME is competitive with standard supervised finetuning while using significantly fewer training data and only requiring minimal feedback.

- **Summary**: Machine learning poses severe privacy concerns as it has been shown that the learned models can reveal sensitive information about their training data. Many works have investigated the effect of widely-adopted data augmentation (DA) and adversarial training (AT) techniques, termed data enhancement in the paper, on the privacy leakage of machine learning models. Such privacy effects are often measured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to investigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the lens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading results as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks as members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem, we deploy a recent attack that can capture individual samples' memorization degrees for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil non-trivial findings about the connections between three essential properties of machine learning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that, unlike existing results, the generalization gap is shown not highly correlated with privacy leakage. Moreover, stronger adversarial robustness does not necessarily imply that the model is more susceptible to privacy attacks.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers are nowadays the de-facto choice for image classification tasks. There are two broad categories of classification tasks, fine-grained and coarse-grained. In fine-grained classification, the necessity is to discover subtle differences due to the high level of similarity between sub-classes. Such distinctions are often lost as we downscale the image to save the memory and computational cost associated with vision transformers (ViT). In this work, we present an in-depth analysis and describe the critical components for developing a system for the fine-grained categorization of plants from herbarium sheets. Our extensive experimental analysis indicated the need for a better augmentation technique and the ability of modern-day neural networks to handle higher dimensional images. We also introduce a convolutional transformer architecture called Conviformer which, unlike the popular Vision Transformer (ConViT), can handle higher resolution images without exploding memory and computational cost. We also introduce a novel, improved pre-processing technique called PreSizer to resize images better while preserving their original aspect ratios, which proved essential for classifying natural plants. With our simple yet effective approach, we achieved SoTA on Herbarium 202x and iNaturalist 2019 dataset.

- **Summary**: Metal artifact correction is a challenging problem in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanning. Metal implants inserted into the anatomy cause severe artifacts in reconstructed images. Widely used inpainting-based metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods require segmentation of metal traces in the projections as a first step which is a challenging task. One approach is to use a deep learning method to segment metals in the projections. However, the success of deep learning methods is limited by the availability of realistic training data. It is challenging and time consuming to get reliable ground truth annotations due to unclear implant boundary and large number of projections. We propose to use X-ray simulations to generate synthetic metal segmentation training dataset from clinical CBCT scans. We compare the effect of simulations with different number of photons and also compare several training strategies to augment the available data. We compare our model's performance on real clinical scans with conventional threshold-based MAR and a recent deep learning method. We show that simulations with relatively small number of photons are suitable for the metal segmentation task and that training the deep learning model with full size and cropped projections together improves the robustness of the model. We show substantial improvement in the image quality affected by severe motion, voxel size under-sampling, and out-of-FOV metals. Our method can be easily implemented into the existing projection-based MAR pipeline to get improved image quality. This method can provide a novel paradigm to accurately segment metals in CBCT projections.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing image change detection is of great importance in disaster assessment and urban planning. The mainstream method is to use encoder-decoder models to detect the change region of two input images. Since the change content of remote sensing images has the characteristics of wide scale range and variety, it is necessary to improve the detection accuracy of the network by increasing the attention mechanism, which commonly includes: Squeeze-and-Excitation block, Non-local and Convolutional Block Attention Module, among others. These methods consider the importance of different location features between channels or within channels, but fail to perceive the differences between input images. In this paper, we propose a novel image difference attention network (IDAN). In the image preprocessing stage, we use a pre-training model to extract the feature differences between two input images to obtain the feature difference map (FD-map), and Canny for edge detection to obtain the edge difference map (ED-map). In the image feature extracting stage, the FD-map and ED-map are input to the feature difference attention module and edge compensation module, respectively, to optimize the features extracted by IDAN. Finally, the change detection result is obtained through the feature difference operation. IDAN comprehensively considers the differences in regional and edge features of images and thus optimizes the extracted image features. The experimental results demonstrate that the F1-score of IDAN improves 1.62% and 1.98% compared to the baseline model on WHU dataset and LEVIR-CD dataset, respectively.

- **Summary**: Grayscale image colorization is a fascinating application of AI for information restoration. The inherently ill-posed nature of the problem makes it even more challenging since the outputs could be multi-modal. The learning-based methods currently in use produce acceptable results for straightforward cases but usually fail to restore the contextual information in the absence of clear figure-ground separation. Also, the images suffer from color bleeding and desaturated backgrounds since a single model trained on full image features is insufficient for learning the diverse data modes. To address these issues, we present a parallel GAN-based colorization framework. In our approach, each separately tailored GAN pipeline colorizes the foreground (using object-level features) or the background (using full-image features). The foreground pipeline employs a Residual-UNet with self-attention as its generator trained using the full-image features and the corresponding object-level features from the COCO dataset. The background pipeline relies on full-image features and additional training examples from the Places dataset. We design a DenseFuse-based fusion network to obtain the final colorized image by feature-based fusion of the parallelly generated outputs. We show the shortcomings of the non-perceptual evaluation metrics commonly used to assess multi-modal problems like image colorization and perform extensive performance evaluation of our framework using multiple perceptual metrics. Our approach outperforms most of the existing learning-based methods and produces results comparable to the state-of-the-art. Further, we performed a runtime analysis and obtained an average inference time of 24ms per image.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are sensitive to adversarial data in a variety of scenarios, including the black-box scenario, where the attacker is only allowed to query the trained model and receive an output. Existing black-box methods for creating adversarial instances are costly, often using gradient estimation or training a replacement network. This paper introduces \textbf{Qu}ery-Efficient \textbf{E}volutiona\textbf{ry} \textbf{Attack}, \textit{QuEry Attack}, an untargeted, score-based, black-box attack. QuEry Attack is based on a novel objective function that can be used in gradient-free optimization problems. The attack only requires access to the output logits of the classifier and is thus not affected by gradient masking. No additional information is needed, rendering our method more suitable to real-life situations. We test its performance with three different state-of-the-art models -- Inception-v3, ResNet-50, and VGG-16-BN -- against three benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet. Furthermore, we evaluate QuEry Attack's performance on non-differential transformation defenses and state-of-the-art robust models. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of QuEry Attack, both in terms of accuracy score and query efficiency.

- **Summary**: Exploration of unknown environments is a fundamental problem in robotics and an essential component in numerous applications of autonomous systems. A major challenge in exploring unknown environments is that the robot has to plan with the limited information available at each time step. While most current approaches rely on heuristics and assumption to plan paths based on these partial observations, we instead propose a novel way to integrate deep learning into exploration by leveraging 3D scene completion for informed, safe, and interpretable exploration mapping and planning. Our approach, SC-Explorer, combines scene completion using a novel incremental fusion mechanism and a newly proposed hierarchical multi-layer mapping approach, to guarantee safety and efficiency of the robot. We further present an informative path planning method, leveraging the capabilities of our mapping approach and a novel scene-completion-aware information gain. While our method is generally applicable, we evaluate it in the use case of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). We thoroughly study each component in high-fidelity simulation experiments using only mobile hardware, and show that our method can speed up coverage of an environment by 73% compared to the baselines with only minimal reduction in map accuracy. Even if scene completions are not included in the final map, we show that they can be used to guide the robot to choose more informative paths, speeding up the measurement of the scene with the robot's sensors by 35%. We validate our system on a fully autonomous MAV, showing rapid and reliable scene coverage even in a complex cluttered environment. We make our methods available as open-source.

- **Summary**: We propose Video-TransUNet, a deep architecture for instance segmentation in medical CT videos constructed by integrating temporal feature blending into the TransUNet deep learning framework. In particular, our approach amalgamates strong frame representation via a ResNet CNN backbone, multi-frame feature blending via a Temporal Context Module (TCM), non-local attention via a Vision Transformer, and reconstructive capabilities for multiple targets via a UNet-based convolutional-deconvolutional architecture with multiple heads. We show that this new network design can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art systems when tested on the segmentation of bolus and pharynx/larynx in Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) CT sequences. On our VFSS2022 dataset it achieves a dice coefficient of 0.8796 and an average surface distance of 1.0379 pixels. Note that tracking the pharyngeal bolus accurately is a particularly important application in clinical practice since it constitutes the primary method for diagnostics of swallowing impairment. Our findings suggest that the proposed model can indeed enhance the TransUNet architecture via exploiting temporal information and improving segmentation performance by a significant margin. We publish key source code, network weights, and ground truth annotations for simplified performance reproduction.

- **Summary**: Recently, a lot of automated white blood cells (WBC) or leukocyte classification techniques have been developed. However, all of these methods only utilize a single modality microscopic image i.e. either blood smear or fluorescence based, thus missing the potential of a better learning from multimodal images. In this work, we develop an efficient multimodal architecture based on a first of its kind multimodal WBC dataset for the task of WBC classification. Specifically, our proposed idea is developed in two steps - 1) First, we learn modality specific independent subnetworks inside a single network only; 2) We further enhance the learning capability of the independent subnetworks by distilling knowledge from high complexity independent teacher networks. With this, our proposed framework can achieve a high performance while maintaining low complexity for a multimodal dataset. Our unique contribution is two-fold - 1) We present a first of its kind multimodal WBC dataset for WBC classification; 2) We develop a high performing multimodal architecture which is also efficient and low in complexity at the same time.

- **Summary**: 6D pose estimation of rigid objects from RGB-D images is crucial for object grasping and manipulation in robotics. Although RGB channels and the depth (D) channel are often complementary, providing respectively the appearance and geometry information, it is still non-trivial how to fully benefit from the two cross-modal data. From the simple yet new observation, when an object rotates, its semantic label is invariant to the pose while its keypoint offset direction is variant to the pose. To this end, we present SO(3)-Pose, a new representation learning network to explore SO(3)-equivariant and SO(3)-invariant features from the depth channel for pose estimation. The SO(3)-invariant features facilitate to learn more distinctive representations for segmenting objects with similar appearance from RGB channels. The SO(3)-equivariant features communicate with RGB features to deduce the (missed) geometry for detecting keypoints of an object with the reflective surface from the depth channel. Unlike most of existing pose estimation methods, our SO(3)-Pose not only implements the information communication between the RGB and depth channels, but also naturally absorbs the SO(3)-equivariance geometry knowledge from depth images, leading to better appearance and geometry representation learning. Comprehensive experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of large pre-trained vison-language model like CLIP, transferable representations can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks via prompt tuning. Prompt tuning tries to probe the beneficial information for downstream tasks from the general knowledge stored in the pre-trained model. A recently proposed method named Context Optimization (CoOp) introduces a set of learnable vectors as text prompt from the language side. However, tuning the text prompt alone can only adjust the synthesized "classifier", while the computed visual features of the image encoder can not be affected , thus leading to sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-modality Prompt Tuning (DPT) paradigm through learning text and visual prompts simultaneously. To make the final image feature concentrate more on the target visual concept, a Class-Aware Visual Prompt Tuning (CAVPT) scheme is further proposed in our DPT, where the class-aware visual prompt is generated dynamically by performing the cross attention between text prompts features and image patch token embeddings to encode both the downstream task-related information and visual instance information. Extensive experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method. Our code is available in https://github.com/fanrena/DPT.

A practical recognition system must balance between majority (head) and minority (tail) classes, generalize across the distribution, and acknowledge novelty upon the instances of unseen classes (open classes). We define Open Long-Tailed Recognition++ (OLTR++) as learning from such naturally distributed data and optimizing for the classification accuracy over a balanced test set which includes both known and open classes. OLTR++ handles imbalanced classification, few-shot learning, open-set recognition, and active learning in one integrated algorithm, whereas existing classification approaches often focus only on one or two aspects and deliver poorly over the entire spectrum. The key challenges are: 1) how to share visual knowledge between head and tail classes, 2) how to reduce confusion between tail and open classes, and 3) how to actively explore open classes with learned knowledge. Our algorithm, OLTR++, maps images to a feature space such that visual concepts can relate to each other through a memory association mechanism and a learned metric (dynamic meta-embedding) that both respects the closed world classification of seen classes and acknowledges the novelty of open classes. Additionally, we propose an active learning scheme based on visual memory, which learns to recognize open classes in a data-efficient manner for future expansions. On three large-scale open long-tailed datasets we curated from ImageNet (object-centric), Places (scene-centric), and MS1M (face-centric) data, as well as three standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and iNaturalist-18), our approach, as a unified framework, consistently demonstrates competitive performance. Notably, our approach also shows strong potential for the active exploration of open classes and the fairness analysis of minority groups.

- **Summary**: Colonoscopy is widely recognised as the gold standard procedure for the early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Segmentation is valuable for two significant clinical applications, namely lesion detection and classification, providing means to improve accuracy and robustness. The manual segmentation of polyps in colonoscopy images is time-consuming. As a result, the use of deep learning (DL) for automation of polyp segmentation has become important. However, DL-based solutions can be vulnerable to overfitting and the resulting inability to generalise to images captured by different colonoscopes. Recent transformer-based architectures for semantic segmentation both achieve higher performance and generalise better than alternatives, however typically predict a segmentation map of $\frac{h}{4}\times\frac{w}{4}$ spatial dimensions for a $h\times w$ input image. To this end, we propose a new architecture for full-size segmentation which leverages the strengths of a transformer in extracting the most important features for segmentation in a primary branch, while compensating for its limitations in full-size prediction with a secondary fully convolutional branch. The resulting features from both branches are then fused for final prediction of a $h\times w$ segmentation map. We demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance with respect to the mDice, mIoU, mPrecision, and mRecall metrics, on both the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB dataset benchmarks. Additionally, we train the model on each of these datasets and evaluate on the other to demonstrate its superior generalisation performance.

- **Summary**: Published studies have suggested the bias of automated face-based gender classification algorithms across gender-race groups. Specifically, unequal accuracy rates were obtained for women and dark-skinned people. To mitigate the bias of gender classifiers, the vision community has developed several strategies. However, the efficacy of these mitigation strategies is demonstrated for a limited number of races mostly, Caucasian and African-American. Further, these strategies often offer a trade-off between bias and classification accuracy. To further advance the state-of-the-art, we leverage the power of generative views, structured learning, and evidential learning towards mitigating gender classification bias. We demonstrate the superiority of our bias mitigation strategy in improving classification accuracy and reducing bias across gender-racial groups through extensive experimental validation, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in intra- and cross dataset evaluations.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation is a crucial step for image-guided intervention in robotic surgery and laparoscopic imaging system. Since per-pixel depth ground truth is difficult to acquire for laparoscopic image data, it is rarely possible to apply supervised depth estimation to surgical applications. As an alternative, self-supervised methods have been introduced to train depth estimators using only synchronized stereo image pairs. However, most recent work focused on the left-right consistency in 2D and ignored valuable inherent 3D information on the object in real world coordinates, meaning that the left-right 3D geometric structural consistency is not fully utilized. To overcome this limitation, we present M3Depth, a self-supervised depth estimator to leverage 3D geometric structural information hidden in stereo pairs while keeping monocular inference. The method also removes the influence of border regions unseen in at least one of the stereo images via masking, to enhance the correspondences between left and right images in overlapping areas. Intensive experiments show that our method outperforms previous self-supervised approaches on both a public dataset and a newly acquired dataset by a large margin, indicating a good generalization across different samples and laparoscopes. Code and data are available at https://github.com/br0202/M3Depth.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation needs rich and robust supervision on unlabeled data. Consistency learning enforces the same pixel to have similar features in different augmented views, which is a robust signal but neglects relationships with other pixels. In comparison, contrastive learning considers rich pairwise relationships, but it can be a conundrum to assign binary positive-negative supervision signals for pixel pairs. In this paper, we take the best of both worlds and propose multi-view correlation consistency (MVCC) learning: it considers rich pairwise relationships in self-correlation matrices and matches them across views to provide robust supervision. Together with this correlation consistency loss, we propose a view-coherent data augmentation strategy that guarantees pixel-pixel correspondence between different views. In a series of semi-supervised settings on two datasets, we report competitive accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on Cityscapes, we achieve 76.8% mIoU with 1/8 labeled data, just 0.6% shy from the fully supervised oracle.

- **Summary**: Color and structure are the two pillars that combine to give an image its meaning. Interested in critical structures for neural network recognition, we isolate the influence of colors by limiting the color space to just a few bits, and find structures that enable network recognition under such constraints. To this end, we propose a color quantization network, ColorCNN, which learns to structure an image in limited color spaces by minimizing the classification loss. Building upon the architecture and insights of ColorCNN, we introduce ColorCNN+, which supports multiple color space size configurations, and addresses the previous issues of poor recognition accuracy and undesirable visual fidelity under large color spaces. Via a novel imitation learning approach, ColorCNN+ learns to cluster colors like traditional color quantization methods. This reduces overfitting and helps both visual fidelity and recognition accuracy under large color spaces. Experiments verify that ColorCNN+ achieves very competitive results under most circumstances, preserving both key structures for network recognition and visual fidelity with accurate colors. We further discuss differences between key structures and accurate colors, and their specific contributions to network recognition. For potential applications, we show that ColorCNNs can be used as image compression methods for network recognition.

- **Summary**: 3D human motion capture from monocular RGB images respecting interactions of a subject with complex and possibly deformable environments is a very challenging, ill-posed and under-explored problem. Existing methods address it only weakly and do not model possible surface deformations often occurring when humans interact with scene surfaces. In contrast, this paper proposes MoCapDeform, i.e., a new framework for monocular 3D human motion capture that is the first to explicitly model non-rigid deformations of a 3D scene for improved 3D human pose estimation and deformable environment reconstruction. MoCapDeform accepts a monocular RGB video and a 3D scene mesh aligned in the camera space. It first localises a subject in the input monocular video along with dense contact labels using a new raycasting based strategy. Next, our human-environment interaction constraints are leveraged to jointly optimise global 3D human poses and non-rigid surface deformations. MoCapDeform achieves superior accuracy than competing methods on several datasets, including our newly recorded one with deforming background scenes.

- **Summary**: People with blindness and low vision (pBLV) experience significant challenges when locating final destinations or targeting specific objects in unfamiliar environments. Furthermore, besides initially locating and orienting oneself to a target object, approaching the final target from one's present position is often frustrating and challenging, especially when one drifts away from the initial planned path to avoid obstacles. In this paper, we develop a novel wearable navigation solution to provide real-time guidance for a user to approach a target object of interest efficiently and effectively in unfamiliar environments. Our system contains two key visual computing functions: initial target object localization in 3D and continuous estimation of the user's trajectory, both based on the 2D video captured by a low-cost monocular camera mounted on in front of the chest of the user. These functions enable the system to suggest an initial navigation path, continuously update the path as the user moves, and offer timely recommendation about the correction of the user's path. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is able to operate with an error of less than 0.5 meter both outdoor and indoor. The system is entirely vision-based and does not need other sensors for navigation, and the computation can be run with the Jetson processor in the wearable system to facilitate real-time navigation assistance.

- **Summary**: We develop an approach for text-to-image generation that embraces additional retrieval images, driven by a combination of implicit visual guidance loss and generative objectives. Unlike most existing text-to-image generation methods which merely take the text as input, our method dynamically feeds cross-modal search results into a unified training stage, hence improving the quality, controllability and diversity of generation results. We propose a novel hypernetwork modulated visual-text encoding scheme to predict the weight update of the encoding layer, enabling effective transfer from visual information (e.g. layout, content) into the corresponding latent domain. Experimental results show that our model guided with additional retrieval visual data outperforms existing GAN-based models. On COCO dataset, we achieve better FID of $9.13$ with up to $3.5 \times$ fewer generator parameters, compared with the state-of-the-art method.

- **Summary**: This work addresses visual cross-view metric localization for outdoor robotics. Given a ground-level color image and a satellite patch that contains the local surroundings, the task is to identify the location of the ground camera within the satellite patch. Related work addressed this task for range-sensors (LiDAR, Radar), but for vision, only as a secondary regression step after an initial cross-view image retrieval step. Since the local satellite patch could also be retrieved through any rough localization prior (e.g. from GPS/GNSS, temporal filtering), we drop the image retrieval objective and focus on the metric localization only. We devise a novel network architecture with denser satellite descriptors, similarity matching at the bottleneck (rather than at the output as in image retrieval), and a dense spatial distribution as output to capture multi-modal localization ambiguities. We compare against a state-of-the-art regression baseline that uses global image descriptors. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the recently proposed VIGOR and the Oxford RobotCar datasets validate our design. The produced probabilities are correlated with localization accuracy, and can even be used to roughly estimate the ground camera's heading when its orientation is unknown. Overall, our method reduces the median metric localization error by 51%, 37%, and 28% compared to the state-of-the-art when generalizing respectively in the same area, across areas, and across time.

- **Summary**: Social engineering (SE) is a form of deception that aims to trick people into giving access to data, information, networks and even money. For decades SE has been a key method for attackers to gain access to an organization, virtually skipping all lines of defense. Attackers also regularly use SE to scam innocent people by making threatening phone calls which impersonate an authority or by sending infected emails which look like they have been sent from a loved one. SE attacks will likely remain a top attack vector for criminals because humans are the weakest link in cyber security.   Unfortunately, the threat will only get worse now that a new technology called deepfakes as arrived. A deepfake is believable media (e.g., videos) created by an AI. Although the technology has mostly been used to swap the faces of celebrities, it can also be used to `puppet' different personas. Recently, researchers have shown how this technology can be deployed in real-time to clone someone's voice in a phone call or reenact a face in a video call. Given that any novice user can download this technology to use it, it is no surprise that criminals have already begun to monetize it to perpetrate their SE attacks.   In this paper, we propose a lightweight application which can protect organizations and individuals from deepfake SE attacks. Through a challenge and response approach, we leverage the technical and theoretical limitations of deepfake technologies to expose the attacker. Existing defence solutions are too heavy as an end-point solution and can be evaded by a dynamic attacker. In contrast, our approach is lightweight and breaks the reactive arms race, putting the attacker at a disadvantage.

- **Summary**: Is it possible to restructure the non-linear activation functions in a deep network to create hardware-efficient models? To address this question, we propose a new paradigm called Restructurable Activation Networks (RANs) that manipulate the amount of non-linearity in models to improve their hardware-awareness and efficiency. First, we propose RAN-explicit (RAN-e) -- a new hardware-aware search space and a semi-automatic search algorithm -- to replace inefficient blocks with hardware-aware blocks. Next, we propose a training-free model scaling method called RAN-implicit (RAN-i) where we theoretically prove the link between network topology and its expressivity in terms of number of non-linear units. We demonstrate that our networks achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at different scales and for several types of hardware. For example, compared to EfficientNet-Lite-B0, RAN-e achieves a similar accuracy while improving Frames-Per-Second (FPS) by 1.5x on Arm micro-NPUs. On the other hand, RAN-i demonstrates up to 2x reduction in #MACs over ConvNexts with a similar or better accuracy. We also show that RAN-i achieves nearly 40% higher FPS than ConvNext on Arm-based datacenter CPUs. Finally, RAN-i based object detection networks achieve a similar or higher mAP and up to 33% higher FPS on datacenter CPUs compared to ConvNext based models. The code to train and evaluate RANs and the pretrained networks are available at https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-restructurable-activation-networks.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new type of autonomous vehicle - an autonomous dozer that is expected to complete construction site tasks in an efficient, robust, and safe manner. To better handle the path planning for the dozer and ensure construction site safety, object detection plays one of the most critical components among perception tasks. In this work, we first collect the construction site data by driving around our dozers. Then we analyze the data thoroughly to understand its distribution. Finally, two well-known object detection models are trained, and their performances are benchmarked with a wide range of training strategies and hyperparameters.

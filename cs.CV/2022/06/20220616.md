- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to enhance the perceptual quality of compressed videos. Our framework includes attention and adaptation to different quantization parameters (QPs) in a single model. The attention module exploits global receptive fields that can capture and align long-range correlations between consecutive frames, which can be beneficial for enhancing perceptual quality of videos. The frame to be enhanced is fed into the deep network together with its neighboring frames, and in the first stage features at different depths are extracted. Then extracted features are fed into attention blocks to explore global temporal correlations, followed by a series of upsampling and convolution layers. Finally, the resulting features are processed by the QP-conditional adaptation module which leverages the corresponding QP information. In this way, a single model can be used to enhance adaptively to various QPs without requiring multiple models specific for every QP value, while having similar performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed PeQuENet compared with the state-of-the-art compressed video quality enhancement algorithms.

- **Summary**: Attributed graph clustering is one of the most fundamental tasks among graph learning field, the goal of which is to group nodes with similar representations into the same cluster without human annotations. Recent studies based on graph contrastive learning method have achieved remarkable results when exploit graph-structured data. However, most existing methods 1) do not directly address the clustering task, since the representation learning and clustering process are separated; 2) depend too much on data augmentation, which greatly limits the capability of contrastive learning; 3) ignore the contrastive message for clustering tasks, which adversely degenerate the clustering results. In this paper, we propose a Neighborhood Contrast Framework for Attributed Graph Clustering, namely NCAGC, seeking for conquering the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, by leveraging the Neighborhood Contrast Module, the representation of neighbor nodes will be 'push closer' and become clustering-oriented with the neighborhood contrast loss. Moreover, a Contrastive Self-Expression Module is built by minimizing the node representation before and after the self-expression layer to constraint the learning of self-expression matrix. All the modules of NCAGC are optimized in a unified framework, so the learned node representation contains clustering-oriented messages. Extensive experimental results on four attributed graph datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NCAGC compared with 16 state-of-the-art clustering methods.

- **Summary**: Designed for tracking user goals in dialogues, a dialogue state tracker is an essential component in a dialogue system. However, the research of dialogue state tracking has largely been limited to unimodality, in which slots and slot values are limited by knowledge domains (e.g. restaurant domain with slots of restaurant name and price range) and are defined by specific database schema. In this paper, we propose to extend the definition of dialogue state tracking to multimodality. Specifically, we introduce a novel dialogue state tracking task to track the information of visual objects that are mentioned in video-grounded dialogues. Each new dialogue utterance may introduce a new video segment, new visual objects, or new object attributes, and a state tracker is required to update these information slots accordingly. We created a new synthetic benchmark and designed a novel baseline, Video-Dialogue Transformer Network (VDTN), for this task. VDTN combines both object-level features and segment-level features and learns contextual dependencies between videos and dialogues to generate multimodal dialogue states. We optimized VDTN for a state generation task as well as a self-supervised video understanding task which recovers video segment or object representations. Finally, we trained VDTN to use the decoded states in a response prediction task. Together with comprehensive ablation and qualitative analysis, we discovered interesting insights towards building more capable multimodal dialogue systems.

- **Summary**: Online few-shot learning describes a setting where models are trained and evaluated on a stream of data while learning emerging classes. While prior work in this setting has achieved very promising performance on instance classification when learning from data-streams composed of a single indoor environment, we propose to extend this setting to consider object classification on a series of several indoor environments, which is likely to occur in applications such as robotics. Importantly, our setting, which we refer to as online few-shot continual learning, injects the well-studied issue of catastrophic forgetting into the few-shot online learning paradigm. In this work, we benchmark several existing methods and adapted baselines within our setting, and show there exists a trade-off between catastrophic forgetting and online performance. Our findings motivate the need for future work in this setting, which can achieve better online performance without catastrophic forgetting.

- **Summary**: We propose a motion forecasting model called BANet, which means Boundary-Aware Network, and it is a variant of LaneGCN. We believe that it is not enough to use only the lane centerline as input to obtain the embedding features of the vector map nodes. The lane centerline can only provide the topology of the lanes, and other elements of the vector map also contain rich information. For example, the lane boundary can provide traffic rule constraint information such as whether it is possible to change lanes which is very important. Therefore, we achieved better performance by encoding more vector map elements in the motion forecasting model.We report our results on the 2022 Argoverse2 Motion Forecasting challenge and rank 1st on the test leaderboard.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training (AT) is a simple yet effective defense against adversarial attacks to image classification systems, which is based on augmenting the training set with attacks that maximize the loss. However, the effectiveness of AT as a defense for video classification has not been thoroughly studied. Our first contribution is to show that generating optimal attacks for video requires carefully tuning the attack parameters, especially the step size. Notably, we show that the optimal step size varies linearly with the attack budget. Our second contribution is to show that using a smaller (sub-optimal) attack budget at training time leads to a more robust performance at test time. Based on these findings, we propose three defenses against attacks with variable attack budgets. The first one, Adaptive AT, is a technique where the attack budget is drawn from a distribution that is adapted as training iterations proceed. The second, Curriculum AT, is a technique where the attack budget is increased as training iterations proceed. The third, Generative AT, further couples AT with a denoising generative adversarial network to boost robust performance. Experiments on the UCF101 dataset demonstrate that the proposed methods improve adversarial robustness against multiple attack types.

- **Summary**: Building 3D perception systems for autonomous vehicles that do not rely on high-density LiDAR is a critical research problem because of the expense of LiDAR systems compared to cameras and other sensors. Recent research has developed a variety of camera-only methods, where features are differentiably "lifted" from the multi-camera images onto the 2D ground plane, yielding a "bird's eye view" (BEV) feature representation of the 3D space around the vehicle. This line of work has produced a variety of novel "lifting" methods, but we observe that other details in the training setups have shifted at the same time, making it unclear what really matters in top-performing methods. We also observe that using cameras alone is not a real-world constraint, considering that additional sensors like radar have been integrated into real vehicles for years already. In this paper, we first of all attempt to elucidate the high-impact factors in the design and training protocol of BEV perception models. We find that batch size and input resolution greatly affect performance, while lifting strategies have a more modest effect -- even a simple parameter-free lifter works well. Second, we demonstrate that radar data can provide a substantial boost to performance, helping to close the gap between camera-only and LiDAR-enabled systems. We analyze the radar usage details that lead to good performance, and invite the community to re-consider this commonly-neglected part of the sensor platform.

- **Summary**: Image set-based visual classification methods have achieved remarkable performance, via characterising the image set in terms of a non-singular covariance matrix on a symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. To adapt to complicated visual scenarios better, several Riemannian networks (RiemNets) for SPD matrix nonlinear processing have recently been studied. However, it is pertinent to ask, whether greater accuracy gains can be achieved by simply increasing the depth of RiemNets. The answer appears to be negative, as deeper RiemNets tend to lose generalization ability. To explore a possible solution to this issue, we propose a new architecture for SPD matrix learning. Specifically, to enrich the deep representations, we adopt SPDNet [1] as the backbone, with a stacked Riemannian autoencoder (SRAE) built on the tail. The associated reconstruction error term can make the embedding functions of both SRAE and of each RAE an approximate identity mapping, which helps to prevent the degradation of statistical information. We then insert several residual-like blocks with shortcut connections to augment the representational capacity of SRAE, and to simplify the training of a deeper network. The experimental evidence demonstrates that our DreamNet can achieve improved accuracy with increased depth of the network.

- **Summary**: Multimodal sentiment analysis in videos is a key task in many real-world applications, which usually requires integrating multimodal streams including visual, verbal and acoustic behaviors. To improve the robustness of multimodal fusion, some of the existing methods let different modalities communicate with each other and modal the crossmodal interaction via transformers. However, these methods only use the single-scale representations during the interaction but forget to exploit multi-scale representations that contain different levels of semantic information. As a result, the representations learned by transformers could be biased especially for unaligned multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale cooperative multimodal transformer (MCMulT) architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis. On the whole, the "multi-scale" mechanism is capable of exploiting the different levels of semantic information of each modality which are used for fine-grained crossmodal interactions. Meanwhile, each modality learns its feature hierarchies via integrating the crossmodal interactions from multiple level features of its source modality. In this way, each pair of modalities progressively builds feature hierarchies respectively in a cooperative manner. The empirical results illustrate that our MCMulT model not only outperforms existing approaches on unaligned multimodal sequences but also has strong performance on aligned multimodal sequences.

- **Summary**: Image captioning is the process of automatically generating a description of an image in natural language. Image captioning is one of the significant challenges in image understanding since it requires not only recognizing salient objects in the image but also their attributes and the way they interact. The system must then generate a syntactically and semantically correct caption that describes the image content in natural language. With the significant progress in deep learning models and their ability to effectively encode large sets of images and generate correct sentences, several neural-based captioning approaches have been proposed recently, each trying to achieve better accuracy and caption quality. This paper introduces an encoder-decoder-based image captioning system in which the encoder extracts spatial features from the image using ResNet-101. This stage is followed by a refining model, which uses an attention-on-attention mechanism to extract the visual features of the target image objects, then determine their interactions. The decoder consists of an attention-based recurrent module and a reflective attention module, which collaboratively apply attention to the visual and textual features to enhance the decoder's ability to model long-term sequential dependencies. Extensive experiments performed on Flickr30K, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the high quality of the generated captions.

- **Summary**: Recent self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have shown impressive results in learning visual representations from unlabeled images. This paper aims to improve their performance further by utilizing the architectural advantages of the underlying neural network, as the current state-of-the-art visual pretext tasks for SSL do not enjoy the benefit, i.e., they are architecture-agnostic. In particular, we focus on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which have gained much attention recently as a better architectural choice, often outperforming convolutional networks for various visual tasks. The unique characteristic of ViT is that it takes a sequence of disjoint patches from an image and processes patch-level representations internally. Inspired by this, we design a simple yet effective visual pretext task, coined SelfPatch, for learning better patch-level representations. To be specific, we enforce invariance against each patch and its neighbors, i.e., each patch treats similar neighboring patches as positive samples. Consequently, training ViTs with SelfPatch learns more semantically meaningful relations among patches (without using human-annotated labels), which can be beneficial, in particular, to downstream tasks of a dense prediction type. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that it can significantly improve the performance of existing SSL methods for various visual tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation. Specifically, SelfPatch significantly improves the recent self-supervised ViT, DINO, by achieving +1.3 AP on COCO object detection, +1.2 AP on COCO instance segmentation, and +2.9 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.



### Joint Class-Affinity Loss Correction for Robust Medical Image Segmentation with Noisy Labels

- **Summary**: Noisy labels collected with limited annotation cost prevent medical image segmentation algorithms from learning precise semantic correlations. Previous segmentation arts of learning with noisy labels merely perform a pixel-wise manner to preserve semantics, such as pixel-wise label correction, but neglect the pair-wise manner. In fact, we observe that the pair-wise manner capturing affinity relations between pixels can greatly reduce the label noise rate. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel perspective for noisy mitigation by incorporating both pixel-wise and pair-wise manners, where supervisions are derived from noisy class and affinity labels, respectively. Unifying the pixel-wise and pair-wise manners, we propose a robust Joint Class-Affinity Segmentation (JCAS) framework to combat label noise issues in medical image segmentation. Considering the affinity in pair-wise manner incorporates contextual dependencies, a differentiated affinity reasoning (DAR) module is devised to rectify the pixel-wise segmentation prediction by reasoning about intra-class and inter-class affinity relations. To further enhance the noise resistance, a class-affinity loss correction (CALC) strategy is designed to correct supervision signals via the modeled noise label distributions in class and affinity labels. Meanwhile, CALC strategy interacts the pixel-wise and pair-wise manners through the theoretically derived consistency regularization. Extensive experiments under both synthetic and real-world noisy labels corroborate the efficacy of the proposed JCAS framework with a minimum gap towards the upper bound performance.

- **Summary**: Conventional domain adaptation (DA) techniques aim to improve domain transferability by learning domain-invariant representations; while concurrently preserving the task-discriminability knowledge gathered from the labeled source data. However, the requirement of simultaneous access to labeled source and unlabeled target renders them unsuitable for the challenging source-free DA setting. The trivial solution of realizing an effective original to generic domain mapping improves transferability but degrades task discriminability. Upon analyzing the hurdles from both theoretical and empirical standpoints, we derive novel insights to show that a mixup between original and corresponding translated generic samples enhances the discriminability-transferability trade-off while duly respecting the privacy-oriented source-free setting. A simple but effective realization of the proposed insights on top of the existing source-free DA approaches yields state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence. Beyond single-source, we also outperform multi-source prior-arts across both classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The emergence of neural networks has revolutionized the field of motion synthesis. Yet, learning to unconditionally synthesize motions from a given distribution remains challenging, especially when the motions are highly diverse. In this work, we present MoDi -- a generative model trained in an unsupervised setting from an extremely diverse, unstructured and unlabeled dataset. During inference, MoDi can synthesize high-quality, diverse motions. Despite the lack of any structure in the dataset, our model yields a well-behaved and highly structured latent space, which can be semantically clustered, constituting a strong motion prior that facilitates various applications including semantic editing and crowd simulation. In addition, we present an encoder that inverts real motions into MoDi's natural motion manifold, issuing solutions to various ill-posed challenges such as completion from prefix and spatial editing. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments achieve state-of-the-art results that outperform recent SOTA techniques. Code and trained models are available at https://sigal-raab.github.io/MoDi.

- **Summary**: To understand the real world using various types of data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the most used technique nowadays. While finding the pattern within the analyzed data represents the main task. This is performed by extracting representative features step, which is proceeded using the statistical algorithms or using some specific filters. However, the selection of useful features from large-scale data represented a crucial challenge. Now, with the development of convolution neural networks (CNNs), the feature extraction operation has become more automatic and easier. CNNs allow to work on large-scale size of data, as well as cover different scenarios for a specific task. For computer vision tasks, convolutional networks are used to extract features also for the other parts of a deep learning model. The selection of a suitable network for feature extraction or the other parts of a DL model is not random work. So, the implementation of such a model can be related to the target task as well as the computational complexity of it. Many networks have been proposed and become the famous networks used for any DL models in any AI task. These networks are exploited for feature extraction or at the beginning of any DL model which is named backbones. A backbone is a known network trained in many other tasks before and demonstrates its effectiveness. In this paper, an overview of the existing backbones, e.g. VGGs, ResNets, DenseNet, etc, is given with a detailed description. Also, a couple of computer vision tasks are discussed by providing a review of each task regarding the backbones used. In addition, a comparison in terms of performance is also provided, based on the backbone used for each task.

- **Summary**: Predicting whether subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will convert to Alzheimer's disease is a significant clinical challenge. Longitudinal variations and complementary information inherent in longitudinal and multimodal data are crucial for MCI conversion prediction, but persistent issue of missing data in these data may hinder their effective application. Additionally, conversion prediction should be achieved in the early stages of disease progression in clinical practice, specifically at baseline visit (BL). Therefore, longitudinal data should only be incorporated during training to capture disease progression information. To address these challenges, a multi-view imputation and cross-attention network (MCNet) was proposed to integrate data imputation and MCI conversion prediction in a unified framework. First, a multi-view imputation method combined with adversarial learning was presented to handle various missing data scenarios and reduce imputation errors. Second, two cross-attention blocks were introduced to exploit the potential associations in longitudinal and multimodal data. Finally, a multi-task learning model was established for data imputation, longitudinal classification, and conversion prediction tasks. When the model was appropriately trained, the disease progression information learned from longitudinal data can be leveraged by BL data to improve MCI conversion prediction at BL. MCNet was tested on two independent testing sets and single-modal BL data to verify its effectiveness and flexibility in MCI conversion prediction. Results showed that MCNet outperformed several competitive methods. Moreover, the interpretability of MCNet was demonstrated. Thus, our MCNet may be a valuable tool in longitudinal and multimodal data analysis for MCI conversion prediction. Codes are available at https://github.com/Meiyan88/MCNET.

- **Summary**: Despite the considerable progress in automatic abdominal multi-organ segmentation from CT/MRI scans in recent years, a comprehensive evaluation of the models' capabilities is hampered by the lack of a large-scale benchmark from diverse clinical scenarios. Constraint by the high cost of collecting and labeling 3D medical data, most of the deep learning models to date are driven by datasets with a limited number of organs of interest or samples, which still limits the power of modern deep models and makes it difficult to provide a fully comprehensive and fair estimate of various methods. To mitigate the limitations, we present AMOS, a large-scale, diverse, clinical dataset for abdominal organ segmentation.

- **Summary**: Fiducial markers have been broadly used to identify objects or embed messages that can be detected by a camera. Primarily, existing detection methods assume that markers are printed on ideally planar surfaces. Markers often fail to be recognized due to various imaging artifacts of optical/perspective distortion and motion blur. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deformable fiducial marker system that consists of three main parts: First, a fiducial marker generator creates a set of free-form color patterns to encode significantly large-scale information in unique visual codes. Second, a differentiable image simulator creates a training dataset of photorealistic scene images with the deformed markers, being rendered during optimization in a differentiable manner. The rendered images include realistic shading with specular reflection, optical distortion, defocus and motion blur, color alteration, imaging noise, and shape deformation of markers. Lastly, a trained marker detector seeks the regions of interest and recognizes multiple marker patterns simultaneously via inverse deformation transformation. The deformable marker creator and detector networks are jointly optimized via the differentiable photorealistic renderer in an end-to-end manner, allowing us to robustly recognize a wide range of deformable markers with high accuracy. Our deformable marker system is capable of decoding 36-bit messages successfully at ~29 fps with severe shape deformation. Results validate that our system significantly outperforms the traditional and data-driven marker methods. Our learning-based marker system opens up new interesting applications of fiducial markers, including cost-effective motion capture of the human body, active 3D scanning using our fiducial markers' array as structured light patterns, and robust augmented reality rendering of virtual objects on dynamic surfaces.

- **Summary**: Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) is an important part of VR applications. Many scientists are enriching the community with different variations that enable locomotion in VR. Some of the most promising methods are gesture-based and do not require additional handheld hardware. Recent work focused mostly on user preference and performance of the different locomotion techniques. This ignores the learning effect that users go through while new methods are being explored. In this work, it is investigated whether and how quickly users can adapt to a hand gesture-based locomotion system in VR. Four different locomotion techniques are implemented and tested by participants. The goal of this paper is twofold: First, it aims to encourage researchers to consider the learning effect in their studies. Second, this study aims to provide insight into the learning effect of users in gesture-based systems.

- **Summary**: We propose a learning-based method to reconstruct the local terrain for locomotion with a mobile robot traversing urban environments. Using a stream of depth measurements from the onboard cameras and the robot's trajectory, the algorithm estimates the topography in the robot's vicinity. The raw measurements from these cameras are noisy and only provide partial and occluded observations that in many cases do not show the terrain the robot stands on. Therefore, we propose a 3D reconstruction model that faithfully reconstructs the scene, despite the noisy measurements and large amounts of missing data coming from the blind spots of the camera arrangement. The model consists of a 4D fully convolutional network on point clouds that learns the geometric priors to complete the scene from the context and an auto-regressive feedback to leverage spatio-temporal consistency and use evidence from the past. The network can be solely trained with synthetic data, and due to extensive augmentation, it is robust in the real world, as shown in the validation on a quadrupedal robot, ANYmal, traversing challenging settings. We run the pipeline on the robot's onboard low-power computer using an efficient sparse tensor implementation and show that the proposed method outperforms classical map representations.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. An early detection is crucial for slowing down the disease and mitigating risks related to the progression. While the combination of MRI and FDG-PET is the best image-based tool for diagnosis, FDG-PET is not always available. The reliable detection of Alzheimer's disease with only MRI could be beneficial, especially in regions where FDG-PET might not be affordable for all patients. To this end, we propose a multi-task method based on U-Net that takes T1-weighted MR images as an input to generate synthetic FDG-PET images and classifies the dementia progression of the patient into cognitive normal (CN), cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. The attention gates used in both task heads can visualize the most relevant parts of the brain, guiding the examiner and adding interpretability. Results show the successful generation of synthetic FDG-PET images and a performance increase in disease classification over the naive single-task baseline.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation demonstrates great potential to mitigate domain shifts by transferring models from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation has been applied to a wide variety of complex vision tasks, only few works focus on lane detection for autonomous driving. This can be attributed to the lack of publicly available datasets. To facilitate research in these directions, we propose CARLANE, a 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection. CARLANE encompasses the single-target datasets MoLane and TuLane and the multi-target dataset MuLane. These datasets are built from three different domains, which cover diverse scenes and contain a total of 163K unique images, 118K of which are annotated. In addition we evaluate and report systematic baselines, including our own method, which builds upon Prototypical Cross-domain Self-supervised Learning. We find that false positive and false negative rates of the evaluated domain adaptation methods are high compared to those of fully supervised baselines. This affirms the need for benchmarks such as CARLANE to further strengthen research in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for lane detection. CARLANE, all evaluated models and the corresponding implementations are publicly available at https://carlanebenchmark.github.io.

- **Summary**: In recent years, crowd counting has become an important issue in computer vision. In most methods, the density maps are generated by convolving with a Gaussian kernel from the ground-truth dot maps which are marked around the center of human heads. Due to the fixed geometric structures in CNNs and indistinct head-scale information, the head features are obtained incompletely. Deformable convolution is proposed to exploit the scale-adaptive capabilities for CNN features in the heads. By learning the coordinate offsets of the sampling points, it is tractable to improve the ability to adjust the receptive field. However, the heads are not uniformly covered by the sampling points in the deformable convolution, resulting in loss of head information. To handle the non-uniformed sampling, an improved Normed-Deformable Convolution (\textit{i.e.,}NDConv) implemented by Normed-Deformable loss (\textit{i.e.,}NDloss) is proposed in this paper. The offsets of the sampling points which are constrained by NDloss tend to be more even. Then, the features in the heads are obtained more completely, leading to better performance. Especially, the proposed NDConv is a light-weight module which shares similar computation burden with Deformable Convolution. In the extensive experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ShanghaiTech A, ShanghaiTech B, UCF\_QNRF, and UCF\_CC\_50 dataset, achieving 61.4, 7.8, 91.2, and 167.2 MAE, respectively.

- **Summary**: Flood disasters cause enormous social and economic losses. However, both traditional physical models and learning-based flood forecasting models require massive historical flood data to train the model parameters. When come to some new site that does not have sufficient historical data, the model performance will drop dramatically due to overfitting. This technical report presents a Flood Domain Adaptation Network (FloodDAN), a baseline of applying Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) to the flood forecasting problem. Specifically, training of FloodDAN includes two stages: in the first stage, we train a rainfall encoder and a prediction head to learn general transferable hydrological knowledge on large-scale source domain data; in the second stage, we transfer the knowledge in the pretrained encoder into the rainfall encoder of target domain through adversarial domain alignment. During inference, we utilize the target domain rainfall encoder trained in the second stage and the prediction head trained in the first stage to get flood forecasting predictions. Experimental results on Tunxi and Changhua flood dataset show that FloodDAN can perform flood forecasting effectively with zero target domain supervision. The performance of the FloodDAN is on par with supervised models that uses 450-500 hours of supervision.

- **Summary**: Few-Shot Learning (FSL) requires vision models to quickly adapt to brand-new classification tasks with a shift in task distribution. Understanding the difficulties posed by this task distribution shift is central to FSL. In this paper, we show that a simple channel-wise feature transformation may be the key to unraveling this secret from a channel perspective. When facing novel few-shot tasks in the test-time datasets, this transformation can greatly improve the generalization ability of learned image representations, while being agnostic to the choice of training algorithms and datasets. Through an in-depth analysis of this transformation, we find that the difficulty of representation transfer in FSL stems from the severe channel bias problem of image representations: channels may have different importance in different tasks, while convolutional neural networks are likely to be insensitive, or respond incorrectly to such a shift. This points out a core problem of the generalization ability of modern vision systems and needs further attention in the future.

- **Summary**: Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods either run a controller based on a planned trajectory or perform control prediction directly, which have spanned two separately studied lines of research. Seeing their potential mutual benefits to each other, this paper takes the initiative to explore the combination of these two well-developed worlds. Specifically, our integrated approach has two branches for trajectory planning and direct control, respectively. The trajectory branch predicts the future trajectory, while the control branch involves a novel multi-step prediction scheme such that the relationship between current actions and future states can be reasoned. The two branches are connected so that the control branch receives corresponding guidance from the trajectory branch at each time step. The outputs from two branches are then fused to achieve complementary advantages. Our results are evaluated in the closed-loop urban driving setting with challenging scenarios using the CARLA simulator. Even with a monocular camera input, the proposed approach ranks first on the official CARLA Leaderboard, outperforming other complex candidates with multiple sensors or fusion mechanisms by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Few-shot classification aims to learn a model that can generalize well to new tasks when only a few labeled samples are available. To make use of unlabeled data that are more abundantly available in real applications, Ren et al. \shortcite{ren2018meta} propose a semi-supervised few-shot classification method that assigns an appropriate label to each unlabeled sample by a manually defined metric. However, the manually defined metric fails to capture the intrinsic property in data. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{L}abel \textbf{A}ugmentation approach, called \textbf{SALA}, for semi-supervised few-shot classification. A major novelty of SALA is the task-adaptive metric, which can learn the metric adaptively for different tasks in an end-to-end fashion. Another appealing feature of SALA is a progressive neighbor selection strategy, which selects unlabeled data with high confidence progressively through the training phase. Experiments demonstrate that SALA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised few-shot classification on benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Video question answering (VideoQA) is a complex task that requires diverse multi-modal data for training. Manual annotation of question and answers for videos, however, is tedious and prohibits scalability. To tackle this problem, recent methods consider zero-shot settings with no manual annotation of visual question-answer. In particular, a promising approach adapts frozen autoregressive language models pretrained on Web-scale text-only data to multi-modal inputs. In contrast, we here build on frozen bidirectional language models (BiLM) and show that such an approach provides a stronger and cheaper alternative for zero-shot VideoQA. In particular, (i) we combine visual inputs with the frozen BiLM using light trainable modules, (ii) we train such modules using Web-scraped multi-modal data, and finally (iii) we perform zero-shot VideoQA inference through masked language modeling, where the masked text is the answer to a given question. Our proposed approach, FrozenBiLM, outperforms the state of the art in zero-shot VideoQA by a significant margin on a variety of datasets, including LSMDC-FiB, iVQA, MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA, TGIF-FrameQA, How2QA and TVQA. It also demonstrates competitive performance in the few-shot and fully-supervised setting. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/antoyang/FrozenBiLM.

- **Summary**: In seismic interpretation, pixel-level labels of various rock structures can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. As a result, there oftentimes exists a non-trivial quantity of unlabeled data that is left unused simply because traditional deep learning methods rely on access to fully labeled volumes. To rectify this problem, contrastive learning approaches have been proposed that use a self-supervised methodology in order to learn useful representations from unlabeled data. However, traditional contrastive learning approaches are based on assumptions from the domain of natural images that do not make use of seismic context. In order to incorporate this context within contrastive learning, we propose a novel positive pair selection strategy based on the position of slices within a seismic volume. We show that the learnt representations from our method out-perform a state of the art contrastive learning methodology in a semantic segmentation task.

- **Summary**: Unlike RGB cameras that use visible light bands (384$\sim$769 THz) and Lidars that use infrared bands (361$\sim$331 THz), Radars use relatively longer wavelength radio bands (77$\sim$81 GHz), resulting in robust measurements in adverse weathers. Unfortunately, existing Radar datasets only contain a relatively small number of samples compared to the existing camera and Lidar datasets. This may hinder the development of sophisticated data-driven deep learning techniques for Radar-based perception. Moreover, most of the existing Radar datasets only provide 3D Radar tensor (3DRT) data that contain power measurements along the Doppler, range, and azimuth dimensions. As there is no elevation information, it is challenging to estimate the 3D bounding box of an object from 3DRT. In this work, we introduce KAIST-Radar (K-Radar), a novel large-scale object detection dataset and benchmark that contains 35K frames of 4D Radar tensor (4DRT) data with power measurements along the Doppler, range, azimuth, and elevation dimensions, together with carefully annotated 3D bounding box labels of objects on the roads. K-Radar includes challenging driving conditions such as adverse weathers (fog, rain, and snow) on various road structures (urban, suburban roads, alleyways, and highways). In addition to the 4DRT, we provide auxiliary measurements from carefully calibrated high-resolution Lidars, surround stereo cameras, and RTK-GPS. We also provide 4DRT-based object detection baseline neural networks (baseline NNs) and show that the height information is crucial for 3D object detection. And by comparing the baseline NN with a similarly-structured Lidar-based neural network, we demonstrate that 4D Radar is a more robust sensor for adverse weather conditions.

- **Summary**: Crowd understanding has aroused the widespread interest in vision domain due to its important practical significance. Unfortunately, there is no effort to explore crowd understanding in multi-modal domain that bridges natural language and computer vision. Referring expression comprehension (REF) is such a representative multi-modal task. Current REF studies focus more on grounding the target object from multiple distinctive categories in general scenarios. It is difficult to applied to complex real-world crowd understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a new challenging dataset, called RefCrowd, which towards looking for the target person in crowd with referring expressions. It not only requires to sufficiently mine the natural language information, but also requires to carefully focus on subtle differences between the target and a crowd of persons with similar appearance, so as to realize the fine-grained mapping from language to vision. Furthermore, we propose a Fine-grained Multi-modal Attribute Contrastive Network (FMAC) to deal with REF in crowd understanding. It first decomposes the intricate visual and language features into attribute-aware multi-modal features, and then captures discriminative but robustness fine-grained attribute features to effectively distinguish these subtle differences between similar persons. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on our RefCrowd dataset and existing REF datasets. In addition, we implement an end-to-end REF toolbox for the deeper research in multi-modal domain. Our dataset and code can be available at: \url{https://qiuheqian.github.io/datasets/refcrowd/}.

- **Summary**: Equipped with a wide span of sensors, predominant autonomous driving solutions are becoming more modular-oriented for safe system design. Though these sensors have laid a solid foundation, most massive-production solutions up to date still fall into L2 phase. Among these, Comma.ai comes to our sight, claiming one $999 aftermarket device mounted with a single camera and board inside owns the ability to handle L2 scenarios. Together with open-sourced software of the entire system released by Comma.ai, the project is named Openpilot. Is it possible? If so, how is it made possible? With curiosity in mind, we deep-dive into Openpilot and conclude that its key to success is the end-to-end system design instead of a conventional modular framework. The model is briefed as Supercombo, and it can predict the ego vehicle's future trajectory and other road semantics on the fly from monocular input. Unfortunately, the training process and massive amount of data to make all these work are not publicly available. To achieve an intensive investigation, we try to reimplement the training details and test the pipeline on public benchmarks. The refactored network proposed in this work is referred to as OP-Deepdive. For a fair comparison of our version to the original Supercombo, we introduce a dual-model deployment scheme to test the driving performance in the real world. Experimental results on nuScenes, Comma2k19, CARLA, and in-house realistic scenarios verify that a low-cost device can indeed achieve most L2 functionalities and be on par with the original Supercombo model. In this report, we would like to share our latest findings, shed some light on the new perspective of end-to-end autonomous driving from an industrial product-level side, and potentially inspire the community to continue improving the performance. Our code, benchmarks are at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/Openpilot-Deepdive.

- **Summary**: The NuCLS dataset contains over 220.000 annotations of cell nuclei in breast cancers. We show how to use these data to create a multi-rater model with the MIScnn Framework to automate the analysis of cell nuclei. For the model creation, we use the widespread U-Net approach embedded in a pipeline. This pipeline provides besides the high performance convolution neural network, several preprocessor techniques and a extended data exploration. The final model is tested in the evaluation phase using a wide variety of metrics with a subsequent visualization. Finally, the results are compared and interpreted with the results of the NuCLS study. As an outlook, indications are given which are important for the future development of models in the context of cell nuclei.

- **Summary**: Filter pruning method introduces structural sparsity by removing selected filters and is thus particularly effective for reducing complexity. Previous works empirically prune networks from the point of view that filter with smaller norm contributes less to the final results. However, such criteria has been proven sensitive to the distribution of filters, and the accuracy may hard to recover since the capacity gap is fixed once pruned. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning method called Asymptotic Soft Cluster Pruning (ASCP), to identify the redundancy of network based on the similarity of filters. Each filter from over-parameterized network is first distinguished by clustering, and then reconstructed to manually introduce redundancy into it. Several guidelines of clustering are proposed to better preserve feature extraction ability. After reconstruction, filters are allowed to be updated to eliminate the effect caused by mistakenly selected. Besides, various decaying strategies of the pruning rate are adopted to stabilize the pruning process and improve the final performance as well. By gradually generating more identical filters within each cluster, ASCP can remove them through channel addition operation with almost no accuracy drop. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that our method can achieve competitive results compared with many state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: Roof-mounted spinning LiDAR sensors are widely used by autonomous vehicles. However, most semantic datasets and algorithms used for LiDAR sequence segmentation operate on $360^\circ$ frames, causing an acquisition latency incompatible with real-time applications. To address this issue, we first introduce HelixNet, a $10$ billion point dataset with fine-grained labels, timestamps, and sensor rotation information necessary to accurately assess the real-time readiness of segmentation algorithms. Second, we propose Helix4D, a compact and efficient spatio-temporal transformer architecture specifically designed for rotating LiDAR sequences. Helix4D operates on acquisition slices corresponding to a fraction of a full sensor rotation, significantly reducing the total latency. Helix4D reaches accuracy on par with the best segmentation algorithms on HelixNet and SemanticKITTI with a reduction of over $5\times$ in terms of latency and $50\times$ in model size.

- **Summary**: Pyramidal networks are standard methods for multi-scale object detection. Current researches on feature pyramid networks usually adopt layer connections to collect features from certain levels of the feature hierarchy, and do not consider the significant differences among them. We propose a better architecture of feature pyramid networks, named selective multi-scale learning (SMSL), to address this issue. SMSL is efficient and general, which can be integrated in both single-stage and two-stage detectors to boost detection performance, with nearly no extra inference cost. RetinaNet combined with SMSL obtains 1.8\% improvement in AP (from 39.1\% to 40.9\%) on COCO dataset. When integrated with SMSL, two-stage detectors can get around 1.0\% improvement in AP.

- **Summary**: Domain adversarial training has been ubiquitous for achieving invariant representations and is used widely for various domain adaptation tasks. In recent times, methods converging to smooth optima have shown improved generalization for supervised learning tasks like classification. In this work, we analyze the effect of smoothness enhancing formulations on domain adversarial training, the objective of which is a combination of task loss (eg. classification, regression, etc.) and adversarial terms. We find that converging to a smooth minima with respect to (w.r.t.) task loss stabilizes the adversarial training leading to better performance on target domain. In contrast to task loss, our analysis shows that converging to smooth minima w.r.t. adversarial loss leads to sub-optimal generalization on the target domain. Based on the analysis, we introduce the Smooth Domain Adversarial Training (SDAT) procedure, which effectively enhances the performance of existing domain adversarial methods for both classification and object detection tasks. Our analysis also provides insight into the extensive usage of SGD over Adam in the community for domain adversarial training.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce an enormous dataset HaGRID (HAnd Gesture Recognition Image Dataset) for hand gesture recognition (HGR) systems. This dataset contains 552,992 samples divided into 18 classes of gestures. The annotations consist of bounding boxes of hands with gesture labels and markups of leading hands. The proposed dataset allows for building HGR systems, which can be used in video conferencing services, home automation systems, the automotive sector, services for people with speech and hearing impairments, etc. We are especially focused on interaction with devices to manage them. That is why all 18 chosen gestures are functional, familiar to the majority of people, and may be an incentive to take some action. In addition, we used crowdsourcing platforms to collect the dataset and took into account various parameters to ensure data diversity. We describe the challenges of using existing HGR datasets for our task and provide a detailed overview of them. Furthermore, the baselines for the hand detection and gesture classification tasks are proposed.

- **Summary**: Visual domain adaptation (DA) seeks to transfer trained models to unseen, unlabeled domains across distribution shift, but approaches typically focus on adapting convolutional neural network architectures initialized with supervised ImageNet representations. In this work, we shift focus to adapting modern architectures for object recognition -- the increasingly popular Vision Transformer (ViT) -- and modern pretraining based on self-supervised learning (SSL). Inspired by the design of recent SSL approaches based on learning from partial image inputs generated via masking or cropping -- either by learning to predict the missing pixels, or learning representational invariances to such augmentations -- we propose PACMAC, a simple two-stage adaptation algorithm for self-supervised ViTs. PACMAC first performs in-domain SSL on pooled source and target data to learn task-discriminative features, and then probes the model's predictive consistency across a set of partial target inputs generated via a novel attention-conditioned masking strategy, to identify reliable candidates for self-training. Our simple approach leads to consistent performance gains over competing methods that use ViTs and self-supervised initializations on standard object recognition benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Online knowledge distillation conducts knowledge transfer among all student models to alleviate the reliance on pre-trained models. However, existing online methods rely heavily on the prediction distributions and neglect the further exploration of the representational knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-scale Feature Extraction and Fusion method (MFEF) for online knowledge distillation, which comprises three key components: Multi-scale Feature Extraction, Dual-attention and Feature Fusion, towards generating more informative feature maps for distillation. The multiscale feature extraction exploiting divide-and-concatenate in channel dimension is proposed to improve the multi-scale representation ability of feature maps. To obtain more accurate information, we design a dual-attention to strengthen the important channel and spatial regions adaptively. Moreover, we aggregate and fuse the former processed feature maps via feature fusion to assist the training of student models. Extensive experiments on CIF AR-10, CIF AR-100, and CINIC-10 show that MFEF transfers more beneficial representational knowledge for distillation and outperforms alternative methods among various network architectures

- **Summary**: Object detection has made substantial progress in the last decade, due to the capability of convolution in extracting local context of objects. However, the scales of objects are diverse and current convolution can only process single-scale input. The capability of traditional convolution with a fixed receptive field in dealing with such a scale variance problem, is thus limited. Multi-scale feature representation has been proven to be an effective way to mitigate the scale variance problem. Recent researches mainly adopt partial connection with certain scales, or aggregate features from all scales and focus on the global information across the scales. However, the information across spatial and depth dimensions is ignored. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-scale convolution (MSConv) to handle this problem. Taking into consideration scale, spatial and depth information at the same time, MSConv is able to process multi-scale input more comprehensively. MSConv is effective and computationally efficient, with only a small increase of computational cost. For most of the single-stage object detectors, replacing the traditional convolutions with MSConvs in the detection head can bring more than 2.5\% improvement in AP (on COCO 2017 dataset), with only 3\% increase of FLOPs. MSConv is also flexible and effective for two-stage object detectors. When extended to the mainstream two-stage object detectors, MSConv can bring up to 3.0\% improvement in AP. Our best model under single-scale testing achieves 48.9\% AP on COCO 2017 \textit{test-dev} split, which surpasses many state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Neural networks for image classification tasks assume that any given image during inference belongs to one of the training classes. This closed-set assumption is challenged in real-world applications where models may encounter inputs of unknown classes. Open-set recognition aims to solve this problem by rejecting unknown classes while classifying known classes correctly. In this paper, we propose to utilize gradient-based representations obtained from a known classifier to train an unknown detector with instances of known classes only. Gradients correspond to the amount of model updates required to properly represent a given sample, which we exploit to understand the model's capability to characterize inputs with its learned features. Our approach can be utilized with any classifier trained in a supervised manner on known classes without the need to model the distribution of unknown samples explicitly. We show that our gradient-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.6% in open-set classification.

- **Summary**: Though the state-of-the architectures for semantic segmentation, such as HRNet, demonstrate impressive accuracy, the complexity arising from their salient design choices hinders a range of model acceleration tools, and further they make use of operations that are inefficient on current hardware. This paper demonstrates that a simple encoder-decoder architecture with a ResNet-like backbone and a small multi-scale head, performs on-par or better than complex semantic segmentation architectures such as HRNet, FANet and DDRNets. Naively applying deep backbones designed for Image Classification to the task of Semantic Segmentation leads to sub-par results, owing to a much smaller effective receptive field of these backbones. Implicit among the various design choices put forth in works like HRNet, DDRNet, and FANet are networks with a large effective receptive field. It is natural to ask if a simple encoder-decoder architecture would compare favorably if comprised of backbones that have a larger effective receptive field, though without the use of inefficient operations like dilated convolutions. We show that with minor and inexpensive modifications to ResNets, enlarging the receptive field, very simple and competitive baselines can be created for Semantic Segmentation. We present a family of such simple architectures for desktop as well as mobile targets, which match or exceed the performance of complex models on the Cityscapes dataset. We hope that our work provides simple yet effective baselines for practitioners to develop efficient semantic segmentation models.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training (AT) is the de facto method for building robust neural networks, but it can be computationally expensive. To mitigate this, fast single-step attacks can be used, but this may lead to catastrophic overfitting (CO). This phenomenon appears when networks gain non-trivial robustness during the first stages of AT, but then reach a breaking point where they become vulnerable in just a few iterations. The mechanisms that lead to this failure mode are still poorly understood. In this work, we study the onset of CO in single-step AT methods through controlled modifications of typical datasets of natural images. In particular, we show that CO can be induced at much smaller $\epsilon$ values than it was observed before just by injecting images with seemingly innocuous features. These features aid non-robust classification but are not enough to achieve robustness on their own. Through extensive experiments we analyze this novel phenomenon and discover that the presence of these easy features induces a learning shortcut that leads to CO. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CO and improve our understanding of the dynamics of AT. The code to reproduce our experiments can be found at https://github.com/gortizji/co_features.

- **Summary**: We propose to utilize gradients for detecting adversarial and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce confounding labels -- labels that differ from normal labels seen during training -- in gradient generation to probe the effective expressivity of neural networks. Gradients depict the amount of change required for a model to properly represent given inputs, providing insight into the representational power of the model established by network architectural properties as well as training data. By introducing a label of different design, we remove the dependency on ground truth labels for gradient generation during inference. We show that our gradient-based approach allows for capturing the anomaly in inputs based on the effective expressivity of the models with no hyperparameter tuning or additional processing, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for adversarial and out-of-distribution detection.

- **Summary**: The detection of new multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions is an important marker of the evolution of the disease. The applicability of learning-based methods could automate this task efficiently. However, the lack of annotated longitudinal data with new-appearing lesions is a limiting factor for the training of robust and generalizing models. In this work, we describe a deep-learning-based pipeline addressing the challenging task of detecting and segmenting new MS lesions. First, we propose to use transfer-learning from a model trained on a segmentation task using single time-points. Therefore, we exploit knowledge from an easier task and for which more annotated datasets are available. Second, we propose a data synthesis strategy to generate realistic longitudinal time-points with new lesions using single time-point scans. In this way, we pretrain our detection model on large synthetic annotated datasets. Finally, we use a data-augmentation technique designed to simulate data diversity in MRI. By doing that, we increase the size of the available small annotated longitudinal datasets. Our ablation study showed that each contribution lead to an enhancement of the segmentation accuracy. Using the proposed pipeline, we obtained the best score for the segmentation and the detection of new MS lesions in the MSSEG2 MICCAI challenge.

- **Summary**: The aetiology of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) involves multiple carcinogens such as alcohol, tobacco and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). As the HPV infection influences the prognosis, treatment and survival of patients with HNSCC, it is important to determine the HPV status of these tumours. In this paper, we propose a novel triplet-ranking loss function and a multiple instance learning pipeline for HPV status prediction. This achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in HPV detection using only the routine H&E stained WSIs on two HNSCC cohorts. Furthermore, a comprehensive tumour microenvironment profiling was performed, which characterised the unique patterns between HPV+/- HNSCC from genomic, immunology and cellular perspectives. Positive correlations of the proposed score with different subtypes of T cells (e.g. T cells follicular helper, CD8+ T cells), and negative correlations with macrophages and connective cells (e.g. fibroblast) were identified, which is in line with clinical findings. Unique gene expression profiles were also identified with respect to HPV infection status, and is in line with existing findings.

- **Summary**: In this paper we investigate Charon's craters size distribution using a deep learning model. This is motivated by the recent results of Singer et al. (2019) who, using manual cataloging, found a change in the size distribution slope of craters smaller than 12 km in diameter, translating into a paucity of small Kuiper Belt objects. These results were corroborated by Robbins and Singer (2021), but opposed by Morbidelli et al. (2021), necessitating an independent review. Our MaskRCNN-based ensemble of models was trained on Lunar, Mercurian, and Martian crater catalogues and both optical and digital elevation images. We use a robust image augmentation scheme to force the model to generalize and transfer-learn into icy objects. With no prior bias or exposure to Charon, our model find best fit slopes of q =-1.47+-0.33 for craters smaller than 10 km, and q =-2.91+-0.51 for craters larger than 15 km. These values indicate a clear change in slope around 15 km as suggested by Singer et al. (2019) and thus independently confirm their conclusions. Our slopes however are both slightly flatter than those found more recently by Robbins and Singer (2021). Our trained models and relevant codes are available online on github.com/malidib/ACID .

- **Summary**: Video capsule endoscopy is a hot topic in computer vision and medicine. Deep learning can have a positive impact on the future of video capsule endoscopy technology. It can improve the anomaly detection rate, reduce physicians' time for screening, and aid in real-world clinical analysis. CADx classification system for video capsule endoscopy has shown a great promise for further improvement. For example, detection of cancerous polyp and bleeding can lead to swift medical response and improve the survival rate of the patients. To this end, an automated CADx system must have high throughput and decent accuracy. In this paper, we propose FocalConvNet, a focal modulation network integrated with lightweight convolutional layers for the classification of small bowel anatomical landmarks and luminal findings. FocalConvNet leverages focal modulation to attain global context and allows global-local spatial interactions throughout the forward pass. Moreover, the convolutional block with its intrinsic inductive/learning bias and capacity to extract hierarchical features allows our FocalConvNet to achieve favourable results with high throughput. We compare our FocalConvNet with other SOTA on Kvasir-Capsule, a large-scale VCE dataset with 44,228 frames with 13 classes of different anomalies. Our proposed method achieves the weighted F1-score, recall and MCC} of 0.6734, 0.6373 and 0.2974, respectively outperforming other SOTA methodologies. Furthermore, we report the highest throughput of 148.02 images/second rate to establish the potential of FocalConvNet in a real-time clinical environment. The code of the proposed FocalConvNet is available at https://github.com/NoviceMAn-prog/FocalConvNet.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks in deep learning models, especially for safety-critical systems, are gaining more and more attention in recent years, due to the lack of trust in the security and robustness of AI models. Yet the more primitive adversarial attacks might be physically infeasible or require some resources that are hard to access like the training data, which motivated the emergence of patch attacks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview to cover existing techniques of adversarial patch attacks, aiming to help interested researchers quickly catch up with the progress in this field. We also discuss existing techniques for developing detection and defences against adversarial patches, aiming to help the community better understand this field and its applications in the real world.

- **Summary**: An optical microscopic examination of thinly cut stained tissue on glass slides prepared from a FFPE tissue blocks is the gold standard for tissue diagnostics. In addition, the diagnostic abilities and expertise of any pathologist is dependent on their direct experience with common as well as rarer variant morphologies. Recently, deep learning approaches have been used to successfully show a high level of accuracy for such tasks. However, obtaining expert-level annotated images is an expensive and time-consuming task and artificially synthesized histological images can prove greatly beneficial. Here, we present an approach to not only generate histological images that reproduce the diagnostic morphologic features of common disease but also provide a user ability to generate new and rare morphologies. Our approach involves developing a generative adversarial network model that synthesizes pathology images constrained by class labels. We investigated the ability of this framework in synthesizing realistic prostate and colon tissue images and assessed the utility of these images in augmenting diagnostic ability of machine learning methods as well as their usability by a panel of experienced anatomic pathologists. Synthetic data generated by our framework performed similar to real data in training a deep learning model for diagnosis. Pathologists were not able to distinguish between real and synthetic images and showed a similar level of inter-observer agreement for prostate cancer grading. We extended the approach to significantly more complex images from colon biopsies and showed that the complex microenvironment in such tissues can also be reproduced. Finally, we present the ability for a user to generate deepfake histological images via a simple markup of sematic labels.

- **Summary**: We introduce SoundSpaces 2.0, a platform for on-the-fly geometry-based audio rendering for 3D environments. Given a 3D mesh of a real-world environment, SoundSpaces can generate highly realistic acoustics for arbitrary sounds captured from arbitrary microphone locations. Together with existing 3D visual assets, it supports an array of audio-visual research tasks, such as audio-visual navigation, mapping, source localization and separation, and acoustic matching. Compared to existing resources, SoundSpaces 2.0 has the advantages of allowing continuous spatial sampling, generalization to novel environments, and configurable microphone and material properties. To our knowledge, this is the first geometry-based acoustic simulation that offers high fidelity and realism while also being fast enough to use for embodied learning. We showcase the simulator's properties and benchmark its performance against real-world audio measurements. In addition, we demonstrate two downstream tasks -- embodied navigation and far-field automatic speech recognition -- and highlight sim2real performance for the latter. SoundSpaces 2.0 is publicly available to facilitate wider research for perceptual systems that can both see and hear.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) for image classification are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. And, the adversarial examples have transferability, which means an adversarial example for a DNN model can fool another black-box model with a non-trivial probability. This gave birth of the transfer-based adversarial attack where the adversarial examples generated by a pretrained or known model (called surrogate model) are used to conduct black-box attack. There are some work on how to generate the adversarial examples from a given surrogate model to achieve better transferability. However, training a special surrogate model to generate adversarial examples with better transferability is relatively under-explored. In this paper, we propose a method of training a surrogate model with abundant dark knowledge to boost the adversarial transferability of the adversarial examples generated by the surrogate model. This trained surrogate model is named dark surrogate model (DSM), and the proposed method to train DSM consists of two key components: a teacher model extracting dark knowledge and providing soft labels, and the mixing augmentation skill which enhances the dark knowledge of training data. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show that the proposed method can substantially improve the adversarial transferability of surrogate model across different architectures of surrogate model and optimizers for generating adversarial examples. We also show that the proposed method can be applied to other scenarios of transfer-based attack that contain dark knowledge, like face verification.

- **Summary**: Learning visual representations through self-supervision is an extremely challenging task as the network needs to sieve relevant patterns from spurious distractors without the active guidance provided by supervision. This is achieved through heavy data augmentation, large-scale datasets and prohibitive amounts of compute. Video self-supervised learning (SSL) suffers from added challenges: video datasets are typically not as large as image datasets, compute is an order of magnitude larger, and the amount of spurious patterns the optimizer has to sieve through is multiplied several fold. Thus, directly learning self-supervised representations from video data might result in sub-optimal performance. To address this, we propose to utilize a strong image-based model, pre-trained with self- or language supervision, in a video representation learning framework, enabling the model to learn strong spatial and temporal information without relying on the video labeled data. To this end, we modify the typical video-based SSL design and objective to encourage the video encoder to \textit{subsume} the semantic content of an image-based model trained on a general domain. The proposed algorithm is shown to learn much more efficiently (i.e. in less epochs and with a smaller batch) and results in a new state-of-the-art performance on standard downstream tasks among single-modality SSL methods.

- **Summary**: We present a system for realistic one-shot mesh-based human head avatars creation, ROME for short. Using a single photograph, our model estimates a person-specific head mesh and the associated neural texture, which encodes both local photometric and geometric details. The resulting avatars are rigged and can be rendered using a neural network, which is trained alongside the mesh and texture estimators on a dataset of in-the-wild videos. In the experiments, we observe that our system performs competitively both in terms of head geometry recovery and the quality of renders, especially for the cross-person reenactment.

- **Summary**: Image super-resolution is an important research area in computer vision that has a wide variety of applications including surveillance, medical imaging etc. Real-world signal image super-resolution has become very popular now-a-days due to its real-time application. There are still a lot of scopes to improve real-world single image super-resolution specially during challenging weather scenarios. In this paper, we have proposed a new algorithm to perform real-world single image super-resolution during rainy condition. Our proposed method can mitigate the influence of rainy conditions during image super-resolution. Our experiment results show that our proposed algorithm can perform image super-resolution decreasing the negative effects of the rain.

- **Summary**: By leveraging contrastive learning, clustering, and other pretext tasks, unsupervised methods for learning image representations have reached impressive results on standard benchmarks. The result has been a crowded field - many methods with substantially different implementations yield results that seem nearly identical on popular benchmarks, such as linear evaluation on ImageNet. However, a single result does not tell the whole story. In this paper, we compare methods using performance-based benchmarks such as linear evaluation, nearest neighbor classification, and clustering for several different datasets, demonstrating the lack of a clear front-runner within the current state-of-the-art. In contrast to prior work that performs only supervised vs. unsupervised comparison, we compare several different unsupervised methods against each other. To enrich this comparison, we analyze embeddings with measurements such as uniformity, tolerance, and centered kernel alignment (CKA), and propose two new metrics of our own: nearest neighbor graph similarity and linear prediction overlap. We reveal through our analysis that in isolation, single popular methods should not be treated as though they represent the field as a whole, and that future work ought to consider how to leverage the complimentary nature of these methods. We also leverage CKA to provide a framework to robustly quantify augmentation invariance, and provide a reminder that certain types of invariance will be undesirable for downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is a challenging task requiring systems to generate photorealistic images of scenes from new viewpoints, where both quality and speed are important for applications. Previous image-based rendering (IBR) methods are fast, but have poor quality when input views are sparse. Recent Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and generalizable variants give impressive results but are not real-time. In our paper, we propose a generalizable NVS method with sparse inputs, called FWD, which gives high-quality synthesis in real-time. With explicit depth and differentiable rendering, it achieves competitive results to the SOTA methods with 130-1000x speedup and better perceptual quality. If available, we can seamlessly integrate sensor depth during either training or inference to improve image quality while retaining real-time speed. With the growing prevalence of depths sensors, we hope that methods making use of depth will become increasingly useful.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based architectures have become competitive across a variety of visual domains, most notably images and videos. While prior work studies these modalities in isolation, having a common architecture suggests that one can train a single unified model for multiple visual modalities. Prior attempts at unified modeling typically use architectures tailored for vision tasks, or obtain worse performance compared to single modality models. In this work, we show that masked autoencoding can be used to train a simple Vision Transformer on images and videos, without requiring any labeled data. This single model learns visual representations that are comparable to or better than single-modality representations on both image and video benchmarks, while using a much simpler architecture. Furthermore, this model can be learned by dropping 90% of the image and 95% of the video patches, enabling extremely fast training of huge model architectures. In particular, we show that our single ViT-Huge model can be finetuned to achieve 86.6% on ImageNet and 75.5% on the challenging Something Something-v2 video benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Existing GAN inversion and editing methods work well for aligned objects with a clean background, such as portraits and animal faces, but often struggle for more difficult categories with complex scene layouts and object occlusions, such as cars, animals, and outdoor images. We propose a new method to invert and edit such complex images in the latent space of GANs, such as StyleGAN2. Our key idea is to explore inversion with a collection of layers, spatially adapting the inversion process to the difficulty of the image. We learn to predict the "invertibility" of different image segments and project each segment into a latent layer. Easier regions can be inverted into an earlier layer in the generator's latent space, while more challenging regions can be inverted into a later feature space. Experiments show that our method obtains better inversion results compared to the recent approaches on complex categories, while maintaining downstream editability.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is a necessity to enhance data efficiency in deep learning. For vision-language pre-training, data is only augmented either for images or for text in previous works. In this paper, we present MixGen: a joint data augmentation for vision-language representation learning to further improve data efficiency. It generates new image-text pairs with semantic relationships preserved by interpolating images and concatenating text. It's simple, and can be plug-and-played into existing pipelines. We evaluate MixGen on four architectures, including CLIP, ViLT, ALBEF and TCL, across five downstream vision-language tasks to show its versatility and effectiveness. For example, adding MixGen in ALBEF pre-training leads to absolute performance improvements on downstream tasks: image-text retrieval (+6.2% on COCO fine-tuned and +5.3% on Flicker30K zero-shot), visual grounding (+0.9% on RefCOCO+), visual reasoning (+$0.9% on NLVR2), visual question answering (+0.3% on VQA2.0), and visual entailment (+0.4% on SNLI-VE).

- **Summary**: Capitalizing on the recent advances in image generation models, existing controllable face image synthesis methods are able to generate high-fidelity images with some levels of controllability, e.g., controlling the shapes, expressions, textures, and poses of the generated face images. However, these methods focus on 2D image generative models, which are prone to producing inconsistent face images under large expression and pose changes. In this paper, we propose a new NeRF-based conditional 3D face synthesis framework, which enables 3D controllability over the generated face images by imposing explicit 3D conditions from 3D face priors. At its core is a conditional Generative Occupancy Field (cGOF) that effectively enforces the shape of the generated face to commit to a given 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) mesh. To achieve accurate control over fine-grained 3D face shapes of the synthesized image, we additionally incorporate a 3D landmark loss as well as a volume warping loss into our synthesis algorithm. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is able to generate high-fidelity face images and shows more precise 3D controllability than state-of-the-art 2D-based controllable face synthesis methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce a unified framework for group equivariant networks on homogeneous spaces derived from a Fourier perspective. We consider tensor-valued feature fields, before and after a convolutional layer. We present a unified derivation of kernels via the Fourier domain by leveraging the sparsity of Fourier coefficients of the lifted feature fields. The sparsity emerges when the stabilizer subgroup of the homogeneous space is a compact Lie group. We further introduce a nonlinear activation, via an elementwise nonlinearity on the regular representation after lifting and projecting back to the field through an equivariant convolution. We show that other methods treating features as the Fourier coefficients in the stabilizer subgroup are special cases of our activation. Experiments on $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$ show state-of-the-art performance in spherical vector field regression, point cloud classification, and molecular completion.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recovering the spatial layout of the cameras and the geometry of the scene from extreme-view images is a longstanding challenge in computer vision. Prevailing 3D reconstruction algorithms often adopt the image matching paradigm and presume that a portion of the scene is co-visible across images, yielding poor performance when there is little overlap among inputs. In contrast, humans can associate visible parts in one image to the corresponding invisible components in another image via prior knowledge of the shapes. Inspired by this fact, we present a novel concept called virtual correspondences (VCs). VCs are a pair of pixels from two images whose camera rays intersect in 3D. Similar to classic correspondences, VCs conform with epipolar geometry; unlike classic correspondences, VCs do not need to be co-visible across views. Therefore VCs can be established and exploited even if images do not overlap. We introduce a method to find virtual correspondences based on humans in the scene. We showcase how VCs can be seamlessly integrated with classic bundle adjustment to recover camera poses across extreme views. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose estimation methods in challenging scenarios and is comparable in the traditional densely captured setup. Our approach also unleashes the potential of multiple downstream tasks such as scene reconstruction from multi-view stereo and novel view synthesis in extreme-view scenarios.

- **Summary**: Adapting to a continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably faced by all autonomous driving systems. Existing image and video driving datasets, however, fall short of capturing the mutable nature of the real world. In this paper, we introduce the largest multi-task synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, SHIFT. It presents discrete and continuous shifts in cloudiness, rain and fog intensity, time of day, and vehicle and pedestrian density. Featuring a comprehensive sensor suite and annotations for several mainstream perception tasks, SHIFT allows investigating the degradation of a perception system performance at increasing levels of domain shift, fostering the development of continuous adaptation strategies to mitigate this problem and assess model robustness and generality. Our dataset and benchmark toolkit are publicly available at www.vis.xyz/shift.

- **Summary**: Capturing general deforming scenes from monocular RGB video is crucial for many computer graphics and vision applications. However, current approaches suffer from drawbacks such as struggling with large scene deformations, inaccurate shape completion or requiring 2D point tracks. In contrast, our method, Ub4D, handles large deformations, performs shape completion in occluded regions, and can operate on monocular RGB videos directly by using differentiable volume rendering. This technique includes three new in the context of non-rigid 3D reconstruction components, i.e., 1) A coordinate-based and implicit neural representation for non-rigid scenes, which in conjunction with differentiable volume rendering enables an unbiased reconstruction of dynamic scenes, 2) a proof that extends the unbiased formulation of volume rendering to dynamic scenes, and 3) a novel dynamic scene flow loss, which enables the reconstruction of larger deformations by leveraging the coarse estimates of other methods. Results on our new dataset, which will be made publicly available, demonstrate a clear improvement over the state of the art in terms of surface reconstruction accuracy and robustness to large deformations.

- **Summary**: Contemporary artificial neural networks (ANN) are trained end-to-end, jointly learning both features and classifiers for the task of interest. Though enormously effective, this paradigm imposes significant costs in assembling annotated task-specific datasets and training large-scale networks. We propose to decouple feature learning from downstream lung ultrasound tasks by introducing an auxiliary pre-task of visual biomarker classification. We demonstrate that one can learn an informative, concise, and interpretable feature space from ultrasound videos by training models for predicting biomarker labels. Notably, biomarker feature extractors can be trained from data annotated with weak video-scale supervision. These features can be used by a variety of downstream Expert models targeted for diverse clinical tasks (Diagnosis, lung severity, S/F ratio). Crucially, task-specific expert models are comparable in accuracy to end-to-end models directly trained for such target tasks, while being significantly lower cost to train.

- **Summary**: Advances in animal motion tracking and pose recognition have been a game changer in the study of animal behavior. Recently, an increasing number of works go 'deeper' than tracking, and address automated recognition of animals' internal states such as emotions and pain with the aim of improving animal welfare, making this a timely moment for a systematization of the field. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of computer vision-based research on recognition of affective states and pain in animals, addressing both facial and bodily behavior analysis. We summarize the efforts that have been presented so far within this topic -- classifying them across different dimensions, highlight challenges and research gaps, and provide best practice recommendations for advancing the field, and some future directions for research.

- **Summary**: A simple motion amplification algorithm suitable for real-time applications on mobile devices, including smartphones, is presented. It is based on motion enhancement by moving average differencing (MEMAD), a temporal high-pass filter for video streams. MEMAD can amplify small moving objects or subtle motion in larger objects. It is computationally sufficiently simple to be implemented in real time on smartphones. In the specific implementation as an Android phone app, MEMAD is demonstrated on examples chosen such as to motivate applications in the engineering, biological, and medical sciences.

- **Summary**: Indoor scenes exhibit significant appearance variations due to myriad interactions between arbitrarily diverse object shapes, spatially-changing materials, and complex lighting. Shadows, highlights, and inter-reflections caused by visible and invisible light sources require reasoning about long-range interactions for inverse rendering, which seeks to recover the components of image formation, namely, shape, material, and lighting. In this work, our intuition is that the long-range attention learned by transformer architectures is ideally suited to solve longstanding challenges in single-image inverse rendering. We demonstrate with a specific instantiation of a dense vision transformer, IRISformer, that excels at both single-task and multi-task reasoning required for inverse rendering. Specifically, we propose a transformer architecture to simultaneously estimate depths, normals, spatially-varying albedo, roughness and lighting from a single image of an indoor scene. Our extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results on each of the above tasks, enabling applications like object insertion and material editing in a single unconstrained real image, with greater photorealism than prior works. Code and data are publicly released at https://github.com/ViLab-UCSD/IRISformer.

- **Summary**: The core of everyday tasks like reading and driving is active object recognition. Attempts to model such tasks are currently stymied by the inability to incorporate time. People show a flexible tradeoff between speed and accuracy and this tradeoff is a crucial human skill. Deep neural networks have emerged as promising candidates for predicting peak human object recognition performance and neural activity. However, modeling the temporal dimension i.e., the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT), is essential for them to serve as useful computational models for how humans recognize objects. To this end, we here present the first large-scale (148 observers, 4 neural networks, 8 tasks) dataset of the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) in recognizing ImageNet images. In each human trial, a beep, indicating the desired reaction time, sounds at a fixed delay after the image is presented, and observer's response counts only if it occurs near the time of the beep. In a series of blocks, we test many beep latencies, i.e., reaction times. We observe that human accuracy increases with reaction time and proceed to compare its characteristics with the behavior of several dynamic neural networks that are capable of inference-time adaptive computation. Using FLOPs as an analog for reaction time, we compare networks with humans on curve-fit error, category-wise correlation, and curve steepness, and conclude that cascaded dynamic neural networks are a promising model of human reaction time in object recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: A unique challenge in creating high-quality animatable and relightable 3D avatars of people is modeling human eyes. The challenge of synthesizing eyes is multifold as it requires 1) appropriate representations for the various components of the eye and the periocular region for coherent viewpoint synthesis, capable of representing diffuse, refractive and highly reflective surfaces, 2) disentangling skin and eye appearance from environmental illumination such that it may be rendered under novel lighting conditions, and 3) capturing eyeball motion and the deformation of the surrounding skin to enable re-gazing. These challenges have traditionally necessitated the use of expensive and cumbersome capture setups to obtain high-quality results, and even then, modeling of the eye region holistically has remained elusive. We present a novel geometry and appearance representation that enables high-fidelity capture and photorealistic animation, view synthesis and relighting of the eye region using only a sparse set of lights and cameras. Our hybrid representation combines an explicit parametric surface model for the eyeball with implicit deformable volumetric representations for the periocular region and the interior of the eye. This novel hybrid model has been designed to address the various parts of that challenging facial area - the explicit eyeball surface allows modeling refraction and high-frequency specular reflection at the cornea, whereas the implicit representation is well suited to model lower-frequency skin reflection via spherical harmonics and can represent non-surface structures such as hair or diffuse volumetric bodies, both of which are a challenge for explicit surface models. We show that for high-resolution close-ups of the eye, our model can synthesize high-fidelity animated gaze from novel views under unseen illumination conditions.

- **Summary**: To help customers make better-informed viewing choices, video-streaming services try to moderate their content and provide more visibility into which portions of their movies and TV episodes contain age-appropriate material (e.g., nudity, sex, violence, or drug-use). Supervised models to localize these sensitive activities require large amounts of clip-level labeled data which is hard to obtain, while weakly-supervised models to this end usually do not offer competitive accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Coarse2Fine network designed to make use of readily obtainable video-level weak labels in conjunction with sparse clip-level labels of age-appropriate activities. Our model aggregates frame-level predictions to make video-level classifications and is therefore able to leverage sparse clip-level labels along with video-level labels. Furthermore, by performing frame-level predictions in a hierarchical manner, our approach is able to overcome the label-imbalance problem caused due to the rare-occurrence nature of age-appropriate content. We present comparative results of our approach using 41,234 movies and TV episodes (~3 years of video-content) from 521 sub-genres and 250 countries making it by far the largest-scale empirical analysis of age-appropriate activity localization in long-form videos ever published. Our approach offers 107.2% relative mAP improvement (from 5.5% to 11.4%) over existing state-of-the-art activity-localization approaches.

- **Summary**: Accurate intraoperative diagnosis is essential for providing safe and effective care during brain tumor surgery. Our standard-of-care diagnostic methods are time, resource, and labor intensive, which restricts access to optimal surgical treatments. To address these limitations, we propose an alternative workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH), a rapid optical imaging method, with deep learning-based automated interpretation of SRH images for intraoperative brain tumor diagnosis and real-time surgical decision support. Here, we present OpenSRH, the first public dataset of clinical SRH images from 300+ brain tumors patients and 1300+ unique whole slide optical images. OpenSRH contains data from the most common brain tumors diagnoses, full pathologic annotations, whole slide tumor segmentations, raw and processed optical imaging data for end-to-end model development and validation. We provide a framework for patch-based whole slide SRH classification and inference using weak (i.e. patient-level) diagnostic labels. Finally, we benchmark two computer vision tasks: multiclass histologic brain tumor classification and patch-based contrastive representation learning. We hope OpenSRH will facilitate the clinical translation of rapid optical imaging and real-time ML-based surgical decision support in order to improve the access, safety, and efficacy of cancer surgery in the era of precision medicine.

- **Summary**: Existing unsupervised methods for keypoint learning rely heavily on the assumption that a specific keypoint type (e.g. elbow, digit, abstract geometric shape) appears only once in an image. This greatly limits their applicability, as each instance must be isolated before applying the method-an issue that is never discussed or evaluated. We thus propose a novel method to learn Task-agnostic, UnSupervised Keypoints (TUSK) which can deal with multiple instances. To achieve this, instead of the commonly-used strategy of detecting multiple heatmaps, each dedicated to a specific keypoint type, we use a single heatmap for detection, and enable unsupervised learning of keypoint types through clustering. Specifically, we encode semantics into the keypoints by teaching them to reconstruct images from a sparse set of keypoints and their descriptors, where the descriptors are forced to form distinct clusters in feature space around learned prototypes. This makes our approach amenable to a wider range of tasks than any previous unsupervised keypoint method: we show experiments on multiple-instance detection and classification, object discovery, and landmark detection-all unsupervised-with performance on par with the state of the art, while also being able to deal with multiple instances.

- **Summary**: Human vision involves parsing and representing objects and scenes using structured representations based on part-whole hierarchies. Computer vision and machine learning researchers have recently sought to emulate this capability using capsule networks, reference frames and active predictive coding, but a generative model formulation has been lacking. We introduce Recursive Neural Programs (RNPs), which, to our knowledge, is the first neural generative model to address the part-whole hierarchy learning problem. RNPs model images as hierarchical trees of probabilistic sensory-motor programs that recursively reuse learned sensory-motor primitives to model an image within different reference frames, forming recursive image grammars. We express RNPs as structured variational autoencoders (sVAEs) for inference and sampling, and demonstrate parts-based parsing, sampling and one-shot transfer learning for MNIST, Omniglot and Fashion-MNIST datasets, demonstrating the model's expressive power. Our results show that RNPs provide an intuitive and explainable way of composing objects and scenes, allowing rich compositionality and intuitive interpretations of objects in terms of part-whole hierarchies.

- **Summary**: Segmenting both bone surface and the corresponding acoustic shadow are fundamental tasks in ultrasound (US) guided orthopedic procedures. However, these tasks are challenging due to minimal and blurred bone surface response in US images, cross-machine discrepancy, imaging artifacts, and low signal-to-noise ratio. Notably, bone shadows are caused by a significant acoustic impedance mismatch between the soft tissue and bone surfaces. To leverage this mutual information between these highly related tasks, we propose a single end-to-end network with a shared transformer-based encoder and task independent decoders for simultaneous bone and shadow segmentation. To share complementary features, we propose a cross task feature transfer block which learns to transfer meaningful features from decoder of shadow segmentation to that of bone segmentation and vice-versa. We also introduce a correspondence consistency loss which makes sure that network utilizes the inter-dependency between the bone surface and its corresponding shadow to refine the segmentation. Validation against expert annotations shows that the method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art for both bone surface and shadow segmentation.

- **Summary**: Given a new dataset D and a low compute budget, how should we choose a pre-trained model to fine-tune to D, and set the fine-tuning hyperparameters without risking overfitting, particularly if D is small? Here, we extend automated machine learning (AutoML) to best make these choices. Our domain-independent meta-learning approach learns a zero-shot surrogate model which, at test time, allows to select the right deep learning (DL) pipeline (including the pre-trained model and fine-tuning hyperparameters) for a new dataset D given only trivial meta-features describing D such as image resolution or the number of classes. To train this zero-shot model, we collect performance data for many DL pipelines on a large collection of datasets and meta-train on this data to minimize a pairwise ranking objective. We evaluate our approach under the strict time limit of the vision track of the ChaLearn AutoDL challenge benchmark, clearly outperforming all challenge contenders.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently demonstrated exemplary performance on a variety of vision tasks and are being used as an alternative to CNNs. Their design is based on a self-attention mechanism that processes images as a sequence of patches, which is quite different compared to CNNs. Hence it is interesting to study if ViTs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks happen when an attacker poisons a small part of the training data for malicious purposes. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the attacker can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that ViTs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. We also find an intriguing difference between ViTs and CNNs - interpretation algorithms effectively highlight the trigger on test images for ViTs but not for CNNs. Based on this observation, we propose a test-time image blocking defense for ViTs which reduces the attack success rate by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Due to imaging artifacts and low signal-to-noise ratio in ultrasound images, automatic bone surface segmentation networks often produce fragmented predictions that can hinder the success of ultrasound-guided computer-assisted surgical procedures. Existing pixel-wise predictions often fail to capture the accurate topology of bone tissues due to a lack of supervision to enforce connectivity. In this work, we propose an orientation-guided graph convolutional network to improve connectivity while segmenting the bone surface. We also propose an additional supervision on the orientation of the bone surface to further impose connectivity. We validated our approach on 1042 vivo US scans of femur, knee, spine, and distal radius. Our approach improves over the state-of-the-art methods by 5.01% in connectivity metric.

- **Summary**: Editing flat-looking images into stunning photographs requires skill and time. Automated image enhancement algorithms have attracted increased interest by generating high-quality images without user interaction. However, the quality assessment of a photograph is subjective. Even in tone and color adjustments, a single photograph of auto-enhancement is challenging to fit user preferences which are subtle and even changeable. To address this problem, we present a semiautomatic image enhancement algorithm that can generate high-quality images with multiple styles by controlling a few parameters. We first disentangle photo retouching skills from high-quality images and build an efficient enhancement system for each skill. Specifically, an encoder-decoder framework encodes the retouching skills into latent codes and decodes them into the parameters of image signal processing (ISP) functions. The ISP functions are computationally efficient and consist of only 19 parameters. Despite our approach requiring multiple inferences to obtain the desired result, experimental results present that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on the benchmark dataset for image quality and model efficiency.

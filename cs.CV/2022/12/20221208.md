- **Summary**: Multi-label ranking maps instances to a ranked set of predicted labels from multiple possible classes. The ranking approach for multi-label learning problems received attention for its success in multi-label classification, with one of the well-known approaches being pairwise label ranking. However, most existing methods assume that only partial information about the preference relation is known, which is inferred from the partition of labels into a positive and negative set, then treat labels with equal importance. In this paper, we focus on the unique challenge of ranking when the order of the true label set is provided. We propose a novel dedicated loss function to optimize models by incorporating penalties for incorrectly ranked pairs, and make use of the ranking information present in the input. Our method achieves the best reported performance measures on both synthetic and real world ranked datasets and shows improvements on overall ranking of labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is generalizable to a variety of multi-label classification and ranking tasks, while revealing a calibration towards a certain ranking ordering.

- **Summary**: Facial action units (FAUs) are critical for fine-grained facial expression analysis. Although FAU detection has been actively studied using ideally high quality images, it was not thoroughly studied under heavily occluded conditions. In this paper, we propose the first occlusion-robust FAU recognition method to maintain FAU detection performance under heavy occlusions. Our novel approach takes advantage of rich information from the latent space of masked autoencoder (MAE) and transforms it into FAU features. Bypassing the occlusion reconstruction step, our model efficiently extracts FAU features of occluded faces by mining the latent space of a pretrained masked autoencoder. Both node and edge-level knowledge distillation are also employed to guide our model to find a mapping between latent space vectors and FAU features. Facial occlusion conditions, including random small patches and large blocks, are thoroughly studied. Experimental results on BP4D and DISFA datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performances under the studied facial occlusion, significantly outperforming existing baseline methods. In particular, even under heavy occlusion, the proposed method can achieve comparable performance as state-of-the-art methods under normal conditions.

- **Summary**: The aim of this research is to review the state of computer vision as applied to combatting forest fires. My motivation to research this topic comes from the urgency with which new participants and stakeholders require guidance in this field. One of these new stakeholder groups are practitioners of machine learning that lack domain expertise. Introducing these new entrants to domain specific datasets and methods is critical to supporting this aim as general computer vision datasets are insufficient to support specialized research initiatives. The overarching aim of the research is to introduce datasets and methods to make them more accessible to the community.

- **Summary**: We study a challenging task, conditional human motion generation, which produces plausible human motion sequences according to various conditional inputs, such as action classes or textual descriptors. Since human motions are highly diverse and have a property of quite different distribution from conditional modalities, such as textual descriptors in natural languages, it is hard to learn a probabilistic mapping from the desired conditional modality to the human motion sequences. Besides, the raw motion data from the motion capture system might be redundant in sequences and contain noises; directly modeling the joint distribution over the raw motion sequences and conditional modalities would need a heavy computational overhead and might result in artifacts introduced by the captured noises. To learn a better representation of the various human motion sequences, we first design a powerful Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and arrive at a representative and low-dimensional latent code for a human motion sequence. Then, instead of using a diffusion model to establish the connections between the raw motion sequences and the conditional inputs, we perform a diffusion process on the motion latent space. Our proposed Motion Latent-based Diffusion model (MLD) could produce vivid motion sequences conforming to the given conditional inputs and substantially reduce the computational overhead in both the training and inference stages. Extensive experiments on various human motion generation tasks demonstrate that our MLD achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods among extensive human motion generation tasks, with two orders of magnitude faster than previous diffusion models on raw motion sequences.

- **Summary**: As more and more artificial intelligence (AI) technologies move from the laboratory to real-world applications, the open-set and robustness challenges brought by data from the real world have received increasing attention. Data augmentation is a widely used method to improve model performance, and some recent works have also confirmed its positive effect on the robustness of AI models. However, most of the existing data augmentation methods are heuristic, lacking the exploration of their internal mechanisms. We apply the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, explore the internal mechanisms of popular data augmentation methods, analyze the relationship between game interactions and some widely used robustness metrics, and propose a new proxy for model robustness in the open-set environment. Based on the analysis of the internal mechanisms, we develop a mask-based boosting method for data augmentation that comprehensively improves several robustness measures of AI models and beats state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches. Experiments show that our method can be widely applied to many popular data augmentation methods. Different from the adversarial training, our boosting method not only significantly improves the robustness of models, but also improves the accuracy of test sets.

- **Summary**: IoT sensors, especially video cameras, are ubiquitously deployed around the world to perform a variety of computer vision tasks in several verticals including retail, healthcare, safety and security, transportation, manufacturing, etc. To amortize their high deployment effort and cost, it is desirable to perform multiple video analytics tasks, which we refer to as Analytical Units (AUs), off the video feed coming out of every camera. In this paper, we first show that in a multi-AU setting, changing the camera setting has disproportionate impact on different AUs performance. In particular, the optimal setting for one AU may severely degrade the performance for another AU, and further the impact on different AUs varies as the environmental condition changes. We then present Elixir, a system to enhance the video stream quality for multiple analytics on a video stream. Elixir leverages Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL), where the RL agent caters to the objectives from different AUs and adjusts the camera setting to simultaneously enhance the performance of all AUs. To define the multiple objectives in MORL, we develop new AU-specific quality estimator values for each individual AU. We evaluate Elixir through real-world experiments on a testbed with three cameras deployed next to each other (overlooking a large enterprise parking lot) running Elixir and two baseline approaches, respectively. Elixir correctly detects 7.1% (22,068) and 5.0% (15,731) more cars, 94% (551) and 72% (478) more faces, and 670.4% (4975) and 158.6% (3507) more persons than the default-setting and time-sharing approaches, respectively. It also detects 115 license plates, far more than the time-sharing approach (7) and the default setting (0).

- **Summary**: Crowd localization aims to predict the spatial position of humans in a crowd scenario. We observe that the performance of existing methods is challenged from two aspects: (i) ranking inconsistency between test and training phases; and (ii) fixed anchor resolution may underfit or overfit crowd densities of local regions. To address these problems, we design a supervision target reassignment strategy for training to reduce ranking inconsistency and propose an anchor pyramid scheme to adaptively determine the anchor density in each image region. Extensive experimental results on three widely adopted datasets (ShanghaiTech A\&B, JHU-CROWD++, UCF-QNRF) demonstrate the favorable performance against several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Cross-view geo-localization aims to estimate the location of a query ground image by matching it to a reference geo-tagged aerial images database. As an extremely challenging task, its difficulties root in the drastic view changes and different capturing time between two views. Despite these difficulties, recent works achieve outstanding progress on cross-view geo-localization benchmarks. However, existing methods still suffer from poor performance on the cross-area benchmarks, in which the training and testing data are captured from two different regions. We attribute this deficiency to the lack of ability to extract the spatial configuration of visual feature layouts and models' overfitting on low-level details from the training set. In this paper, we propose GeoDTR which explicitly disentangles geometric information from raw features and learns the spatial correlations among visual features from aerial and ground pairs with a novel geometric layout extractor module. This module generates a set of geometric layout descriptors, modulating the raw features and producing high-quality latent representations. In addition, we elaborate on two categories of data augmentations, (i) Layout simulation, which varies the spatial configuration while keeping the low-level details intact. (ii) Semantic augmentation, which alters the low-level details and encourages the model to capture spatial configurations. These augmentations help to improve the performance of the cross-view geo-localization models, especially on the cross-area benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a counterfactual-based learning process to benefit the geometric layout extractor in exploring spatial information. Extensive experiments show that GeoDTR not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also significantly boosts the performance on same-area and cross-area benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study a novel and widely existing problem in graph matching (GM), namely, Bi-level Noisy Correspondence (BNC), which refers to node-level noisy correspondence (NNC) and edge-level noisy correspondence (ENC). In brief, on the one hand, due to the poor recognizability and viewpoint differences between images, it is inevitable to inaccurately annotate some keypoints with offset and confusion, leading to the mismatch between two associated nodes, i.e., NNC. On the other hand, the noisy node-to-node correspondence will further contaminate the edge-to-edge correspondence, thus leading to ENC. For the BNC challenge, we propose a novel method termed Contrastive Matching with Momentum Distillation. Specifically, the proposed method is with a robust quadratic contrastive loss which enjoys the following merits: i) better exploring the node-to-node and edge-to-edge correlations through a GM customized quadratic contrastive learning paradigm; ii) adaptively penalizing the noisy assignments based on the confidence estimated by the momentum teacher. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the robustness of our model compared with 12 competitive baselines.

- **Summary**: This study focuses on using large language models (LLMs) as a planner for embodied agents that can follow natural language instructions to complete complex tasks in a visually-perceived environment. The high data cost and poor sample efficiency of existing methods hinders the development of versatile agents that are capable of many tasks and can learn new tasks quickly. In this work, we propose a novel method, LLM-Planner, that harnesses the power of large language models to do few-shot planning for embodied agents. We further propose a simple but effective way to enhance LLMs with physical grounding to generate and update plans that are grounded in the current environment. Experiments on the ALFRED dataset show that our method can achieve very competitive few-shot performance: Despite using less than 0.5% of paired training data, LLM-Planner achieves competitive performance with recent baselines that are trained using the full training data. Existing methods can barely complete any task successfully under the same few-shot setting. Our work opens the door for developing versatile and sample-efficient embodied agents that can quickly learn many tasks. Website: https://dki-lab.github.io/LLM-Planner

- **Summary**: Changing how pre-trained models behave -- e.g., improving their performance on a downstream task or mitigating biases learned during pre-training -- is a common practice when developing machine learning systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for steering the behavior of neural networks, centered around \textit{task vectors}. A task vector specifies a direction in the weight space of a pre-trained model, such that movement in that direction improves performance on the task. We build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a task. We show that these task vectors can be modified and combined together through arithmetic operations such as negation and addition, and the behavior of the resulting model is steered accordingly. Negating a task vector decreases performance on the target task, with little change in model behavior on control tasks. Moreover, adding task vectors together can improve performance on multiple tasks at once. Finally, when tasks are linked by an analogy relationship of the form ``A is to B as C is to D", combining task vectors from three of the tasks can improve performance on the fourth, even when no data from the fourth task is used for training. Overall, our experiments with several models, modalities and tasks show that task arithmetic is a simple, efficient and effective way of editing models.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised video anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal events in videos using only video-level labels. Recently, two-stage self-training methods have achieved significant improvements by self-generating pseudo labels and self-refining anomaly scores with these labels. As the pseudo labels play a crucial role, we propose an enhancement framework by exploiting completeness and uncertainty properties for effective self-training. Specifically, we first design a multi-head classification module (each head serves as a classifier) with a diversity loss to maximize the distribution differences of predicted pseudo labels across heads. This encourages the generated pseudo labels to cover as many abnormal events as possible. We then devise an iterative uncertainty pseudo label refinement strategy, which improves not only the initial pseudo labels but also the updated ones obtained by the desired classifier in the second stage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches on the UCF-Crime, TAD, and XD-Violence benchmark datasets.



### ALTO: Alternating Latent Topologies for Implicit 3D Reconstruction

- **Summary**: This work introduces alternating latent topologies (ALTO) for high-fidelity reconstruction of implicit 3D surfaces from noisy point clouds. Previous work identifies that the spatial arrangement of latent encodings is important to recover detail. One school of thought is to encode a latent vector for each point (point latents). Another school of thought is to project point latents into a grid (grid latents) which could be a voxel grid or triplane grid. Each school of thought has tradeoffs. Grid latents are coarse and lose high-frequency detail. In contrast, point latents preserve detail. However, point latents are more difficult to decode into a surface, and quality and runtime suffer. In this paper, we propose ALTO to sequentially alternate between geometric representations, before converging to an easy-to-decode latent. We find that this preserves spatial expressiveness and makes decoding lightweight. We validate ALTO on implicit 3D recovery and observe not only a performance improvement over the state-of-the-art, but a runtime improvement of 3-10$\times$.

- **Summary**: Well-annotated medical datasets enable deep neural networks (DNNs) to gain strong power in extracting lesion-related features. Building such large and well-designed medical datasets is costly due to the need for high-level expertise. Model pre-training based on ImageNet is a common practice to gain better generalization when the data amount is limited. However, it suffers from the domain gap between natural and medical images. In this work, we pre-train DNNs on ultrasound (US) domains instead of ImageNet to reduce the domain gap in medical US applications. To learn US image representations based on unlabeled US videos, we propose a novel meta-learning-based contrastive learning method, namely Meta Ultrasound Contrastive Learning (Meta-USCL). To tackle the key challenge of obtaining semantically consistent sample pairs for contrastive learning, we present a positive pair generation module along with an automatic sample weighting module based on meta-learning. Experimental results on multiple computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) problems, including pneumonia detection, breast cancer classification, and breast tumor segmentation, show that the proposed self-supervised method reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA).

- **Summary**: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has demonstrated great success in NLP and 2D image fields because of the high-quality representation ability and transferability of their pretrained models. However, pretraining such a strong model is difficult in the 3D point cloud field since the training data is limited and point cloud collection is expensive. This paper introduces Efficient Point Cloud Learning (EPCL), an effective and efficient point cloud learner for directly training high-quality point cloud models with a frozen CLIP model. Our EPCL connects the 2D and 3D modalities by semantically aligning the 2D features and point cloud features without paired 2D-3D data. Specifically, the input point cloud is divided into a sequence of tokens and directly fed into the frozen CLIP model to learn point cloud representation. Furthermore, we design a task token to narrow the gap between 2D images and 3D point clouds. Comprehensive experiments on 3D detection, semantic segmentation, classification and few-shot learning demonstrate that the 2D CLIP model can be an efficient point cloud backbone and our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both real-world and synthetic downstream tasks. Code will be available.

- **Summary**: Attention-based arbitrary style transfer studies have shown promising performance in synthesizing vivid local style details. They typically use the all-to-all attention mechanism -- each position of content features is fully matched to all positions of style features. However, all-to-all attention tends to generate distorted style patterns and has quadratic complexity, limiting the effectiveness and efficiency of arbitrary style transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel all-to-key attention mechanism -- each position of content features is matched to stable key positions of style features -- that is more in line with the characteristics of style transfer. Specifically, it integrates two newly proposed attention forms: distributed and progressive attention. Distributed attention assigns attention to key style representations that depict the style distribution of local regions; Progressive attention pays attention from coarse-grained regions to fine-grained key positions. The resultant module, dubbed StyA2K, shows extraordinary performance in preserving the semantic structure and rendering consistent style patterns. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.

- **Summary**: Content scanning systems employ perceptual hashing algorithms to scan user content for illegal material, such as child pornography or terrorist recruitment flyers. Perceptual hashing algorithms help determine whether two images are visually similar while preserving the privacy of the input images. Several efforts from industry and academia propose to conduct content scanning on client devices such as smartphones due to the impending roll out of end-to-end encryption that will make server-side content scanning difficult. However, these proposals have met with strong criticism because of the potential for the technology to be misused and re-purposed. Our work informs this conversation by experimentally characterizing the potential for one type of misuse -- attackers manipulating the content scanning system to perform physical surveillance on target locations. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we offer a definition of physical surveillance in the context of client-side image scanning systems; (2) we experimentally characterize this risk and create a surveillance algorithm that achieves physical surveillance rates of >40% by poisoning 5% of the perceptual hash database; (3) we experimentally study the trade-off between the robustness of client-side image scanning systems and surveillance, showing that more robust detection of illegal material leads to increased potential for physical surveillance.

- **Summary**: Most shadow removal methods rely on the invasion of training images associated with laborious and lavish shadow region annotations, leading to the increasing popularity of shadow image synthesis. However, the poor performance also stems from these synthesized images since they are often shadow-inauthentic and details-impaired. In this paper, we present a novel generation framework, referred to as HQSS, for high-quality pseudo shadow image synthesis. The given image is first decoupled into a shadow region identity and a non-shadow region identity. HQSS employs a shadow feature encoder and a generator to synthesize pseudo images. Specifically, the encoder extracts the shadow feature of a region identity which is then paired with another region identity to serve as the generator input to synthesize a pseudo image. The pseudo image is expected to have the shadow feature as its input shadow feature and as well as a real-like image detail as its input region identity. To fulfill this goal, we design three learning objectives. When the shadow feature and input region identity are from the same region identity, we propose a self-reconstruction loss that guides the generator to reconstruct an identical pseudo image as its input. When the shadow feature and input region identity are from different identities, we introduce an inter-reconstruction loss and a cycle-reconstruction loss to make sure that shadow characteristics and detail information can be well retained in the synthesized images. Our HQSS is observed to outperform the state-of-the-art methods on ISTD dataset, Video Shadow Removal dataset, and SRD dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/zysxmu/HQSS.

- **Summary**: Surround-view fisheye perception under valet parking scenes is fundamental and crucial in autonomous driving. Environmental conditions in parking lots perform differently from the common public datasets, such as imperfect light and opacity, which substantially impacts on perception performance. Most existing networks based on public datasets may generalize suboptimal results on these valet parking scenes, also affected by the fisheye distortion. In this article, we introduce a new large-scale fisheye dataset called Fisheye Parking Dataset(FPD) to promote the research in dealing with diverse real-world surround-view parking cases. Notably, our compiled FPD exhibits excellent characteristics for different surround-view perception tasks. In addition, we also propose our real-time distortion-insensitive multi-task framework Fisheye Perception Network (FPNet), which improves the surround-view fisheye BEV perception by enhancing the fisheye distortion operation and multi-task lightweight designs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach and the dataset's exceptional generalizability.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts the final representation from either class token or an average of all patch tokens, following the architecture of Transformer in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. However, studies for the best way of aggregating the patch tokens are still limited to average pooling, while widely-used pooling strategies, such as max and GeM pooling, can be considered. Despite their effectiveness, the existing pooling strategies do not consider the architecture of ViT and the channel-wise difference in the activation maps, aggregating the crucial and trivial channels with the same importance. In this paper, we present Group Generalized Mean (GGeM) pooling as a simple yet powerful pooling strategy for ViT. GGeM divides the channels into groups and computes GeM pooling with a shared pooling parameter per group. As ViT groups the channels via a multi-head attention mechanism, grouping the channels by GGeM leads to lower head-wise dependence while amplifying important channels on the activation maps. Exploiting GGeM shows 0.1%p to 0.7%p performance boosts compared to the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance for ViT-Base and ViT-Large models in ImageNet-1K classification task. Moreover, GGeM outperforms the existing pooling strategies on image retrieval and multi-modal representation learning tasks, demonstrating the superiority of GGeM for a variety of tasks. GGeM is a simple algorithm in that only a few lines of code are necessary for implementation.

- **Summary**: Obtaining the position of ego-vehicle is a crucial prerequisite for automatic control and path planning in the field of autonomous driving. Most existing positioning systems rely on GPS, RTK, or wireless signals, which are arduous to provide effective localization under weak signal conditions. This paper proposes a real-time positioning system based on the detection of the parking numbers as they are unique positioning marks in the parking lot scene. It does not only can help with the positioning with open area, but also run independently under isolation environment. The result tested on both public datasets and self-collected dataset show that the system outperforms others in both performances and applies in practice. In addition, the code and dataset will release later.

- **Summary**: As sharing images in an instant message is a crucial factor, there has been active research on learning a image-text multi-modal dialogue model. However, training a well-generalized multi-modal dialogue model is challenging because existing multi-modal dialogue datasets contain a small number of data, limited topics, and a restricted variety of images per dialogue. In this paper, we present a multi-modal dialogue dataset creation pipeline that involves matching large-scale images to dialogues based on CLIP similarity. Using this automatic pipeline, we propose a large-scale multi-modal dialogue dataset, DialogCC, which covers diverse real-world topics and various images per dialogue. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training a multi-modal dialogue model with our dataset can improve generalization performance. Additionally, existing models trained with our dataset achieve state-of-the-art performance on image and text retrieval tasks. The source code and the dataset will be released after publication.

- **Summary**: Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is a critical component of the autonomous driving perception system, and research in this area has accelerated in recent years. However, there is yet no perfect solution to the vehicle re-identification issue associated with the car's surround-view camera system. Our analysis identifies two significant issues in the aforementioned scenario: i) It is difficult to identify the same vehicle in many picture frames due to the unique construction of the fisheye camera. ii) The appearance of the same vehicle when seen via the surround vision system's several cameras is rather different. To overcome these issues, we suggest an integrative vehicle Re-ID solution method. On the one hand, we provide a technique for determining the consistency of the tracking box drift with respect to the target. On the other hand, we combine a Re-ID network based on the attention mechanism with spatial limitations to increase performance in situations involving multiple cameras. Finally, our approach combines state-of-the-art accuracy with real-time performance. We will soon make the source code and annotated fisheye dataset available.

- **Summary**: Crowd counting is usually handled in a density map regression fashion, which is supervised via a L2 loss between the predicted density map and ground truth. To effectively regulate models, various improved L2 loss functions have been proposed to find a better correspondence between predicted density and annotation positions. In this paper, we propose to predict the density map at one resolution but measure the density map at multiple resolutions. By maximizing the posterior probability in such a setting, we obtain a log-formed multi-resolution L2-difference loss, where the traditional single-resolution L2 loss is its particular case. We mathematically prove it is superior to a single-resolution L2 loss. Without bells and whistles, the proposed loss substantially improves several baselines and performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods on four crowd counting datasets, ShanghaiTech A & B, UCF-QNRF, and JHU-Crowd++.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed a remarkable success of large deep learning models. However, training these models is challenging due to high computational costs, painfully slow convergence, and overfitting issues. In this paper, we present Deep Incubation, a novel approach that enables the efficient and effective training of large models by dividing them into smaller sub-modules that can be trained separately and assembled seamlessly. A key challenge for implementing this idea is to ensure the compatibility of the independently trained sub-modules. To address this issue, we first introduce a global, shared meta model, which is leveraged to implicitly link all the modules together, and can be designed as an extremely small network with negligible computational overhead. Then we propose a module incubation algorithm, which trains each sub-module to replace the corresponding component of the meta model and accomplish a given learning task. Despite the simplicity, our approach effectively encourages each sub-module to be aware of its role in the target large model, such that the finally-learned sub-modules can collaborate with each other smoothly after being assembled. Empirically, our method outperforms end-to-end (E2E) training in terms of both final accuracy and training efficiency. For example, on top of ViT-Huge, it improves the accuracy by 2.7% on ImageNet or achieves similar performance with 4x less training time. Notably, the gains are significant for downstream tasks as well (e.g., object detection and image segmentation on COCO and ADE20K).

- **Summary**: Corals are the primary habitat-building life-form on reefs that support a quarter of the species in the ocean. A coral reef ecosystem usually consists of reefs, each of which is like a tall building in any city. These reef-building corals secrete hard calcareous exoskeletons that give them structural rigidity, and are also a prerequisite for our accurate 3D modeling and semantic mapping using advanced photogrammetric computer vision and machine learning. Underwater videography as a modern underwater remote sensing tool is a high-resolution coral habitat survey and mapping technique. In this paper, detailed 3D mesh models, digital surface models and orthophotos of the coral habitat are generated from the collected coral images and underwater control points. Meanwhile, a novel pixel-wise semantic segmentation approach of orthophotos is performed by advanced deep learning. Finally, the semantic map is mapped into 3D space. For the first time, 3D fine-grained semantic modeling and rugosity evaluation of coral reefs have been completed at millimeter (mm) accuracy. This provides a new and powerful method for understanding the processes and characteristics of coral reef change at high spatial and temporal resolution under climate change.

- **Summary**: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to adapt the source model to continually changing unlabeled target domains without access to the source data. Existing methods mainly focus on model-based adaptation in a self-training manner, such as predicting pseudo labels for new domain datasets. Since pseudo labels are noisy and unreliable, these methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation when dealing with dynamic data distributions. Motivated by the prompt learning in NLP, in this paper, we propose to learn an image-level visual domain prompt for target domains while having the source model parameters frozen. During testing, the changing target datasets can be adapted to the source model by reformulating the input data with the learned visual prompts. Specifically, we devise two types of prompts, i.e., domains-specific prompts and domains-agnostic prompts, to extract current domain knowledge and maintain the domain-shared knowledge in the continual adaptation. Furthermore, we design a homeostasis-based prompt adaptation strategy to suppress domain-sensitive parameters in domain-invariant prompts to learn domain-shared knowledge more effectively. This transition from the model-dependent paradigm to the model-free one enables us to bypass the catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation problems. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used benchmarks, including CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and VLCS datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study two challenging but less-touched problems in image restoration, namely, i) how to quantify the relationship between image degradations and ii) how to improve the performance of a specific restoration task using the quantified relationship. To tackle the first challenge, we proposed a Degradation Relationship Index (DRI) which is defined as the mean drop rate difference in the validation loss between two models which are respectively trained using the anchor degradation and the mixture of the anchor and the auxiliary degradations. Through quantifying the degradation relationship using DRI, we reveal that i) a positive DRI always predicts performance improvement by using the specific degradation as an auxiliary to train models; ii) the degradation proportion is crucial to the image restoration performance. In other words, the restoration performance is improved only if the anchor and the auxiliary degradations are mixed with an appropriate proportion. Based on the observations, we further propose a simple but effective method (dubbed DPD) to estimate whether the given degradation combinations could improve the performance on the anchor degradation with the assistance of the auxiliary degradation. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method in dehazing, denoising, deraining, and desnowing. The code will be released after acceptance.

- **Summary**: Assessing the critical view of safety in laparoscopic cholecystectomy requires accurate identification and localization of key anatomical structures, reasoning about their geometric relationships to one another, and determining the quality of their exposure. Prior works have approached this task by including semantic segmentation as an intermediate step, using predicted segmentation masks to then predict the CVS. While these methods are effective, they rely on extremely expensive ground-truth segmentation annotations and tend to fail when the predicted segmentation is incorrect, limiting generalization. In this work, we propose a method for CVS prediction wherein we first represent a surgical image using a disentangled latent scene graph, then process this representation using a graph neural network. Our graph representations explicitly encode semantic information - object location, class information, geometric relations - to improve anatomy-driven reasoning, as well as visual features to retain differentiability and thereby provide robustness to semantic errors. Finally, to address annotation cost, we propose to train our method using only bounding box annotations, incorporating an auxiliary image reconstruction objective to learn fine-grained object boundaries. We show that our method not only outperforms several baseline methods when trained with bounding box annotations, but also scales effectively when trained with segmentation masks, maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Digital security has been an active area of research interest due to the rapid adaptation of internet infrastructure, the increasing popularity of social media, and digital cameras. Due to inherent differences in working principles to generate an image, different camera brands left behind different intrinsic processing noises which can be used to identify the camera brand. In the last decade, many signal processing and deep learning-based methods have been proposed to identify and isolate this noise from the scene details in an image to detect the source camera brand. One prominent solution is to utilize a hierarchical classification system rather than the traditional single-classifier approach. Different individual networks are used for brand-level and model-level source camera identification. This approach allows for better scaling and requires minimal modifications for adding a new camera brand/model to the solution. However, using different full-fledged networks for both brand and model-level classification substantially increases memory consumption and training complexity. Moreover, extracted low-level features from the different network's initial layers often coincide, resulting in redundant weights. To mitigate the training and memory complexity, we propose a classifier-block-level hierarchical system instead of a network-level one for source camera model classification. Our proposed approach not only results in significantly fewer parameters but also retains the capability to add a new camera model with minimal modification. Thorough experimentation on the publicly available Dresden dataset shows that our proposed approach can achieve the same level of state-of-the-art performance but requires fewer parameters compared to a state-of-the-art network-level hierarchical-based system.

- **Summary**: The neuron reconstruction from raw Optical Microscopy (OM) image stacks is the basis of neuroscience. Manual annotation and semi-automatic neuron tracing algorithms are time-consuming and inefficient. Existing deep learning neuron reconstruction methods, although demonstrating exemplary performance, greatly demand complex rule-based components. Therefore, a crucial challenge is designing an end-to-end neuron reconstruction method that makes the overall framework simpler and model training easier. We propose a Neuron Reconstruction Transformer (NRTR) that, discarding the complex rule-based components, views neuron reconstruction as a direct set-prediction problem. To the best of our knowledge, NRTR is the first image-to-set deep learning model for end-to-end neuron reconstruction. In experiments using the BigNeuron and VISoR-40 datasets, NRTR achieves excellent neuron reconstruction results for comprehensive benchmarks and outperforms competitive baselines. Results of extensive experiments indicate that NRTR is effective at showing that neuron reconstruction is viewed as a set-prediction problem, which makes end-to-end model training available.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning is one of the most effective and trending ways to adapt powerful vision-language foundation models like CLIP to downstream datasets by tuning learnable prompt vectors with very few samples. However, although prompt learning achieves excellent performance over in-domain data, it still faces the major challenge of generalizing to unseen classes and domains. Some existing prompt learning methods tackle this issue by adaptively generating different prompts for different tokens or domains but neglecting the ability of learned prompts to generalize to unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning paradigm that directly generates \emph{domain invariant} prompt that can be generalized to unseen domains, called MetaPrompt. Specifically, a dual-modality prompt tuning network is proposed to generate prompts for input from both image and text modalities. With a novel asymmetric contrastive loss, the representation from the original pre-trained vision-language model acts as supervision to enhance the generalization ability of the learned prompt. More importantly, we propose a meta-learning-based prompt tuning algorithm that explicitly constrains the task-specific prompt tuned for one domain or class to also achieve good performance in another domain or class. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets for base-to-new generalization and 4 datasets for domain generalization demonstrate that our method consistently and significantly outperforms existing methods.

- **Summary**: Object detection requires substantial labeling effort for learning robust models. Active learning can reduce this effort by intelligently selecting relevant examples to be annotated. However, selecting these examples properly without introducing a sampling bias with a negative impact on the generalization performance is not straightforward and most active learning techniques can not hold their promises on real-world benchmarks. In our evaluation paper, we focus on active learning techniques without a computational overhead besides inference, something we refer to as zero-cost active learning. In particular, we show that a key ingredient is not only the score on a bounding box level but also the technique used for aggregating the scores for ranking images. We outline our experimental setup and also discuss practical considerations when using active learning for object detection.

- **Summary**: In a rapidly flourishing country like Bangladesh, accidents in unmanned level crossings are increasing daily. This study presents a deep learning-based approach for automating level crossing junctions, ensuring maximum safety. Here, we develop a fully automated technique using computer vision on a microcontroller that will reduce and eliminate level-crossing deaths and accidents. A Raspberry Pi microcontroller detects impending trains using computer vision on live video, and the intersection is closed until the incoming train passes unimpeded. Live video activity recognition and object detection algorithms scan the junction 24/7. Self-regulating microcontrollers control the entire process. When persistent unauthorized activity is identified, authorities, such as police and fire brigade, are notified via automated messages and notifications. The microcontroller evaluates live rail-track data, and arrival and departure times to anticipate ETAs, train position, velocity, and track problems to avoid head-on collisions. This proposed scheme reduces level crossing accidents and fatalities at a lower cost than current market solutions.

However, a model trained on a naive merge of different datasets tends to obtain poor performance due to annotation conflicts and domain divergence.In this paper, we attempt to train a unified model that is expected to perform well across domains on several popularity segmentation datasets.We conduct a detailed analysis of the impact on model generalization from three aspects of data augmentation, training strategies, and model capacity.Based on the analysis, we propose a robust solution that is able to improve model generalization across domains.Our solution ranks 2nd on RVC 2022 semantic segmentation task, with a dataset only 1/3 size of the 1st model used.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for ground plane normal estimation of wheeled vehicles. In practice, the ground plane is dynamically changed due to braking and unstable road surface. As a result, the vehicle pose, especially the pitch angle, is oscillating from subtle to obvious. Thus, estimating ground plane normal is meaningful since it can be encoded to improve the robustness of various autonomous driving tasks (e.g., 3D object detection, road surface reconstruction, and trajectory planning). Our proposed method only uses odometry as input and estimates accurate ground plane normal vectors in real time. Particularly, it fully utilizes the underlying connection between the ego pose odometry (ego-motion) and its nearby ground plane. Built on that, an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is designed to estimate the normal vector in the sensor's coordinate. Thus, our proposed method is simple yet efficient and supports both camera- and inertial-based odometry algorithms. Its usability and the marked improvement of robustness are validated through multiple experiments on public datasets. For instance, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI dataset with the estimated vector error of 0.39{\deg}. Our code is available at github.com/manymuch/ground_normal_filter.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised source-free domain adaptation methods aim to train a model to be used in the target domain utilizing the pretrained source-domain model and unlabeled target-domain data, where the source data may not be accessible due to intellectual property or privacy issues. These methods frequently utilize self-training with pseudo-labeling thresholded by prediction confidence. In a source-free scenario, only supervision comes from target data, and thresholding limits the contribution of the self-training. In this study, we utilize self-training with a mean-teacher approach. The student network is trained with all predictions of the teacher network. Instead of thresholding the predictions, the gradients calculated from the pseudo-labels are weighted based on the reliability of the teacher's predictions. We propose a novel method that uses proxy-based metric learning to estimate reliability. We train a metric network on the encoder features of the teacher network. Since the teacher is updated with the moving average, the encoder feature space is slowly changing. Therefore, the metric network can be updated in training time, which enables end-to-end training. We also propose a metric-based online ClassMix method to augment the input of the student network where the patches to be mixed are decided based on the metric reliability. We evaluated our method in synthetic-to-real and cross-city scenarios. The benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Natural language explanations promise to offer intuitively understandable explanations of a neural network's decision process in complex vision-language tasks, as pursued in recent VL-NLE models. While current models offer impressive performance on task accuracy and explanation plausibility, they suffer from a range of issues: Some models feature a modular design where the explanation generation module is poorly integrated with a separate module for task-answer prediction, employ backbone models trained on limited sets of tasks, or incorporate ad hoc solutions to increase performance on single datasets. We propose to evade these limitations by applying recent advances in large-scale multi-task pretraining of generative Transformer models to the problem of VL-NLE tasks. Our approach outperforms recent models by a large margin, with human annotators preferring the generated explanations over the ground truth in two out of three evaluated datasets. As a novel challenge in VL-NLE research, we propose the problem of multi-task VL-NLE and show that jointly training on multiple tasks can increase the explanation quality. We discuss the ethical implications of high-quality NLE generation and other issues in recent VL-NLE research.

- **Summary**: Accurate recognition of food items along with quality assessment is of paramount importance in the agricultural industry. Such automated systems can speed up the wheel of the food processing sector and save tons of manual labor. In this connection, the recent advancement of Deep learning-based architectures has introduced a wide variety of solutions offering remarkable performance in several classification tasks. In this work, we have exploited the concept of Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks (DenseNets) for fruit quality assessment. The feature propagation towards the deeper layers has enabled the network to tackle the vanishing gradient problems and ensured the reuse of features to learn meaningful insights. Evaluating on a dataset of 19,526 images containing six fruits having three quality grades for each, the proposed pipeline achieved a remarkable accuracy of 99.67%. The robustness of the model was further tested for fruit classification and quality assessment tasks where the model produced a similar performance, which makes it suitable for real-life applications.

- **Summary**: We propose GazeNeRF, a 3D-aware method for the task of gaze redirection. Existing gaze redirection methods operate on 2D images and struggle to generate 3D consistent results. Instead, we build on the intuition that the face region and eyeballs are separate 3D structures that move in a coordinated yet independent fashion. Our method leverages recent advancements in conditional image-based neural radiance fields and proposes a two-stream architecture that predicts volumetric features for the face and eye regions separately. Rigidly transforming the eye features via a 3D rotation matrix provides fine-grained control over the desired gaze angle. The final, redirected image is then attained via differentiable volume compositing. Our experiments show that this architecture outperforms naively conditioned NeRF baselines as well as previous state-of-the-art 2D gaze redirection methods in terms of redirection accuracy and identity preservation.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) and Foundation models have been the go-to recipe for achieving SoTA performance on general benchmarks. However, leveraging these powerful techniques for more complex vision-language tasks, such as cooking applications, with more structured input data, is still little investigated. In this work, we propose to leverage these techniques for structured-text based computational cuisine tasks. Our strategy, dubbed VLPCook, first transforms existing image-text pairs to image and structured-text pairs. This allows to pretrain our VLPCook model using VLP objectives adapted to the strutured data of the resulting datasets, then finetuning it on downstream computational cooking tasks. During finetuning, we also enrich the visual encoder, leveraging pretrained foundation models (e.g. CLIP) to provide local and global textual context. VLPCook outperforms current SoTA by a significant margin (+3.3 Recall@1 absolute improvement) on the task of Cross-Modal Food Retrieval on the large Recipe1M dataset. We conduct further experiments on VLP to validate their importance, especially on the Recipe1M+ dataset. Finally, we validate the generalization of the approach to other tasks (i.e, Food Recognition) and domains with structured text such as the Medical domain on the ROCO dataset.

- **Summary**: Image super-resolution (SR) is a technique to recover lost high-frequency information in low-resolution (LR) images. Spatial-domain information has been widely exploited to implement image SR, so a new trend is to involve frequency-domain information in SR tasks. Besides, image SR is typically application-oriented and various computer vision tasks call for image arbitrary magnification. Therefore, in this paper, we study image features in the frequency domain to design a novel scale-arbitrary image SR network. First, we statistically analyze LR-HR image pairs of several datasets under different scale factors and find that the high-frequency spectra of different images under different scale factors suffer from different degrees of degradation, but the valid low-frequency spectra tend to be retained within a certain distribution range. Then, based on this finding, we devise an adaptive scale-aware feature division mechanism using deep reinforcement learning, which can accurately and adaptively divide the frequency spectrum into the low-frequency part to be retained and the high-frequency one to be recovered. Finally, we design a scale-aware feature recovery module to capture and fuse multi-level features for reconstructing the high-frequency spectrum at arbitrary scale factors. Extensive experiments on public datasets show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The ability to sequentially learn multiple tasks without forgetting is a key skill of biological brains, whereas it represents a major challenge to the field of deep learning. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, various continual learning (CL) approaches have been devised. However, these usually require discrete task boundaries. This requirement seems biologically implausible and often limits the application of CL methods in the real world where tasks are not always well defined. Here, we take inspiration from neuroscience, where sparse, non-overlapping neuronal representations have been suggested to prevent catastrophic forgetting. As in the brain, we argue that these sparse representations should be chosen on the basis of feed forward (stimulus-specific) as well as top-down (context-specific) information. To implement such selective sparsity, we use a bio-plausible form of hierarchical credit assignment known as Deep Feedback Control (DFC) and combine it with a winner-take-all sparsity mechanism. In addition to sparsity, we introduce lateral recurrent connections within each layer to further protect previously learned representations. We evaluate the new sparse-recurrent version of DFC on the split-MNIST computer vision benchmark and show that only the combination of sparsity and intra-layer recurrent connections improves CL performance with respect to standard backpropagation. Our method achieves similar performance to well-known CL methods, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation and Synaptic Intelligence, without requiring information about task boundaries. Overall, we showcase the idea of adopting computational principles from the brain to derive new, task-free learning algorithms for CL.

- **Summary**: Conditional normalizing flows can generate diverse image samples for solving inverse problems. Most normalizing flows for inverse problems in imaging employ the conditional affine coupling layer that can generate diverse images quickly. However, unintended severe artifacts are occasionally observed in the output of them. In this work, we address this critical issue by investigating the origins of these artifacts and proposing the conditions to avoid them. First of all, we empirically and theoretically reveal that these problems are caused by "exploding inverse" in the conditional affine coupling layer for certain out-of-distribution (OOD) conditional inputs. Then, we further validated that the probability of causing erroneous artifacts in pixels is highly correlated with a Mahalanobis distance-based OOD score for inverse problems in imaging. Lastly, based on our investigations, we propose a remark to avoid exploding inverse and then based on it, we suggest a simple remedy that substitutes the affine coupling layers with the modified rational quadratic spline coupling layers in normalizing flows, to encourage the robustness of generated image samples. Our experimental results demonstrated that our suggested methods effectively suppressed critical artifacts occurring in normalizing flows for super-resolution space generation and low-light image enhancement.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic 3D worlds occupied by moving humans has many applications in games, architecture, and synthetic data creation. But generating such scenes is expensive and labor intensive. Recent work generates human poses and motions given a 3D scene. Here, we take the opposite approach and generate 3D indoor scenes given 3D human motion. Such motions can come from archival motion capture or from IMU sensors worn on the body, effectively turning human movement in a "scanner" of the 3D world. Intuitively, human movement indicates the free-space in a room and human contact indicates surfaces or objects that support activities such as sitting, lying or touching. We propose MIME (Mining Interaction and Movement to infer 3D Environments), which is a generative model of indoor scenes that produces furniture layouts that are consistent with the human movement. MIME uses an auto-regressive transformer architecture that takes the already generated objects in the scene as well as the human motion as input, and outputs the next plausible object. To train MIME, we build a dataset by populating the 3D FRONT scene dataset with 3D humans. Our experiments show that MIME produces more diverse and plausible 3D scenes than a recent generative scene method that does not know about human movement. Code and data will be available for research at https://mime.is.tue.mpg.de.

- **Summary**: Learning continuous image representations is recently gaining popularity for image super-resolution (SR) because of its ability to reconstruct high-resolution images with arbitrary scales from low-resolution inputs. Existing methods mostly ensemble nearby features to predict the new pixel at any queried coordinate in the SR image. Such a local ensemble suffers from some limitations: i) it has no learnable parameters and it neglects the similarity of the visual features; ii) it has a limited receptive field and cannot ensemble relevant features in a large field which are important in an image. To address these issues, this paper proposes a continuous implicit attention-in-attention network, called CiaoSR. We explicitly design an implicit attention network to learn the ensemble weights for the nearby local features. Furthermore, we embed a scale-aware attention in this implicit attention network to exploit additional non-local information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate CiaoSR significantly outperforms the existing single image SR methods with the same backbone. In addition, CiaoSR also achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the arbitrary-scale SR task. The effectiveness of the method is also demonstrated on the real-world SR setting. More importantly, CiaoSR can be flexibly integrated into any backbone to improve the SR performance.

- **Summary**: Emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs) has raised enormous attention towards artificial neural networks (ANNs) once again. They have become the state-of-the-art models and have won different machine learning challenges. Although these networks are inspired by the brain, they lack biological plausibility, and they have structural differences compared to the brain. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been around for a long time, and they have been investigated to understand the dynamics of the brain. However, their application in real-world and complicated machine learning tasks were limited. Recently, they have shown great potential in solving such tasks. Due to their energy efficiency and temporal dynamics there are many promises in their future development. In this work, we reviewed the structures and performances of SNNs on image classification tasks. The comparisons illustrate that these networks show great capabilities for more complicated problems. Furthermore, the simple learning rules developed for SNNs, such as STDP and R-STDP, can be a potential alternative to replace the backpropagation algorithm used in DNNs.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-training has shown promising results on the vision-and-language navigation (VLN) task. However, most existing pre-training methods employ discrete panoramas to learn visual-textual associations. This requires the model to implicitly correlate incomplete, duplicate observations within the panoramas, which may impair an agent's spatial understanding. Thus, we propose a new map-based pre-training paradigm that is spatial-aware for use in VLN. Concretely, we build a local metric map to explicitly aggregate incomplete observations and remove duplicates, while modeling navigation dependency in a global topological map. This hybrid design can balance the demand of VLN for both short-term reasoning and long-term planning. Then, based on the hybrid map, we devise a pre-training framework to learn a multimodal map representation, which enhances spatial-aware cross-modal reasoning thereby facilitating the language-guided navigation goal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the map-based pre-training route for VLN, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art on four VLN benchmarks.

- **Summary**: We propose an analysis-by-synthesis method for fast multi-view 3D reconstruction of opaque objects with arbitrary materials and illumination. State-of-the-art methods use both neural surface representations and neural rendering. While flexible, neural surface representations are a significant bottleneck in optimization runtime. Instead, we represent surfaces as triangle meshes and build a differentiable rendering pipeline around triangle rasterization and neural shading. The renderer is used in a gradient descent optimization where both a triangle mesh and a neural shader are jointly optimized to reproduce the multi-view images. We evaluate our method on a public 3D reconstruction dataset and show that it can match the reconstruction accuracy of traditional baselines and neural approaches while surpassing them in optimization runtime. Additionally, we investigate the shader and find that it learns an interpretable representation of appearance, enabling applications such as 3D material editing.

- **Summary**: Generalist models, which are capable of performing diverse multi-modal tasks in a task-agnostic way within a single model, have been explored recently. Being, hopefully, an alternative to approaching general-purpose AI, existing generalist models are still at an early stage, where modality and task coverage is limited. To empower multi-modal task-scaling and speed up this line of research, we release a generalist model learning system, OFASys, built on top of a declarative task interface named multi-modal instruction. At the core of OFASys is the idea of decoupling multi-modal task representations from the underlying model implementations. In OFASys, a task involving multiple modalities can be defined declaratively even with just a single line of code. The system automatically generates task plans from such instructions for training and inference. It also facilitates multi-task training for diverse multi-modal workloads. As a starting point, we provide presets of 7 different modalities and 23 highly-diverse example tasks in OFASys, with which we also develop a first-in-kind, single model, OFA+, that can handle text, image, speech, video, and motion data. The single OFA+ model achieves 95% performance in average with only 16% parameters of 15 task-finetuned models, showcasing the performance reliability of multi-modal task-scaling provided by OFASys.

- **Summary**: Incidental supervision from language has become a popular approach for learning generic visual representations that can be prompted to perform many recognition tasks in computer vision. We conduct an in-depth exploration of the CLIP model and show that its visual representation is often strongly biased towards solving some tasks more than others. Moreover, which task the representation will be biased towards is unpredictable, with little consistency across images. To resolve this task bias, we show how to learn a visual prompt that guides the representation towards features relevant to their task of interest. Our results show that these visual prompts can be independent of the input image and still effectively provide a conditioning mechanism to steer visual representations towards the desired task.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the problem of generating 3D holistic body motions from human speech. Given a speech recording, we synthesize sequences of 3D body poses, hand gestures, and facial expressions that are realistic and diverse. To achieve this, we first build a high-quality dataset of 3D holistic body meshes with synchronous speech. We then define a novel speech-to-motion generation framework in which the face, body, and hands are modeled separately. The separated modeling stems from the fact that face articulation strongly correlates with human speech, while body poses and hand gestures are less correlated. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder for face motions, and a compositional vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) for the body and hand motions. The compositional VQ-VAE is key to generating diverse results. Additionally, we propose a cross-conditional autoregressive model that generates body poses and hand gestures, leading to coherent and realistic motions. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Image-based virtual try-on techniques have shown great promise for enhancing the user-experience and improving customer satisfaction on fashion-oriented e-commerce platforms. However, existing techniques are currently still limited in the quality of the try-on results they are able to produce from input images of diverse characteristics. In this work, we propose a Context-Driven Virtual Try-On Network (C-VTON) that addresses these limitations and convincingly transfers selected clothing items to the target subjects even under challenging pose configurations and in the presence of self-occlusions. At the core of the C-VTON pipeline are: (i) a geometric matching procedure that efficiently aligns the target clothing with the pose of the person in the input images, and (ii) a powerful image generator that utilizes various types of contextual information when synthesizing the final try-on result. C-VTON is evaluated in rigorous experiments on the VITON and MPV datasets and in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques from the literature. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to produce photo-realistic and visually convincing results and significantly improves on the existing state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Most camera lens systems are designed in isolation, separately from downstream computer vision methods. Recently, joint optimization approaches that design lenses alongside other components of the image acquisition and processing pipeline -- notably, downstream neural networks -- have achieved improved imaging quality or better performance on vision tasks. However, these existing methods optimize only a subset of lens parameters and cannot optimize glass materials given their categorical nature. In this work, we develop a differentiable spherical lens simulation model that accurately captures geometrical aberrations. We propose an optimization strategy to address the challenges of lens design -- notorious for non-convex loss function landscapes and many manufacturing constraints -- that are exacerbated in joint optimization tasks. Specifically, we introduce quantized continuous glass variables to facilitate the optimization and selection of glass materials in an end-to-end design context, and couple this with carefully designed constraints to support manufacturability. In automotive object detection, we report improved detection performance over existing designs even when simplifying designs to two- or three-element lenses, despite significantly degrading the image quality.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation, particularly in athletes, can help improve their performance. However, this estimation is difficult using existing methods, such as human annotation, if the subjects wear loose-fitting clothes such as ski/snowboard wears. This study developed a method for obtaining the ground truth data on two-dimensional (2D) poses of a human wearing loose-fitting clothes. This method uses fast-flushing light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The subjects were required to wear loose-fitting clothes and place the LED on the target joints. The LEDs were observed directly using a camera by selecting thin filmy loose-fitting clothes. The proposed method captures the scene at 240 fps by using a high-frame-rate camera and renders two 30 fps image sequences by extracting LED-on and -off frames. The temporal differences between the two video sequences can be ignored, considering the speed of human motion. The LED-on video was used to manually annotate the joints and thus obtain the ground truth data. Additionally, the LED-off video, equivalent to a standard video at 30 fps, confirmed the accuracy of existing machine learning-based methods and manual annotations. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can obtain ground truth data for standard RGB videos. Further, it was revealed that neither manual annotation nor the state-of-the-art pose estimator obtains the correct position of target joints.

- **Summary**: Timely and effective feedback within surgical training plays a critical role in developing the skills required to perform safe and efficient surgery. Feedback from expert surgeons, while especially valuable in this regard, is challenging to acquire due to their typically busy schedules, and may be subject to biases. Formal assessment procedures like OSATS and GEARS attempt to provide objective measures of skill, but remain time-consuming. With advances in machine learning there is an opportunity for fast and objective automated feedback on technical skills. The SimSurgSkill 2021 challenge (hosted as a sub-challenge of EndoVis at MICCAI 2021) aimed to promote and foster work in this endeavor. Using virtual reality (VR) surgical tasks, competitors were tasked with localizing instruments and predicting surgical skill. Here we summarize the winning approaches and how they performed. Using this publicly available dataset and results as a springboard, future work may enable more efficient training of surgeons with advances in surgical data science.

- **Summary**: Can a text-to-image diffusion model be used as a training objective for adapting a GAN generator to another domain? In this paper, we show that the classifier-free guidance can be leveraged as a critic and enable generators to distill knowledge from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Generators can be efficiently shifted into new domains indicated by text prompts without access to groundtruth samples from target domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our method through extensive experiments. Although not trained to minimize CLIP loss, our model achieves equally high CLIP scores and significantly lower FID than prior work on short prompts, and outperforms the baseline qualitatively and quantitatively on long and complicated prompts. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is the first attempt at incorporating large-scale pre-trained diffusion models and distillation sampling for text-driven image generator domain adaptation and gives a quality previously beyond possible. Moreover, we extend our work to 3D-aware style-based generators and DreamBooth guidance.

- **Summary**: Training embodied agents in simulation has become mainstream for the embodied AI community. However, these agents often struggle when deployed in the physical world due to their inability to generalize to real-world environments. In this paper, we present Phone2Proc, a method that uses a 10-minute phone scan and conditional procedural generation to create a distribution of training scenes that are semantically similar to the target environment. The generated scenes are conditioned on the wall layout and arrangement of large objects from the scan, while also sampling lighting, clutter, surface textures, and instances of smaller objects with randomized placement and materials. Leveraging just a simple RGB camera, training with Phone2Proc shows massive improvements from 34.7% to 70.7% success rate in sim-to-real ObjectNav performance across a test suite of over 200 trials in diverse real-world environments, including homes, offices, and RoboTHOR. Furthermore, Phone2Proc's diverse distribution of generated scenes makes agents remarkably robust to changes in the real world, such as human movement, object rearrangement, lighting changes, or clutter.

- **Summary**: Computer vision applications have heavily relied on the linear combination of Lambertian diffuse and microfacet specular reflection models for representing reflected radiance, which turns out to be physically incompatible and limited in applicability. In this paper, we derive a novel analytical reflectance model, which we refer to as Fresnel Microfacet BRDF model, that is physically accurate and generalizes to various real-world surfaces. Our key idea is to model the Fresnel reflection and transmission of the surface microgeometry with a collection of oriented mirror facets, both for body and surface reflections. We carefully derive the Fresnel reflection and transmission for each microfacet as well as the light transport between them in the subsurface. This physically-grounded modeling also allows us to express the polarimetric behavior of reflected light in addition to its radiometric behavior. That is, FMBRDF unifies not only body and surface reflections but also light reflection in radiometry and polarization and represents them in a single model. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in accuracy, expressive power, and image-based estimation.

- **Summary**: Action recognition models have achieved impressive results by incorporating scene-level annotations, such as objects, their relations, 3D structure, and more. However, obtaining annotations of scene structure for videos requires a significant amount of effort to gather and annotate, making these methods expensive to train. In contrast, synthetic datasets generated by graphics engines provide powerful alternatives for generating scene-level annotations across multiple tasks. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage synthetic scene data for improving video understanding. We present a multi-task prompt learning approach for video transformers, where a shared video transformer backbone is enhanced by a small set of specialized parameters for each task. Specifically, we add a set of ``task prompts'', each corresponding to a different task, and let each prompt predict task-related annotations. This design allows the model to capture information shared among synthetic scene tasks as well as information shared between synthetic scene tasks and a real video downstream task throughout the entire network. We refer to this approach as ``Promptonomy'', since the prompts model task-related structure. We propose the PromptonomyViT model (PViT), a video transformer that incorporates various types of scene-level information from synthetic data using the ``Promptonomy'' approach. PViT shows strong performance improvements on multiple video understanding tasks and datasets.

- **Summary**: While generative models produce high-quality images of concepts learned from a large-scale database, a user often wishes to synthesize instantiations of their own concepts (for example, their family, pets, or items). Can we teach a model to quickly acquire a new concept, given a few examples? Furthermore, can we compose multiple new concepts together? We propose Custom Diffusion, an efficient method for augmenting existing text-to-image models. We find that only optimizing a few parameters in the text-to-image conditioning mechanism is sufficiently powerful to represent new concepts while enabling fast tuning (~6 minutes). Additionally, we can jointly train for multiple concepts or combine multiple fine-tuned models into one via closed-form constrained optimization. Our fine-tuned model generates variations of multiple new concepts and seamlessly composes them with existing concepts in novel settings. Our method outperforms or performs on par with several baselines and concurrent works in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while being memory and computationally efficient.

- **Summary**: Recent works on diffusion models have demonstrated a strong capability for conditioning image generation, e.g., text-guided image synthesis. Such success inspires many efforts trying to use large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for tackling a challenging problem--real image editing. Works conducted in this area learn a unique textual token corresponding to several images containing the same object. However, under many circumstances, only one image is available, such as the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Using existing works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single image causes severe overfitting issues. The information leakage from the pre-trained diffusion models makes editing can not keep the same content as the given image while creating new features depicted by the language guidance. This work aims to address the problem of single-image editing. We propose a novel model-based guidance built upon the classifier-free guidance so that the knowledge from the model trained on a single image can be distilled into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. Additionally, we propose a patch-based fine-tuning that can effectively help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution. We provide extensive experiments to validate the design choices of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation.

- **Summary**: While object reconstruction has made great strides in recent years, current methods typically require densely captured images and/or known camera poses, and generalize poorly to novel object categories. To step toward object reconstruction in the wild, this work explores reconstructing general real-world objects from a few images without known camera poses or object categories. The crux of our work is solving two fundamental 3D vision problems -- shape reconstruction and pose estimation -- in a unified approach. Our approach captures the synergies of these two problems: reliable camera pose estimation gives rise to accurate shape reconstruction, and the accurate reconstruction, in turn, induces robust correspondence between different views and facilitates pose estimation. Our method FORGE predicts 3D features from each view and leverages them in conjunction with the input images to establish cross-view correspondence for estimating relative camera poses. The 3D features are then transformed by the estimated poses into a shared space and are fused into a neural radiance field. The reconstruction results are rendered by volume rendering techniques, enabling us to train the model without 3D shape ground-truth. Our experiments show that FORGE reliably reconstructs objects from five views. Our pose estimation method outperforms existing ones by a large margin. The reconstruction results under predicted poses are comparable to the ones using ground-truth poses. The performance on novel testing categories matches the results on categories seen during training. Project page: https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/FORGE/

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel framework built to simplify 3D asset generation for amateur users. To enable interactive generation, our method supports a variety of input modalities that can be easily provided by a human, including images, text, partially observed shapes and combinations of these, further allowing to adjust the strength of each input. At the core of our approach is an encoder-decoder, compressing 3D shapes into a compact latent representation, upon which a diffusion model is learned. To enable a variety of multi-modal inputs, we employ task-specific encoders with dropout followed by a cross-attention mechanism. Due to its flexibility, our model naturally supports a variety of tasks, outperforming prior works on shape completion, image-based 3D reconstruction, and text-to-3D. Most interestingly, our model can combine all these tasks into one swiss-army-knife tool, enabling the user to perform shape generation using incomplete shapes, images, and textual descriptions at the same time, providing the relative weights for each input and facilitating interactivity. Despite our approach being shape-only, we further show an efficient method to texture the generated shape using large-scale text-to-image models.

- **Summary**: Conventional methods for human motion synthesis are either deterministic or struggle with the trade-off between motion diversity and motion quality. In response to these limitations, we introduce MoFusion, i.e., a new denoising-diffusion-based framework for high-quality conditional human motion synthesis that can generate long, temporally plausible, and semantically accurate motions based on a range of conditioning contexts (such as music and text). We also present ways to introduce well-known kinematic losses for motion plausibility within the motion diffusion framework through our scheduled weighting strategy. The learned latent space can be used for several interactive motion editing applications -- like inbetweening, seed conditioning, and text-based editing -- thus, providing crucial abilities for virtual character animation and robotics. Through comprehensive quantitative evaluations and a perceptual user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFusion compared to the state of the art on established benchmarks in the literature.

- **Summary**: Owing to the success of transformer models, recent works study their applicability in 3D medical segmentation tasks. Within the transformer models, the self-attention mechanism is one of the main building blocks that strives to capture long-range dependencies. However, the self-attention operation has quadratic complexity which proves to be a computational bottleneck, especially in volumetric medical imaging, where the inputs are 3D with numerous slices. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical image segmentation approach, named UNETR++, that offers both high-quality segmentation masks as well as efficiency in terms of parameters, compute cost, and inference speed. The core of our design is the introduction of a novel efficient paired attention (EPA) block that efficiently learns spatial and channel-wise discriminative features using a pair of inter-dependent branches based on spatial and channel attention. Our spatial attention formulation is efficient having linear complexity with respect to the input sequence length. To enable communication between spatial and channel-focused branches, we share the weights of query and key mapping functions that provide a complimentary benefit (paired attention), while also reducing the overall network parameters. Our extensive evaluations on five benchmarks, Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, BRaTs, and Decathlon-Lung, reveal the effectiveness of our contributions in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. On Synapse, our UNETR++ sets a new state-of-the-art with a Dice Score of 87.2%, while being significantly efficient with a reduction of over 71% in terms of both parameters and FLOPs, compared to the best method in the literature.

- **Summary**: To build general robotic agents that can operate in many environments, it is often imperative for the robot to collect experience in the real world. However, this is often not feasible due to safety, time, and hardware restrictions. We thus propose leveraging the next best thing as real-world experience: internet videos of humans using their hands. Visual priors, such as visual features, are often learned from videos, but we believe that more information from videos can be utilized as a stronger prior. We build a learning algorithm, VideoDex, that leverages visual, action, and physical priors from human video datasets to guide robot behavior. These actions and physical priors in the neural network dictate the typical human behavior for a particular robot task. We test our approach on a robot arm and dexterous hand-based system and show strong results on various manipulation tasks, outperforming various state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Benefiting from masked visual modeling, self-supervised video representation learning has achieved remarkable progress. However, existing methods focus on learning representations from scratch through reconstructing low-level features like raw pixel RGB values. In this paper, we propose masked video distillation (MVD), a simple yet effective two-stage masked feature modeling framework for video representation learning: firstly we pretrain an image (or video) model by recovering low-level features of masked patches, then we use the resulting features as targets for masked feature modeling. For the choice of teacher models, we observe that students taught by video teachers perform better on temporally-heavy video tasks, while image teachers transfer stronger spatial representations for spatially-heavy video tasks. Visualization analysis also indicates different teachers produce different learned patterns for students. Motivated by this observation, we design a spatial-temporal co-teaching method for MVD. Specifically, we distill student models from both video teachers and image teachers by masked feature modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that video transformers pretrained with spatial-temporal co-teaching outperform models distilled with a single teacher on a multitude of video datasets. Our MVD with vanilla ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous supervised or self-supervised methods on several challenging video downstream tasks. For example, with the ViT-Large model, our MVD achieves 86.4% and 76.7% Top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2, outperforming VideoMAE by 1.2% and 2.4% respectively. When a larger ViT-Huge model is adopted, MVD achieves the state-of-the-art performance with 77.3% Top-1 accuracy on Something-Something-v2 and 41.1 mAP on AVA v2.2.

- **Summary**: We introduce LaViLa, a new approach to learning video-language representations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). We repurpose pre-trained LLMs to be conditioned on visual input, and finetune them to create automatic video narrators. Our auto-generated narrations offer a number of advantages, including dense coverage of long videos, better temporal synchronization of the visual information and text, and much higher diversity of text. The video-text embedding learned contrastively with these additional auto-generated narrations outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on multiple first-person and third-person video tasks, both in zero-shot and finetuned setups. Most notably, LaViLa obtains an absolute gain of 10.1% on EGTEA classification and 5.9% Epic-Kitchens-100 multi-instance retrieval benchmarks. Furthermore, LaViLa trained with only half the narrations from the Ego4D dataset outperforms baseline models trained on the full set, and shows positive scaling behavior on increasing pre-training data and model size.

- **Summary**: Reflections on glossy objects contain valuable and hidden information about the surrounding environment. By converting these objects into cameras, we can unlock exciting applications, including imaging beyond the camera's field-of-view and from seemingly impossible vantage points, e.g. from reflections on the human eye. However, this task is challenging because reflections depend jointly on object geometry, material properties, the 3D environment, and the observer viewing direction. Our approach converts glossy objects with unknown geometry into radiance-field cameras to image the world from the object's perspective. Our key insight is to convert the object surface into a virtual sensor that captures cast reflections as a 2D projection of the 5D environment radiance field visible to the object. We show that recovering the environment radiance fields enables depth and radiance estimation from the object to its surroundings in addition to beyond field-of-view novel-view synthesis, i.e. rendering of novel views that are only directly-visible to the glossy object present in the scene, but not the observer. Moreover, using the radiance field we can image around occluders caused by close-by objects in the scene. Our method is trained end-to-end on multi-view images of the object and jointly estimates object geometry, diffuse radiance, and the 5D environment radiance field.

- **Summary**: Rating a video based on its content is an important step for classifying video age categories. Movie content rating and TV show rating are the two most common rating systems established by professional committees. However, manually reviewing and evaluating scene/film content by a committee is a tedious work and it becomes increasingly difficult with the ever-growing amount of online video content. As such, a desirable solution is to use computer vision based video content analysis techniques to automate the evaluation process. In this paper, related works are summarized for action recognition, multi-modal learning, movie genre classification, and sensitive content detection in the context of content moderation and movie content rating.

- **Summary**: A core process in human cognition is analogical mapping: the ability to identify a similar relational structure between different situations. We introduce a novel task, Visual Analogies of Situation Recognition, adapting the classical word-analogy task into the visual domain. Given a triplet of images, the task is to select an image candidate B' that completes the analogy (A to A' is like B to what?). Unlike previous work on visual analogy that focused on simple image transformations, we tackle complex analogies requiring understanding of scenes.   We leverage situation recognition annotations and the CLIP model to generate a large set of 500k candidate analogies. Crowdsourced annotations for a sample of the data indicate that humans agree with the dataset label ~80% of the time (chance level 25%). Furthermore, we use human annotations to create a gold-standard dataset of 3,820 validated analogies. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art models do well when distractors are chosen randomly (~86%), but struggle with carefully chosen distractors (~53%, compared to 90% human accuracy). We hope our dataset will encourage the development of new analogy-making models. Website: https://vasr-dataset.github.io/

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework that jointly learns keypoint detection, descriptor representation and cross-frame matching for the task of image-based 3D localization. Prior art has tackled each of these components individually, purportedly aiming to alleviate difficulties in effectively train a holistic network. We design a self-supervised image warping correspondence loss for both feature detection and matching, a weakly-supervised epipolar constraints loss on relative camera pose learning, and a directional matching scheme that detects key-point features in a source image and performs coarse-to-fine correspondence search on the target image. We leverage this framework to enforce cycle consistency in our matching module. In addition, we propose a new loss to robustly handle both definite inlier/outlier matches and less-certain matches. The integration of these learning mechanisms enables end-to-end training of a single network performing all three localization components. Bench-marking our approach on public data-sets, exemplifies how such an end-to-end framework is able to yield more accurate localization that out-performs both traditional methods as well as state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Deformable image registration is a key task in medical image analysis. The Brain Tumor Sequence Registration challenge (BraTS-Reg) aims at establishing correspondences between pre-operative and follow-up scans of the same patient diagnosed with an adult brain diffuse high-grade glioma and intends to address the challenging task of registering longitudinal data with major tissue appearance changes. In this work, we proposed a two-stage cascaded network based on the Inception and TransMorph models. The dataset for each patient was comprised of a native pre-contrast (T1), a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1-CE), a T2-weighted (T2), and a Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). The Inception model was used to fuse the 4 image modalities together and extract the most relevant information. Then, a variant of the TransMorph architecture was adapted to generate the displacement fields. The Loss function was composed of a standard image similarity measure, a diffusion regularizer, and an edge-map similarity measure added to overcome intensity dependence and reinforce correct boundary deformation. We observed that the addition of the Inception module substantially increased the performance of the network. Additionally, performing an initial affine registration before training the model showed improved accuracy in the landmark error measurements between pre and post-operative MRIs. We observed that our best model composed of the Inception and TransMorph architectures while using an initially affine registered dataset had the best performance with a median absolute error of 2.91 (initial error = 7.8). We achieved 6th place at the time of model submission in the final testing phase of the BraTS-Reg challenge.

- **Summary**: To achieve autonomy in a priori unknown real-world scenarios, agents should be able to: i) act from high-dimensional sensory observations (e.g., images), ii) learn from past experience to adapt and improve, and iii) be capable of long horizon planning. Classical planning algorithms (e.g. PRM, RRT) are proficient at handling long-horizon planning. Deep learning based methods in turn can provide the necessary representations to address the others, by modeling statistical contingencies between observations. In this direction, we introduce a general-purpose planning algorithm called PALMER that combines classical sampling-based planning algorithms with learning-based perceptual representations. For training these perceptual representations, we combine Q-learning with contrastive representation learning to create a latent space where the distance between the embeddings of two states captures how easily an optimal policy can traverse between them. For planning with these perceptual representations, we re-purpose classical sampling-based planning algorithms to retrieve previously observed trajectory segments from a replay buffer and restitch them into approximately optimal paths that connect any given pair of start and goal states. This creates a tight feedback loop between representation learning, memory, reinforcement learning, and sampling-based planning. The end result is an experiential framework for long-horizon planning that is significantly more robust and sample efficient compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Most benchmarks for studying surgical interventions focus on a specific challenge instead of leveraging the intrinsic complementarity among different tasks. In this work, we present a new experimental framework towards holistic surgical scene understanding. First, we introduce the Phase, Step, Instrument, and Atomic Visual Action recognition (PSI-AVA) Dataset. PSI-AVA includes annotations for both long-term (Phase and Step recognition) and short-term reasoning (Instrument detection and novel Atomic Action recognition) in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy videos. Second, we present Transformers for Action, Phase, Instrument, and steps Recognition (TAPIR) as a strong baseline for surgical scene understanding. TAPIR leverages our dataset's multi-level annotations as it benefits from the learned representation on the instrument detection task to improve its classification capacity. Our experimental results in both PSI-AVA and other publicly available databases demonstrate the adequacy of our framework to spur future research on holistic surgical scene understanding.

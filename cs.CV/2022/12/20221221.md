- **Summary**: Recent advances in neural radiance fields have enabled the high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of complex scenes for novel view synthesis. However, it remains underexplored how the appearance of such representations can be efficiently edited while maintaining photorealism.   In this work, we present PaletteNeRF, a novel method for photorealistic appearance editing of neural radiance fields (NeRF) based on 3D color decomposition. Our method decomposes the appearance of each 3D point into a linear combination of palette-based bases (i.e., 3D segmentations defined by a group of NeRF-type functions) that are shared across the scene. While our palette-based bases are view-independent, we also predict a view-dependent function to capture the color residual (e.g., specular shading). During training, we jointly optimize the basis functions and the color palettes, and we also introduce novel regularizers to encourage the spatial coherence of the decomposition.   Our method allows users to efficiently edit the appearance of the 3D scene by modifying the color palettes. We also extend our framework with compressed semantic features for semantic-aware appearance editing. We demonstrate that our technique is superior to baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively for appearance editing of complex real-world scenes.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the recent success of Transformers for Natural Language Processing and vision Transformer for Computer Vision, many researchers in the medical imaging community have flocked to Transformer-based networks for various main stream medical tasks such as classification, segmentation, and estimation. In this study, we analyze, two recently published Transformer-based network architectures for the task of multimodal head-and-tumor segmentation and compare their performance to the de facto standard 3D segmentation network - the nnU-Net. Our results showed that modeling long-range dependencies may be helpful in cases where large structures are present and/or large field of view is needed. However, for small structures such as head-and-neck tumor, the convolution-based U-Net architecture seemed to perform well, especially when training dataset is small and computational resource is limited.

- **Summary**: Medical Visual Question Answering (Medical-VQA) aims to to answer clinical questions regarding radiology images, assisting doctors with decision-making options. Nevertheless, current Medical-VQA models learn cross-modal representations through residing vision and texture encoders in dual separate spaces, which lead to indirect semantic alignment. In this paper, we propose UnICLAM, a Unified and Interpretable Medical-VQA model through Contrastive Representation Learning with Adversarial Masking. Specifically, to learn an aligned image-text representation, we first establish a unified dual-stream pre-training structure with the gradually soft-parameter sharing strategy. Technically, the proposed strategy learns a constraint for the vision and texture encoders to be close in a same space, which is gradually loosened as the higher number of layers. Moreover, for grasping the unified semantic representation, we extend the adversarial masking data augmentation to the contrastive representation learning of vision and text in a unified manner. Concretely, while the encoder training minimizes the distance between original and masking samples, the adversarial masking module keeps adversarial learning to conversely maximize the distance. Furthermore, we also intuitively take a further exploration to the unified adversarial masking augmentation model, which improves the potential ante-hoc interpretability with remarkable performance and efficiency. Experimental results on VQA-RAD and SLAKE public benchmarks demonstrate that UnICLAM outperforms existing 11 state-of-the-art Medical-VQA models. More importantly, we make an additional discussion about the performance of UnICLAM in diagnosing heart failure, verifying that UnICLAM exhibits superior few-shot adaption performance in practical disease diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Climate change has increased the intensity, frequency, and duration of extreme weather events and natural disasters across the world. While the increased data on natural disasters improves the scope of machine learning (ML) in this field, progress is relatively slow. One bottleneck is the lack of benchmark datasets that would allow ML researchers to quantify their progress against a standard metric. The objective of this short paper is to explore the state of benchmark datasets for ML tasks related to natural disasters, categorizing them according to the disaster management cycle. We compile a list of existing benchmark datasets introduced in the past five years. We propose a web platform - NADBenchmarks - where researchers can search for benchmark datasets for natural disasters, and we develop a preliminary version of such a platform using our compiled list. This paper is intended to aid researchers in finding benchmark datasets to train their ML models on, and provide general directions for topics where they can contribute new benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual approaches involving visual inputs have laid the foundation for recent progress in speech separation. However, the optimization of the concurrent usage of auditory and visual inputs is still an active research area. Inspired by the cortico-thalamo-cortical circuit, in which the sensory processing mechanisms of different modalities modulate one another via the non-lemniscal sensory thalamus, we propose a novel cortico-thalamo-cortical neural network (CTCNet) for audio-visual speech separation (AVSS). First, the CTCNet learns hierarchical auditory and visual representations in a bottom-up manner in separate auditory and visual subnetworks, mimicking the functions of the auditory and visual cortical areas. Then, inspired by the large number of connections between cortical regions and the thalamus, the model fuses the auditory and visual information in a thalamic subnetwork through top-down connections. Finally, the model transmits this fused information back to the auditory and visual subnetworks, and the above process is repeated several times. The results of experiments on three speech separation benchmark datasets show that CTCNet remarkably outperforms existing AVSS methods with considerablely fewer parameters. These results suggest that mimicking the anatomical connectome of the mammalian brain has great potential for advancing the development of deep neural networks.

- **Summary**: Sign language is the preferred method of communication of deaf or mute people, but similar to any language, it is difficult to learn and represents a significant barrier for those who are hard of hearing or unable to speak. A person's entire frontal appearance dictates and conveys specific meaning. However, this frontal appearance can be quantified as a temporal sequence of human body pose, leading to Sign Language Recognition through the learning of spatiotemporal dynamics of skeleton keypoints. We propose a novel, attention-based approach to Sign Language Recognition exclusively built upon decoupled graph and temporal self-attention: the Sign Language Graph Time Transformer (SLGTformer). SLGTformer first deconstructs spatiotemporal pose sequences separately into spatial graphs and temporal windows. SLGTformer then leverages novel Learnable Graph Relative Positional Encodings (LGRPE) to guide spatial self-attention with the graph neighborhood context of the human skeleton. By modeling the temporal dimension as intra- and inter-window dynamics, we introduce Temporal Twin Self-Attention (TTSA) as the combination of locally-grouped temporal attention (LTA) and global sub-sampled temporal attention (GSTA). We demonstrate the effectiveness of SLGTformer on the World-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an ensemble-free approach on the keypoint modality.

### Class Prototype-based Cleaner for Label Noise Learning

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning based methods are current SOTA solutions to the noisy-label learning problem, which rely on learning an unsupervised label cleaner first to divide the training samples into a labeled set for clean data and an unlabeled set for noise data. Typically, the cleaner is obtained via fitting a mixture model to the distribution of per-sample training losses. However, the modeling procedure is \emph{class agnostic} and assumes the loss distributions of clean and noise samples are the same across different classes. Unfortunately, in practice, such an assumption does not always hold due to the varying learning difficulty of different classes, thus leading to sub-optimal label noise partition criteria. In this work, we reveal this long-ignored problem and propose a simple yet effective solution, named \textbf{C}lass \textbf{P}rototype-based label noise \textbf{C}leaner (\textbf{CPC}). Unlike previous works treating all the classes equally, CPC fully considers loss distribution heterogeneity and applies class-aware modulation to partition the clean and noise data. CPC takes advantage of loss distribution modeling and intra-class consistency regularization in feature space simultaneously and thus can better distinguish clean and noise labels. We theoretically justify the effectiveness of our method by explaining it from the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on the noisy-label benchmarks CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Clothing1M and WebVision. The results show that CPC consistently brings about performance improvement across all benchmarks. Codes and pre-trained models will be released at \url{https://github.com/hjjpku/CPC.git}.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-light image and video enhancement. We begin with the challenging mixed over-/under-exposed images, which are under-performed by existing methods. To this end, we propose two variants of the SICE dataset named SICE\_Grad and SICE\_Mix. Next, we introduce Night Wenzhou, a large-scale, high-resolution video dataset, to address the lack of low-light video datasets that discourages the use of low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods in videos. Our Night Wenzhou dataset is challenging since it consists of fast-moving aerial scenes and streetscapes with varying illuminations and degradation. We then construct a hierarchical taxonomy, conduct extensive key technique analysis, and performs experimental comparisons for representative LLIE approaches using our proposed datasets and the current benchmark datasets. Finally, we identify emerging applications, address unresolved challenges, and propose future research topics for the LLIE community. Our datasets are available at https://github.com/ShenZheng2000/LLIE_Survey.

- **Summary**: Nature-inspired optimization Algorithms (NIOAs) are nowadays a popular choice for community detection in social networks. Community detection problem in social network is treated as optimization problem, where the objective is to either maximize the connection within the community or minimize connections between the communities. To apply NIOAs, either of the two, or both objectives are explored. Since NIOAs mostly exploit randomness in their strategies, it is necessary to analyze their performance for specific applications. In this paper, NIOAs are analyzed on the community detection problem. A direct comparison approach is followed to perform pairwise comparison of NIOAs. The performance is measured in terms of five scores designed based on prasatul matrix and also with average isolability. Three widely used real-world social networks and four NIOAs are considered for analyzing the quality of communities generated by NIOAs.

- **Summary**: Information diffusion in Online Social Networks is a new and crucial problem in social network analysis field and requires significant research attention. Efficient diffusion of information are of critical importance in diverse situations such as; pandemic prevention, advertising, marketing etc. Although several mathematical models have been developed till date, but previous works lacked systematic analysis and exploration of the influence of neighborhood for information diffusion. In this paper, we have proposed Common Neighborhood Strategy (CNS) algorithm for information diffusion that demonstrates the role of common neighborhood in information propagation throughout the network. The performance of CNS algorithm is evaluated on several real-world datasets in terms of diffusion speed and diffusion outspread and compared with several widely used information diffusion models. Empirical results show CNS algorithm enables better information diffusion both in terms of diffusion speed and diffusion outspread.

- **Summary**: We propose MaskingDepth, a novel semi-supervised learning framework for monocular depth estimation to mitigate the reliance on large ground-truth depth quantities. MaskingDepth is designed to enforce consistency between the strongly-augmented unlabeled data and the pseudo-labels derived from weakly-augmented unlabeled data, which enables learning depth without supervision. In this framework, a novel data augmentation is proposed to take the advantage of a naive masking strategy as an augmentation, while avoiding its scale ambiguity problem between depths from weakly- and strongly-augmented branches and risk of missing small-scale instances. To only retain high-confident depth predictions from the weakly-augmented branch as pseudo-labels, we also present an uncertainty estimation technique, which is used to define robust consistency regularization. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-Depth-v2 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, its robustness to the use of fewer depth-annotated images, and superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods for monocular depth estimation. Furthermore, we show our method can be easily extended to domain adaptation task. Our code is available at https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/MaskingDepth.

- **Summary**: With large-scale adaption to biometric based applications, security and privacy of biometrics is utmost important especially when operating in unsupervised online mode. This work proposes a novel approach for generating new artificial fingerprints also called proxy fingerprints that are natural looking, non-invertible, revocable and privacy preserving. These proxy biometrics can be generated from original ones only with the help of a user-specific key. Instead of using the original fingerprint, these proxy templates can be used anywhere with same convenience. The manuscripts walks through an interesting way in which proxy fingerprints of different types can be generated and how they can be combined with use-specific keys to provide revocability and cancelability in case of compromise. Using the proposed approach a proxy dataset is generated from samples belonging to Anguli fingerprint database. Matching experiments were performed on the new set which is 5 times larger than the original, and it was found that their performance is at par with 0 FAR and 0 FRR in the stolen key, safe key scenarios. Other parameters on revocability and diversity are also analyzed for protection performance.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is an efficient quantitative MRI technique that can extract important tissue and system parameters such as T1, T2, B0, and B1 from a single scan. This property also makes it attractive for retrospectively synthesizing contrast-weighted images. In general, contrast-weighted images like T1-weighted, T2-weighted, etc., can be synthesized directly from parameter maps through spin-dynamics simulation (i.e., Bloch or Extended Phase Graph models). However, these approaches often exhibit artifacts due to imperfections in the mapping, the sequence modeling, and the data acquisition. Here we propose a supervised learning-based method that directly synthesizes contrast-weighted images from the MRF data without going through the quantitative mapping and spin-dynamics simulation. To implement our direct contrast synthesis (DCS) method, we deploy a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework and propose a multi-branch U-Net as the generator. The input MRF data are used to directly synthesize T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images through supervised training on paired MRF and target spin echo-based contrast-weighted scans. In-vivo experiments demonstrate excellent image quality compared to simulation-based contrast synthesis and previous DCS methods, both visually as well as by quantitative metrics. We also demonstrate cases where our trained model is able to mitigate in-flow and spiral off-resonance artifacts that are typically seen in MRF reconstructions and thus more faithfully represent conventional spin echo-based contrast-weighted images.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based models have been widely demonstrated to be successful in computer vision tasks by modelling long-range dependencies and capturing global representations. However, they are often dominated by features of large patterns leading to the loss of local details (e.g., boundaries and small objects), which are critical in medical image segmentation. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Dual-Aggregation Transformer Network called DuAT, which is characterized by two innovative designs, namely, the Global-to-Local Spatial Aggregation (GLSA) and Selective Boundary Aggregation (SBA) modules. The GLSA has the ability to aggregate and represent both global and local spatial features, which are beneficial for locating large and small objects, respectively. The SBA module is used to aggregate the boundary characteristic from low-level features and semantic information from high-level features for better preserving boundary details and locating the re-calibration objects. Extensive experiments in six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the segmentation of skin lesion images, and polyps in colonoscopy images. In addition, our approach is more robust than existing methods in various challenging situations such as small object segmentation and ambiguous object boundaries.

- **Summary**: Active learning as a paradigm in deep learning is especially important in applications involving intricate perception tasks such as object detection where labels are difficult and expensive to acquire. Development of active learning methods in such fields is highly computationally expensive and time consuming which obstructs the progression of research and leads to a lack of comparability between methods. In this work, we propose and investigate a sandbox setup for rapid development and transparent evaluation of active learning in deep object detection. Our experiments with commonly used configurations of datasets and detection architectures found in the literature show that results obtained in our sandbox environment are representative of results on standard configurations. The total compute time to obtain results and assess the learning behavior can thereby be reduced by factors of up to 14 when comparing with Pascal VOC and up to 32 when comparing with BDD100k. This allows for testing and evaluating data acquisition and labeling strategies in under half a day and contributes to the transparency and development speed in the field of active learning for object detection.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent zero-shot generalization to new language tasks. However, effective utilization of LLMs for zero-shot visual question-answering (VQA) remains challenging, primarily due to the modality disconnection and task disconnection between LLM and VQA task. End-to-end training on vision and language data may bridge the disconnections, but is inflexible and computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose \emph{Img2Prompt}, a plug-and-play module that provides the prompts that can bridge the aforementioned modality and task disconnections, so that LLMs can perform zero-shot VQA tasks without end-to-end training. In order to provide such prompts, we further employ LLM-agnostic models to provide prompts that can describe image content and self-constructed question-answer pairs, which can effectively guide LLM to perform zero-shot VQA tasks. Img2Prompt offers the following benefits: 1) It can flexibly work with various LLMs to perform VQA. 2)~Without the needing of end-to-end training, it significantly reduces the cost of deploying LLM for zero-shot VQA tasks. 3) It achieves comparable or better performance than methods relying on end-to-end training. For example, we outperform Flamingo \cite{Deepmind:Flamingo2022} by 5.6\% on VQAv2. On the challenging A-OKVQA dataset, our method even outperforms few-shot methods by as much as 20\%.

- **Summary**: Learning effective motion features is an essential pursuit of video representation learning. This paper presents a simple yet effective sample construction strategy to boost the learning of motion features in video contrastive learning. The proposed method, dubbed Motion-focused Quadruple Construction (MoQuad), augments the instance discrimination by meticulously disturbing the appearance and motion of both the positive and negative samples to create a quadruple for each video instance, such that the model is encouraged to exploit motion information. Unlike recent approaches that create extra auxiliary tasks for learning motion features or apply explicit temporal modelling, our method keeps the simple and clean contrastive learning paradigm (i.e.,SimCLR) without multi-task learning or extra modelling. In addition, we design two extra training strategies by analyzing initial MoQuad experiments. By simply applying MoQuad to SimCLR, extensive experiments show that we achieve superior performance on downstream tasks compared to the state of the arts. Notably, on the UCF-101 action recognition task, we achieve 93.7% accuracy after pre-training the model on Kinetics-400 for only 200 epochs, surpassing various previous methods

- **Summary**: Recently, deep networks have shown impressive performance for the segmentation of cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. However, their achievement is proving slow to transition to widespread use in medical clinics because of robustness issues leading to low trust of clinicians to their results. Predicting run-time quality of segmentation masks can be useful to warn clinicians against poor results. Despite its importance, there are few studies on this problem. To address this gap, we propose a quality control method based on the agreement across decoders of a multi-view network, TMS-Net, measured by the cosine similarity. The network takes three view inputs resliced from the same 3D image along different axes. Different from previous multi-view networks, TMS-Net has a single encoder and three decoders, leading to better noise robustness, segmentation performance and run-time quality estimation in our experiments on the segmentation of the left atrium on STACOM 2013 and STACOM 2018 challenge datasets. We also present a way to generate poor segmentation masks by using noisy images generated with engineered noise and Rician noise to simulate undertraining, high anisotropy and poor imaging settings problems. Our run-time quality estimation method show a good classification of poor and good quality segmentation masks with an AUC reaching to 0.97 on STACOM 2018. We believe that TMS-Net and our run-time quality estimation method has a high potential to increase the thrust of clinicians to automatic image analysis tools.

- **Summary**: Uniform-precision neural network quantization has gained popularity since it simplifies densely packed arithmetic unit for high computing capability. However, it ignores heterogeneous sensitivity to the impact of quantization errors across the layers, resulting in sub-optimal inference accuracy. This work proposes a novel neural architecture search called neural channel expansion that adjusts the network structure to alleviate accuracy degradation from ultra-low uniform-precision quantization. The proposed method selectively expands channels for the quantization sensitive layers while satisfying hardware constraints (e.g., FLOPs, PARAMs). Based on in-depth analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt several popular networks channels to achieve superior 2-bit quantization accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. In particular, we achieve the best-to-date Top-1/Top-5 accuracy for 2-bit ResNet50 with smaller FLOPs and the parameter size.

- **Summary**: Due to the high activation sparsity and use of accumulates (AC) instead of expensive multiply-and-accumulates (MAC), neuromorphic spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising low-power alternative to traditional DNNs for several computer vision (CV) applications. However, most existing SNNs require multiple time steps for acceptable inference accuracy, hindering real-time deployment and increasing spiking activity and, consequently, energy consumption. Recent works proposed direct encoding that directly feeds the analog pixel values in the first layer of the SNN in order to significantly reduce the number of time steps. Although the overhead for the first layer MACs with direct encoding is negligible for deep SNNs and the CV processing is efficient using SNNs, the data transfer between the image sensors and the downstream processing costs significant bandwidth and may dominate the total energy. To mitigate this concern, we propose an in-sensor computing hardware-software co-design framework for SNNs targeting image recognition tasks. Our approach reduces the bandwidth between sensing and processing by 12-96x and the resulting total energy by 2.32x compared to traditional CV processing, with a 3.8% reduction in accuracy on ImageNet.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation (DA) is indispensable in modern machine learning and deep neural networks. The basic idea of DA is to construct new training data to improve the model's generalization by adding slightly disturbed versions of existing data or synthesizing new data. In this work, we review a small but essential subset of DA -- Mix-based Data Augmentation (MixDA) that generates novel samples by mixing multiple examples. Unlike conventional DA approaches based on a single-sample operation or requiring domain knowledge, MixDA is more general in creating a broad spectrum of new data and has received increasing attention in the community. We begin with proposing a new taxonomy classifying MixDA into, Mixup-based, Cutmix-based, and hybrid approaches according to a hierarchical view of the data mix. Various MixDA techniques are then comprehensively reviewed in a more fine-grained way. Owing to its generalization, MixDA has penetrated a variety of applications which are also completely reviewed in this work. We also examine why MixDA works from different aspects of improving model performance, generalization, and calibration while explaining the model behavior based on the properties of MixDA. Finally, we recapitulate the critical findings and fundamental challenges of current MixDA studies, and outline the potential directions for future works. Different from previous related works that summarize the DA approaches in a specific domain (e.g., images or natural language processing) or only review a part of MixDA studies, we are the first to provide a systematical survey of MixDA in terms of its taxonomy, methodology, applications, and explainability. This work can serve as a roadmap to MixDA techniques and application reviews while providing promising directions for researchers interested in this exciting area.

- **Summary**: Community detection in Social Networks is associated with finding and grouping the most similar nodes inherent in the network. These similar nodes are identified by computing tie strength. Stronger ties indicates higher proximity shared by connected node pairs. This work is motivated by Granovetter's argument that suggests that strong ties lies within densely connected nodes and the theory that community cores in real-world networks are densely connected. In this paper, we have introduced a novel method called \emph{Disjoint Community detection using Cascades (DCC)} which demonstrates the effectiveness of a new local density based tie strength measure on detecting communities. Here, tie strength is utilized to decide the paths followed for propagating information. The idea is to crawl through the tuple information of cascades towards the community core guided by increasing tie strength. Considering the cascade generation step, a novel preferential membership method has been developed to assign community labels to unassigned nodes. The efficacy of $DCC$ has been analyzed based on quality and accuracy on several real-world datasets and baseline community detection algorithms.

- **Summary**: Obtaining ground truth data in medical imaging has difficulties due to the fact that it requires a lot of annotating time from the experts in the field. Also, when trained with supervised learning, it detects only the cases included in the labels. In real practice, we want to also open to other possibilities than the named cases while examining the medical images. As a solution, the need for anomaly detection that can detect and localize abnormalities by learning the normal characteristics using only normal images is emerging. With medical image data, we can design either 2D or 3D networks of self-supervised learning for anomaly detection task. Although 3D networks, which learns 3D structures of the human body, show good performance in 3D medical image anomaly detection, they cannot be stacked in deeper layers due to memory problems. While 2D networks have advantage in feature detection, they lack 3D context information. In this paper, we develop a method for combining the strength of the 3D network and the strength of the 2D network through joint embedding. We also propose the pretask of self-supervised learning to make it possible for the networks to learn efficiently. Through the experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves better performance in both classification and segmentation tasks compared to the SoTA method.



### Incremental Neural Implicit Representation with Uncertainty-Filtered Knowledge Distillation

- **Summary**: Recent neural implicit representations (NIRs) have achieved great success in the tasks of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, they suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem when continuously learning from streaming data without revisiting the previously seen data. This limitation prohibits the application of existing NIRs to scenarios where images come in sequentially. In view of this, we explore the task of incremental learning for NIRs in this work. We design a student-teacher framework to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem. Specifically, we iterate the process of using the student as the teacher at the end of each time step and let the teacher guide the training of the student in the next step. As a result, the student network is able to learn new information from the streaming data and retain old knowledge from the teacher network simultaneously. Although intuitive, naively applying the student-teacher pipeline does not work well in our task. Not all information from the teacher network is helpful since it is only trained with the old data. To alleviate this problem, we further introduce a random inquirer and an uncertainty-based filter to filter useful information. Our proposed method is general and thus can be adapted to different implicit representations such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and neural SDF. Extensive experimental results for both 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to different baselines.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present TruFor, a forensic framework that can be applied to a large variety of image manipulation methods, from classic cheapfakes to more recent manipulations based on deep learning. We rely on the extraction of both high-level and low-level traces through a transformer-based fusion architecture that combines the RGB image and a learned noise-sensitive fingerprint. The latter learns to embed the artifacts related to the camera internal and external processing by training only on real data in a self-supervised manner. Forgeries are detected as deviations from the expected regular pattern that characterizes each pristine image. Looking for anomalies makes the approach able to robustly detect a variety of local manipulations, ensuring generalization. In addition to a pixel-level localization map and a whole-image integrity score, our approach outputs a reliability map that highlights areas where localization predictions may be error-prone. This is particularly important in forensic applications in order to reduce false alarms and allow for a large scale analysis. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that our method is able to reliably detect and localize both cheapfakes and deepfakes manipulations outperforming state-of-the-art works.

- **Summary**: Automatic colorization of anime line drawing has attracted much attention in recent years since it can substantially benefit the animation industry. User-hint based methods are the mainstream approach for line drawing colorization, while reference-based methods offer a more intuitive approach. Nevertheless, although reference-based methods can improve feature aggregation of the reference image and the line drawing, the colorization results are not compelling in terms of color consistency or semantic correspondence. In this paper, we introduce an attention-based model for anime line drawing colorization, in which a channel-wise and spatial-wise Convolutional Attention module is used to improve the ability of the encoder for feature extraction and key area perception, and a Stop-Gradient Attention module with cross-attention and self-attention is used to tackle the cross-domain long-range dependency problem. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms other SOTA methods, with more accurate line structure and semantic color information.

- **Summary**: Efforts to improve the adversarial robustness of convolutional neural networks have primarily focused on developing more effective adversarial training methods. In contrast, little attention was devoted to analyzing the role of architectural elements (such as topology, depth, and width) on adversarial robustness. This paper seeks to bridge this gap and present a holistic study on the impact of architectural design on adversarial robustness. We focus on residual networks and consider architecture design at the block level, i.e., topology, kernel size, activation, and normalization, as well as at the network scaling level, i.e., depth and width of each block in the network. In both cases, we first derive insights through systematic ablative experiments. Then we design a robust residual block, dubbed RobustResBlock, and a compound scaling rule, dubbed RobustScaling, to distribute depth and width at the desired FLOP count. Finally, we combine RobustResBlock and RobustScaling and present a portfolio of adversarially robust residual networks, RobustResNets, spanning a broad spectrum of model capacities. Experimental validation across multiple datasets and adversarial attacks demonstrate that RobustResNets consistently outperform both the standard WRNs and other existing robust architectures, achieving state-of-the-art AutoAttack robust accuracy of 61.1% without additional data and 63.7% with 500K external data while being $2\times$ more compact in terms of parameters.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based object detection is a powerful approach for detecting faulty insulators in power lines. This involves training an object detection model from scratch, or fine tuning a model that is pre-trained on benchmark computer vision datasets. This approach works well with a large number of insulator images, but can result in unreliable models in the low data regime. The current literature mainly focuses on detecting the presence or absence of insulator caps, which is a relatively easy detection task, and does not consider detection of finer faults such as flashed and broken disks. In this article, we formulate three object detection tasks for insulator and asset inspection from aerial images, focusing on incipient faults in disks. We curate a large reference dataset of insulator images that can be used to learn robust features for detecting healthy and faulty insulators. We study the advantage of using this dataset in the low target data regime by pre-training on the reference dataset followed by fine-tuning on the target dataset. The results suggest that object detection models can be used to detect faults in insulators at a much incipient stage, and that transfer learning adds value depending on the type of object detection model. We identify key factors that dictate performance in the low data-regime and outline potential approaches to improve the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: In recent years multi-label, multi-class video action recognition has gained significant popularity. While reasoning over temporally connected atomic actions is mundane for intelligent species, standard artificial neural networks (ANN) still struggle to classify them. In the real world, atomic actions often temporally connect to form more complex composite actions. The challenge lies in recognising composite action of varying durations while other distinct composite or atomic actions occur in the background. Drawing upon the success of relational networks, we propose methods that learn to reason over the semantic concept of objects and actions. We empirically show how ANNs benefit from pretraining, relational inductive biases and unordered set-based latent representations. In this paper we propose deep set conditioned I3D (SCI3D), a two stream relational network that employs latent representation of state and visual representation for reasoning over events and actions. They learn to reason about temporally connected actions in order to identify all of them in the video. The proposed method achieves an improvement of around 1.49% mAP in atomic action recognition and 17.57% mAP in composite action recognition, over a I3D-NL baseline, on the CATER dataset.

- **Summary**: Automatically estimating 3D skeleton, shape, camera viewpoints, and part articulation from sparse in-the-wild image ensembles is a severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most prior methods rely on large-scale image datasets, dense temporal correspondence, or human annotations like camera pose, 2D keypoints, and shape templates. We propose Hi-LASSIE, which performs 3D articulated reconstruction from only 20-30 online images in the wild without any user-defined shape or skeleton templates. We follow the recent work of LASSIE that tackles a similar problem setting and make two significant advances. First, instead of relying on a manually annotated 3D skeleton, we automatically estimate a class-specific skeleton from the selected reference image. Second, we improve the shape reconstructions with novel instance-specific optimization strategies that allow reconstructions to faithful fit on each instance while preserving the class-specific priors learned across all images. Experiments on in-the-wild image ensembles show that Hi-LASSIE obtains higher fidelity state-of-the-art 3D reconstructions despite requiring minimum user input.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a content relationship distillation (CRD) to tackle the over-parameterized generative adversarial networks (GANs) for the serviceability in cutting-edge devices. In contrast to traditional instance-level distillation, we design a novel GAN compression oriented knowledge by slicing the contents of teacher outputs into multiple fine-grained granularities, such as row/column strips (global information) and image patches (local information), modeling the relationships among them, such as pairwise distance and triplet-wise angle, and encouraging the student to capture these relationships within its output contents. Built upon our proposed content-level distillation, we also deploy an online teacher discriminator, which keeps updating when co-trained with the teacher generator and keeps freezing when co-trained with the student generator for better adversarial training. We perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, the results of which show that our CRD reaches the most complexity reduction on GANs while obtaining the best performance in comparison with existing methods. For example, we reduce MACs of CycleGAN by around 40x and parameters by over 80x, meanwhile, 46.61 FIDs are obtained compared with these of 51.92 for the current state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: The architecture of transformers, which recently witness booming applications in vision tasks, has pivoted against the widespread convolutional paradigm. Relying on the tokenization process that splits inputs into multiple tokens, transformers are capable of extracting their pairwise relationships using self-attention. While being the stemming building block of transformers, what makes for a good tokenizer has not been well understood in computer vision. In this work, we investigate this uncharted problem from an information trade-off perspective. In addition to unifying and understanding existing structural modifications, our derivation leads to better design strategies for vision tokenizers. The proposed Modulation across Tokens (MoTo) incorporates inter-token modeling capability through normalization. Furthermore, a regularization objective TokenProp is embraced in the standard training regime. Through extensive experiments on various transformer architectures, we observe both improved performance and intriguing properties of these two plug-and-play designs with negligible computational overhead. These observations further indicate the importance of the commonly-omitted designs of tokenizers in vision transformer.



### A recurrent CNN for online object detection on raw radar frames

- **Summary**: Automotive radar sensors provide valuable information for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Radars can reliably estimate the distance to an object and the relative velocity, regardless of weather and light conditions. However, radar sensors suffer from low resolution and huge intra-class variations in the shape of objects. Exploiting the time information (e.g., multiple frames) has been shown to help to capture better the dynamics of objects and, therefore, the variation in the shape of objects. Most temporal radar object detectors use 3D convolutions to learn spatial and temporal information. However, these methods are often non-causal and unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents RECORD, a new recurrent CNN architecture for online radar object detection. We propose an end-to-end trainable architecture mixing convolutions and ConvLSTMs to learn spatio-temporal dependencies between successive frames. Our model is causal and requires only the past information encoded in the memory of the ConvLSTMs to detect objects. Our experiments show such a method's relevance for detecting objects in different radar representations (range-Doppler, range-angle) and outperform state-of-the-art models on the ROD2021 and CARRADA datasets while being less computationally expensive.

- **Summary**: Contrastive representation learning has proven to be an effective self-supervised learning method for images and videos. Most successful approaches are based on Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and use different views of an instance as positives that should be contrasted with other instances, called negatives, that are considered as noise. However, several instances in a dataset are drawn from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information. A good data representation should contain relations between the instances, or semantic similarity and dissimilarity, that contrastive learning harms by considering all negatives as noise. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive Estimation (SCE). Our training objective is a soft contrastive one that brings the positives closer and estimates a continuous distribution to push or pull negative instances based on their learned similarities. We validate empirically our approach on both image and video representation learning. We show that SCE performs competitively with the state of the art on the ImageNet linear evaluation protocol for fewer pretraining epochs and that it generalizes to several downstream image tasks. We also show that SCE reaches state-of-the-art results for pretraining video representation and that the learned representation can generalize to video downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Anomaly Detection is a relevant problem that arises in numerous real-world applications, especially when dealing with images. However, there has been little research for this task in the Continual Learning setting. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called SCALE (SCALing is Enough) to perform Compressed Replay in a framework for Anomaly Detection in Continual Learning setting. The proposed technique scales and compresses the original images using a Super Resolution model which, to the best of our knowledge, is studied for the first time in the Continual Learning setting. SCALE can achieve a high level of compression while maintaining a high level of image reconstruction quality. In conjunction with other Anomaly Detection approaches, it can achieve optimal results. To validate the proposed approach, we use a real-world dataset of images with pixel-based anomalies, with the scope to provide a reliable benchmark for Anomaly Detection in the context of Continual Learning, serving as a foundation for further advancements in the field.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has made significant strides in the field of remote sensing. Finding a large number of labeled datasets for SSL methods is uncommon, and manually labeling datasets is expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, accurately identifying remote sensing satellite images is more complicated than it is for conventional images. Class-imbalanced datasets are another prevalent phenomenon, and models trained on these become biased towards the majority classes. This becomes a critical issue with an SSL model's subpar performance. We aim to address the issue of labeling unlabeled data and also solve the model bias problem due to imbalanced datasets while achieving better accuracy. To accomplish this, we create "artificial" labels and train a model to have reasonable accuracy. We iteratively redistribute the classes through resampling using a distribution alignment technique. We use a variety of class imbalanced satellite image datasets: EuroSAT, UCM, and WHU-RS19. On UCM balanced dataset, our method outperforms previous methods MSMatch and FixMatch by 1.21% and 0.6%, respectively. For imbalanced EuroSAT, our method outperforms MSMatch and FixMatch by 1.08% and 1%, respectively. Our approach significantly lessens the requirement for labeled data, consistently outperforms alternative approaches, and resolves the issue of model bias caused by class imbalance in datasets.

- **Summary**: Neural image classifiers are known to undergo severe performance degradation when exposed to input that exhibits covariate shift with respect to the training distribution. In this paper, we show that recent Text-to-Image (T2I) generators' ability to edit images to approximate interventions via natural-language prompts is a promising technology to train more robust classifiers. Using current open-source models, we find that a variety of prompting strategies are effective for producing augmented training datasets sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance (1) in widely adopted Single-Domain Generalization benchmarks, (2) in reducing classifiers' dependency on spurious features and (3) facilitating the application of Multi-Domain Generalization techniques when fewer training domains are available.

- **Summary**: Objective: Imbalances of the electrolyte concentration levels in the body can lead to catastrophic consequences, but accurate and accessible measurements could improve patient outcomes. While blood tests provide accurate measurements, they are invasive and the laboratory analysis can be slow or inaccessible. In contrast, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely adopted tool which is quick and simple to acquire. However, the problem of estimating continuous electrolyte concentrations directly from ECGs is not well-studied. We therefore investigate if regression methods can be used for accurate ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentrations. Methods: We explore the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for this task. We analyze the regression performance across four electrolytes, utilizing a novel dataset containing over 290000 ECGs. For improved understanding, we also study the full spectrum from continuous predictions to binary classification of extreme concentration levels. To enhance clinical usefulness, we finally extend to a probabilistic regression approach and evaluate different uncertainty estimates. Results: We find that the performance varies significantly between different electrolytes, which is clinically justified in the interplay of electrolytes and their manifestation in the ECG. We also compare the regression accuracy with that of traditional machine learning models, demonstrating superior performance of DNNs. Conclusion: Discretization can lead to good classification performance, but does not help solve the original problem of predicting continuous concentration levels. While probabilistic regression demonstrates potential practical usefulness, the uncertainty estimates are not particularly well-calibrated. Significance: Our study is a first step towards accurate and reliable ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentration levels.

- **Summary**: Nine language-vision AI models trained on web scrapes with the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) objective are evaluated for evidence of a bias studied by psychologists: the sexual objectification of girls and women, which occurs when a person's human characteristics, such as emotions, are disregarded and the person is treated as a body. We replicate three experiments in psychology quantifying sexual objectification and show that the phenomena persist in AI. A first experiment uses standardized images of women from the Sexual OBjectification and EMotion Database, and finds that human characteristics are disassociated from images of objectified women: the model's recognition of emotional state is mediated by whether the subject is fully or partially clothed. Embedding association tests (EATs) return significant effect sizes for both anger (d >0.80) and sadness (d >0.50), associating images of fully clothed subjects with emotions. GRAD-CAM saliency maps highlight that CLIP gets distracted from emotional expressions in objectified images. A second experiment measures the effect in a representative application: an automatic image captioner (Antarctic Captions) includes words denoting emotion less than 50% as often for images of partially clothed women than for images of fully clothed women. A third experiment finds that images of female professionals (scientists, doctors, executives) are likely to be associated with sexual descriptions relative to images of male professionals. A fourth experiment shows that a prompt of "a [age] year old girl" generates sexualized images (as determined by an NSFW classifier) up to 73% of the time for VQGAN-CLIP and Stable Diffusion; the corresponding rate for boys never surpasses 9%. The evidence indicates that language-vision AI models trained on web scrapes learn biases of sexual objectification, which propagate to downstream applications.

- **Summary**: We present 3D Highlighter, a technique for localizing semantic regions on a mesh using text as input. A key feature of our system is the ability to interpret "out-of-domain" localizations. Our system demonstrates the ability to reason about where to place non-obviously related concepts on an input 3D shape, such as adding clothing to a bare 3D animal model. Our method contextualizes the text description using a neural field and colors the corresponding region of the shape using a probability-weighted blend. Our neural optimization is guided by a pre-trained CLIP encoder, which bypasses the need for any 3D datasets or 3D annotations. Thus, 3D Highlighter is highly flexible, general, and capable of producing localizations on a myriad of input shapes. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/threedle/3DHighlighter.

- **Summary**: We present X-Decoder, a generalized decoding model that can predict pixel-level segmentation and language tokens seamlessly. X-Decodert takes as input two types of queries: (i) generic non-semantic queries and (ii) semantic queries induced from text inputs, to decode different pixel-level and token-level outputs in the same semantic space. With such a novel design, X-Decoder is the first work that provides a unified way to support all types of image segmentation and a variety of vision-language (VL) tasks. Further, our design enables seamless interactions across tasks at different granularities and brings mutual benefits by learning a common and rich pixel-level visual-semantic understanding space, without any pseudo-labeling. After pretraining on a mixed set of a limited amount of segmentation data and millions of image-text pairs, X-Decoder exhibits strong transferability to a wide range of downstream tasks in both zero-shot and finetuning settings. Notably, it achieves (1) state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary segmentation and referring segmentation on eight datasets; (2) better or competitive finetuned performance to other generalist and specialist models on segmentation and VL tasks; and (3) flexibility for efficient finetuning and novel task composition (e.g., referring captioning and image editing).

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques have made considerable progress in image inpainting, restoration, and reconstruction in the last few years. Image outpainting, also known as image extrapolation, lacks attention and practical approaches to be fulfilled, owing to difficulties caused by large-scale area loss and less legitimate neighboring information. These difficulties have made outpainted images handled by most of the existing models unrealistic to human eyes and spatially inconsistent. When upsampling through deconvolution to generate fake content, the naive generation methods may lead to results lacking high-frequency details and structural authenticity. Therefore, as our novelties to handle image outpainting problems, we introduce structural prior as a condition to optimize the generation quality and a new semantic embedding term to enhance perceptual sanity. we propose a deep learning method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and condition edges as structural prior in order to assist the generation. We use a multi-phase adversarial training scheme that comprises edge inference training, contents inpainting training, and joint training. The newly added semantic embedding loss is proved effective in practice.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in various industries. While recent decades have witnessed the introduction of many advanced two-dimensional (2D) human pose estimation solutions, three-dimensional (3D) human pose estimation is still an active research field in computer vision. Generally speaking, 3D human pose estimation methods can be divided into two categories: single-stage and two-stage. In this paper, we focused on the 2D-to-3D lifting process in the two-stage methods and proposed a more advanced baseline model for 3D human pose estimation, based on the existing solutions. Our improvements include optimization of machine learning models and multiple parameters, as well as introduction of a weighted loss to the training model. Finally, we used the Human3.6M benchmark to test the final performance and it did produce satisfactory results.

- **Summary**: Generalisation to unseen contexts remains a challenge for embodied navigation agents. In the context of semantic audio-visual navigation (SAVi) tasks, the notion of generalisation should include both generalising to unseen indoor visual scenes as well as generalising to unheard sounding objects. However, previous SAVi task definitions do not include evaluation conditions on truly novel sounding objects, resorting instead to evaluating agents on unheard sound clips of known objects; meanwhile, previous SAVi methods do not include explicit mechanisms for incorporating domain knowledge about object and region semantics. These weaknesses limit the development and assessment of models' abilities to generalise their learned experience. In this work, we introduce the use of knowledge-driven scene priors in the semantic audio-visual embodied navigation task: we combine semantic information from our novel knowledge graph that encodes object-region relations, spatial knowledge from dual Graph Encoder Networks, and background knowledge from a series of pre-training tasks -- all within a reinforcement learning framework for audio-visual navigation. We also define a new audio-visual navigation sub-task, where agents are evaluated on novel sounding objects, as opposed to unheard clips of known objects. We show improvements over strong baselines in generalisation to unseen regions and novel sounding objects, within the Habitat-Matterport3D simulation environment, under the SoundSpaces task.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation can play an important role in addressing the issue of deriving scene geometry from 2D images. It has been used in a variety of industries, including robots, self-driving cars, scene comprehension, 3D reconstructions, and others. The goal of our method is to create a lightweight machine-learning model in order to predict the depth value of each pixel given only a single RGB image as input with the Unet structure of the image segmentation network. We use the NYU Depth V2 dataset to test the structure and compare the result with other methods. The proposed method achieves relatively high accuracy and low rootmean-square error.

- **Summary**: For satellite images, the presence of clouds presents a problem as clouds obscure more than half to two-thirds of the ground information. This problem causes many issues for reliability in a noise-free environment to communicate data and other applications that need seamless monitoring. Removing the clouds from the images while keeping the background pixels intact can help address the mentioned issues. Recently, deep learning methods have become popular for researching cloud removal by demonstrating promising results, among which Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown considerably better performance. In this project, we aim to address cloud removal from satellite images using AttentionGAN and then compare our results by reproducing the results obtained using traditional GANs and auto-encoders. We use RICE dataset. The outcome of this project can be used to develop applications that require cloud-free satellite images. Moreover, our results could be helpful for making further research improvements.

- **Summary**: Objective: Accurate visual classification of bladder tissue during Trans-Urethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) procedures is essential to improve early cancer diagnosis and treatment. During TURBT interventions, White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) techniques are used for lesion detection. Each imaging technique provides diverse visual information that allows clinicians to identify and classify cancerous lesions. Computer vision methods that use both imaging techniques could improve endoscopic diagnosis. We address the challenge of tissue classification when annotations are available only in one domain, in our case WLI, and the endoscopic images correspond to an unpaired dataset, i.e. there is no exact equivalent for every image in both NBI and WLI domains. Method: We propose a semi-surprised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method composed of three main components: a teacher network trained on the labeled WLI data; a cycle-consistency GAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, and a multi-input student network. To ensure the quality of the synthetic images generated by the proposed GAN we perform a detailed quantitative, and qualitative analysis with the help of specialists. Conclusion: The overall average classification accuracy, precision, and recall obtained with the proposed method for tissue classification are 0.90, 0.88, and 0.89 respectively, while the same metrics obtained in the unlabeled domain (NBI) are 0.92, 0.64, and 0.94 respectively. The quality of the generated images is reliable enough to deceive specialists. Significance: This study shows the potential of using semi-supervised GAN-based bladder tissue classification when annotations are limited in multi-domain data.

- **Summary**: Arbitrary Style Transfer is a technique used to produce a new image from two images: a content image, and a style image. The newly produced image is unseen and is generated from the algorithm itself. Balancing the structure and style components has been the major challenge that other state-of-the-art algorithms have tried to solve. Despite all the efforts, it's still a major challenge to apply the artistic style that was originally created on top of the structure of the content image while maintaining consistency. In this work, we solved these problems by using a Deep Learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks. Our implementation will first extract foreground from the background using the pre-trained Detectron 2 model from the content image, and then apply the Arbitrary Style Transfer technique that is used in SANet. Once we have the two styled images, we will stitch the two chunks of images after the process of style transfer for the complete end piece.

- **Summary**: Prior works on improving speech quality with visual input typically study each type of auditory distortion separately (e.g., separation, inpainting, video-to-speech) and present tailored algorithms. This paper proposes to unify these subjects and study Generalized Speech Enhancement, where the goal is not to reconstruct the exact reference clean signal, but to focus on improving certain aspects of speech. In particular, this paper concerns intelligibility, quality, and video synchronization. We cast the problem as audio-visual speech resynthesis, which is composed of two steps: pseudo audio-visual speech recognition (P-AVSR) and pseudo text-to-speech synthesis (P-TTS). P-AVSR and P-TTS are connected by discrete units derived from a self-supervised speech model. Moreover, we utilize self-supervised audio-visual speech model to initialize P-AVSR. The proposed model is coined ReVISE. ReVISE is the first high-quality model for in-the-wild video-to-speech synthesis and achieves superior performance on all LRS3 audio-visual enhancement tasks with a single model. To demonstrates its applicability in the real world, ReVISE is also evaluated on EasyCom, an audio-visual benchmark collected under challenging acoustic conditions with only 1.6 hours of training data. Similarly, ReVISE greatly suppresses noise and improves quality. Project page: https://wnhsu.github.io/ReVISE.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art object detectors are treated as black boxes due to their highly non-linear internal computations. Even with unprecedented advancements in detector performance, the inability to explain how their outputs are generated limits their use in safety-critical applications. Previous work fails to produce explanations for both bounding box and classification decisions, and generally make individual explanations for various detectors. In this paper, we propose an open-source Detector Explanation Toolkit (DExT) which implements the proposed approach to generate a holistic explanation for all detector decisions using certain gradient-based explanation methods. We suggests various multi-object visualization methods to merge the explanations of multiple objects detected in an image as well as the corresponding detections in a single image. The quantitative evaluation show that the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) is more faithfully explained compared to other detectors regardless of the explanation methods. Both quantitative and human-centric evaluations identify that SmoothGrad with Guided Backpropagation (GBP) provides more trustworthy explanations among selected methods across all detectors. We expect that DExT will motivate practitioners to evaluate object detectors from the interpretability perspective by explaining both bounding box and classification decisions.

- **Summary**: The management of cattle over a huge area is still a challenging problem in the farming sector. With evolution in technology, Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with consumer level digital cameras are becoming a popular alternative to manual animal censuses for livestock estimation since they are less risky and expensive.This paper evaluated and compared the cutting-edge object detection algorithms, YOLOv7,RetinaNet with ResNet50 backbone, RetinaNet with EfficientNet and mask RCNN. It aims to improve the occlusion problem that is to detect hidden cattle from a huge dataset captured by drones using deep learning algorithms for accurate cattle detection. Experimental results showed YOLOv7 was superior with precision of 0.612 when compared to the other two algorithms. The proposed method proved superior to the usual competing algorithms for cow face detection, especially in very difficult cases.

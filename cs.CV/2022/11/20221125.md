- **Summary**: Efficient inference of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is essential to making AI ubiquitous. Two important algorithmic techniques have shown promise for enabling efficient inference - sparsity and binarization. These techniques translate into weight sparsity and weight repetition at the hardware-software level enabling the deployment of DNNs with critically low power and latency requirements. We propose a new method called signed-binary networks to improve efficiency further (by exploiting both weight sparsity and weight repetition together) while maintaining similar accuracy. Our method achieves comparable accuracy on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets with binary and can lead to 69% sparsity. We observe real speedup when deploying these models on general-purpose devices and show that this high percentage of unstructured sparsity can lead to a further reduction in energy consumption on ASICs.

- **Summary**: Siamese-network-based self-supervised learning (SSL) suffers from slow convergence and instability in training. To alleviate this, we propose a framework to exploit intermediate self-supervisions in each stage of deep nets, called the Ladder Siamese Network. Our self-supervised losses encourage the intermediate layers to be consistent with different data augmentations to single samples, which facilitates training progress and enhances the discriminative ability of the intermediate layers themselves. While some existing work has already utilized multi-level self supervisions in SSL, ours is different in that 1) we reveal its usefulness with non-contrastive Siamese frameworks in both theoretical and empirical viewpoints, and 2) ours improves image-level classification, instance-level detection, and pixel-level segmentation simultaneously. Experiments show that the proposed framework can improve BYOL baselines by 1.0% points in ImageNet linear classification, 1.2% points in COCO detection, and 3.1% points in PASCAL VOC segmentation. In comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, our Ladder-based model achieves competitive and balanced performances in all tested benchmarks without causing large degradation in one.

- **Summary**: Although transformer networks are recently employed in various vision tasks with outperforming performance, extensive training data and a lengthy training time are required to train a model to disregard an inductive bias. Using trainable links between the channel-wise spatial attention of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the attention head of Vision Transformers (ViT), we present a regularization technique to improve the training efficiency of ViT. The trainable links are referred to as the attention augmentation module, which is trained simultaneously with ViT, boosting the training of ViT and allowing it to avoid the overfitting issue caused by a lack of data. From the trained attention augmentation module, we can extract the relevant relationship between each CNN activation map and each ViT attention head, and based on this, we also propose an advanced attention augmentation module. Consequently, even with a small amount of data, the suggested method considerably improves the performance of ViT while achieving faster convergence during training.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated great zero-shot performance for image-text matching because of its holistic use of natural language supervision that covers large-scale, open-world visual concepts. However, it is still challenging to adapt CLIP to compositional image and text matching -- a more challenging image and matching mask requiring the model understanding of compositional word concepts and visual components. Towards better compositional generalization in zero-shot image and text matching, in this paper, we study the problem from a causal perspective: the erroneous semantics of individual entities are essentially confounders that cause the matching failure. Therefore, we propose a novel training-free compositional CLIP model (ComCLIP). ComCLIP disentangles input images into subjects, objects, and action sub-images and composes CLIP's vision encoder and text encoder to perform evolving matching over compositional text embedding and sub-image embeddings. In this way, ComCLIP can mitigate spurious correlations introduced by the pretrained CLIP models and dynamically assess the contribution of each entity when performing image and text matching. Experiments on compositional image-text matching on SVO and ComVG and general image-text retrieval on Flickr8K demonstrate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play method, which boosts the zero-shot inference ability of CLIP even without further training or fine-tuning of CLIP.

- **Summary**: Image inpainting is the process of regenerating lost parts of the image. Supervised algorithm-based methods have shown excellent results but have two significant drawbacks. They do not perform well when tested with unseen data. They fail to capture the global context of the image, resulting in a visually unappealing result. We propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for image-inpainting: Weighted Self-Supervised Learning (WSSL) to tackle these problems. We designed WSSL to learn features from multiple weighted pretext tasks. These features are then utilized for the downstream task, image-inpainting. To improve the performance of our framework and produce more visually appealing images, we also present a novel loss function for image inpainting. The loss function takes advantage of both reconstruction loss and perceptual loss functions to regenerate the image. Our experimentation shows WSSL outperforms previous methods, and our loss function helps produce better results.

- **Summary**: In recent years, some researchers focused on using a single image to obtain a large number of samples through multi-scale features. This study intends to a brand-new idea that requires only ten or even fewer samples to construct the low-rank structural-Hankel matrices-assisted score-based generative model (SHGM) for color image inpainting task. During the prior learning process, a certain amount of internal-middle patches are firstly extracted from several images and then the structural-Hankel matrices are constructed from these patches. To better apply the score-based generative model to learn the internal statistical distribution within patches, the large-scale Hankel matrices are finally folded into the higher dimensional tensors for prior learning. During the iterative inpainting process, SHGM views the inpainting problem as a conditional generation procedure in low-rank environment. As a result, the intermediate restored image is acquired by alternatively performing the stochastic differential equation solver, alternating direction method of multipliers, and data consistency steps. Experimental results demonstrated the remarkable performance and diversity of SHGM.

- **Summary**: We focus on the task of far-field 3D detection (Far3Det) of objects beyond a certain distance from an observer, e.g., $>$50m. Far3Det is particularly important for autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating at highway speeds, which require detections of far-field obstacles to ensure sufficient braking distances. However, contemporary AV benchmarks such as nuScenes underemphasize this problem because they evaluate performance only up to a certain distance (50m). One reason is that obtaining far-field 3D annotations is difficult, particularly for lidar sensors that produce very few point returns for far-away objects. Indeed, we find that almost 50% of far-field objects (beyond 50m) contain zero lidar points. Secondly, current metrics for 3D detection employ a "one-size-fits-all" philosophy, using the same tolerance thresholds for near and far objects, inconsistent with tolerances for both human vision and stereo disparities. Both factors lead to an incomplete analysis of the Far3Det task. For example, while conventional wisdom tells us that high-resolution RGB sensors should be vital for 3D detection of far-away objects, lidar-based methods still rank higher compared to RGB counterparts on the current benchmark leaderboards. As a first step towards a Far3Det benchmark, we develop a method to find well-annotated scenes from the nuScenes dataset and derive a well-annotated far-field validation set. We also propose a Far3Det evaluation protocol and explore various 3D detection methods for Far3Det. Our result convincingly justifies the long-held conventional wisdom that high-resolution RGB improves 3D detection in the far-field. We further propose a simple yet effective method that fuses detections from RGB and lidar detectors based on non-maximum suppression, which remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art 3D detectors in the far-field.

- **Summary**: Fully convolutional detectors discard the one-to-many assignment and adopt a one-to-one assigning strategy to achieve end-to-end detection but suffer from the slow convergence issue. In this paper, we revisit these two assignment methods and find that bringing one-to-many assignment back to end-to-end fully convolutional detectors helps with model convergence. Based on this observation, we propose {\em \textbf{D}ual \textbf{A}ssignment} for end-to-end fully convolutional de\textbf{TE}ction (DATE). Our method constructs two branches with one-to-many and one-to-one assignment during training and speeds up the convergence of the one-to-one assignment branch by providing more supervision signals. DATE only uses the branch with the one-to-one matching strategy for model inference, which doesn't bring inference overhead. Experimental results show that Dual Assignment gives nontrivial improvements and speeds up model convergence upon OneNet and DeFCN. Code: https://github.com/YiqunChen1999/date.

- **Summary**: We present a large-scale facial UV-texture dataset that contains over 50,000 high-quality texture UV-maps with even illuminations, neutral expressions, and cleaned facial regions, which are desired characteristics for rendering realistic 3D face models under different lighting conditions. The dataset is derived from a large-scale face image dataset namely FFHQ, with the help of our fully automatic and robust UV-texture production pipeline. Our pipeline utilizes the recent advances in StyleGAN-based facial image editing approaches to generate multi-view normalized face images from single-image inputs. An elaborated UV-texture extraction, correction, and completion procedure is then applied to produce high-quality UV-maps from the normalized face images. Compared with existing UV-texture datasets, our dataset has more diverse and higher-quality texture maps. We further train a GAN-based texture decoder as the nonlinear texture basis for parametric fitting based 3D face reconstruction. Experiments show that our method improves the reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, and more importantly, produces high-quality texture maps that are ready for realistic renderings. The dataset, code, and pre-trained texture decoder are publicly available at https://github.com/csbhr/FFHQ-UV.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in Vision-Language (V&L) joint research have achieved remarkable results in various text-driven tasks. High-quality Text-to-video (T2V), a task that has been long considered mission-impossible, was proven feasible with reasonably good results in latest works. However, the resulting videos often have undesired artifacts largely because the system is purely data-driven and agnostic to the physical laws. To tackle this issue and further push T2V towards high-level physical realism, we present an autonomous data generation technique and a dataset, which intend to narrow the gap with a large number of multi-modal, 3D Text-to-Video/Simulation (T2V/S) data. In the dataset, we provide high-resolution 3D physical simulations for both solids and fluids, along with textual descriptions of the physical phenomena. We take advantage of state-of-the-art physical simulation methods (i) Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) and (ii) Material Point Method (MPM) to simulate diverse scenarios, including elastic deformations, material fractures, collisions, turbulence, etc. Additionally, high-quality, multi-view rendering videos are supplied for the benefit of T2V, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and other communities. This work is the first step towards fully automated Text-to-Video/Simulation (T2V/S). Live examples and subsequent work are at https://sites.google.com/view/tpa-net.

- **Summary**: The use of vision transformers (ViT) in computer vision is increasing due to limited inductive biases (e.g., locality, weight sharing, etc.) and increased scalability compared to other deep learning methods. This has led to some initial studies on the use of ViT for biometric recognition, including fingerprint recognition. In this work, we improve on these initial studies for transformers in fingerprint recognition by i.) evaluating additional attention-based architectures, ii.) scaling to larger and more diverse training and evaluation datasets, and iii.) combining the complimentary representations of attention-based and CNN-based embeddings for improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) fingerprint recognition (both authentication and identification). Our combined architecture, AFR-Net (Attention-Driven Fingerprint Recognition Network), outperforms several baseline transformer and CNN-based models, including a SOTA commercial fingerprint system, Verifinger v12.3, across intra-sensor, cross-sensor, and latent to rolled fingerprint matching datasets. Additionally, we propose a realignment strategy using local embeddings extracted from intermediate feature maps within the networks to refine the global embeddings in low certainty situations, which boosts the overall recognition accuracy significantly across each of the models. This realignment strategy requires no additional training and can be applied as a wrapper to any existing deep learning network (including attention-based, CNN-based, or both) to boost its performance.



### Learning Detailed Radiance Manifolds for High-Fidelity and 3D-Consistent Portrait Synthesis from Monocular Image

- **Summary**: A key challenge for novel view synthesis of monocular portrait images is 3D consistency under continuous pose variations. Most existing methods rely on 2D generative models which often leads to obvious 3D inconsistency artifacts. We present a 3D-consistent novel view synthesis approach for monocular portrait images based on a recent proposed 3D-aware GAN, namely Generative Radiance Manifolds (GRAM), which has shown strong 3D consistency at multiview image generation of virtual subjects via the radiance manifolds representation. However, simply learning an encoder to map a real image into the latent space of GRAM can only reconstruct coarse radiance manifolds without faithful fine details, while improving the reconstruction fidelity via instance-specific optimization is time-consuming. We introduce a novel detail manifolds reconstructor to learn 3D-consistent fine details on the radiance manifolds from monocular images, and combine them with the coarse radiance manifolds for high-fidelity reconstruction. The 3D priors derived from the coarse radiance manifolds are used to regulate the learned details to ensure reasonable synthesized results at novel views. Trained on in-the-wild 2D images, our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent portrait synthesis largely outperforming the prior art.

- **Summary**: The orthogonality constraints, including the hard and soft ones, have been used to normalize the weight matrices of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, especially the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), to reduce model parameter redundancy and improve training stability. However, the robustness to noisy data of these models with constraints is not always satisfactory. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage approximately orthogonal training framework (TAOTF) to find a trade-off between the orthogonal solution space and the main task solution space to solve this problem in noisy data scenarios. In the first stage, we propose a novel algorithm called polar decomposition-based orthogonal initialization (PDOI) to find a good initialization for the orthogonal optimization. In the second stage, unlike other existing methods, we apply soft orthogonal constraints for all layers of DNN model. We evaluate the proposed model-agnostic framework both on the natural image and medical image datasets, which show that our method achieves stable and superior performances to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Standard multi-modal models assume the use of the same modalities in training and inference stages. However, in practice, the environment in which multi-modal models operate may not satisfy such assumption. As such, their performances degrade drastically if any modality is missing in the inference stage. We ask: how can we train a model that is robust to missing modalities? This paper seeks a set of good practices for multi-modal action recognition, with a particular interest in circumstances where some modalities are not available at an inference time. First, we study how to effectively regularize the model during training (e.g., data augmentation). Second, we investigate on fusion methods for robustness to missing modalities: we find that transformer-based fusion shows better robustness for missing modality than summation or concatenation. Third, we propose a simple modular network, ActionMAE, which learns missing modality predictive coding by randomly dropping modality features and tries to reconstruct them with the remaining modality features. Coupling these good practices, we build a model that is not only effective in multi-modal action recognition but also robust to modality missing. Our model achieves the state-of-the-arts on multiple benchmarks and maintains competitive performances even in missing modality scenarios.

- **Summary**: Previous studies show the necessity of global and local adjustment for image enhancement. However, existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models face great challenges in balancing the computational efficiency and effectiveness of global-local information usage. Especially, existing methods typically adopt the global-to-local fusion mode, ignoring the importance of bidirectional interactions. To address those issues, we propose a novel mutual guidance network (MGN) to perform effective bidirectional global-local information exchange while keeping a compact architecture. In our design, we adopt a two-branch framework where one branch focuses more on modeling global relations while the other is committed to processing local information. Then, we develop an efficient attention-based mutual guidance approach throughout our framework for bidirectional global-local interactions. As a result, both the global and local branches can enjoy the merits of mutual information aggregation. Besides, to further refine the results produced by our MGN, we propose a novel residual integration scheme following the divide-and-conquer philosophy. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public image enhancement benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The radiation dose in computed tomography (CT) examinations is harmful for patients but can be significantly reduced by intuitively decreasing the number of projection views. Reducing projection views usually leads to severe aliasing artifacts in reconstructed images. Previous deep learning (DL) techniques with sparse-view data require sparse-view/full-view CT image pairs to train the network with supervised manners. When the number of projection view changes, the DL network should be retrained with updated sparse-view/full-view CT image pairs. To relieve this limitation, we present a fully unsupervised score-based generative model in sinogram domain for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on full-view sinogram data and use multi-channel strategy to form highdimensional tensor as the network input to capture their prior distribution. Then, at the inference stage, the stochastic differential equation (SDE) solver and data-consistency step were performed iteratively to achieve fullview projection. Filtered back-projection (FBP) algorithm was used to achieve the final image reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative studies were implemented to evaluate the presented method with several CT data. Experimental results demonstrated that our method achieved comparable or better performance than the supervised learning counterparts.



### UperFormer: A Multi-scale Transformer-based Decoder for Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: While a large number of recent works on semantic segmentation focus on designing and incorporating a transformer-based encoder, much less attention and vigor have been devoted to transformer-based decoders. For such a task whose hallmark quest is pixel-accurate prediction, we argue that the decoder stage is just as crucial as that of the encoder in achieving superior segmentation performance, by disentangling and refining the high-level cues and working out object boundaries with pixel-level precision. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based decoder called UperFormer, which is plug-and-play for hierarchical encoders and attains high quality segmentation results regardless of encoder architecture. UperFormer is equipped with carefully designed multi-head skip attention units and novel upsampling operations. Multi-head skip attention is able to fuse multi-scale features from backbones with those in decoders. The upsampling operation, which incorporates feature from encoder, can be more friendly for object localization. It brings a 0.4% to 3.2% increase compared with traditional upsampling methods. By combining UperFormer with Swin Transformer (Swin-T), a fully transformer-based symmetric network is formed for semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach is highly effective and computationally efficient. On Cityscapes dataset, we achieve state-of-the-art performance. On the more challenging ADE20K dataset, our best model yields a single-scale mIoU of 50.18, and a multi-scale mIoU of 51.8, which is on-par with the current state-of-art model, while we drastically cut the number of FLOPs by 53.5%.

- **Summary**: We present XKD, a novel self-supervised framework to learn meaningful representations from unlabelled video clips. XKD is trained with two pseudo tasks. First, masked data reconstruction is performed to learn individual representations from audio and visual streams. Next, self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation is performed between the two modalities through teacher-student setups to learn complementary information. To identify the most effective information to transfer and also to tackle the domain gap between audio and visual modalities which could hinder knowledge transfer, we introduce a domain alignment and feature refinement strategy for effective cross-modal knowledge distillation. Lastly, to develop a general-purpose network capable of handling both audio and visual streams, modality-agnostic variants of our proposed framework are introduced, which use the same backbone for both audio and visual modalities. Our proposed cross-modal knowledge distillation improves linear evaluation top-1 accuracy of video action classification by 8.6% on UCF101, 8.2% on HMDB51, 13.9% on Kinetics-Sound, and 15.7% on Kinetics400. Additionally, our modality-agnostic variant shows promising results in developing a general-purpose network capable of learning both data streams for solving different downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: There has been increasing attention on planning model learning in classical planning. Most existing approaches, however, focus on learning planning models from structured data in symbolic representations. It is often difficult to obtain such structured data in real-world scenarios. Although a number of approaches have been developed for learning planning models from fully observed unstructured data (e.g., images), in many scenarios raw observations are often incomplete. In this paper, we provide a novel framework, \aType{Recplan}, for learning a transition model from partially observed raw image traces. More specifically, by considering the preceding and subsequent images in a trace, we learn the latent state representations of raw observations and then build a transition model based on such representations. Additionally, we propose a neural-network-based approach to learn a heuristic model that estimates the distance toward a given goal observation. Based on the learned transition model and heuristic model, we implement a classical planner for images. We exhibit empirically that our approach is more effective than a state-of-the-art approach of learning visual planning models in the environment with incomplete observations.

- **Summary**: Normally eosinophils are present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of healthy individuals. When the eosinophils increase beyond their usual amount in the GI tract, a patient gets varied symptoms. Clinicians find it difficult to diagnose this condition called eosinophilia. Early diagnosis can help in treating patients. Histopathology is the gold standard in the diagnosis for this condition. As this is an under-diagnosed condition, counting eosinophils in the GI tract biopsies is important. In this study, we trained and tested a deep neural network based on UNet to detect and count eosinophils in GI tract biopsies. We used connected component analysis to extract the eosinophils. We studied correlation of eosinophilic infiltration counted by AI with a manual count. GI tract biopsy slides were stained with H&E stain. Slides were scanned using a camera attached to a microscope and five high-power field images were taken per slide. Pearson correlation coefficient was 85% between the machine-detected and manual eosinophil counts on 300 held-out (test) images.

- **Summary**: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been widely used in pipeline detection and underground diagnosis. In practical applications, the characteristics of the GPR data of the detected area and the likely underground anomalous structures could be rarely acknowledged before fully analyzing the obtained GPR data, causing challenges to identify the underground structures or abnormals automatically. In this paper, a GPR B-scan image diagnosis method based on learning in the model space is proposed. The idea of learning in the model space is to use models fitted on parts of data as more stable and parsimonious representations of the data. For the GPR image, 2-Direction Echo State Network (2D-ESN) is proposed to fit the image segments through the next item prediction. By building the connections between the points on the image in both the horizontal and vertical directions, the 2D-ESN regards the GPR image segment as a whole and could effectively capture the dynamic characteristics of the GPR image. And then, semi-supervised and supervised learning methods could be further implemented on the 2D-ESN models for underground diagnosis. Experiments on real-world datasets are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: Triggered by the success of transformers in various visual tasks, the spatial self-attention mechanism has recently attracted more and more attention in the computer vision community. However, we empirically found that a typical vision transformer with the spatial self-attention mechanism could not learn accurate attention maps for distinguishing different categories of fine-grained images. To address this problem, motivated by the temporal attention mechanism in brains, we propose a spatial-temporal attention network for learning fine-grained feature representations, called STAN, where the features learnt by implementing a sequence of spatial self-attention operations corresponding to multiple moments are aggregated progressively. The proposed STAN consists of four modules: a self-attention backbone module for learning a sequence of features with self-attention operations, a spatial feature self-organizing module for facilitating the model training, a spatial-temporal feature learning module for aggregating the re-organized features via a Long Short-Term Memory network, and a context-aware module that is implemented as the forget block of the spatial-temporal feature learning module for preserving/forgetting the long-term memory by utilizing contextual information. Then, we propose a STAN-based method for open-set fine-grained recognition by integrating the proposed STAN network with a linear classifier, called STAN-OSFGR. Extensive experimental results on 3 fine-grained datasets and 2 coarse-grained datasets demonstrate that the proposed STAN-OSFGR outperforms 9 state-of-the-art open-set recognition methods significantly in most cases.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have demonstrated great potential in solving dipole inversion for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM). However, the performances of most existing deep learning methods drastically degrade with mismatched sequence parameters such as acquisition orientation and spatial resolution. We propose an end-to-end AFfine Transformation Edited and Refined (AFTER) deep neural network for QSM, which is robust against arbitrary acquisition orientation and spatial resolution up to 0.6 mm isotropic at the finest. The AFTER-QSM neural network starts with a forward affine transformation layer, followed by an Unet for dipole inversion, then an inverse affine transformation layer, followed by a Residual Dense Network (RDN) for QSM refinement. Simulation and in-vivo experiments demonstrated that the proposed AFTER-QSM network architecture had excellent generalizability. It can successfully reconstruct susceptibility maps from highly oblique and anisotropic scans, leading to the best image quality assessments in simulation tests and suppressed streaking artifacts and noise levels for in-vivo experiments compared with other methods. Furthermore, ablation studies showed that the RDN refinement network significantly reduced image blurring and susceptibility underestimation due to affine transformations. In addition, the AFTER-QSM network substantially shortened the reconstruction time from minutes using conventional methods to only a few seconds.

- **Summary**: Recently, text-guided image manipulation has received increasing attention in the research field of multimedia processing and computer vision due to its high flexibility and controllability. Its goal is to semantically manipulate parts of an input reference image according to the text descriptions. However, most of the existing works have the following problems: (1) text-irrelevant content cannot always be maintained but randomly changed, (2) the performance of image manipulation still needs to be further improved, (3) only can manipulate descriptive attributes. To solve these problems, we propose a novel image manipulation method that interactively edits an image using complex text instructions. It allows users to not only improve the accuracy of image manipulation but also achieve complex tasks such as enlarging, dwindling, or removing objects and replacing the background with the input image. To make these tasks possible, we apply three strategies. First, the given image is divided into text-relevant content and text-irrelevant content. Only the text-relevant content is manipulated and the text-irrelevant content can be maintained. Second, a super-resolution method is used to enlarge the manipulation region to further improve the operability and to help manipulate the object itself. Third, a user interface is introduced for editing the segmentation map interactively to re-modify the generated image according to the user's desires. Extensive experiments on the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB) dataset and Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) datasets demonstrate our proposed method can enable interactive, flexible, and accurate image manipulation in real-time. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In practice, Wearable Human Activity Recognition (WHAR) models usually face performance degradation on the new user due to user variance. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) becomes the natural solution to cross-user WHAR under annotation scarcity. Existing UDA models usually align samples across domains without differentiation, which ignores the difference among samples. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation model with sample weight learning (SWL-Adapt) for cross-user WHAR. SWL-Adapt calculates sample weights according to the classification loss and domain discrimination loss of each sample with a parameterized network. We introduce the meta-optimization based update rule to learn this network end-to-end, which is guided by meta-classification loss on the selected pseudo-labeled target samples. Therefore, this network can fit a weighting function according to the cross-user WHAR task at hand, which is superior to existing sample differentiation rules fixed for special scenarios. Extensive experiments on three public WHAR datasets demonstrate that SWL-Adapt achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the cross-user WHAR task, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 3.1% and 5.3% in accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively.

- **Summary**: A master face is a face image that passes face-based identity authentication for a high percentage of the population. These faces can be used to impersonate, with a high probability of success, any user, without having access to any user information. We optimize these faces for 2D and 3D face verification models, by using an evolutionary algorithm in the latent embedding space of the StyleGAN face generator. For 2D face verification, multiple evolutionary strategies are compared, and we propose a novel approach that employs a neural network to direct the search toward promising samples, without adding fitness evaluations. The results we present demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a considerable coverage of the identities in the LFW or RFW datasets with less than 10 master faces, for six leading deep face recognition systems. In 3D, we generate faces using the 2D StyleGAN2 generator and predict a 3D structure using a deep 3D face reconstruction network. When employing two different 3D face recognition systems, we are able to obtain a coverage of 40%-50%. Additionally, we present the generation of paired 2D RGB and 3D master faces, which simultaneously match 2D and 3D models with high impersonation rates.

- **Summary**: Visual anomaly detection plays a crucial role in not only manufacturing inspection to find defects of products during manufacturing processes, but also maintenance inspection to keep equipment in optimum working condition particularly outdoors. Due to the scarcity of the defective samples, unsupervised anomaly detection has attracted great attention in recent years. However, existing datasets for unsupervised anomaly detection are biased towards manufacturing inspection, not considering maintenance inspection which is usually conducted under outdoor uncontrolled environment such as varying camera viewpoints, messy background and degradation of object surface after long-term working. We focus on outdoor maintenance inspection and contribute a comprehensive Maintenance Inspection Anomaly Detection (MIAD) dataset which contains more than 100K high-resolution color images in various outdoor industrial scenarios. This dataset is generated by a 3D graphics software and covers both surface and logical anomalies with pixel-precise ground truth. Extensive evaluations of representative algorithms for unsupervised anomaly detection are conducted, and we expect MIAD and corresponding experimental results can inspire research community in outdoor unsupervised anomaly detection tasks. Worthwhile and related future work can be spawned from our new dataset.

- **Summary**: An increasing amount of applications rely on data-driven models that are deployed for perception tasks across a sequence of scenes. Due to the mismatch between training and deployment data, adapting the model on the new scenes is often crucial to obtain good performance. In this work, we study continual multi-scene adaptation for the task of semantic segmentation, assuming that no ground-truth labels are available during deployment and that performance on the previous scenes should be maintained. We propose training a Semantic-NeRF network for each scene by fusing the predictions of a segmentation model and then using the view-consistent rendered semantic labels as pseudo-labels to adapt the model. Through joint training with the segmentation model, the Semantic-NeRF model effectively enables 2D-3D knowledge transfer. Furthermore, due to its compact size, it can be stored in a long-term memory and subsequently used to render data from arbitrary viewpoints to reduce forgetting. We evaluate our approach on ScanNet, where we outperform both a voxel-based baseline and a state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation method.

- **Summary**: As the scope of machine learning broadens, we observe a recurring theme of algorithmic monoculture: the same systems, or systems that share components (e.g. training data), are deployed by multiple decision-makers. While sharing offers clear advantages (e.g. amortizing costs), does it bear risks? We introduce and formalize one such risk, outcome homogenization: the extent to which particular individuals or groups experience negative outcomes from all decision-makers. If the same individuals or groups exclusively experience undesirable outcomes, this may institutionalize systemic exclusion and reinscribe social hierarchy. To relate algorithmic monoculture and outcome homogenization, we propose the component-sharing hypothesis: if decision-makers share components like training data or specific models, then they will produce more homogeneous outcomes. We test this hypothesis on algorithmic fairness benchmarks, demonstrating that sharing training data reliably exacerbates homogenization, with individual-level effects generally exceeding group-level effects. Further, given the dominant paradigm in AI of foundation models, i.e. models that can be adapted for myriad downstream tasks, we test whether model sharing homogenizes outcomes across tasks. We observe mixed results: we find that for both vision and language settings, the specific methods for adapting a foundation model significantly influence the degree of outcome homogenization. We conclude with philosophical analyses of and societal challenges for outcome homogenization, with an eye towards implications for deployed machine learning systems.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised foreground-background segmentation aims at extracting salient objects from cluttered backgrounds, where Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approaches, especially layered GANs, show great promise. However, without human annotations, they are typically prone to produce foreground and background layers with non-negligible semantic and visual confusion, dubbed "information leakage", resulting in notable degeneration of the generated segmentation mask. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective explicit layer independence modeling approach, termed Independent Layer Synthesis GAN (ILSGAN), pursuing independent foreground-background layer generation by encouraging their discrepancy. Specifically, it targets minimizing the mutual information between visible and invisible regions of the foreground and background to spur interlayer independence. Through in-depth theoretical and experimental analyses, we justify that explicit layer independence modeling is critical to suppressing information leakage and contributes to impressive segmentation performance gains. Also, our ILSGAN achieves strong state-of-the-art generation quality and segmentation performance on complex real-world data.

- **Summary**: The power of DNNs depends heavily on the quantity and quality of training data. However, collecting and annotating data on a large scale is often costly and time-consuming, which severely hinders the application of DNNs. To address this issue, we explore a new task, termed as dataset expansion, which seeks to expand a ready-to-use small dataset by automatically creating new labeled samples. To this end, we present a Guided Imagination Framework (GIF) that leverages cutting-edge generative models (e.g., DALL-E2, Stable Diffusion (SD)) to ``imagine'' and create informative new data from the input seed data. Specifically, GIF conducts data imagination by optimizing the latent features of the seed data in the semantically meaningful space of the prior model, which are used to create photo-realistic images with new content. To guide the imagination towards creating informative samples for model training, we introduce two key criteria, i.e., class-maintained information boosting and sample diversity promotion. The two criteria are verified to be essential for effective dataset expansion: GIF-SD obtains 13.5\% higher model accuracy on natural image datasets than unguided expansion with SD. With these essential criteria, GIF expands datasets effectively in various small-data scenarios, boosting model accuracy by 36.9\% on average over six natural image datasets and by 13.5\% on average over three medical datasets.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the industrial sector has evolved towards its fourth revolution. The quality control domain is particularly interested in advanced machine learning for computer vision anomaly detection. Nevertheless, several challenges have to be faced, including imbalanced datasets, the image complexity, and the zero-false-negative (ZFN) constraint to guarantee the high-quality requirement. This paper illustrates a use case for an industrial partner, where Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) images are first reconstructed with a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) trained on normal products. Then, several multi-level metrics are extracted on a few normal and abnormal images, highlighting anomalies through reconstruction differences. Finally, a classifer is trained to build a composite anomaly score thanks to the metrics extracted. This three-step approach is performed on the public MVTec-AD datasets and on the partner PCBA dataset, where it achieves a regular accuracy of 95.69% and 87.93% under the ZFN constraint.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have recently shown superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification and segmentation. However, in fine-grained image re-identification (ReID), the labels are indexes, lacking concrete text descriptions. Therefore, it remains to be determined how such models could be applied to these tasks. This paper first finds out that simply fine-tuning the visual model initialized by the image encoder in CLIP, has already obtained competitive performances in various ReID tasks. Then we propose a two-stage strategy to facilitate a better visual representation. The key idea is to fully exploit the cross-modal description ability in CLIP through a set of learnable text tokens for each ID and give them to the text encoder to form ambiguous descriptions. In the first training stage, image and text encoders from CLIP keep fixed, and only the text tokens are optimized from scratch by the contrastive loss computed within a batch. In the second stage, the ID-specific text tokens and their encoder become static, providing constraints for fine-tuning the image encoder. With the help of the designed loss in the downstream task, the image encoder is able to represent data as vectors in the feature embedding accurately. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated on several datasets for the person or vehicle ReID tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Syliz517/CLIP-ReID.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the multi-scale aggregation strategy for scene text detection in natural images. We present the Aggregated Text TRansformer(ATTR), which is designed to represent texts in scene images with a multi-scale self-attention mechanism. Starting from the image pyramid with multiple resolutions, the features are first extracted at different scales with shared weight and then fed into an encoder-decoder architecture of Transformer. The multi-scale image representations are robust and contain rich information on text contents of various sizes. The text Transformer aggregates these features to learn the interaction across different scales and improve text representation. The proposed method detects scene texts by representing each text instance as an individual binary mask, which is tolerant of curve texts and regions with dense instances. Extensive experiments on public scene text detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have been developed for a variety of tasks and are deployed every day to work in real conditions. Some of these tasks are critical and models need to be trusted and safe, e.g. military communications or cancer diagnosis. These models are given real data, simulated data or combination of both and are trained to be highly predictive on them. However, gathering enough real data or simulating them to be representative of all the real conditions is: costly, sometimes impossible due to confidentiality and most of the time impossible. Indeed, real conditions are constantly changing and sometimes are intractable. A solution is to deploy machine learning models that are able to give predictions when they are confident enough otherwise raise a flag or abstain. One issue is that standard models easily fail at detecting out-of-distribution samples where their predictions are unreliable.   We present here TrustGAN, a generative adversarial network pipeline targeting trustness. It is a deep learning pipeline which improves a target model estimation of the confidence without impacting its predictive power. The pipeline can accept any given deep learning model which outputs a prediction and a confidence on this prediction. Moreover, the pipeline does not need to modify this target model. It can thus be easily deployed in a MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) setting.   The pipeline is applied here to a target classification model trained on MNIST data to recognise numbers based on images. We compare such a model when trained in the standard way and with TrustGAN. We show that on out-of-distribution samples, here FashionMNIST and CIFAR10, the estimated confidence is largely reduced. We observe similar conclusions for a classification model trained on 1D radio signals from AugMod, tested on RML2016.04C. We also publicly release the code.

- **Summary**: The quality of training datasets for deep neural networks is a key factor contributing to the accuracy of resulting models. This effect is amplified in difficult tasks such as object detection. Dealing with errors in datasets is often limited to accepting that some fraction of examples is incorrect, estimating their confidence and assigning appropriate weights or ignoring uncertain ones during training. In this work, we propose a different approach. We introduce the Confident Learning for Object Detection (CLOD) algorithm for assessing the quality of each label in object detection datasets, identifying missing, spurious, mislabeled and mislocated bounding boxes and suggesting corrections. By focusing on finding incorrect examples in the training datasets, we can eliminate them at the root. Suspicious bounding boxes can be reviewed in order to improve the quality of the dataset, leading to better models without further complicating their already complex architectures. The proposed method is able to point out 99% of artificially disturbed bounding boxes with a false positive rate below 0.3. We see this method as a promising path to correcting popular object detection datasets.

- **Summary**: We present Dynamic Neural Portraits, a novel approach to the problem of full-head reenactment. Our method generates photo-realistic video portraits by explicitly controlling head pose, facial expressions and eye gaze. Our proposed architecture is different from existing methods that rely on GAN-based image-to-image translation networks for transforming renderings of 3D faces into photo-realistic images. Instead, we build our system upon a 2D coordinate-based MLP with controllable dynamics. Our intuition to adopt a 2D-based representation, as opposed to recent 3D NeRF-like systems, stems from the fact that video portraits are captured by monocular stationary cameras, therefore, only a single viewpoint of the scene is available. Primarily, we condition our generative model on expression blendshapes, nonetheless, we show that our system can be successfully driven by audio features as well. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is 270 times faster than recent NeRF-based reenactment methods, with our networks achieving speeds of 24 fps for resolutions up to 1024 x 1024, while outperforming prior works in terms of visual quality.

- **Summary**: Continual learning for segmentation has recently seen increasing interest. However, all previous works focus on narrow semantic segmentation and disregard panoptic segmentation, an important task with real-world impacts. %a In this paper, we present the first continual learning model capable of operating on both semantic and panoptic segmentation. Inspired by recent transformer approaches that consider segmentation as a mask-classification problem, we design CoMFormer. Our method carefully exploits the properties of transformer architectures to learn new classes over time. Specifically, we propose a novel adaptive distillation loss along with a mask-based pseudo-labeling technique to effectively prevent forgetting. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a novel continual panoptic segmentation benchmark on the challenging ADE20K dataset. Our CoMFormer outperforms all the existing baselines by forgetting less old classes but also learning more effectively new classes. In addition, we also report an extensive evaluation in the large-scale continual semantic segmentation scenario showing that CoMFormer also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Most deep learning methods for video frame interpolation consist of three main components: feature extraction, motion estimation, and image synthesis. Existing approaches are mainly distinguishable in terms of how these modules are designed. However, when interpolating high-resolution images, e.g. at 4K, the design choices for achieving high accuracy within reasonable memory requirements are limited. The feature extraction layers help to compress the input and extract relevant information for the latter stages, such as motion estimation. However, these layers are often costly in parameters, computation time, and memory. We show how ideas from dimensionality reduction combined with a lightweight optimization can be used to compress the input representation while keeping the extracted information suitable for frame interpolation. Further, we require neither a pretrained flow network nor a synthesis network, additionally reducing the number of trainable parameters and required memory. When evaluating on three 4K benchmarks, we achieve state-of-the-art image quality among the methods without pretrained flow while having the lowest network complexity and memory requirements overall.

- **Summary**: Long-term autonomy is one of the most demanded capabilities looked into a robot. The possibility to perform the same task over and over on a long temporal horizon, offering a high standard of reproducibility and robustness, is appealing. Long-term autonomy can play a crucial role in the adoption of robotics systems for precision agriculture, for example in assisting humans in monitoring and harvesting crops in a large orchard. With this scope in mind, we report an ongoing effort in the long-term deployment of an autonomous mobile robot in a vineyard for data collection across multiple months. The main aim is to collect data from the same area at different points in time so to be able to analyse the impact of the environmental changes in the mapping and localisation tasks. In this work, we present a map-based localisation study taking 4 data sessions. We identify expected failures when the pre-built map visually differs from the environment's current appearance and we anticipate LTS-Net, a solution pointed at extracting stable temporal features for improving long-term 4D localisation results.

- **Summary**: Recent research showed that the dual-pixel sensor has made great progress in defocus map estimation and image defocus deblurring. However, extracting real-time dual-pixel views is troublesome and complex in algorithm deployment. Moreover, the deblurred image generated by the defocus deblurring network lacks high-frequency details, which is unsatisfactory in human perception. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel defocus deblurring method that uses the guidance of the defocus map to implement image deblurring. The proposed method consists of a learnable blur kernel to estimate the defocus map, which is an unsupervised method, and a single-image defocus deblurring generative adversarial network (DefocusGAN) for the first time. The proposed network can learn the deblurring of different regions and recover realistic details. We propose a defocus adversarial loss to guide this training process. Competitive experimental results confirm that with a learnable blur kernel, the generated defocus map can achieve results comparable to supervised methods. In the single-image defocus deblurring task, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, especially significant improvements in perceptual quality, where PSNR reaches 25.56 dB and LPIPS reaches 0.111.

- **Summary**: Scene flow estimation is a long-standing problem in computer vision, where the goal is to find the 3D motion of a scene from its consecutive observations. Recently, there have been efforts to compute the scene flow from 3D point clouds. A common approach is to train a regression model that consumes source and target point clouds and outputs the per-point translation vector. An alternative is to learn point matches between the point clouds concurrently with regressing a refinement of the initial correspondence flow. In both cases, the learning task is very challenging since the flow regression is done in the free 3D space, and a typical solution is to resort to a large annotated synthetic dataset. We introduce SCOOP, a new method for scene flow estimation that can be learned on a small amount of data without employing ground-truth flow supervision. In contrast to previous work, we train a pure correspondence model focused on learning point feature representation and initialize the flow as the difference between a source point and its softly corresponding target point. Then, in the run-time phase, we directly optimize a flow refinement component with a self-supervised objective, which leads to a coherent and accurate flow field between the point clouds. Experiments on widespread datasets demonstrate the performance gains achieved by our method compared to existing leading techniques while using a fraction of the training data. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/itailang/SCOOP.

- **Summary**: Performance of trimap-free image matting methods is limited when trying to decouple the deterministic and undetermined regions, especially in the scenes where foregrounds are semantically ambiguous, chromaless, or high transmittance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Privileged Prior Information Distillation for Image Matting (PPID-IM) that can effectively transfer privileged prior environment-aware information to improve the performance of students in solving hard foregrounds. The prior information of trimap regulates only the teacher model during the training stage, while not being fed into the student network during actual inference. In order to achieve effective privileged cross-modality (i.e. trimap and RGB) information distillation, we introduce a Cross-Level Semantic Distillation (CLSD) module that reinforces the trimap-free students with more knowledgeable semantic representations and environment-aware information. We also propose an Attention-Guided Local Distillation module that efficiently transfers privileged local attributes from the trimap-based teacher to trimap-free students for the guidance of local-region optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our PPID framework on the task of image matting. In addition, our trimap-free IndexNet-PPID surpasses the other competing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, especially in scenarios with chromaless, weak texture, or irregular objects.

- **Summary**: Pooling is essentially an operation from the field of Mathematical Morphology, with max pooling as a limited special case. The more general setting of MorphPooling greatly extends the tool set for building neural networks. In addition to pooling operations, encoder-decoder networks used for pixel-level predictions also require unpooling. It is common to combine unpooling with convolution or deconvolution for up-sampling. However, using its morphological properties, unpooling can be generalised and improved. Extensive experimentation on two tasks and three large-scale datasets shows that morphological pooling and unpooling lead to improved predictive performance at much reduced parameter counts.

- **Summary**: The new trend of full-screen devices implies positioning the camera behind the screen to bring a larger display-to-body ratio, enhance eye contact, and provide a notch-free viewing experience on smartphones, TV or tablets. On the other hand, the images captured by under-display cameras (UDCs) are degraded by the screen in front of them. Deep learning methods for image restoration can significantly reduce the degradation of captured images, providing satisfying results for the human eyes. However, most proposed solutions are unreliable or efficient enough to be used in real-time on mobile devices.   In this paper, we aim to solve this image restoration problem using efficient deep learning methods capable of processing FHD images in real-time on commercial smartphones while providing high-quality results. We propose a lightweight model for blind UDC Image Restoration and HDR, and we also provide a benchmark comparing the performance and runtime of different methods on smartphones. Our models are competitive on UDC benchmarks while using x4 less operations than others. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to approach and analyze this real-world single image restoration problem from the efficiency and production point of view.

- **Summary**: We study the approximation of shift-invariant or equivariant functions by deep fully convolutional networks from the dynamical systems perspective. We prove that deep residual fully convolutional networks and their continuous-layer counterpart can achieve universal approximation of these symmetric functions at constant channel width. Moreover, we show that the same can be achieved by non-residual variants with at least 2 channels in each layer and convolutional kernel size of at least 2. In addition, we show that these requirements are necessary, in the sense that networks with fewer channels or smaller kernels fail to be universal approximators.

- **Summary**: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and the increasing popularity of camera-equipped devices, many edge video analytics applications are emerging, calling for the deployment of computation-intensive AI models at the network edge. Edge inference is a promising solution to move the computation-intensive workloads from low-end devices to a powerful edge server for video analytics, but the device-server communications will remain a bottleneck due to the limited bandwidth. This paper proposes a task-oriented communication framework for edge video analytics, where multiple devices collect the visual sensory data and transmit the informative features to an edge server for processing. To enable low-latency inference, this framework removes video redundancy in spatial and temporal domains and transmits minimal information that is essential for the downstream task, rather than reconstructing the videos at the edge server. Specifically, it extracts compact task-relevant features based on the deterministic information bottleneck (IB) principle, which characterizes a tradeoff between the informativeness of the features and the communication cost. As the features of consecutive frames are temporally correlated, we propose a temporal entropy model (TEM) to reduce the bitrate by taking the previous features as side information in feature encoding. To further improve the inference performance, we build a spatial-temporal fusion module at the server to integrate features of the current and previous frames for joint inference. Extensive experiments on video analytics tasks evidence that the proposed framework effectively encodes task-relevant information of video data and achieves a better rate-performance tradeoff than existing methods.

- **Summary**: We present a deep learning-based approach for skull reconstruction for MONAI, which has been pre-trained on the MUG500+ skull dataset. The implementation follows the MONAI contribution guidelines, hence, it can be easily tried out and used, and extended by MONAI users. The primary goal of this paper lies in the investigation of open-sourcing codes and pre-trained deep learning models under the MONAI framework. Nowadays, open-sourcing software, especially (pre-trained) deep learning models, has become increasingly important. Over the years, medical image analysis experienced a tremendous transformation. Over a decade ago, algorithms had to be implemented and optimized with low-level programming languages, like C or C++, to run in a reasonable time on a desktop PC, which was not as powerful as today's computers. Nowadays, users have high-level scripting languages like Python, and frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, along with a sea of public code repositories at hand. As a result, implementations that had thousands of lines of C or C++ code in the past, can now be scripted with a few lines and in addition executed in a fraction of the time. To put this even on a higher level, the Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence (MONAI) framework tailors medical imaging research to an even more convenient process, which can boost and push the whole field. The MONAI framework is a freely available, community-supported, open-source and PyTorch-based framework, that also enables to provide research contributions with pre-trained models to others. Codes and pre-trained weights for skull reconstruction are publicly available at: https://github.com/Project-MONAI/research-contributions/tree/master/SkullRec

- **Summary**: In this paper, we target image-based person-to-person virtual try-on in the presence of diverse poses and large viewpoint variations. Existing methods are restricted in this setting as they estimate garment warping flows mainly based on 2D poses and appearance, which omits the geometric prior of the 3D human body shape. Moreover, current garment warping methods are confined to localized regions, which makes them ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies and results in inferior flows with artifacts. To tackle these issues, we present 3D-aware global correspondences, which are reliable flows that jointly encode global semantic correlations, local deformations, and geometric priors of 3D human bodies. Particularly, given an image pair depicting the source and target person, (a) we first obtain their pose-aware and high-level representations via two encoders, and introduce a coarse-to-fine decoder with multiple refinement modules to predict the pixel-wise global correspondence. (b) 3D parametric human models inferred from images are incorporated as priors to regularize the correspondence refinement process so that our flows can be 3D-aware and better handle variations of pose and viewpoint. (c) Finally, an adversarial generator takes the garment warped by the 3D-aware flow, and the image of the target person as inputs, to synthesize the photo-realistic try-on result. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and our HardPose test set demonstrate the superiority of our method against the SOTA try-on approaches.

- **Summary**: Temporal action localization (TAL) requires long-form reasoning to predict actions of various durations and complex content. Given limited GPU memory, training TAL end to end (i.e., from videos to predictions) on long videos is a significant challenge. Most methods can only train on pre-extracted features without optimizing them for the localization problem, consequently limiting localization performance. In this work, to extend the potential in TAL networks, we propose a novel end-to-end method Re2TAL, which rewires pretrained video backbones for reversible TAL. Re2TAL builds a backbone with reversible modules, where the input can be recovered from the output such that the bulky intermediate activations can be cleared from memory during training. Instead of designing one single type of reversible module, we propose a network rewiring mechanism, to transform any module with a residual connection to a reversible module without changing any parameters. This provides two benefits: (1) a large variety of reversible networks are easily obtained from existing and even future model designs, and (2) the reversible models require much less training effort as they reuse the pre-trained parameters of their original non-reversible versions. Re2TAL, only using the RGB modality, reaches 37.01% average mAP on ActivityNet-v1.3, a new state-of-the-art record, and mAP 64.9% at tIoU=0.5 on THUMOS-14, outperforming all other RGB-only methods.

- **Summary**: The use of computer vision for product and assembly quality control is becoming ubiquitous in the manufacturing industry. Lately, it is apparent that machine learning based solutions are outperforming classical computer vision algorithms in terms of performance and robustness. However, a main drawback is that they require sufficiently large and labeled training datasets, which are often not available or too tedious and too time consuming to acquire. This is especially true for low-volume and high-variance manufacturing. Fortunately, in this industry, CAD models of the manufactured or assembled products are available. This paper introduces CAD2Render, a GPU-accelerated synthetic data generator based on the Unity High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). CAD2Render is designed to add variations in a modular fashion, making it possible for high customizable data generation, tailored to the needs of the industrial use case at hand. Although CAD2Render is specifically designed for manufacturing use cases, it can be used for other domains as well. We validate CAD2Render by demonstrating state of the art performance in two industrial relevant setups. We demonstrate that the data generated by our approach can be used to train object detection and pose estimation models with a high enough accuracy to direct a robot.

- **Summary**: Domain generalization is the task of learning models that generalize to unseen target domains. We propose a simple yet effective method for domain generalization, named cross-domain ensemble distillation (XDED), that learns domain-invariant features while encouraging the model to converge to flat minima, which recently turned out to be a sufficient condition for domain generalization. To this end, our method generates an ensemble of the output logits from training data with the same label but from different domains and then penalizes each output for the mismatch with the ensemble. Also, we present a de-stylization technique that standardizes features to encourage the model to produce style-consistent predictions even in an arbitrary target domain. Our method greatly improves generalization capability in public benchmarks for cross-domain image classification, cross-dataset person re-ID, and cross-dataset semantic segmentation. Moreover, we show that models learned by our method are robust against adversarial attacks and image corruptions.

- **Summary**: We present a novel paradigm for high-fidelity face swapping that faithfully preserves the desired subtle geometry and texture details. We rethink face swapping from the perspective of fine-grained face editing, \textit{i.e., ``editing for swapping'' (E4S)}, and propose a framework that is based on the explicit disentanglement of the shape and texture of facial components. Following the E4S principle, our framework enables both global and local swapping of facial features, as well as controlling the amount of partial swapping specified by the user. Furthermore, the E4S paradigm is inherently capable of handling facial occlusions by means of facial masks. At the core of our system lies a novel Regional GAN Inversion (RGI) method, which allows the explicit disentanglement of shape and texture. It also allows face swapping to be performed in the latent space of StyleGAN. Specifically, we design a multi-scale mask-guided encoder to project the texture of each facial component into regional style codes. We also design a mask-guided injection module to manipulate the feature maps with the style codes. Based on the disentanglement, face swapping is reformulated as a simplified problem of style and mask swapping. Extensive experiments and comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach in preserving texture and shape details, as well as working with high resolution images.

- **Summary**: In this work, we leverage estimated depth to boost self-supervised contrastive learning for segmentation of urban scenes, where unlabeled videos are readily available for training self-supervised depth estimation. We argue that the semantics of a coherent group of pixels in 3D space is self-contained and invariant to the contexts in which they appear. We group coherent, semantically related pixels into coherent depth regions given their estimated depth and use copy-paste to synthetically vary their contexts. In this way, cross-context correspondences are built in contrastive learning and a context-invariant representation is learned. For unsupervised semantic segmentation of urban scenes, our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art baseline by +7.14% in mIoU on Cityscapes and +6.65% on KITTI. For fine-tuning on Cityscapes and KITTI segmentation, our method is competitive with existing models, yet, we do not need to pre-train on ImageNet or COCO, and we are also more computationally efficient.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an application of the LayoutLMv3 model for semantic table detection on financial documents from the IIIT-AR-13K dataset. The motivation behind this paper's experiment was that LayoutLMv3's official paper had no results for table detection using semantic information. We concluded that our approach did not improve the model's table detection capabilities, for which we can give several possible reasons. Either the model's weights were unsuitable for our purpose, or we needed to invest more time in optimising the model's hyperparameters. It is also possible that semantic information does not improve a model's table detection accuracy.

- **Summary**: Manipulated images are a threat to consumers worldwide, when they are used to spread disinformation. Therefore, Comprint enables forgery detection by utilizing JPEG-compression fingerprints. This paper evaluates the impact of the training set on Comprint's performance. Most interestingly, we found that including images compressed with low quality factors during training does not have a significant effect on the accuracy, whereas incorporating recompression boosts the robustness. As such, consumers can use Comprint on their smartphones to verify the authenticity of images.

- **Summary**: Positive unlabeled learning is a binary classification problem with positive and unlabeled data. It is common in domains where negative labels are costly or impossible to obtain, e.g., medicine and personalized advertising. Most approaches to positive unlabeled learning apply to specific data types (e.g., images, categorical data) and can not generate new positive and negative samples. This work introduces a feature-space distance-based tensor network approach to the positive unlabeled learning problem. The presented method is not domain specific and significantly improves the state-of-the-art results on the MNIST image and 15 categorical/mixed datasets. The trained tensor network model is also a generative model and enables the generation of new positive and negative instances.

- **Summary**: By supervising camera rays between a scene and multi-view image planes, NeRF reconstructs a neural scene representation for the task of novel view synthesis. On the other hand, shadow rays between the light source and the scene have yet to be considered. Therefore, we propose a novel shadow ray supervision scheme that optimizes both the samples along the ray and the ray location. By supervising shadow rays, we successfully reconstruct a neural SDF of the scene from single-view images under multiple lighting conditions. Given single-view binary shadows, we train a neural network to reconstruct a complete scene not limited by the camera's line of sight. By further modeling the correlation between the image colors and the shadow rays, our technique can also be effectively extended to RGB inputs. We compare our method with previous works on challenging tasks of shape reconstruction from single-view binary shadow or RGB images and observe significant improvements.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure for the subsequent HSI applications. Unfortunately, though witnessing the development of deep learning in HSI denoising area, existing convolution-based methods face the trade-off between computational efficiency and capability to model non-local characteristics of HSI. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (SST) to alleviate this problem. To fully explore intrinsic similarity characteristics in both spatial dimension and spectral dimension, we conduct non-local spatial self-attention and global spectral self-attention with Transformer architecture. The window-based spatial self-attention focuses on the spatial similarity beyond the neighboring region. While, spectral self-attention exploits the long-range dependencies between highly correlative bands. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods in quantitative quality and visual results.

- **Summary**: Learning descriptive 3D features is crucial for understanding 3D scenes with diverse objects and complex structures. However, it is usually unknown whether important geometric attributes and scene context obtain enough emphasis in an end-to-end trained 3D scene understanding network. To guide 3D feature learning toward important geometric attributes and scene context, we explore the help of textual scene descriptions. Given some free-form descriptions paired with 3D scenes, we extract the knowledge regarding the object relationships and object attributes. We then inject the knowledge to 3D feature learning through three classification-based auxiliary tasks. This language-assisted training can be combined with modern object detection and instance segmentation methods to promote 3D semantic scene understanding, especially in a label-deficient regime. Moreover, the 3D feature learned with language assistance is better aligned with the language features, which can benefit various 3D-language multimodal tasks. Experiments on several benchmarks of 3D-only and 3D-language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our language-assisted 3D feature learning.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are common forms of neurodegenerative dementia. Behavioral alterations and cognitive impairments are found in the clinical courses of both diseases and their differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult for physicians. Therefore, an accurate tool dedicated to this diagnostic challenge can be valuable in clinical practice. However, current structural imaging methods mainly focus on the detection of each disease but rarely on their differential diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach for both problems of disease detection and differential diagnosis. We suggest utilizing two types of biomarkers for this application: structure grading and structure atrophy. First, we propose to train a large ensemble of 3D U-Nets to locally determine the anatomical patterns of healthy people, patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Frontotemporal dementia using structural MRI as input. The output of the ensemble is a 2-channel disease's coordinate map able to be transformed into a 3D grading map which is easy to interpret for clinicians. This 2-channel map is coupled with a multi-layer perceptron classifier for different classification tasks. Second, we propose to combine our deep learning framework with a traditional machine learning strategy based on volume to improve the model discriminative capacity and robustness. After both cross-validation and external validation, our experiments based on 3319 MRI demonstrated competitive results of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods for both disease detection and differential diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Generative image models have been extensively studied in recent years. In the unconditional setting, they model the marginal distribution from unlabelled images. To allow for more control, image synthesis can be conditioned on semantic segmentation maps that instruct the generator the position of objects in the image. While these two tasks are intimately related, they are generally studied in isolation. We propose OCO-GAN, for Optionally COnditioned GAN, which addresses both tasks in a unified manner, with a shared image synthesis network that can be conditioned either on semantic maps or directly on latents. Trained adversarially in an end-to-end approach with a shared discriminator, we are able to leverage the synergy between both tasks. We experiment with Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff, ADE20K datasets in a limited data, semi-supervised and full data regime and obtain excellent performance, improving over existing hybrid models that can generate both with and without conditioning in all settings. Moreover, our results are competitive or better than state-of-the art specialised unconditional and conditional models.

- **Summary**: Text-guided diffusion models have shown superior performance in image/video generation and editing. While few explorations have been performed in 3D scenarios. In this paper, we discuss three fundamental and interesting problems on this topic. First, we equip text-guided diffusion models to achieve $\textbf{3D-consistent generation}$. Specifically, we integrate a NeRF-like neural field to generate low-resolution coarse results for a given camera view. Such results can provide 3D priors as condition information for the following diffusion process. During denoising diffusion, we further enhance the 3D consistency by modeling cross-view correspondences with a novel two-stream (corresponding to two different views) asynchronous diffusion process. Second, we study $\textbf{3D local editing}$ and propose a two-step solution that can generate 360$^{\circ}$ manipulated results by editing an object from a single view. Step 1, we propose to perform 2D local editing by blending the predicted noises. Step 2, we conduct a noise-to-text inversion process that maps 2D blended noises into the view-independent text embedding space. Once the corresponding text embedding is obtained, 360$^{\circ}$ images can be generated. Last but not least, we extend our model to perform \textbf{one-shot novel view synthesis} by fine-tuning on a single image, firstly showing the potential of leveraging text guidance for novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments and various applications show the prowess of our 3DDesigner. The project page is available at https://3ddesigner-diffusion.github.io/.

- **Summary**: The photometric stereo (PS) problem consists in reconstructing the 3D-surface of an object, thanks to a set of photographs taken under different lighting directions. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale architecture for PS which, combined with a new dataset, yields state-of-the-art results. Our proposed architecture is flexible: it permits to consider a variable number of images as well as variable image size without loss of performance. In addition, we define a set of constraints to allow the generation of a relevant synthetic dataset to train convolutional neural networks for the PS problem. Our proposed dataset is much larger than pre-existing ones, and contains many objects with challenging materials having anisotropic reflectance (e.g. metals, glass). We show on publicly available benchmarks that the combination of both these contributions drastically improves the accuracy of the estimated normal field, in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine, most often diagnosed in childhood. It affects 2-3% of the population, which is approximately seven million people in North America. Currently, the reference standard for assessing scoliosis is based on the manual assignment of Cobb angles at the site of the curvature center. This manual process is time consuming and unreliable as it is affected by inter- and intra-observer variance. To overcome these inaccuracies, machine learning (ML) methods can be used to automate the Cobb angle measurement process. This paper proposes to address the Cobb angle measurement task using YOLACT, an instance segmentation model. The proposed method first segments the vertebrae in an X-Ray image using YOLACT, then it tracks the important landmarks using the minimum bounding box approach. Lastly, the extracted landmarks are used to calculate the corresponding Cobb angles. The model achieved a Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) score of 10.76%, demonstrating the reliability of this process in both vertebra localization and Cobb angle measurement.

- **Summary**: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is an important task for a variety of robotic applications such as grasping or localization. It is a challenging task due to object symmetries, clutter and occlusion, but it becomes more challenging when additional information, such as depth and 3D models, is not provided. We present a transformer-based approach that takes an RGB image as input and predicts a 6D pose for each object in the image. Besides the image, our network does not require any additional information such as depth maps or 3D object models. First, the image is passed through an object detector to generate feature maps and to detect objects. Then, the feature maps are fed into a transformer with the detected bounding boxes as additional information. Afterwards, the output object queries are processed by a separate translation and rotation head. We achieve state-of-the-art results for RGB-only approaches on the challenging YCB-V dataset. We illustrate the suitability of the resulting model as pose sensor for a 6-DoF state estimation task. Code is available at https://github.com/aau-cns/poet.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a generalized few-shot segmentation framework with a straightforward training process and an easy-to-optimize inference phase. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective model based on the well-known InfoMax principle, where the Mutual Information (MI) between the learned feature representations and their corresponding predictions is maximized. In addition, the terms derived from our MI-based formulation are coupled with a knowledge distillation term to retain the knowledge on base classes. With a simple training process, our inference model can be applied on top of any segmentation network trained on base classes. The proposed inference yields substantial improvements on the popular few-shot segmentation benchmarks, PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$. Particularly, for novel classes, the improvement gains range from 7% to 26% (PASCAL-$5^i$) and from 3% to 12% (COCO-$20^i$) in the 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a more challenging setting, where performance gaps are further exacerbated. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sinahmr/DIaM.

- **Summary**: Image aesthetic quality assessment (AQA) aims to assign numerical aesthetic ratings to images whilst image aesthetic captioning (IAC) aims to generate textual descriptions of the aesthetic aspects of images. In this paper, we study image AQA and IAC together and present a new IAC method termed Aesthetically Relevant Image Captioning (ARIC). Based on the observation that most textual comments of an image are about objects and their interactions rather than aspects of aesthetics, we first introduce the concept of Aesthetic Relevance Score (ARS) of a sentence and have developed a model to automatically label a sentence with its ARS. We then use the ARS to design the ARIC model which includes an ARS weighted IAC loss function and an ARS based diverse aesthetic caption selector (DACS). We present extensive experimental results to show the soundness of the ARS concept and the effectiveness of the ARIC model by demonstrating that texts with higher ARS's can predict the aesthetic ratings more accurately and that the new ARIC model can generate more accurate, aesthetically more relevant and more diverse image captions. Furthermore, a large new research database containing 510K images with over 5 million comments and 350K aesthetic scores, and code for implementing ARIC are available at https://github.com/PengZai/ARIC.

- **Summary**: Human-object interaction is one of the most important visual cues and we propose a novel way to represent human-object interactions for egocentric action anticipation. We propose a novel transformer variant to model interactions by computing the change in the appearance of objects and human hands due to the execution of the actions and use those changes to refine the video representation. Specifically, we model interactions between hands and objects using Spatial Cross-Attention (SCA) and further infuse contextual information using Trajectory Cross-Attention to obtain environment-refined interaction tokens. Using these tokens, we construct an interaction-centric video representation for action anticipation. We term our model InAViT which achieves state-of-the-art action anticipation performance on large-scale egocentric datasets EPICKTICHENS100 (EK100) and EGTEA Gaze+. InAViT outperforms other visual transformer-based methods including object-centric video representation. On the EK100 evaluation server, InAViT is the top-performing method on the public leaderboard (at the time of submission) where it outperforms the second-best model by 3.3% on mean-top5 recall.

- **Summary**: Holistic 3D scene understanding entails estimation of both layout configuration and object geometry in a 3D environment. Recent works have shown advances in 3D scene estimation from various input modalities (e.g., images, 3D scans), by leveraging 3D supervision (e.g., 3D bounding boxes or CAD models), for which collection at scale is expensive and often intractable. To address this shortcoming, we propose a new method to learn 3D scene priors of layout and shape without requiring any 3D ground truth. Instead, we rely on 2D supervision from multi-view RGB images. Our method represents a 3D scene as a latent vector, from which we can progressively decode to a sequence of objects characterized by their class categories, 3D bounding boxes, and meshes. With our trained autoregressive decoder representing the scene prior, our method facilitates many downstream applications, including scene synthesis, interpolation, and single-view reconstruction. Experiments on 3D-FRONT and ScanNet show that our method outperforms state of the art in single-view reconstruction, and achieves state-of-the-art results in scene synthesis against baselines which require for 3D supervision.

- **Summary**: We present a novel method, called NeuralUDF, for reconstructing surfaces with arbitrary topologies from 2D images via volume rendering. Recent advances in neural rendering based reconstruction have achieved compelling results. However, these methods are limited to objects with closed surfaces since they adopt Signed Distance Function (SDF) as surface representation which requires the target shape to be divided into inside and outside. In this paper, we propose to represent surfaces as the Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) and develop a new volume rendering scheme to learn the neural UDF representation. Specifically, a new density function that correlates the property of UDF with the volume rendering scheme is introduced for robust optimization of the UDF fields. Experiments on the DTU and DeepFashion3D datasets show that our method not only enables high-quality reconstruction of non-closed shapes with complex typologies, but also achieves comparable performance to the SDF based methods on the reconstruction of closed surfaces.

- **Summary**: Numerous diseases cause severe economic loss in the apple production-based industry. Early disease identification in apple leaves can help to stop the spread of infections and provide better productivity. Therefore, it is crucial to study the identification and classification of different apple foliar diseases. Various traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have addressed and investigated this issue. However, it is still challenging to classify these diseases because of their complex background, variation in the diseased spot in the images, and the presence of several symptoms of multiple diseases on the same leaf. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning-based stacked ensemble architecture named MCFFA-Net, which is composed of three pre-trained architectures named MobileNetV2, DenseNet201, and InceptionResNetV2 as backbone networks. We also propose a novel multi-scale dilated residual convolution module to capture multi-scale contextual information with several dilated receptive fields from the extracted features. Channel-based attention mechanism is provided through squeeze and excitation networks to make the MCFFA-Net focused on the relevant information in the multi-receptive fields. The proposed MCFFA-Net achieves a classification accuracy of 90.86%.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of the region of interest in medical images can provide an essential pathway for devising effective treatment plans for life-threatening diseases. It is still challenging for U-Net, and its state-of-the-art variants, such as CE-Net and DoubleU-Net, to effectively model the higher-level output feature maps of the convolutional units of the network mostly due to the presence of various scales of the region of interest, intricacy of context environments, ambiguous boundaries, and multiformity of textures in medical images. In this paper, we exploit multi-contextual features and several attention strategies to increase networks' ability to model discriminative feature representation for more accurate medical image segmentation, and we present a novel dual U-Net-based architecture named DoubleU-NetPlus. The DoubleU-NetPlus incorporates several architectural modifications. In particular, we integrate EfficientNetB7 as the feature encoder module, a newly designed multi-kernel residual convolution module, and an adaptive feature re-calibrating attention-based atrous spatial pyramid pooling module to progressively and precisely accumulate discriminative multi-scale high-level contextual feature maps and emphasize the salient regions. In addition, we introduce a novel triple attention gate module and a hybrid triple attention module to encourage selective modeling of relevant medical image features. Moreover, to mitigate the gradient vanishing issue and incorporate high-resolution features with deeper spatial details, the standard convolution operation is replaced with the attention-guided residual convolution operations, ...

- **Summary**: The 3D visual grounding task has been explored with visual and language streams comprehending referential language to identify target objects in 3D scenes. However, most existing methods devote the visual stream to capturing the 3D visual clues using off-the-shelf point clouds encoders. The main question we address in this paper is "can we consolidate the 3D visual stream by 2D clues synthesized from point clouds and efficiently utilize them in training and testing?". The main idea is to assist the 3D encoder by incorporating rich 2D object representations without requiring extra 2D inputs. To this end, we leverage 2D clues, synthetically generated from 3D point clouds, and empirically show their aptitude to boost the quality of the learned visual representations. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRefer datasets and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods. Our proposed module, dubbed as Look Around and Refer (LAR), significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding techniques on three benchmarks, i.e., Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRefer.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural field generating signed distance field representations (SDFs) of 3D shapes have shown remarkable progress in 3D shape reconstruction and generation. We introduce a new paradigm for neural field representations of 3D scenes; rather than characterizing surfaces as SDFs, we propose a Poisson-inspired characterization for surfaces as indicator functions optimized by neural fields. Crucially, for reconstruction of real scan data, the indicator function representation enables simple and effective constraints based on common range sensing inputs, which indicate empty space based on line of sight. Such empty space information is intrinsic to the scanning process, and incorporating this knowledge enables more accurate surface reconstruction. We show that our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on both synthetic and real scanned 3D scene data, with 9.5% improvement in Chamfer distance over state of the art.

- **Summary**: The formidable accomplishment of Transformers in natural language processing has motivated the researchers in the computer vision community to build Vision Transformers. Compared with the Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), a Vision Transformer has a larger receptive field which is capable of characterizing the long-range dependencies. Nevertheless, the large receptive field of Vision Transformer is accompanied by the huge computational cost. To boost efficiency, the window-based Vision Transformers emerge. They crop an image into several local windows, and the self-attention is conducted within each window. To bring back the global receptive field, window-based Vision Transformers have devoted a lot of efforts to achieving cross-window communications by developing several sophisticated operations. In this work, we check the necessity of the key design element of Swin Transformer, the shifted window partitioning. We discover that a simple depthwise convolution is sufficient for achieving effective cross-window communications. Specifically, with the existence of the depthwise convolution, the shifted window configuration in Swin Transformer cannot lead to an additional performance improvement. Thus, we degenerate the Swin Transformer to a plain Window-based (Win) Transformer by discarding sophisticated shifted window partitioning. The proposed Win Transformer is conceptually simpler and easier for implementation than Swin Transformer. Meanwhile, our Win Transformer achieves consistently superior performance than Swin Transformer on multiple computer vision tasks, including image recognition, semantic segmentation, and object detection.

- **Summary**: In orthodontic treatment, a full tooth model consisting of both the crown and root is indispensable in making the treatment plan. However, acquiring tooth root information to obtain the full tooth model from CBCT images is sometimes restricted due to the massive radiation of CBCT scanning. Thus, reconstructing the full tooth shape from the ready-to-use input, e.g., the partial intra-oral scan and the 2D panoramic image, is an applicable and valuable solution. In this paper, we propose a neural network, called ToothInpaintor, that takes as input a partial 3D dental model and a 2D panoramic image and reconstructs the full tooth model with high-quality root(s). Technically, we utilize the implicit representation for both the 3D and 2D inputs, and learn a latent space of the full tooth shapes. At test time, given an input, we successfully project it to the learned latent space via neural optimization to obtain the full tooth model conditioned on the input. To help find the robust projection, a novel adversarial learning module is exploited in our pipeline. We extensively evaluate our method on a dataset collected from real-world clinics. The evaluation, comparison, and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that our approach produces accurate complete tooth models robustly and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Quantitative analysis of in utero human brain development is crucial for abnormal characterization. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation is therefore an asset for quantitative analysis. However, the development of automated segmentation methods is hampered by the scarce availability of fetal brain MRI annotated datasets and the limited variability within these cohorts. In this context, we propose to leverage the power of fetal brain MRI super-resolution (SR) reconstruction methods to generate multiple reconstructions of a single subject with different parameters, thus as an efficient tuning-free data augmentation strategy. Overall, the latter significantly improves the generalization of segmentation methods over SR pipelines.

- **Summary**: A persistent challenge in conditional image synthesis has been to generate diverse output images from the same input image despite only one output image being observed per input image. GAN-based methods are prone to mode collapse, which leads to low diversity. To get around this, we leverage Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) which can overcome mode collapse fundamentally. IMLE uses the same generator as GANs but trains it with a different, non-adversarial objective which ensures each observed image has a generated sample nearby. Unfortunately, to generate high-fidelity images, prior IMLE-based methods require a large number of samples, which is expensive. In this paper, we propose a new method to get around this limitation, which we dub Conditional Hierarchical IMLE (CHIMLE), which can generate high-fidelity images without requiring many samples. We show CHIMLE significantly outperforms the prior best IMLE, GAN and diffusion-based methods in terms of image fidelity and mode coverage across four tasks, namely night-to-day, 16x single image super-resolution, image colourization and image decompression. Quantitatively, our method improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) by 36.9% on average compared to the prior best IMLE-based method, and by 27.5% on average compared to the best non-IMLE-based general-purpose methods.

- **Summary**: Standard semantic segmentation models owe their success to curated datasets with a fixed set of semantic categories, without contemplating the possibility of identifying unknown objects from novel categories. Existing methods in outlier detection suffer from a lack of smoothness and objectness in their predictions, due to limitations of the per-pixel classification paradigm. Furthermore, additional training for detecting outliers harms the performance of known classes. In this paper, we explore another paradigm with region-level classification to better segment unknown objects. We show that the object queries in mask classification tend to behave like one \vs all classifiers. Based on this finding, we propose a novel outlier scoring function called RbA by defining the event of being an outlier as being rejected by all known classes. Our extensive experiments show that mask classification improves the performance of the existing outlier detection methods, and the best results are achieved with the proposed RbA. We also propose an objective to optimize RbA using minimal outlier supervision. Further fine-tuning with outliers improves the unknown performance, and unlike previous methods, it does not degrade the inlier performance.

- **Summary**: In Deep Image Prior (DIP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is fitted to map a latent space to a degraded (e.g. noisy) image but in the process learns to reconstruct the clean image. This phenomenon is attributed to CNN's internal image-prior. We revisit the DIP framework, examining it from the perspective of a neural implicit representation. Motivated by this perspective, we replace the random or learned latent with Fourier-Features (Positional Encoding). We show that thanks to the Fourier features properties, we can replace the convolution layers with simple pixel-level MLPs. We name this scheme ``Positional Encoding Image Prior" (PIP) and exhibit that it performs very similarly to DIP on various image-reconstruction tasks with much less parameters required. Additionally, we demonstrate that PIP can be easily extended to videos, where 3D-DIP struggles and suffers from instability. Code and additional examples for all tasks, including videos, are available on the project page https://nimrodshabtay.github.io/PIP/

- **Summary**: Stochastic human motion prediction (HMP) has generally been tackled with generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders. Most prior works aim at predicting highly diverse movements in terms of the skeleton joints' dispersion. This has led to methods predicting fast and motion-divergent movements, which are often unrealistic and incoherent with past motion. Such methods also neglect contexts that need to anticipate diverse low-range behaviors, or actions, with subtle joint displacements. To address these issues, we present BeLFusion, a model that, for the first time, leverages latent diffusion models in HMP to sample from a latent space where behavior is disentangled from pose and motion. As a result, diversity is encouraged from a behavioral perspective. Thanks to our behavior coupler's ability to transfer sampled behavior to ongoing motion, BeLFusion's predictions display a variety of behaviors that are significantly more realistic than the state of the art. To support it, we introduce two metrics, the Area of the Cumulative Motion Distribution, and the Average Pairwise Distance Error, which are correlated to our definition of realism according to a qualitative study with 126 participants. Finally, we prove BeLFusion's generalization power in a new cross-dataset scenario for stochastic HMP.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image diffusion models are able to generate convincing results of unprecedented quality. However, it is nearly impossible to control the shapes of different regions/objects or their layout in a fine-grained fashion. Previous attempts to provide such controls were hindered by their reliance on a fixed set of labels. To this end, we present SpaText - a new method for text-to-image generation using open-vocabulary scene control. In addition to a global text prompt that describes the entire scene, the user provides a segmentation map where each region of interest is annotated by a free-form natural language description. Due to lack of large-scale datasets that have a detailed textual description for each region in the image, we choose to leverage the current large-scale text-to-image datasets and base our approach on a novel CLIP-based spatio-textual representation, and show its effectiveness on two state-of-the-art diffusion models: pixel-based and latent-based. In addition, we show how to extend the classifier-free guidance method in diffusion models to the multi-conditional case and present an alternative accelerated inference algorithm. Finally, we offer several automatic evaluation metrics and use them, in addition to FID scores and a user study, to evaluate our method and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on image generation with free-form textual scene control.

- **Summary**: Inferring the structure of 3D scenes from 2D observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recently popularized approaches based on neural scene representations have achieved tremendous impact and have been applied across a variety of applications. One of the major remaining challenges in this space is training a single model which can provide latent representations which effectively generalize beyond a single scene. Scene Representation Transformer (SRT) has shown promise in this direction, but scaling it to a larger set of diverse scenes is challenging and necessitates accurately posed ground truth data. To address this problem, we propose RUST (Really Unposed Scene representation Transformer), a pose-free approach to novel view synthesis trained on RGB images alone. Our main insight is that one can train a Pose Encoder that peeks at the target image and learns a latent pose embedding which is used by the decoder for view synthesis. We perform an empirical investigation into the learned latent pose structure and show that it allows meaningful test-time camera transformations and accurate explicit pose readouts. Perhaps surprisingly, RUST achieves similar quality as methods which have access to perfect camera pose, thereby unlocking the potential for large-scale training of amortized neural scene representations.

- **Summary**: The goal of Anomaly-Detection (AD) is to identify outliers, or outlying regions, from some unknown distribution given only a set of positive (good) examples. Few-Shot AD (FSAD) aims to solve the same task with a minimal amount of normal examples. Recent embedding-based methods, that compare the embedding vectors of queries to a set of reference embeddings, have demonstrated impressive results for FSAD, where as little as one good example is provided. A different approach, image-reconstruction-based, has been historically used for AD. The idea is to train a model to recover normal images from corrupted observations, assuming that the model will fail to recover regions when encountered with an out-of-distribution image. However, image-reconstruction-based methods were not yet used in the low-shot regime as they need to be trained on a diverse set of normal images in order to properly perform. We suggest using Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE), a self-supervised transformer model trained for recovering missing image regions based on their surroundings for FSAD. We show that MAE performs well by pre-training on an arbitrary set of natural images (ImageNet) and only fine-tuning on a small set of normal images. We name this method MAEDAY. We further find that MAEDAY provides an orthogonal signal to the embedding-based methods and the ensemble of the two approaches achieves very strong SOTA results. We also present a novel task of Zero-Shot AD (ZSAD) where no normal samples are available at training time. We show that MAEDAY performs surprisingly well at this task. Finally, we provide a new dataset for detecting foreign objects on the ground and demonstrate superior results for this task as well. Code is available at https://github.com/EliSchwartz/MAEDAY .

- **Summary**: This paper presents WALDO (WArping Layer-Decomposed Objects), a novel approach to the prediction of future video frames from past ones. Individual images are decomposed into multiple layers combining object masks and a small set of control points. The layer structure is shared across all frames in each video to build dense inter-frame connections. Complex scene motions are modeled by combining parametric geometric transformations associated with individual layers, and video synthesis is broken down into discovering the layers associated with past frames, predicting the corresponding transformations for upcoming ones and warping the associated object regions accordingly, and filling in the remaining image parts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including urban videos (Cityscapes and KITTI) and videos featuring nonrigid motions (UCF-Sports and H3.6M), show that our method consistently outperforms the state of the art by a significant margin in every case.

- **Summary**: We propose to model longer-term future human behavior by jointly predicting action labels and 3D characteristic poses (3D poses representative of the associated actions). While previous work has considered action and 3D pose forecasting separately, we observe that the nature of the two tasks is coupled, and thus we predict them together. Starting from an input 2D video observation, we jointly predict a future sequence of actions along with 3D poses characterizing these actions. Since coupled action labels and 3D pose annotations are difficult and expensive to acquire for videos of complex action sequences, we train our approach with action labels and 2D pose supervision from two existing action video datasets, in tandem with an adversarial loss that encourages likely 3D predicted poses. Our experiments demonstrate the complementary nature of joint action and characteristic 3D pose prediction: our joint approach outperforms each task treated individually, enables robust longer-term sequence prediction, and outperforms alternative approaches to forecast actions and characteristic 3D poses.

- **Summary**: Despite the impressive progress of telepresence systems for room-scale scenes with static and dynamic scene entities, expanding their capabilities to scenarios with larger dynamic environments beyond a fixed size of a few square-meters remains challenging.   In this paper, we aim at sharing 3D live-telepresence experiences in large-scale environments beyond room scale with both static and dynamic scene entities at practical bandwidth requirements only based on light-weight scene capture with a single moving consumer-grade RGB-D camera. To this end, we present a system which is built upon a novel hybrid volumetric scene representation in terms of the combination of a voxel-based scene representation for the static contents, that not only stores the reconstructed surface geometry but also contains information about the object semantics as well as their accumulated dynamic movement over time, and a point-cloud-based representation for dynamic scene parts, where the respective separation from static parts is achieved based on semantic and instance information extracted for the input frames. With an independent yet simultaneous streaming of both static and dynamic content, where we seamlessly integrate potentially moving but currently static scene entities in the static model until they are becoming dynamic again, as well as the fusion of static and dynamic data at the remote client, our system is able to achieve VR-based live-telepresence at close to real-time rates. Our evaluation demonstrates the potential of our novel approach in terms of visual quality, performance, and ablation studies regarding involved design choices.

- **Summary**: Line Chart Data Extraction is a natural extension of Optical Character Recognition where the objective is to recover the underlying numerical information a chart image represents. Some recent works such as ChartOCR approach this problem using multi-stage networks combining OCR models with object detection frameworks. However, most of the existing datasets and models are based on "clean" images such as screenshots that drastically differ from camera photos. In addition, creating domain-specific new datasets requires extensive labeling which can be time-consuming. Our main contributions are as follows: we propose a synthetic data generation framework and a one-stage model that outputs text labels, mark coordinates, and perspective estimation simultaneously. We collected two datasets consisting of real camera photos for evaluation. Results show that our model trained only on synthetic data can be applied to real photos without any fine-tuning and is feasible for real-world application.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of generating 3D human motions in dyadic activities. In contrast to the concurrent works, which mainly focus on generating the motion of a single actor from the textual description, we generate the motion of one of the actors from the motion of the other participating actor in the action. This is a particularly challenging, under-explored problem, that requires learning intricate relationships between the motion of two actors participating in an action and also identifying the action from the motion of one actor. To address these, we propose partner conditioned motion operator (PaCMO), a neural operator-based generative model which learns the distribution of human motion conditioned by the partner's motion in function spaces through adversarial training. Our model can handle long unlabeled action sequences at arbitrary time resolution. We also introduce the "Functional Frechet Inception Distance" ($F^2ID$) metric for capturing similarity between real and generated data for function spaces. We test PaCMO on NTU RGB+D and DuetDance datasets and our model produces realistic results evidenced by the $F^2ID$ score and the conducted user study.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Deep Learning have greatly improved performance on various tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, sentiment analysis. The focus of most research directions up until very recently has been on beating state-of-the-art results. This has materialized in the utilization of bigger and bigger models and techniques which help the training procedure to extract more predictive power out of a given dataset. While this has lead to great results, many of which with real-world applications, other relevant aspects of deep learning have remained neglected and unknown. In this work, we will present several novel deep learning training techniques which, while capable of offering significant performance gains they also reveal several interesting analysis results regarding convergence speed, optimization landscape smoothness, and adversarial robustness. The methods presented in this work are the following:   $\bullet$ Perfect Ordering Approximation; a generalized model agnostic curriculum learning approach. The results show the effectiveness of the technique for improving training time as well as offer some new insight into the training process of deep networks.   $\bullet$ Cascading Sum Augmentation; an extension of mixup capable of utilizing more data points for linear interpolation by leveraging a smoother optimization landscape. This can be used for computer vision tasks in order to improve both prediction performance as well as improve passive model robustness.

- **Summary**: Objectives: Early detection of liver fibrosis can help cure the disease or prevent disease progression. We perform a comprehensive study of machine learning-based fibrosis detection in CT images using radiomic features to develop a non-invasive approach to fibrosis detection.   Methods: Two sets of radiomic features were extracted from spherical ROIs in CT images of 182 patients who underwent simultaneous liver biopsy and CT examinations, one set corresponding to biopsy locations and another distant from biopsy locations. Combinations of contrast, normalization, machine learning model, feature selection method, bin width, and kernel radius were investigated, each of which were trained and evaluated 100 times with randomized development and test cohorts. The best settings were evaluated based on their mean test AUC and the best features were determined based on their frequency among the best settings.   Results: Logistic regression models with NC images normalized using Gamma correction with $\gamma = 1.5$ performed best for fibrosis detection. Boruta was the best for radiomic feature selection method. Training a model using these optimal settings and features consisting of first order energy, first order kurtosis, and first order skewness, resulted in a model that achieved mean test AUCs of 0.7549 and 0.7166 on biopsy-based and non-biopsy ROIs respectively, outperforming a baseline and best models found during the initial study.   Conclusions: Logistic regression models trained on radiomic features from NC images normalized using Gamma correction with $\gamma = 1.5$ that underwent Boruta feature selection are effective for liver fibrosis detection. Energy, kurtosis, and skewness are particularly effective features for fibrosis detection.

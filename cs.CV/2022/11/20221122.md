- **Summary**: Unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) aims to train a feature extractor for identity retrieval without exploiting identity labels. Due to the blind trust in imperfect clustering results, the learning is inevitably misled by unreliable pseudo labels. Albeit the pseudo label refinement has been investigated by previous works, they generally leverage auxiliary information such as camera IDs and body part predictions. This work explores the internal characteristics of clusters to refine pseudo labels. To this end, Confidence-Guided Centroids (CGC) are proposed to provide reliable cluster-wise prototypes for feature learning. Since samples with high confidence are exclusively involved in the formation of centroids, the identity information of low-confidence samples, i.e., boundary samples, are NOT likely to contribute to the corresponding centroid. Given the new centroids, current learning scheme, where samples are enforced to learn from their assigned centroids solely, is unwise. To remedy the situation, we propose to use Confidence-Guided pseudo Label (CGL), which enables samples to approach not only the originally assigned centroid but other centroids that are potentially embedded with their identity information. Empowered by confidence-guided centroids and labels, our method yields comparable performance with, or even outperforms, state-of-the-art pseudo label refinement works that largely leverage auxiliary information.

- **Summary**: The re-identification (ReID) of individuals over a complex network of cameras is a challenging task, especially under real-world surveillance conditions. Several deep learning models have been proposed for visible-infrared (V-I) person ReID to recognize individuals from images captured using RGB and IR cameras. However, performance may decline considerably if RGB and IR images captured at test time are corrupted (e.g., noise, blur, and weather conditions). Although various data augmentation (DA) methods have been explored to improve the generalization capacity, these are not adapted for V-I person ReID. In this paper, a specialized DA strategy is proposed to address this multimodal setting. Given both the V and I modalities, this strategy allows to diminish the impact of corruption on the accuracy of deep person ReID models. Corruption may be modality-specific, and an additional modality often provides complementary information. Our multimodal DA strategy is designed specifically to encourage modality collaboration and reinforce generalization capability. For instance, punctual masking of modalities forces the model to select the informative modality. Local DA is also explored for advanced selection of features within and among modalities. The impact of training baseline fusion models for V-I person ReID using the proposed multimodal DA strategy is assessed on corrupted versions of the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and ThermalWORLD datasets in terms of complexity and efficiency. Results indicate that using our strategy provides V-I ReID models the ability to exploit both shared and individual modality knowledge so they can outperform models trained with no or unimodal DA.

- **Summary**: Recent research works have focused on generating human models and garments from their 2D images. However, state-of-the-art researches focus either on only a single layer of the garment on a human model or on generating multiple garment layers without any guarantee of the intersection-free geometric relationship between them. In reality, people wear multiple layers of garments in their daily life, where an inner layer of garment could be partially covered by an outer one. In this paper, we try to address this multi-layer modeling problem and propose the Layered-Garment Net (LGN) that is capable of generating intersection-free multiple layers of garments defined by implicit function fields over the body surface, given the person's near front-view image. With a special design of garment indication fields (GIF), we can enforce an implicit covering relationship between the signed distance fields (SDF) of different layers to avoid self-intersections among different garment surfaces and the human body. Experiments demonstrate the strength of our proposed LGN framework in generating multi-layer garments as compared to state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, LGN is the first research work to generate intersection-free multiple layers of garments on the human body from a single image.

- **Summary**: Gaze estimation has grown rapidly in accuracy in recent years. However, these models often fail to take advantage of different computer vision (CV) algorithms and techniques (such as small ResNet and Inception networks and ensemble models) that have been shown to improve results for other CV problems. Additionally, most current gaze estimation models require the use of either both eyes or an entire face, whereas real-world data may not always have both eyes in high resolution. Thus, we propose a gaze estimation model that implements the ResNet and Inception model architectures and makes predictions using only one eye image. Furthermore, we propose an ensemble calibration network that uses the predictions from several individual architectures for subject-specific predictions. With the use of lightweight architectures, we achieve high performance on the GazeCapture dataset with very low model parameter counts. When using two eyes as input, we achieve a prediction error of 1.591 cm on the test set without calibration and 1.439 cm with an ensemble calibration model. With just one eye as input, we still achieve an average prediction error of 2.312 cm on the test set without calibration and 1.951 cm with an ensemble calibration model. We also notice significantly lower errors on the right eye images in the test set, which could be important in the design of future gaze estimation-based tools.

- **Summary**: Real-world data often have a long-tailed distribution, where the number of samples per class is not equal over training classes. The imbalanced data form a biased feature space, which deteriorates the performance of the recognition model. In this paper, we propose a novel long-tailed recognition method to balance the latent feature space. First, we introduce a MixUp-based data augmentation technique to reduce the bias of the long-tailed data. Furthermore, we propose a new supervised contrastive learning method, named Supervised contrastive learning on Mixed Classes (SMC), for blended images. SMC creates a set of positives based on the class labels of the original images. The combination ratio of positives weights the positives in the training loss. SMC with the class-mixture-based loss explores more diverse data space, enhancing the generalization capability of the model. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show the effectiveness of our one-stage training method.

- **Summary**: Images of spacecraft photographed from other spacecraft operating in outer space are difficult to come by, especially at a scale typically required for deep learning tasks. Semantic image segmentation, object detection and localization, and pose estimation are well researched areas with powerful results for many applications, and would be very useful in autonomous spacecraft operation and rendezvous. However, recent studies show that these strong results in broad and common domains may generalize poorly even to specific industrial applications on earth. To address this, we propose a method for generating synthetic image data that are labelled for semantic segmentation, generalizable to other tasks, and provide a prototype synthetic image dataset consisting of 2D monocular images of unmanned spacecraft, in order to enable further research in the area of autonomous spacecraft rendezvous. We also present a strong benchmark result (S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient 0.8723) on these synthetic data, suggesting that it is feasible to train well-performing image segmentation models for this task, especially if the target spacecraft and its configuration are known.

- **Summary**: This paper does not attempt to design a state-of-the-art method for visual recognition but investigates a more efficient way to make use of convolutions to encode spatial features. By comparing the design principles of the recent convolutional neural networks ConvNets) and Vision Transformers, we propose to simplify the self-attention by leveraging a convolutional modulation operation. We show that such a simple approach can better take advantage of the large kernels (>=7x7) nested in convolutional layers. We build a family of hierarchical ConvNets using the proposed convolutional modulation, termed Conv2Former. Our network is simple and easy to follow. Experiments show that our Conv2Former outperforms existent popular ConvNets and vision Transformers, like Swin Transformer and ConvNeXt in all ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and ADE20k semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Label noise and class imbalance commonly coexist in real-world data. Previous works for robust learning, however, usually address either one type of the data biases and underperform when facing them both. To mitigate this gap, this work presents a novel meta-learning based dynamic loss that automatically adjusts the objective functions with the training process to robustly learn a classifier from long-tailed noisy data. Concretely, our dynamic loss comprises a label corrector and a margin generator, which respectively correct noisy labels and generate additive per-class classification margins by perceiving the underlying data distribution as well as the learning state of the classifier. Equipped with a new hierarchical sampling strategy that enriches a small amount of unbiased metadata with diverse and hard samples, the two components in the dynamic loss are optimized jointly through meta-learning and cultivate the classifier to well adapt to clean and balanced test data. Extensive experiments show our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets with various types of data biases, including CIFAR-10/100, Animal-10N, ImageNet-LT, and Webvision. Code will soon be publicly available.



### UpCycling: Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection without Sharing Raw-level Unlabeled Scenes

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) has received increasing attention in autonomous driving to reduce the enormous burden of 3D annotation. In this paper, we propose UpCycling, a novel SSL framework for 3D object detection with zero additional raw-level point cloud: learning from unlabeled de-identified intermediate features (i.e., smashed data) to preserve privacy. Since these intermediate features are naturally produced by the inference pipeline, no additional computation is required on autonomous vehicles. However, generating effective consistency loss for unlabeled feature-level scene turns out to be a critical challenge. The latest SSL frameworks for 3D object detection that enforce consistency regularization between different augmentations of an unlabeled raw-point scene become detrimental when applied to intermediate features. To solve the problem, we introduce a novel combination of hybrid pseudo labels and feature-level Ground Truth sampling (F-GT), which safely augments unlabeled multi-type 3D scene features and provides high-quality supervision. We implement UpCycling on two representative 3D object detection models: SECOND-IoU and PV-RCNN. Experiments on widely-used datasets (Waymo, KITTI, and Lyft) verify that UpCycling outperforms other augmentation methods applied at the feature level. In addition, while preserving privacy, UpCycling performs better or comparably to the state-of-the-art methods that utilize raw-level unlabeled data in both domain adaptation and partial-label scenarios.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel training scheme, namely Teach-DETR, to learn better DETR-based detectors from versatile teacher detectors. We show that the predicted boxes from teacher detectors are effective medium to transfer knowledge of teacher detectors, which could be either RCNN-based or DETR-based detectors, to train a more accurate and robust DETR model. This new training scheme can easily incorporate the predicted boxes from multiple teacher detectors, each of which provides parallel supervisions to the student DETR. Our strategy introduces no additional parameters and adds negligible computational cost to the original detector during training. During inference, Teach-DETR brings zero additional overhead and maintains the merit of requiring no non-maximum suppression. Extensive experiments show that our method leads to consistent improvement for various DETR-based detectors. Specifically, we improve the state-of-the-art detector DINO with Swin-Large backbone, 4 scales of feature maps and 36-epoch training schedule, from 57.8% to 58.9% in terms of mean average precision on MSCOCO 2017 validation set.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection received increasing attention in autonomous driving recently. Objects in 3D scenes are distributed with diverse orientations. Ordinary detectors do not explicitly model the variations of rotation and reflection transformations. Consequently, large networks and extensive data augmentation are required for robust detection. Recent equivariant networks explicitly model the transformation variations by applying shared networks on multiple transformed point clouds, showing great potential in object geometry modeling. However, it is difficult to apply such networks to 3D object detection in autonomous driving due to its large computation cost and slow reasoning speed. In this work, we present TED, an efficient Transformation-Equivariant 3D Detector to overcome the computation cost and speed issues. TED first applies a sparse convolution backbone to extract multi-channel transformation-equivariant voxel features; and then aligns and aggregates these equivariant features into lightweight and compact representations for high-performance 3D object detection. On the highly competitive KITTI 3D car detection leaderboard, TED ranked 1st among all submissions with competitive efficiency.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional (3D) object reconstruction based on differentiable rendering (DR) is an active research topic in computer vision. DR-based methods minimize the difference between the rendered and target images by optimizing both the shape and appearance and realizing a high visual reproductivity. However, most approaches perform poorly for textureless objects because of the geometrical ambiguity, which means that multiple shapes can have the same rendered result in such objects. To overcome this problem, we introduce active sensing with structured light (SL) into multi-view 3D object reconstruction based on DR to learn the unknown geometry and appearance of arbitrary scenes and camera poses. More specifically, our framework leverages the correspondences between pixels in different views calculated by structured light as an additional constraint in the DR-based optimization of implicit surface, color representations, and camera poses. Because camera poses can be optimized simultaneously, our method realizes high reconstruction accuracy in the textureless region and reduces efforts for camera pose calibration, which is required for conventional SL-based methods. Experiment results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our system outperforms conventional DR- and SL-based methods in a high-quality surface reconstruction, particularly for challenging objects with textureless or shiny surfaces.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised domain adaptation aims to classify data belonging to a target domain by utilizing a related label-rich source domain and very few labeled examples of the target domain. Here, we propose a novel framework, Pred&Guide, which leverages the inconsistency between the predicted and the actual class labels of the few labeled target examples to effectively guide the domain adaptation in a semi-supervised setting. Pred&Guide consists of three stages, as follows (1) First, in order to treat all the target samples equally, we perform unsupervised domain adaptation coupled with self-training; (2) Second is the label prediction stage, where the current model is used to predict the labels of the few labeled target examples, and (3) Finally, the correctness of the label predictions are used to effectively weigh source examples class-wise to better guide the domain adaptation process. Extensive experiments show that the proposed Pred&Guide framework achieves state-of-the-art results for two large-scale benchmark datasets, namely Office-Home and DomainNet.

- **Summary**: Modern deep learning-based 3D pose estimation approaches require plenty of 3D pose annotations. However, existing 3D datasets lack diversity, which limits the performance of current methods and their generalization ability. Although existing methods utilize 2D pose annotations to help 3D pose estimation, they mainly focus on extracting 2D structural constraints from 2D poses, ignoring the 3D information hidden in the images. In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract weak 3D information directly from 2D images without 3D pose supervision. Firstly, we utilize 2D pose annotations and perspective prior knowledge to generate the relationship of that keypoint is closer or farther from the camera, called relative depth. We collect a 2D pose dataset (MCPC) and generate relative depth labels. Based on MCPC, we propose a weakly-supervised pre-training (WSP) strategy to distinguish the depth relationship between two points in an image. WSP enables the learning of the relative depth of two keypoints on lots of in-the-wild images, which is more capable of predicting depth and generalization ability for 3D human pose estimation. After fine-tuning on 3D pose datasets, WSP achieves state-of-the-art results on two widely-used benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This paper reviews vision-based localization methods in GPS-denied environments and classifies the mainstream methods into Relative Vision Localization (RVL) and Absolute Vision Localization (AVL). For RVL, we discuss the broad application of optical flow in feature extraction-based Visual Odometry (VO) solutions and introduce advanced optical flow estimation methods. For AVL, we review recent advances in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) techniques, from optimization-based methods to Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based methods. We also introduce the application of offline map registration and lane vision detection schemes to achieve Absolute Visual Localization. This paper compares the performance and applications of mainstream methods for visual localization and provides suggestions for future studies.

- **Summary**: There has been a significant increase in the adoption of technology in cricket recently. This trend has created the problem of duplicate work being done in similar computer vision-based research works. Our research tries to solve one of these problems by segmenting ball deliveries in a cricket broadcast using deep learning models, MobileNet and YOLO, thus enabling researchers to use our work as a dataset for their research. The output from our research can be used by cricket coaches and players to analyze ball deliveries which are played during the match. This paper presents an approach to segment and extract video shots in which only the ball is being delivered. The video shots are a series of continuous frames that make up the whole scene of the video. Object detection models are applied to reach a high level of accuracy in terms of correctly extracting video shots. The proof of concept for building large datasets of video shots for ball deliveries is proposed which paves the way for further processing on those shots for the extraction of semantics. Ball tracking in these video shots is also done using a separate RetinaNet model as a sample of the usefulness of the proposed dataset. The position on the cricket pitch where the ball lands is also extracted by tracking the ball along the y-axis. The video shot is then classified as a full-pitched, good-length or short-pitched delivery.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a neural incremental Structure-from-Motion (SfM) approach, Level-S$^2$fM, which estimates the camera poses and scene geometry from a set of uncalibrated images by learning coordinate MLPs for the implicit surfaces and the radiance fields from the established keypoint correspondences. Our novel formulation poses some new challenges due to inevitable two-view and few-view configurations in the incremental SfM pipeline, which complicates the optimization of coordinate MLPs for volumetric neural rendering with unknown camera poses. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the strong inductive basis conveying in the 2D correspondences is promising to tackle those challenges by exploiting the relationship between the ray sampling schemes. Based on this, we revisit the pipeline of incremental SfM and renew the key components, including two-view geometry initialization, the camera poses registration, the 3D points triangulation, and Bundle Adjustment, with a fresh perspective based on neural implicit surfaces. By unifying the scene geometry in small MLP networks through coordinate MLPs, our Level-S$^2$fM treats the zero-level set of the implicit surface as an informative top-down regularization to manage the reconstructed 3D points, reject the outliers in correspondences via querying SDF, and refine the estimated geometries by NBA (Neural BA). Not only does our Level-S$^2$fM lead to promising results on camera pose estimation and scene geometry reconstruction, but it also shows a promising way for neural implicit rendering without knowing camera extrinsic beforehand.

- **Summary**: In Smart City and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems, acquiring pedestrians' accurate locations is crucial to traffic safety. Current systems adopt cameras and wireless sensors to detect and estimate people's locations via sensor fusion. Standard fusion algorithms, however, become inapplicable when multi-modal data is not associated. For example, pedestrians are out of the camera field of view, or data from camera modality is missing. To address this challenge and produce more accurate location estimations for pedestrians, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. During training, it learns the underlying linkage between pedestrians' camera-phone data correspondences. During inference, it generates refined position estimations based only on pedestrians' phone data that consists of GPS, IMU and FTM. Results show that our GAN produces 3D coordinates at 1 to 2 meter localization error across 5 different outdoor scenes. We further show that the proposed model supports self-learning. The generated coordinates can be associated with pedestrian's bounding box coordinates to obtain additional camera-phone data correspondences. This allows automatic data collection during inference. After fine-tuning on the expanded dataset, localization accuracy is improved by up to 26%.

- **Summary**: Few-shot action recognition in videos is challenging for its lack of supervision and difficulty in generalizing to unseen actions. To address this task, we propose a simple yet effective method, called knowledge prompting, which leverages commonsense knowledge of actions from external resources to prompt a powerful pre-trained vision-language model for few-shot classification. We first collect large-scale language descriptions of actions, defined as text proposals, to build an action knowledge base. The collection of text proposals is done by filling in handcraft sentence templates with external action-related corpus or by extracting action-related phrases from captions of Web instruction videos.Then we feed these text proposals into the pre-trained vision-language model along with video frames to generate matching scores of the proposals to each frame, and the scores can be treated as action semantics with strong generalization. Finally, we design a lightweight temporal modeling network to capture the temporal evolution of action semantics for classification.Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method generally achieves the state-of-the-art performance while reducing the training overhead to 0.001 of existing methods.

- **Summary**: Some self-supervised cross-modal learning approaches have recently demonstrated the potential of image signals for enhancing point cloud representation. However, it remains a question on how to directly model cross-modal local and global correspondences in a self-supervised fashion. To solve it, we proposed PointCMC, a novel cross-modal method to model multi-scale correspondences across modalities for self-supervised point cloud representation learning. In particular, PointCMC is composed of: (1) a local-to-local (L2L) module that learns local correspondences through optimized cross-modal local geometric features, (2) a local-to-global (L2G) module that aims to learn the correspondences between local and global features across modalities via local-global discrimination, and (3) a global-to-global (G2G) module, which leverages auxiliary global contrastive loss between the point cloud and image to learn high-level semantic correspondences. Extensive experiment results show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks such as 3D object classification and segmentation. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect and segment the most salient object in videos. The primary techniques used in unsupervised VOS are 1) the collaboration of appearance and motion information and 2) temporal fusion between different frames. This paper proposes two novel prototype-based attention mechanisms, inter-modality attention (IMA) and inter-frame attention (IFA), to incorporate these techniques via dense propagation across different modalities and frames. IMA densely integrates context information from different modalities based on a mutual refinement. IFA injects global context of a video to the query frame, enabling a full utilization of useful properties from multiple frames. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all existing methods by a substantial margin. The proposed two components are also thoroughly validated via ablative study.

- **Summary**: We present ONeRF, a method that automatically segments and reconstructs object instances in 3D from multi-view RGB images without any additional manual annotations. The segmented 3D objects are represented using separate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) which allow for various 3D scene editing and novel view rendering. At the core of our method is an unsupervised approach using the iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which effectively aggregates 2D visual features and the corresponding 3D cues from multi-views for joint 3D object segmentation and reconstruction. Unlike existing approaches that can only handle simple objects, our method produces segmented full 3D NeRFs of individual objects with complex shapes, topologies and appearance. The segmented ONeRfs enable a range of 3D scene editing, such as object transformation, insertion and deletion.

- **Summary**: Although diffusion model has shown great potential for generating higher quality images than GANs, slow sampling speed hinders its wide application in practice. Progressive distillation is thus proposed for fast sampling by progressively aligning output images of $N$-step teacher sampler with $N/2$-step student sampler. In this paper, we argue that this distillation-based accelerating method can be further improved, especially for few-step samplers, with our proposed \textbf{C}lassifier-based \textbf{F}eature \textbf{D}istillation (CFD). Instead of aligning output images, we distill teacher's sharpened feature distribution into the student with a dataset-independent classifier, making the student focus on those important features to improve performance. We also introduce a dataset-oriented loss to further optimize the model. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show the superiority of our method in achieving high quality and fast sampling.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are powerful to parameterize continuous signals in computer vision. However, almost all INRs methods are limited to low-level tasks, e.g., image/video compression, super-resolution, and image generation. The questions on how to explore INRs to high-level tasks and deep networks are still under-explored. Existing INRs methods suffer from two problems: 1) narrow theoretical definitions of INRs are inapplicable to high-level tasks; 2) lack of representation capabilities to deep networks. Motivated by the above facts, we reformulate the definitions of INRs from a novel perspective and propose an innovative Implicit Neural Representation Network (INRN), which is the first study of INRs to tackle both low-level and high-level tasks. Specifically, we present three key designs for basic blocks in INRN along with two different stacking ways and corresponding loss functions. Extensive experiments with analysis on both low-level tasks (image fitting) and high-level vision tasks (image classification, object detection, instance segmentation) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has exhibited outstanding three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction quality via the novel view synthesis from multi-view images and paired calibrated camera parameters. However, previous NeRF-based systems have been demonstrated under strictly controlled settings, with little attention paid to less ideal scenarios, including with the presence of noise such as exposure, illumination changes, and blur. In particular, though blur frequently occurs in real situations, NeRF that can handle blurred images has received little attention. The few studies that have investigated NeRF for blurred images have not considered geometric and appearance consistency in 3D space, which is one of the most important factors in 3D reconstruction. This leads to inconsistency and the degradation of the perceptual quality of the constructed scene. Hence, this paper proposes a DP-NeRF, a novel clean NeRF framework for blurred images, which is constrained with two physical priors. These priors are derived from the actual blurring process during image acquisition by the camera. DP-NeRF proposes rigid blurring kernel to impose 3D consistency utilizing the physical priors and adaptive weight proposal to refine the color composition error in consideration of the relationship between depth and blur. We present extensive experimental results for synthetic and real scenes with two types of blur: camera motion blur and defocus blur. The results demonstrate that DP-NeRF successfully improves the perceptual quality of the constructed NeRF ensuring 3D geometric and appearance consistency. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with comprehensive ablation analysis.

- **Summary**: In this work, we develop convolutional neural generative coding (Conv-NGC), a generalization of predictive coding to the case of convolution/deconvolution-based computation. Specifically, we concretely implement a flexible neurobiologically-motivated algorithm that progressively refines latent state feature maps in order to dynamically form a more accurate internal representation/reconstruction model of natural images. The performance of the resulting sensory processing system is evaluated on complex datasets such as Color-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Street House View Numbers (SVHN). We study the effectiveness of our brain-inspired model on the tasks of reconstruction and image denoising and find that it is competitive with convolutional auto-encoding systems trained by backpropagation of errors and outperforms them with respect to out-of-distribution reconstruction (including the full 90k CINIC-10 test set).

- **Summary**: The camouflaged object detection (COD) task aims to identify and segment objects that blend into the background due to their similar color or texture. Despite the inherent difficulties of the task, COD has gained considerable attention in several fields, such as medicine, life-saving, and anti-military fields. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called the Deformable Point Sampling network (DPS-Net) to address the challenges associated with COD. The proposed DPS-Net utilizes a Deformable Point Sampling transformer (DPS transformer) that can effectively capture sparse local boundary information of significant object boundaries in COD using a deformable point sampling method. Moreover, the DPS transformer demonstrates robust COD performance by extracting contextual features for target object localization through integrating rough global positional information of objects with boundary local information. We evaluate our method on three prominent datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparative experiments.

- **Summary**: In image denoising networks, feature scaling is widely used to enlarge the receptive field size and reduce computational costs. This practice, however, also leads to the loss of high-frequency information and fails to consider within-scale characteristics. Recently, dynamic convolution has exhibited powerful capabilities in processing high-frequency information (e.g., edges, corners, textures), but previous works lack sufficient spatial contextual information in filter generation. To alleviate these issues, we propose to employ dynamic convolution to improve the learning of high-frequency and multi-scale features. Specifically, we design a spatially enhanced kernel generation (SEKG) module to improve dynamic convolution, enabling the learning of spatial context information with a very low computational complexity. Based on the SEKG module, we propose a dynamic convolution block (DCB) and a multi-scale dynamic convolution block (MDCB). The former enhances the high-frequency information via dynamic convolution and preserves low-frequency information via skip connections. The latter utilizes shared adaptive dynamic kernels and the idea of dilated convolution to achieve efficient multi-scale feature extraction. The proposed multi-dimension feature integration (MFI) mechanism further fuses the multi-scale features, providing precise and contextually enriched feature representations. Finally, we build an efficient denoising network with the proposed DCB and MDCB, named ADFNet. It achieves better performance with low computational complexity on real-world and synthetic Gaussian noisy datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/it-hao/ADFNet.

- **Summary**: Large-scale commonsense knowledge bases empower a broad range of AI applications, where the automatic extraction of commonsense knowledge (CKE) is a fundamental and challenging problem. CKE from text is known for suffering from the inherent sparsity and reporting bias of commonsense in text. Visual perception, on the other hand, contains rich commonsense knowledge about real-world entities, e.g., (person, can_hold, bottle), which can serve as promising sources for acquiring grounded commonsense knowledge. In this work, we present CLEVER, which formulates CKE as a distantly supervised multi-instance learning problem, where models learn to summarize commonsense relations from a bag of images about an entity pair without any human annotation on image instances. To address the problem, CLEVER leverages vision-language pre-training models for deep understanding of each image in the bag, and selects informative instances from the bag to summarize commonsense entity relations via a novel contrastive attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results in held-out and human evaluation show that CLEVER can extract commonsense knowledge in promising quality, outperforming pre-trained language model-based methods by 3.9 AUC and 6.4 mAUC points. The predicted commonsense scores show strong correlation with human judgment with a 0.78 Spearman coefficient. Moreover, the extracted commonsense can also be grounded into images with reasonable interpretability. The data and codes can be obtained at https://github.com/thunlp/CLEVER.

- **Summary**: Generalization to previously unseen images with potential domain shifts and different styles is essential for clinically applicable medical image segmentation, and the ability to disentangle domain-specific and domain-invariant features is key for achieving Domain Generalization (DG). However, existing DG methods can hardly achieve effective disentanglement to get high generalizability. To deal with this problem, we propose an efficient Contrastive Domain Disentanglement and Style Augmentation (CDDSA) framework for generalizable medical image segmentation. First, a disentangle network is proposed to decompose an image into a domain-invariant anatomical representation and a domain-specific style code, where the former is sent to a segmentation model that is not affected by the domain shift, and the disentangle network is regularized by a decoder that combines the anatomical and style codes to reconstruct the input image. Second, to achieve better disentanglement, a contrastive loss is proposed to encourage the style codes from the same domain and different domains to be compact and divergent, respectively. Thirdly, to further improve generalizability, we propose a style augmentation method based on the disentanglement representation to synthesize images in various unseen styles with shared anatomical structures. Our method was validated on a public multi-site fundus image dataset for optic cup and disc segmentation and an in-house multi-site Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Magnetic Resonance Image (NPC-MRI) dataset for nasopharynx Gross Tumor Volume (GTVnx) segmentation. Experimental results showed that the proposed CDDSA achieved remarkable generalizability across different domains, and it outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in domain-generalizable segmentation.

- **Summary**: Accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is essential for the diagnosis and assessment of a wide range of neurological diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) with radiolabeled water (15O-water) is considered the gold-standard for the measurement of CBF in humans. PET imaging, however, is not widely available because of its prohibitive costs and use of short-lived radiopharmaceutical tracers that typically require onsite cyclotron production. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more readily accessible and does not involve ionizing radiation. This study presents a convolutional encoder-decoder network with attention mechanisms to predict gold-standard 15O-water PET CBF from multi-sequence MRI scans, thereby eliminating the need for radioactive tracers. Inputs to the prediction model include several commonly used MRI sequences (T1-weighted, T2-FLAIR, and arterial spin labeling). The model was trained and validated using 5-fold cross-validation in a group of 126 subjects consisting of healthy controls and cerebrovascular disease patients, all of whom underwent simultaneous $15O-water PET/MRI. The results show that such a model can successfully synthesize high-quality PET CBF measurements (with an average SSIM of 0.924 and PSNR of 38.8 dB) and is more accurate compared to concurrent and previous PET synthesis methods. We also demonstrate the clinical significance of the proposed algorithm by evaluating the agreement for identifying the vascular territories with abnormally low CBF. Such methods may enable more widespread and accurate CBF evaluation in larger cohorts who cannot undergo PET imaging due to radiation concerns, lack of access, or logistic challenges.

- **Summary**: Joint bleeding is a common condition for people with hemophilia and, if untreated, can result in hemophilic arthropathy. Ultrasound imaging has recently emerged as an effective tool to diagnose joint recess distension caused by joint bleeding. However, no computer-aided diagnosis tool exists to support the practitioner in the diagnosis process. This paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting the recess and assessing whether it is distended in knee ultrasound images collected in patients with hemophilia. After framing the problem, we propose two different approaches: the first one adopts a one-stage object detection algorithm, while the second one is a multi-task approach with a classification and a detection branch. The experimental evaluation, conducted with $483$ annotated images, shows that the solution based on object detection alone has a balanced accuracy score of $0.74$ with a mean IoU value of $0.66$, while the multi-task approach has a higher balanced accuracy value ($0.78$) at the cost of a slightly lower mean IoU value.

- **Summary**: Existing models of human visual attention are generally unable to incorporate direct task guidance and therefore cannot model an intent or goal when exploring a scene. To integrate guidance of any downstream visual task into attention modeling, we propose the Neural Visual Attention (NeVA) algorithm. To this end, we impose to neural networks the biological constraint of foveated vision and train an attention mechanism to generate visual explorations that maximize the performance with respect to the downstream task. We observe that biologically constrained neural networks generate human-like scanpaths without being trained for this objective. Extensive experiments on three common benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised human attention models in generating human-like scanpaths.

- **Summary**: Video-quality measurement is a critical task in video processing. Nowadays, many implementations of new encoding standards - such as AV1, VVC, and LCEVC - use deep-learning-based decoding algorithms with perceptual metrics that serve as optimization objectives. But investigations of the performance of modern video- and image-quality metrics commonly employ videos compressed using older standards, such as AVC. In this paper, we present a new benchmark for video-quality metrics that evaluates video compression. It is based on a new dataset consisting of about 2,500 streams encoded using different standards, including AVC, HEVC, AV1, VP9, and VVC. Subjective scores were collected using crowdsourced pairwise comparisons. The list of evaluated metrics includes recent ones based on machine learning and neural networks. The results demonstrate that new no-reference metrics exhibit a high correlation with subjective quality and approach the capability of top full-reference metrics.

- **Summary**: Image classifiers are known to be difficult to interpret and therefore require explanation methods to understand their decisions. We present ShearletX, a novel mask explanation method for image classifiers based on the shearlet transform -- a multiscale directional image representation. Current mask explanation methods are regularized by smoothness constraints that protect against undesirable fine-grained explanation artifacts. However, the smoothness of a mask limits its ability to separate fine-detail patterns, that are relevant for the classifier, from nearby nuisance patterns, that do not affect the classifier. ShearletX solves this problem by avoiding smoothness regularization all together, replacing it by shearlet sparsity constraints. The resulting explanations consist of a few edges, textures, and smooth parts of the original image, that are the most relevant for the decision of the classifier. To support our method, we propose a mathematical definition for explanation artifacts and an information theoretic score to evaluate the quality of mask explanations. We demonstrate the superiority of ShearletX over previous mask based explanation methods using these new metrics, and present exemplary situations where separating fine-detail patterns allows explaining phenomena that were not explainable before.

- **Summary**: Crowdedness caused by overlapping among similar objects is a ubiquitous challenge in the field of 2D visual object detection. In this paper, we first underline two main effects of the crowdedness issue: 1) IoU-confidence correlation disturbances (ICD) and 2) confused de-duplication (CDD). Then we explore a pathway of cracking these nuts from the perspective of data augmentation. Primarily, a particular copy-paste scheme is proposed towards making crowded scenes. Based on this operation, we first design a "consensus learning" method to further resist the ICD problem and then find out the pasting process naturally reveals a pseudo "depth" of object in the scene, which can be potentially used for alleviating CDD dilemma. Both methods are derived from magical using of the copy-pasting without extra cost for hand-labeling. Experiments show that our approach can easily improve the state-of-the-art detector in typical crowded detection task by more than 2% without any bells and whistles. Moreover, this work can outperform existing data augmentation strategies in crowded scenario.

- **Summary**: We provide a new multi-task benchmark for evaluating text-to-image models. We perform a human evaluation comparing the most common open-source (Stable Diffusion) and commercial (DALL-E 2) models. Twenty computer science AI graduate students evaluated the two models, on three tasks, at three difficulty levels, across ten prompts each, providing 3,600 ratings. Text-to-image generation has seen rapid progress to the point that many recent models have demonstrated their ability to create realistic high-resolution images for various prompts. However, current text-to-image methods and the broader body of research in vision-language understanding still struggle with intricate text prompts that contain many objects with multiple attributes and relationships. We introduce a new text-to-image benchmark that contains a suite of thirty-two tasks over multiple applications that capture a model's ability to handle different features of a text prompt. For example, asking a model to generate a varying number of the same object to measure its ability to count or providing a text prompt with several objects that each have a different attribute to identify its ability to match objects and attributes correctly. Rather than subjectively evaluating text-to-image results on a set of prompts, our new multi-task benchmark consists of challenge tasks at three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) and human ratings for each generated image.



### Flow Guidance Deformable Compensation Network for Video Frame Interpolation

- **Summary**: Motion-based video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have made remarkable progress with the development of deep convolutional networks over the past years. While their performance is often jeopardized by the inaccuracy of flow map estimation, especially in the case of large motion and occlusion. In this paper, we propose a flow guidance deformable compensation network (FGDCN) to overcome the drawbacks of existing motion-based methods. FGDCN decomposes the frame sampling process into two steps: a flow step and a deformation step. Specifically, the flow step utilizes a coarse-to-fine flow estimation network to directly estimate the intermediate flows and synthesizes an anchor frame simultaneously. To ensure the accuracy of the estimated flow, a distillation loss and a task-oriented loss are jointly employed in this step. Under the guidance of the flow priors learned in step one, the deformation step designs a pyramid deformable compensation network to compensate for the missing details of the flow step. In addition, a pyramid loss is proposed to supervise the model in both the image and frequency domain. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves excellent performance on various datasets with fewer parameters.



### Unsupervised Domain Adaptation GAN Inversion for Image Editing

- **Summary**: Existing GAN inversion methods work brilliantly for high-quality image reconstruction and editing while struggling with finding the corresponding high-quality images for low-quality inputs. Therefore, recent works are directed toward leveraging the supervision of paired high-quality and low-quality images for inversion. However, these methods are infeasible in real-world scenarios and further hinder performance improvement. In this paper, we resolve this problem by introducing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) into the Inversion process, namely UDA-Inversion, for both high-quality and low-quality image inversion and editing. Particularly, UDA-Inversion first regards the high-quality and low-quality images as the source domain and unlabeled target domain, respectively. Then, a discrepancy function is presented to measure the difference between two domains, after which we minimize the source error and the discrepancy between the distributions of two domains in the latent space to obtain accurate latent codes for low-quality images. Without direct supervision, constructive representations of high-quality images can be spontaneously learned and transformed into low-quality images based on unsupervised domain adaptation. Experimental results indicate that UDA-inversion is the first that achieves a comparable level of performance with supervised methods in low-quality images across multiple domain datasets. We hope this work provides a unique inspiration for latent embedding distributions in image process tasks.

- **Summary**: Scene extrapolation -- the idea of generating novel views by flying into a given image -- is a promising, yet challenging task. For each predicted frame, a joint inpainting and 3D refinement problem has to be solved, which is ill posed and includes a high level of ambiguity. Moreover, training data for long-range scenes is difficult to obtain and usually lacks sufficient views to infer accurate camera poses. We introduce DiffDreamer, an unsupervised framework capable of synthesizing novel views depicting a long camera trajectory while training solely on internet-collected images of nature scenes. Utilizing the stochastic nature of the guided denoising steps, we train the diffusion models to refine projected RGBD images but condition the denoising steps on multiple past and future frames for inference. We demonstrate that image-conditioned diffusion models can effectively perform long-range scene extrapolation while preserving consistency significantly better than prior GAN-based methods. DiffDreamer is a powerful and efficient solution for scene extrapolation, producing impressive results despite limited supervision. Project page: https://primecai.github.io/diffdreamer.

- **Summary**: The interactions of individuals with city neighbourhoods is determined, in part, by the perceived quality of urban environments. Perceived neighbourhood quality is a core component of urban vitality, influencing social cohesion, sense of community, safety, activity and mental health of residents. Large-scale assessment of perceptions of neighbourhood quality was pioneered by the Place Pulse projects. Researchers demonstrated the efficacy of crowd-sourcing perception ratings of image pairs across 56 cities and training a model to predict perceptions from street-view images. Variation across cities may limit Place Pulse's usefulness for assessing within-city perceptions. In this paper, we set forth a protocol for city-specific dataset collection for the perception: 'On which street would you prefer to walk?'. This paper describes our methodology, based in London, including collection of images and ratings, web development, model training and mapping. Assessment of within-city perceptions of neighbourhoods can identify inequities, inform planning priorities, and identify temporal dynamics.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel method for vision-based metric cross-view geolocalization (CVGL) that matches the camera images captured from a ground-based vehicle with an aerial image to determine the vehicle's geo-pose. Since aerial images are globally available at low cost, they represent a potential compromise between two established paradigms of autonomous driving, i.e. using expensive high-definition prior maps or relying entirely on the sensor data captured at runtime.   We present an end-to-end differentiable model that uses the ground and aerial images to predict a probability distribution over possible vehicle poses. We combine multiple vehicle datasets with aerial images from orthophoto providers on which we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Since the ground truth poses are often inaccurate w.r.t. the aerial images, we implement a pseudo-label approach to produce more accurate ground truth poses and make them publicly available.   While previous works require training data from the target region to achieve reasonable localization accuracy (i.e. same-area evaluation), our approach overcomes this limitation and outperforms previous results even in the strictly more challenging cross-area case. We improve the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin even without ground or aerial data from the test region, which highlights the model's potential for global-scale application. We further integrate the uncertainty-aware predictions in a tracking framework to determine the vehicle's trajectory over time resulting in a mean position error on KITTI-360 of 0.78m.



### Aligning Source Visual and Target Language Domains for Unpaired Video Captioning

- **Summary**: Training supervised video captioning model requires coupled video-caption pairs. However, for many targeted languages, sufficient paired data are not available. To this end, we introduce the unpaired video captioning task aiming to train models without coupled video-caption pairs in target language. To solve the task, a natural choice is to employ a two-step pipeline system: first utilizing video-to-pivot captioning model to generate captions in pivot language and then utilizing pivot-to-target translation model to translate the pivot captions to the target language. However, in such a pipeline system, 1) visual information cannot reach the translation model, generating visual irrelevant target captions; 2) the errors in the generated pivot captions will be propagated to the translation model, resulting in disfluent target captions. To address these problems, we propose the Unpaired Video Captioning with Visual Injection system (UVC-VI). UVC-VI first introduces the Visual Injection Module (VIM), which aligns source visual and target language domains to inject the source visual information into the target language domain. Meanwhile, VIM directly connects the encoder of the video-to-pivot model and the decoder of the pivot-to-target model, allowing end-to-end inference by completely skipping the generation of pivot captions. To enhance the cross-modality injection of the VIM, UVC-VI further introduces a pluggable video encoder, i.e., Multimodal Collaborative Encoder (MCE). The experiments show that UVC-VI outperforms pipeline systems and exceeds several supervised systems. Furthermore, equipping existing supervised systems with our MCE can achieve 4% and 7% relative margins on the CIDEr scores to current state-of-the-art models on the benchmark MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Event cameras are considered to have great potential for computer vision and robotics applications because of their high temporal resolution and low power consumption characteristics. However, the event stream output from event cameras has asynchronous, sparse characteristics that existing computer vision algorithms cannot handle. Spiking neural network is a novel event-based computational paradigm that is considered to be well suited for processing event camera tasks. However, direct training of deep SNNs suffers from degradation problems. This work addresses these problems by proposing a spiking neural network architecture with a novel residual block designed and multi-dimension attention modules combined, focusing on the problem of depth prediction. In addition, a novel event stream representation method is explicitly proposed for SNNs. This model outperforms previous ANN networks of the same size on the MVSEC dataset and shows great computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Visual counterfactual explanations identify modifications to an image that would change the prediction of a classifier. We propose a set of techniques based on generative models (VAE) and a classifier ensemble directly trained in the latent space, which all together, improve the quality of the gradient required to compute visual counterfactuals. These improvements lead to a novel classification model, Clarity, which produces realistic counterfactual explanations over all images. We also present several experiments that give insights on why these techniques lead to better quality results than those in the literature. The explanations produced are competitive with the state-of-the-art and emphasize the importance of selecting a meaningful input space for training.

- **Summary**: Explaining black-box Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is a cornerstone for trustworthy AI and a prerequisite for its use in safety critical applications such that AI models can reliably assist humans in critical decisions. However, instead of trying to explain our models post-hoc, we need models which are interpretable-by-design built on a reasoning process similar to humans that exploits meaningful high-level concepts such as shapes, texture or object parts. Learning such concepts is often hindered by its need for explicit specification and annotation up front. Instead, prototype-based learning approaches such as ProtoPNet claim to discover visually meaningful prototypes in an unsupervised way. In this work, we propose a set of properties that those prototypes have to fulfill to enable human analysis, e.g. as part of a reliable model assessment case, and analyse such existing methods in the light of these properties. Given a 'Guess who?' game, we find that these prototypes still have a long way ahead towards definite explanations. We quantitatively validate our findings by conducting a user study indicating that many of the learnt prototypes are not considered useful towards human understanding. We discuss about the missing links in the existing methods and present a potential real-world application motivating the need to progress towards truly human-interpretable prototypes.

- **Summary**: This paper summarizes the results of the first Monocular Depth Estimation Challenge (MDEC) organized at WACV2023. This challenge evaluated the progress of self-supervised monocular depth estimation on the challenging SYNS-Patches dataset. The challenge was organized on CodaLab and received submissions from 4 valid teams. Participants were provided a devkit containing updated reference implementations for 16 State-of-the-Art algorithms and 4 novel techniques. The threshold for acceptance for novel techniques was to outperform every one of the 16 SotA baselines. All participants outperformed the baseline in traditional metrics such as MAE or AbsRel. However, pointcloud reconstruction metrics were challenging to improve upon. We found predictions were characterized by interpolation artefacts at object boundaries and errors in relative object positioning. We hope this challenge is a valuable contribution to the community and encourage authors to participate in future editions.

- **Summary**: Many applications such as forensics, surveillance, satellite imaging, medical imaging, etc., demand High-Resolution (HR) images. However, obtaining an HR image is not always possible due to the limitations of optical sensors and their costs. An alternative solution called Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a software-driven approach that aims to take a Low-Resolution (LR) image and obtain the HR image. Most supervised SISR solutions use ground truth HR image as a target and do not include the information provided in the LR image, which could be valuable. In this work, we introduce Triplet Loss-based Generative Adversarial Network hereafter referred as SRTGAN for Image Super-Resolution problem on real-world degradation. We introduce a new triplet-based adversarial loss function that exploits the information provided in the LR image by using it as a negative sample. Allowing the patch-based discriminator with access to both HR and LR images optimizes to better differentiate between HR and LR images; hence, improving the adversary. Further, we propose to fuse the adversarial loss, content loss, perceptual loss, and quality loss to obtain Super-Resolution (SR) image with high perceptual fidelity. We validate the superior performance of the proposed method over the other existing methods on the RealSR dataset in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

- **Summary**: Content-based medical image retrieval is an important diagnostic tool that improves the explainability of computer-aided diagnosis systems and provides decision making support to healthcare professionals. Medical imaging data, such as radiology images, are often multimorbidity; a single sample may have more than one pathology present. As such, image retrieval systems for the medical domain must be designed for the multi-label scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label metric learning method that can be used for both classification and content-based image retrieval. In this way, our model is able to support diagnosis by predicting the presence of diseases and provide evidence for these predictions by returning samples with similar pathological content to the user. In practice, the retrieved images may also be accompanied by pathology reports, further assisting in the diagnostic process. Our method leverages proxy feature vectors, enabling the efficient learning of a robust feature space in which the distance between feature vectors can be used as a measure of the similarity of those samples. Unlike existing proxy-based methods, training samples are able to assign to multiple proxies that span multiple class labels. This multi-label proxy assignment results in a feature space that encodes the complex relationships between diseases present in medical imaging data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art image retrieval systems and a set of baseline approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach to both classification and content-based image retrieval on two multimorbidity radiology datasets.

- **Summary**: 3D human pose estimation is a key component of clinical monitoring systems. The clinical applicability of deep pose estimation models, however, is limited by their poor generalization under domain shifts along with their need for sufficient labeled training data. As a remedy, we present a novel domain adaptation method, adapting a model from a labeled source to a shifted unlabeled target domain. Our method comprises two complementary adaptation strategies based on prior knowledge about human anatomy. First, we guide the learning process in the target domain by constraining predictions to the space of anatomically plausible poses. To this end, we embed the prior knowledge into an anatomical loss function that penalizes asymmetric limb lengths, implausible bone lengths, and implausible joint angles. Second, we propose to filter pseudo labels for self-training according to their anatomical plausibility and incorporate the concept into the Mean Teacher paradigm. We unify both strategies in a point cloud-based framework applicable to unsupervised and source-free domain adaptation. Evaluation is performed for in-bed pose estimation under two adaptation scenarios, using the public SLP dataset and a newly created dataset. Our method consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, surpasses the baseline model by 31%/66%, and reduces the domain gap by 65%/82%.

- **Summary**: Generating talking head videos through a face image and a piece of speech audio still contains many challenges. ie, unnatural head movement, distorted expression, and identity modification. We argue that these issues are mainly because of learning from the coupled 2D motion fields. On the other hand, explicitly using 3D information also suffers problems of stiff expression and incoherent video. We present SadTalker, which generates 3D motion coefficients (head pose, expression) of the 3DMM from audio and implicitly modulates a novel 3D-aware face render for talking head generation. To learn the realistic motion coefficients, we explicitly model the connections between audio and different types of motion coefficients individually. Precisely, we present ExpNet to learn the accurate facial expression from audio by distilling both coefficients and 3D-rendered faces. As for the head pose, we design PoseVAE via a conditional VAE to synthesize head motion in different styles. Finally, the generated 3D motion coefficients are mapped to the unsupervised 3D keypoints space of the proposed face render, and synthesize the final video. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of motion and video quality.

- **Summary**: The high-quality images yielded by generative adversarial networks (GANs) have motivated investigations into their application for image editing. However, GANs are often limited in the control they provide for performing specific edits. One of the principal challenges is the entangled latent space of GANs, which is not directly suitable for performing independent and detailed edits. Recent editing methods allow for either controlled style edits or controlled semantic edits. In addition, methods that use semantic masks to edit images have difficulty preserving the identity and are unable to perform controlled style edits. We propose a method to disentangle a GAN$\text{'}$s latent space into semantic and style spaces, enabling controlled semantic and style edits for face images independently within the same framework. To achieve this, we design an encoder-decoder based network architecture ($S^2$-Flow), which incorporates two proposed inductive biases. We show the suitability of $S^2$-Flow quantitatively and qualitatively by performing various semantic and style edits.

- **Summary**: Event cameras record sparse illumination changes with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Thanks to their sparse recording and low consumption, they are increasingly used in applications such as AR/VR and autonomous driving. Current top-performing methods often ignore specific event-data properties, leading to the development of generic but computationally expensive algorithms, while event-aware methods do not perform as well. We propose Event Transformer+, that improves our seminal work evtprev EvT with a refined patch-based event representation and a more robust backbone to achieve more accurate results, while still benefiting from event-data sparsity to increase its efficiency. Additionally, we show how our system can work with different data modalities and propose specific output heads, for event-stream predictions (i.e. action recognition) and per-pixel predictions (dense depth estimation). Evaluation results show better performance to the state-of-the-art while requiring minimal computation resources, both on GPU and CPU.

- **Summary**: Traditional visual place recognition (VPR), usually using standard cameras, is easy to fail due to glare or high-speed motion. By contrast, event cameras have the advantages of low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range, which can deal with the above issues. Nevertheless, event cameras are prone to failure in weakly textured or motionless scenes, while standard cameras can still provide appearance information in this case. Thus, exploiting the complementarity of standard cameras and event cameras can effectively improve the performance of VPR algorithms. In the paper, we propose FE-Fusion-VPR, an attention-based multi-scale network architecture for VPR by fusing frames and events. First, the intensity frame and event volume are fed into the two-stream feature extraction network for shallow feature fusion. Next, the three-scale features are obtained through the multi-scale fusion network and aggregated into three sub-descriptors using the VLAD layer. Finally, the weight of each sub-descriptor is learned through the descriptor re-weighting network to obtain the final refined descriptor. Experimental results show that on the Brisbane-Event-VPR and DDD20 datasets, the Recall@1 of our FE-Fusion-VPR is 29.26% and 33.59% higher than Event-VPR and Ensemble-EventVPR, and is 7.00% and 14.15% higher than MultiRes-NetVLAD and NetVLAD. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end network that goes beyond the existing event-based and frame-based SOTA methods to fuse frame and events directly for VPR.

- **Summary**: We present an effective and efficient method that explores the properties of Transformers in the frequency domain for high-quality image deblurring. Our method is motivated by the convolution theorem that the correlation or convolution of two signals in the spatial domain is equivalent to an element-wise product of them in the frequency domain. This inspires us to develop an efficient frequency domain-based self-attention solver (FSAS) to estimate the scaled dot-product attention by an element-wise product operation instead of the matrix multiplication in the spatial domain. In addition, we note that simply using the naive feed-forward network (FFN) in Transformers does not generate good deblurred results. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple yet effective discriminative frequency domain-based FFN (DFFN), where we introduce a gated mechanism in the FFN based on the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) compression algorithm to discriminatively determine which low- and high-frequency information of the features should be preserved for latent clear image restoration. We formulate the proposed FSAS and DFFN into an asymmetrical network based on an encoder and decoder architecture, where the FSAS is only used in the decoder module for better image deblurring. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/kkkls/FFTformer}.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a popular approach for novel view synthesis. While NeRFs are quickly being adapted for a wider set of applications, intuitively editing NeRF scenes is still an open challenge. One important editing task is the removal of unwanted objects from a 3D scene, such that the replaced region is visually plausible and consistent with its context. We refer to this task as 3D inpainting. In 3D, solutions must be both consistent across multiple views and geometrically valid. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D inpainting method that addresses these challenges. Given a small set of posed images and sparse annotations in a single input image, our framework first rapidly obtains a 3D segmentation mask for a target object. Using the mask, a perceptual optimizationbased approach is then introduced that leverages learned 2D image inpainters, distilling their information into 3D space, while ensuring view consistency. We also address the lack of a diverse benchmark for evaluating 3D scene inpainting methods by introducing a dataset comprised of challenging real-world scenes. In particular, our dataset contains views of the same scene with and without a target object, enabling more principled benchmarking of the 3D inpainting task. We first demonstrate the superiority of our approach on multiview segmentation, comparing to NeRFbased methods and 2D segmentation approaches. We then evaluate on the task of 3D inpainting, establishing state-ofthe-art performance against other NeRF manipulation algorithms, as well as a strong 2D image inpainter baseline.

- **Summary**: Generalizing models trained on normal visual conditions to target domains under adverse conditions is demanding in the practical systems. One prevalent solution is to bridge the domain gap between clear- and adverse-condition images to make satisfactory prediction on the target. However, previous methods often reckon on additional reference images of the same scenes taken from normal conditions, which are quite tough to collect in reality. Furthermore, most of them mainly focus on individual adverse condition such as nighttime or foggy, weakening the model versatility when encountering other adverse weathers. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel framework, Visibility Boosting and Logit-Constraint learning (VBLC), tailored for superior normal-to-adverse adaptation. VBLC explores the potential of getting rid of reference images and resolving the mixture of adverse conditions simultaneously. In detail, we first propose the visibility boost module to dynamically improve target images via certain priors in the image level. Then, we figure out the overconfident drawback in the conventional cross-entropy loss for self-training method and devise the logit-constraint learning, which enforces a constraint on logit outputs during training to mitigate this pain point. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new perspective for tackling such a challenging task. Extensive experiments on two normal-to-adverse domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., Cityscapes -> ACDC and Cityscapes -> FoggyCityscapes + RainCityscapes, verify the effectiveness of VBLC, where it establishes the new state of the art.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is typically inspired by class activation maps, which serve as pseudo masks with class-discriminative regions highlighted. Although tremendous efforts have been made to recall precise and complete locations for each class, existing methods still commonly suffer from the unsolicited Out-of-Candidate (OC) error predictions that not belongs to the label candidates, which could be avoidable since the contradiction with image-level class tags is easy to be detected. In this paper, we develop a group ranking-based Out-of-Candidate Rectification (OCR) mechanism in a plug-and-play fashion. Firstly, we adaptively split the semantic categories into In-Candidate (IC) and OC groups for each OC pixel according to their prior annotation correlation and posterior prediction correlation. Then, we derive a differentiable rectification loss to force OC pixels to shift to the IC group. Incorporating our OCR with seminal baselines (e.g., AffinityNet, SEAM, MCTformer), we can achieve remarkable performance gains on both Pascal VOC (+3.2%, +3.3%, +0.8% mIoU) and MS COCO (+1.0%, +1.3%, +0.5% mIoU) datasets with negligible extra training overhead, which justifies the effectiveness and generality of our OCR.

- **Summary**: Hierarchical classification (HC) assigns each object with multiple labels organized into a hierarchical structure. The existing deep learning based HC methods usually predict an instance starting from the root node until a leaf node is reached. However, in the real world, images interfered by noise, occlusion, blur, or low resolution may not provide sufficient information for the classification at subordinate levels. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic guided level-category hybrid prediction network (SGLCHPN) that can jointly perform the level and category prediction in an end-to-end manner. SGLCHPN comprises two modules: a visual transformer that extracts feature vectors from the input images, and a semantic guided cross-attention module that uses categories word embeddings as queries to guide learning category-specific representations. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we construct two new datasets in which images are at a broad range of quality and thus are labeled to different levels (depths) in the hierarchy according to their individual quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HC method.

- **Summary**: Multi-grained features extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their strong discrimination ability in supervised person re-identification (Re-ID) tasks. Inspired by them, this work investigates the way of extracting multi-grained features from a pure transformer network to address the unsupervised Re-ID problem that is label-free but much more challenging. To this end, we build a dual-branch network architecture based upon a modified Vision Transformer (ViT). The local tokens output in each branch are reshaped and then uniformly partitioned into multiple stripes to generate part-level features, while the global tokens of two branches are averaged to produce a global feature. Further, based upon offline-online associated camera-aware proxies (O2CAP) that is a top-performing unsupervised Re-ID method, we define offline and online contrastive learning losses with respect to both global and part-level features to conduct unsupervised learning. Extensive experiments on three person Re-ID datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a considerable margin, greatly mitigating the gap to supervised counterparts.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have attracted significant attention due to their ability to synthesize novel scene views with great accuracy. However, inherent to their underlying formulation, the sampling of points along a ray with zero width may result in ambiguous representations that lead to further rendering artifacts such as aliasing in the final scene. To address this issue, the recent variant mip-NeRF proposes an Integrated Positional Encoding (IPE) based on a conical view frustum. Although this is expressed with an integral formulation, mip-NeRF instead approximates this integral as the expected value of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This approximation is reliable for short frustums but degrades with highly elongated regions, which arises when dealing with distant scene objects under a larger depth of field. In this paper, we explore the use of an exact approach for calculating the IPE by using a pyramid-based integral formulation instead of an approximated conical-based one. We denote this formulation as Exact-NeRF and contribute the first approach to offer a precise analytical solution to the IPE within the NeRF domain. Our exploratory work illustrates that such an exact formulation Exact-NeRF matches the accuracy of mip-NeRF and furthermore provides a natural extension to more challenging scenarios without further modification, such as in the case of unbounded scenes. Our contribution aims to both address the hitherto unexplored issues of frustum approximation in earlier NeRF work and additionally provide insight into the potential future consideration of analytical solutions in future NeRF extensions.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a vital role in the field of computer vision. Previous approaches make efforts to design various fusion rules in the loss functions. However, these experimental designed fusion rules make the methods more and more complex. Besides, most of them only focus on boosting the visual effects, thus showing unsatisfactory performance for the follow-up high-level vision tasks. To address these challenges, in this letter, we develop a semantic-level fusion network to sufficiently utilize the semantic guidance, emancipating the experimental designed fusion rules. In addition, to achieve a better semantic understanding of the feature fusion process, a fusion block based on the transformer is presented in a multi-scale manner. Moreover, we devise a regularization loss function, together with a training strategy, to fully use semantic guidance from the high-level vision tasks. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method does not depend on the hand-crafted fusion loss function. Still, it achieves superior performance on visual quality along with the follow-up high-level vision tasks.



### Exemplar-free Continual Learning of Vision Transformers via Gated Class-Attention and Cascaded Feature Drift Compensation

- **Summary**: We propose a new method for exemplar-free class incremental training of ViTs. The main challenge of exemplar-free continual learning is maintaining plasticity of the learner without causing catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. This is often achieved via exemplar replay which can help recalibrate previous task classifiers to the feature drift which occurs when learning new tasks. Exemplar replay, however, comes at the cost of retaining samples from previous tasks which for many applications may not be possible. To address the problem of continual ViT training, we first propose gated class-attention to minimize the drift in the final ViT transformer block. This mask-based gating is applied to class-attention mechanism of the last transformer block and strongly regulates the weights crucial for previous tasks. Importantly, gated class-attention does not require the task-ID during inference, which distinguishes it from other parameter isolation methods. Secondly, we propose a new method of feature drift compensation that accommodates feature drift in the backbone when learning new tasks. The combination of gated class-attention and cascaded feature drift compensation allows for plasticity towards new tasks while limiting forgetting of previous ones. Extensive experiments performed on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet100 demonstrate that our exemplar-free method obtains competitive results when compared to rehearsal based ViT methods.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion, as the upstream procedure of 3D recognition and segmentation, has become an essential part of many tasks such as navigation and scene understanding. While various point cloud completion models have demonstrated their powerful capabilities, their robustness against adversarial attacks, which have been proven to be fatally malicious towards deep neural networks, remains unknown. In addition, existing attack approaches towards point cloud classifiers cannot be applied to the completion models due to different output forms and attack purposes. In order to evaluate the robustness of the completion models, we propose PointCA, the first adversarial attack against 3D point cloud completion models. PointCA can generate adversarial point clouds that maintain high similarity with the original ones, while being completed as another object with totally different semantic information. Specifically, we minimize the representation discrepancy between the adversarial example and the target point set to jointly explore the adversarial point clouds in the geometry space and the feature space. Furthermore, to launch a stealthier attack, we innovatively employ the neighbourhood density information to tailor the perturbation constraint, leading to geometry-aware and distribution-adaptive modifications for each point. Extensive experiments against different premier point cloud completion networks show that PointCA can cause a performance degradation from 77.9% to 16.7%, with the structure chamfer distance kept below 0.01. We conclude that existing completion models are severely vulnerable to adversarial examples, and state-of-the-art defenses for point cloud classification will be partially invalid when applied to incomplete and uneven point cloud data.

- **Summary**: Industrial vision anomaly detection plays a critical role in the advanced intelligent manufacturing process, while some limitations still need to be addressed under such a context. First, existing reconstruction-based methods struggle with the identity mapping of trivial shortcuts where the reconstruction error gap is legible between the normal and abnormal samples, leading to inferior detection capabilities. Then, the previous studies mainly concentrated on the convolutional neural network (CNN) models that capture the local semantics of objects and neglect the global context, also resulting in inferior performance. Moreover, existing studies follow the individual learning fashion where the detection models are only capable of one category of the product while the generalizable detection for multiple categories has not been explored. To tackle the above limitations, we proposed a self-induction vision Transformer(SIVT) for unsupervised generalizable multi-category industrial visual anomaly detection and localization. The proposed SIVT first extracts discriminatory features from pre-trained CNN as property descriptors. Then, the self-induction vision Transformer is proposed to reconstruct the extracted features in a self-supervisory fashion, where the auxiliary induction tokens are additionally introduced to induct the semantics of the original signal. Finally, the abnormal properties can be detected using the semantic feature residual difference. We experimented with the SIVT on existing Mvtec AD benchmarks, the results reveal that the proposed method can advance state-of-the-art detection performance with an improvement of 2.8-6.3 in AUROC, and 3.3-7.6 in AP.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled forensics researchers to develop a new class of image splicing detection and localization algorithms. These algorithms identify spliced content by detecting localized inconsistencies in forensic traces using Siamese neural networks, either explicitly during analysis or implicitly during training. At the same time, deep learning has enabled new forms of anti-forensic attacks, such as adversarial examples and generative adversarial network (GAN) based attacks. Thus far, however, no anti-forensic attack has been demonstrated against image splicing detection and localization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new GAN-based anti-forensic attack that is able to fool state-of-the-art splicing detection and localization algorithms such as EXIF-Net, Noiseprint, and Forensic Similarity Graphs. This attack operates by adversarially training an anti-forensic generator against a set of Siamese neural networks so that it is able to create synthetic forensic traces. Under analysis, these synthetic traces appear authentic and are self-consistent throughout an image. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our attack is capable of fooling forensic splicing detection and localization algorithms without introducing visually detectable artifacts into an attacked image. Additionally, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing alternative attack approaches. %

This paper gives another variant of ResNets, a kind of cross-residual learning networks called C-ResNets, which has less computation and parameters than ResNets. C-ResNets increases the information interaction between modules by densifying jumpers and enriches the role of jumpers. In addition, some meticulous designs on jumpers and channels counts can further reduce the resource consumption of C-ResNets and increase its classification performance. In order to test the effectiveness of C-ResNets, we use the same hyperparameter settings as fine-tuned ResNets in the experiments.   We test our C-ResNets on datasets MNIST, FashionMnist, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CALTECH-101 and SVHN. Compared with fine-tuned ResNets, C-ResNets not only maintains the classification performance, but also enormously reduces the amount of calculations and parameters which greatly save the utilization rate of GPUs and GPU memory resources. Therefore, our C-ResNets is competitive and viable alternatives to ResNets in various scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/liangjunhello/C-ResNet

- **Summary**: Accurate travel time estimation is paramount for providing transit users with reliable schedules and dependable real-time information. This paper is the first to utilize roadside urban imagery for direct transit travel time prediction. We propose and evaluate an end-to-end framework integrating traditional transit data sources with a roadside camera for automated roadside image data acquisition, labeling, and model training to predict transit travel times across a segment of interest. First, we show how the GTFS real-time data can be utilized as an efficient activation mechanism for a roadside camera unit monitoring a segment of interest. Second, AVL data is utilized to generate ground truth labels for the acquired images based on the observed transit travel time percentiles across the camera-monitored segment during the time of image acquisition. Finally, the generated labeled image dataset is used to train and thoroughly evaluate a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to predict a discrete transit travel time range (band). The results illustrate that the ViT model is able to learn image features and contents that best help it deduce the expected travel time range with an average validation accuracy ranging between 80%-85%. We assess the interpretability of the ViT model's predictions and showcase how this discrete travel time band prediction can subsequently improve continuous transit travel time estimation. The workflow and results presented in this study provide an end-to-end, scalable, automated, and highly efficient approach for integrating traditional transit data sources and roadside imagery to improve the estimation of transit travel duration. This work also demonstrates the value of incorporating real-time information from computer-vision sources, which are becoming increasingly accessible and can have major implications for improving operations and passenger real-time information.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art machine-learning methods for event cameras treat events as dense representations and process them with conventional deep neural networks. Thus, they fail to maintain the sparsity and asynchronous nature of event data, thereby imposing significant computation and latency constraints on downstream systems. A recent line of work tackles this issue by modeling events as spatiotemporally evolving graphs that can be efficiently and asynchronously processed using graph neural networks. These works showed impressive computation reductions, yet their accuracy is still limited by the small scale and shallow depth of their network, both of which are required to reduce computation. In this work, we break this glass ceiling by introducing several architecture choices which allow us to scale the depth and complexity of such models while maintaining low computation. On object detection tasks, our smallest model shows up to 3.7 times lower computation, while outperforming state-of-the-art asynchronous methods by 7.4 mAP. Even when scaling to larger model sizes, we are 13% more efficient than state-of-the-art while outperforming it by 11.5 mAP. As a result, our method runs 3.7 times faster than a dense graph neural network, taking only 8.4 ms per forward pass. This opens the door to efficient, and accurate object detection in edge-case scenarios.

- **Summary**: Action spotting in soccer videos is the task of identifying the specific time when a certain key action of the game occurs. Lately, it has received a large amount of attention and powerful methods have been introduced. Action spotting involves understanding the dynamics of the game, the complexity of events, and the variation of video sequences. Most approaches have focused on the latter, given that their models exploit the global visual features of the sequences. In this work, we focus on the former by (a) identifying and representing the players, referees, and goalkeepers as nodes in a graph, and by (b) modeling their temporal interactions as sequences of graphs. For the player identification, or player classification task, we obtain an accuracy of 97.72% in our annotated benchmark. For the action spotting task, our method obtains an overall performance of 57.83% average-mAP by combining it with other audiovisual modalities. This performance surpasses similar graph-based methods and has competitive results with heavy computing methods. Code and data are available at https://github.com/IPCV/soccer_action_spotting.

- **Summary**: Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a non-destructive evaluation technique used in a variety of applications ranging from security to medicine. The limited angle coverage in LACT is often a dominant source of severe artifacts in the reconstructed images, making it a challenging inverse problem. We present DOLCE, a new deep model-based framework for LACT that uses a conditional diffusion model as an image prior. Diffusion models are a recent class of deep generative models that are relatively easy to train due to their implementation as image denoisers. DOLCE can form high-quality images from severely under-sampled data by integrating data-consistency updates with the sampling updates of a diffusion model, which is conditioned on the transformed limited-angle data. We show through extensive experimentation on several challenging real LACT datasets that, the same pre-trained DOLCE model achieves the SOTA performance on drastically different types of images. Additionally, we show that, unlike standard LACT reconstruction methods, DOLCE naturally enables the quantification of the reconstruction uncertainty by generating multiple samples consistent with the measured data.

- **Summary**: Few-shot image generation is a challenging task since it aims to generate diverse new images for an unseen category with only a few images. Existing methods suffer from the trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated images. To tackle this problem, we propose Hyperbolic Attribute Editing~(HAE), a simple yet effective method. Unlike other methods that work in Euclidean space, HAE captures the hierarchy among images using data from seen categories in hyperbolic space. Given a well-trained HAE, images of unseen categories can be generated by moving the latent code of a given image toward any meaningful directions in the Poincar\'e disk with a fixing radius. Most importantly, the hyperbolic space allows us to control the semantic diversity of the generated images by setting different radii in the disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HAE is capable of not only generating images with promising quality and diversity using limited data but achieving a highly controllable and interpretable editing process.

- **Summary**: Most in-the-wild images are stored in Low Dynamic Range (LDR) form, serving as a partial observation of the High Dynamic Range (HDR) visual world. Despite limited dynamic range, these LDR images are often captured with different exposures, implicitly containing information about the underlying HDR image distribution. Inspired by this intuition, in this work we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first method for learning a generative model of HDR images from in-the-wild LDR image collections in a fully unsupervised manner. The key idea is to train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate HDR images which, when projected to LDR under various exposures, are indistinguishable from real LDR images. The projection from HDR to LDR is achieved via a camera model that captures the stochasticity in exposure and camera response function. Experiments show that our method GlowGAN can synthesize photorealistic HDR images in many challenging cases such as landscapes, lightning, or windows, where previous supervised generative models produce overexposed images. We further demonstrate the new application of unsupervised inverse tone mapping (ITM) enabled by GlowGAN. Our ITM method does not need HDR images or paired multi-exposure images for training, yet it reconstructs more plausible information for overexposed regions than state-of-the-art supervised learning models trained on such data.

- **Summary**: In this work we propose a non-contrastive method for anomaly detection and segmentation in images, that benefits both from a modern machine learning approach and a more classic statistical detection theory. The method consists of three phases. First, features are extracted using a multi-scale image Transformer architecture. Then, these features are fed into a U-shaped Normalizing Flow that lays the theoretical foundations for the last phase, which computes a pixel-level anomaly map, and performs a segmentation based on the a contrario framework. This multiple-hypothesis testing strategy permits to derive robust automatic detection thresholds, which are crucial in many real-world applications, where an operational point is needed. The segmentation results are evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric; and for assessing the generated anomaly maps we report the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), and the area under the per-region-overlap curve (AUPRO). Extensive experimentation in various datasets shows that the proposed approach produces state-of-the-art results for all metrics and all datasets, ranking first in most MvTec-AD categories, with a mean pixel-level AUROC of 98.74%.

- **Summary**: While dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown success in high-fidelity 3D modeling of talking portraits, the slow training and inference speed severely obstruct their potential usage. In this paper, we propose an efficient NeRF-based framework that enables real-time synthesizing of talking portraits and faster convergence by leveraging the recent success of grid-based NeRF. Our key insight is to decompose the inherently high-dimensional talking portrait representation into three low-dimensional feature grids. Specifically, a Decomposed Audio-spatial Encoding Module models the dynamic head with a 3D spatial grid and a 2D audio grid. The torso is handled with another 2D grid in a lightweight Pseudo-3D Deformable Module. Both modules focus on efficiency under the premise of good rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic and audio-lips synchronized talking portrait videos, while also being highly efficient compared to previous methods.

- **Summary**: LiDAR can capture accurate depth information in large-scale scenarios without the effect of light conditions, and the captured point cloud contains gait-related 3D geometric properties and dynamic motion characteristics. We make the first attempt to leverage LiDAR to remedy the limitation of view-dependent and light-sensitive camera for more robust and accurate gait recognition. In this paper, we propose a LiDAR-camera-based gait recognition method with an effective multi-modal feature fusion strategy, which fully exploits advantages of both point clouds and images. In particular, we propose a new in-the-wild gait dataset, LiCamGait, involving multi-modal visual data and diverse 2D/3D representations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new dataset. Code and dataset will be released when this paper is published.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we provide the observation that too few queries assigned as positive samples in DETR with one-to-one set matching leads to sparse supervision on the encoder's output which considerably hurt the discriminative feature learning of the encoder and vice visa for attention learning in the decoder. To alleviate this, we present a novel collaborative hybrid assignments training scheme, namely $\mathcal{C}$o-DETR, to learn more efficient and effective DETR-based detectors from versatile label assignment manners. This new training scheme can easily enhance the encoder's learning ability in end-to-end detectors by training the multiple parallel auxiliary heads supervised by one-to-many label assignments such as ATSS and Faster RCNN. In addition, we conduct extra customized positive queries by extracting the positive coordinates from these auxiliary heads to improve the training efficiency of positive samples in the decoder. In inference, these auxiliary heads are discarded and thus our method introduces no additional parameters and computational cost to the original detector while requiring no hand-crafted non-maximum suppression (NMS). We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on DETR variants, including DAB-DETR, Deformable-DETR, and DINO-Deformable-DETR. The state-of-the-art DINO-Deformable-DETR with Swin-L can be improved from 58.5% to 59.5% AP on COCO val. Surprisingly, incorporated with ViT-L backbone, we achieve 66.0% AP on COCO test-dev and 67.9% AP on LVIS val, outperforming previous methods by clear margins with much fewer model sizes.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, deep vision models are being widely deployed in safety-critical applications, e.g., autonomous driving, and explainability of such models is becoming a pressing concern. Among explanation methods, counterfactual explanations aim to find minimal and interpretable changes to the input image that would also change the output of the model to be explained. Such explanations point end-users at the main factors that impact the decision of the model. However, previous methods struggle to explain decision models trained on images with many objects, e.g., urban scenes, which are more difficult to work with but also arguably more critical to explain. In this work, we propose to tackle this issue with an object-centric framework for counterfactual explanation generation. Our method, inspired by recent generative modeling works, encodes the query image into a latent space that is structured in a way to ease object-level manipulations. Doing so, it provides the end-user with control over which search directions (e.g., spatial displacement of objects, style modification, etc.) are to be explored during the counterfactual generation. We conduct a set of experiments on counterfactual explanation benchmarks for driving scenes, and we show that our method can be adapted beyond classification, e.g., to explain semantic segmentation models. To complete our analysis, we design and run a user study that measures the usefulness of counterfactual explanations in understanding a decision model.

- **Summary**: We introduce DeepJoin, an automated approach to generate high-resolution repairs for fractured shapes using deep neural networks. Existing approaches to perform automated shape repair operate exclusively on symmetric objects, require a complete proxy shape, or predict restoration shapes using low-resolution voxels which are too coarse for physical repair. We generate a high-resolution restoration shape by inferring a corresponding complete shape and a break surface from an input fractured shape. We present a novel implicit shape representation for fractured shape repair that combines the occupancy function, signed distance function, and normal field. We demonstrate repairs using our approach for synthetically fractured objects from ShapeNet, 3D scans from the Google Scanned Objects dataset, objects in the style of ancient Greek pottery from the QP Cultural Heritage dataset, and real fractured objects. We outperform three baseline approaches in terms of chamfer distance and normal consistency. Unlike existing approaches and restorations using subtraction, DeepJoin restorations do not exhibit surface artifacts and join closely to the fractured region of the fractured shape.

- **Summary**: Vision language pre-training aims to learn alignments between vision and language from a large amount of data. Most existing methods only learn image-text alignments. Some others utilize pre-trained object detectors to leverage vision language alignments at the object level. In this paper, we propose to learn multi-grained vision language alignments by a unified pre-training framework that learns multi-grained aligning and multi-grained localization simultaneously. Based on it, we present X$^2$-VLM, an all-in-one model with a flexible modular architecture, in which we further unify image-text pre-training and video-text pre-training in one model. X$^2$-VLM is able to learn unlimited visual concepts associated with diverse text descriptions. Experiment results show that X$^2$-VLM performs the best on base and large scale for both image-text and video-text tasks, making a good trade-off between performance and model scale. Moreover, we show that the modular design of X$^2$-VLM results in high transferability for it to be utilized in any language or domain. For example, by simply replacing the text encoder with XLM-R, X$^2$-VLM outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual multi-modal pre-trained models without any multilingual pre-training.

- **Summary**: Broadspread use of medical imaging devices with digital storage has paved the way for curation of substantial data repositories. Fast access to image samples with similar appearance to suspected cases can help establish a consulting system for healthcare professionals, and improve diagnostic procedures while minimizing processing delays. However, manual querying of large data repositories is labor intensive. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) offers an automated solution based on dense embedding vectors that represent image features to allow quantitative similarity assessments. Triplet learning has emerged as a powerful approach to recover embeddings in CBIR, albeit traditional loss functions ignore the dynamic relationship between opponent image classes. Here, we introduce a triplet-learning method for automated querying of medical image repositories based on a novel Opponent Class Adaptive Margin (OCAM) loss. OCAM uses a variable margin value that is updated continually during the course of training to maintain optimally discriminative representations. CBIR performance of OCAM is compared against state-of-the-art loss functions for representational learning on three public databases (gastrointestinal disease, skin lesion, lung disease). Comprehensive experiments in each application domain demonstrate the superior performance of OCAM against baselines.

- **Summary**: Predicting the accuracy of candidate neural architectures is an important capability of NAS-based solutions. When a candidate architecture has properties that are similar to other known architectures, the prediction task is rather straightforward using off-the-shelf regression algorithms. However, when a candidate architecture lies outside of the known space of architectures, a regression model has to perform extrapolated predictions, which is not only a challenging task, but also technically impossible using the most popular regression algorithm families, which are based on decision trees. In this work, we are trying to address two problems. The first one is improving regression accuracy using feature selection, whereas the other one is the evaluation of regression algorithms on extrapolating accuracy prediction tasks. We extend the NAAP-440 dataset with new tabular features and introduce NAAP-440e, which we use for evaluation. We observe a dramatic improvement from the old baseline, namely, the new baseline requires 3x shorter training processes of candidate architectures, while maintaining the same mean-absolute-error and achieving almost 2x fewer monotonicity violations, compared to the old baseline's best reported performance. The extended dataset and code used in the study have been made public in the NAAP-440 repository.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation focuses on the exploration of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, which is more in line with the demands of real-world image understanding applications. However, it is still hindered by the inability to fully and effectively leverage unlabeled images. In this paper, we reveal that cross-window consistency (CWC) is helpful in comprehensively extracting auxiliary supervision from unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose a novel CWC-driven progressive learning framework to optimize the deep network by mining weak-to-strong constraints from massive unlabeled data. More specifically, this paper presents a biased cross-window consistency (BCC) loss with an importance factor, which helps the deep network explicitly constrain confidence maps from overlapping regions in different windows to maintain semantic consistency with larger contexts. In addition, we propose a dynamic pseudo-label memory bank (DPM) to provide high-consistency and high-reliability pseudo-labels to further optimize the network. Extensive experiments on three representative datasets of urban views, medical scenarios, and satellite scenes demonstrate our framework consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin. Code will be available publicly.

- **Summary**: For a number of tasks, such as 3D reconstruction, robotic interface, autonomous driving, etc., camera calibration is essential. In this study, we present a unique method for predicting intrinsic (principal point offset and focal length) and extrinsic (baseline, pitch, and translation) properties from a pair of images. We suggested a novel method where camera model equations are represented as a neural network in a multi-task learning framework, in contrast to existing methods, which build a comprehensive solution. By reconstructing the 3D points using a camera model neural network and then using the loss in reconstruction to obtain the camera specifications, this innovative camera projection loss (CPL) method allows us that the desired parameters should be estimated. As far as we are aware, our approach is the first one that uses an approach to multi-task learning that includes mathematical formulas in a framework for learning to estimate camera parameters to predict both the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters jointly. Additionally, we provided a new dataset named as CVGL Camera Calibration Dataset [1] which has been collected using the CARLA Simulator [2]. Actually, we show that our suggested strategy out performs both conventional methods and methods based on deep learning on 6 out of 10 parameters that were assessed using both real and synthetic data.

- **Summary**: The operating room (OR) is an environment of interest for the development of sensing systems, enabling the detection of people, objects, and their semantic relations. Due to frequent occlusions in the OR, these systems often rely on input from multiple cameras. While increasing the number of cameras generally increases algorithm performance, there are hard limitations to the number and locations of cameras in the OR. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can be used to render synthetic views from arbitrary camera positions, virtually enlarging the number of cameras in the dataset. In this work, we explore the use of NeRF for view synthesis of dynamic scenes in the OR, and we show that regularisation with depth supervision from RGB-D sensor data results in higher image quality. We optimise a dynamic depth-supervised NeRF with up to six synchronised cameras that capture the surgical field in five distinct phases before and during a knee replacement surgery. We qualitatively inspect views rendered by a virtual camera that moves 180 degrees around the surgical field at differing time values. Quantitatively, we evaluate view synthesis from an unseen camera position in terms of PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS for the colour channels and in MAE and error percentage for the estimated depth. We find that NeRFs can be used to generate geometrically consistent views, also from interpolated camera positions and at interpolated time intervals. Views are generated from an unseen camera pose with an average PSNR of 18.2 and a depth estimation error of 2.0%. Our results show the potential of a dynamic NeRF for view synthesis in the OR and stress the relevance of depth supervision in a clinical setting.

- **Summary**: We present SinDiffusion, leveraging denoising diffusion models to capture internal distribution of patches from a single natural image. SinDiffusion significantly improves the quality and diversity of generated samples compared with existing GAN-based approaches. It is based on two core designs. First, SinDiffusion is trained with a single model at a single scale instead of multiple models with progressive growing of scales which serves as the default setting in prior work. This avoids the accumulation of errors, which cause characteristic artifacts in generated results. Second, we identify that a patch-level receptive field of the diffusion network is crucial and effective for capturing the image's patch statistics, therefore we redesign the network structure of the diffusion model. Coupling these two designs enables us to generate photorealistic and diverse images from a single image. Furthermore, SinDiffusion can be applied to various applications, i.e., text-guided image generation, and image outpainting, due to the inherent capability of diffusion models. Extensive experiments on a wide range of images demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for modeling the patch distribution.

- **Summary**: Finding an initial noise vector that produces an input image when fed into the diffusion process (known as inversion) is an important problem in denoising diffusion models (DDMs), with applications for real image editing. The state-of-the-art approach for real image editing with inversion uses denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) to deterministically noise the image to the intermediate state along the path that the denoising would follow given the original conditioning. However, DDIM inversion for real images is unstable as it relies on local linearization assumptions, which result in the propagation of errors, leading to incorrect image reconstruction and loss of content. To alleviate these problems, we propose Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled Transformations (EDICT), an inversion method that draws inspiration from affine coupling layers. EDICT enables mathematically exact inversion of real and model-generated images by maintaining two coupled noise vectors which are used to invert each other in an alternating fashion. Using Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, we demonstrate that EDICT successfully reconstructs real images with high fidelity. On complex image datasets like MS-COCO, EDICT reconstruction significantly outperforms DDIM, improving the mean square error of reconstruction by a factor of two. Using noise vectors inverted from real images, EDICT enables a wide range of image edits--from local and global semantic edits to image stylization--while maintaining fidelity to the original image structure. EDICT requires no model training/finetuning, prompt tuning, or extra data and can be combined with any pretrained DDM. Code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/EDICT.

- **Summary**: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging task aiming to learn the segmentation labels from class-level labels. In the literature, exploiting the information obtained from Class Activation Maps (CAMs) is widely used for WSSS studies. However, as CAMs are obtained from a classification network, they are interested in the most discriminative parts of the objects, producing non-complete prior information for segmentation tasks. In this study, to obtain more coherent CAMs with segmentation labels, we propose a framework that employs an iterative approach in a modified encoder-decoder-based segmentation model, which simultaneously supports classification and segmentation tasks. As no ground-truth segmentation labels are given, the same model also generates the pseudo-segmentation labels with the help of dense Conditional Random Fields (dCRF). As a result, the proposed framework becomes an iterative self-improved model. The experiments performed with DeepLabv3 and UNet models show a significant gain on the Pascal VOC12 dataset, and the DeepLabv3 application increases the current state-of-the-art metric by %2.5. The implementation associated with the experiments can be found: https://github.com/cenkbircanoglu/isim.

- **Summary**: Prototypical network for Few shot learning tries to learn an embedding function in the encoder that embeds images with similar features close to one another in the embedding space. However, in this process, the support set samples for a task are embedded independently of one other, and hence, the inter-class closeness is not taken into account. Thus, in the presence of similar-looking classes in a task, the embeddings will tend to be close to each other in the embedding space and even possibly overlap in some regions, which is not desirable for classification. In this paper, we propose an approach that intuitively pushes the embeddings of each of the classes away from the others in the meta-testing phase, thereby grouping them closely based on the distinct class labels rather than only the similarity of spatial features. This is achieved by training the encoder network for classification using the support set samples and labels of the new task. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark data sets show improvements in meta-testing accuracy when compared with Prototypical Networks and also other standard few-shot learning models.



### PIC-Score: Probabilistic Interpretable Comparison Score for Optimal Matching Confidence in Single- and Multi-Biometric (Face) Recognition

- **Summary**: In the context of biometrics, matching confidence refers to the confidence that a given matching decision is correct. Since many biometric systems operate in critical decision-making processes, such as in forensics investigations, accurately and reliably stating the matching confidence becomes of high importance. Previous works on biometric confidence estimation can well differentiate between high and low confidence, but lack interpretability. Therefore, they do not provide accurate probabilistic estimates of the correctness of a decision. In this work, we propose a probabilistic interpretable comparison (PIC) score that accurately reflects the probability that the score originates from samples of the same identity. We prove that the proposed approach provides optimal matching confidence. Contrary to other approaches, it can also optimally combine multiple samples in a joint PIC score which further increases the recognition and confidence estimation performance. In the experiments, the proposed PIC approach is compared against all biometric confidence estimation methods available on four publicly available databases and five state-of-the-art face recognition systems. The results demonstrate that PIC has a significantly more accurate probabilistic interpretation than similar approaches and is highly effective for multi-biometric recognition. The code is publicly-available.



### Shortcomings of Top-Down Randomization-Based Sanity Checks for Evaluations of Deep Neural Network Explanations

- **Summary**: While the evaluation of explanations is an important step towards trustworthy models, it needs to be done carefully, and the employed metrics need to be well-understood. Specifically model randomization testing is often overestimated and regarded as a sole criterion for selecting or discarding certain explanation methods. To address shortcomings of this test, we start by observing an experimental gap in the ranking of explanation methods between randomization-based sanity checks [1] and model output faithfulness measures (e.g. [25]). We identify limitations of model-randomization-based sanity checks for the purpose of evaluating explanations. Firstly, we show that uninformative attribution maps created with zero pixel-wise covariance easily achieve high scores in this type of checks. Secondly, we show that top-down model randomization preserves scales of forward pass activations with high probability. That is, channels with large activations have a high probility to contribute strongly to the output, even after randomization of the network on top of them. Hence, explanations after randomization can only be expected to differ to a certain extent. This explains the observed experimental gap. In summary, these results demonstrate the inadequacy of model-randomization-based sanity checks as a criterion to rank attribution methods.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of (learning) algorithm comparison, where the goal is to find differences between models trained with two different learning algorithms. We begin by formalizing this goal as one of finding distinguishing feature transformations, i.e., input transformations that change the predictions of models trained with one learning algorithm but not the other. We then present ModelDiff, a method that leverages the datamodels framework (Ilyas et al., 2022) to compare learning algorithms based on how they use their training data. We demonstrate ModelDiff through three case studies, comparing models trained with/without data augmentation, with/without pre-training, and with different SGD hyperparameters.

- **Summary**: Video has become a dominant form of media. However, video editing interfaces have remained largely unchanged over the past two decades. Such interfaces typically consist of a grid-like asset management panel and a linear editing timeline. When working with a large number of video clips, it can be difficult to sort through them all and identify patterns within (e.g. opportunities for smooth transitions and storytelling). In this work, we imagine a new paradigm for video editing by mapping videos into a 2D latent space and building a proof-of-concept interface.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the challenge of extracting highlight moments from videos. To perform this task, a system needs to understand what constitutes a highlight for arbitrary video domains while at the same time being able to scale across different domains. Our key insight is that photographs taken by photographers tend to capture the most remarkable or photogenic moments of an activity. Drawing on this insight, we present Videogenic, a system capable of creating domain-specific highlight videos for a wide range of domains. In a human evaluation study (N=50), we show that a high-quality photograph collection combined with CLIP-based retrieval (which uses a neural network with semantic knowledge of images) can serve as an excellent prior for finding video highlights. In a within-subjects expert study (N=12), we demonstrate the usefulness of Videogenic in helping video editors create highlight videos with lighter workload, shorter task completion time, and better usability.

- **Summary**: Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) aims to train a classifier that can generalize to unseen classes, using a set of attributes as auxiliary information, and the visual features extracted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network. While recent GZSL methods have explored various techniques to leverage the capacity of these features, there has been an extensive growth of representation learning techniques that remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the utility of different GZSL methods when using different feature extractors, and examine how these models' pre-training objectives, datasets, and architecture design affect their feature representation ability. Our results indicate that 1) methods using generative components for GZSL provide more advantages when using recent feature extractors; 2) feature extractors pre-trained using self-supervised learning objectives and knowledge distillation provide better feature representations, increasing up to 15% performance when used with recent GZSL techniques; 3) specific feature extractors pre-trained with larger datasets do not necessarily boost the performance of GZSL methods. In addition, we investigate how GZSL methods fare against CLIP, a more recent multi-modal pre-trained model with strong zero-shot performance. We found that GZSL tasks still benefit from generative-based GZSL methods along with CLIP's internet-scale pre-training to achieve state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained datasets. We release a modular framework for analyzing representation learning issues in GZSL here: https://github.com/uvavision/TV-GZSL

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of predicting the 3D shape, articulation, viewpoint, texture, and lighting of an articulated animal like a horse given a single test image as input. We present a new method, dubbed MagicPony, that learns this predictor purely from in-the-wild single-view images of the object category, with minimal assumptions about the topology of deformation. At its core is an implicit-explicit representation of articulated shape and appearance, combining the strengths of neural fields and meshes. In order to help the model understand an object's shape and pose, we distil the knowledge captured by an off-the-shelf self-supervised vision transformer and fuse it into the 3D model. To overcome local optima in viewpoint estimation, we further introduce a new viewpoint sampling scheme that comes at no additional training cost. MagicPony outperforms prior work on this challenging task and demonstrates excellent generalisation in reconstructing art, despite the fact that it is only trained on real images.

- **Summary**: The ability to associate touch with sight is essential for tasks that require physically interacting with objects in the world. We propose a dataset with paired visual and tactile data called Touch and Go, in which human data collectors probe objects in natural environments using tactile sensors, while simultaneously recording egocentric video. In contrast to previous efforts, which have largely been confined to lab settings or simulated environments, our dataset spans a large number of "in the wild" objects and scenes. To demonstrate our dataset's effectiveness, we successfully apply it to a variety of tasks: 1) self-supervised visuo-tactile feature learning, 2) tactile-driven image stylization, i.e., making the visual appearance of an object more consistent with a given tactile signal, and 3) predicting future frames of a tactile signal from visuo-tactile inputs.

- **Summary**: We present Instant Volumetric Head Avatars (INSTA), a novel approach for reconstructing photo-realistic digital avatars instantaneously. INSTA models a dynamic neural radiance field based on neural graphics primitives embedded around a parametric face model. Our pipeline is trained on a single monocular RGB portrait video that observes the subject under different expressions and views. While state-of-the-art methods take up to several days to train an avatar, our method can reconstruct a digital avatar in less than 10 minutes on modern GPU hardware, which is orders of magnitude faster than previous solutions. In addition, it allows for the interactive rendering of novel poses and expressions. By leveraging the geometry prior of the underlying parametric face model, we demonstrate that INSTA extrapolates to unseen poses. In quantitative and qualitative studies on various subjects, INSTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding rendering quality and training time.

- **Summary**: The pose-guided person image generation task requires synthesizing photorealistic images of humans in arbitrary poses. The existing approaches use generative adversarial networks that do not necessarily maintain realistic textures or need dense correspondences that struggle to handle complex deformations and severe occlusions. In this work, we show how denoising diffusion models can be applied for high-fidelity person image synthesis with strong sample diversity and enhanced mode coverage of the learnt data distribution. Our proposed Person Image Diffusion Model (PIDM) disintegrates the complex transfer problem into a series of simpler forward-backward denoising steps. This helps in learning plausible source-to-target transformation trajectories that result in faithful textures and undistorted appearance details. We introduce a 'texture diffusion module' based on cross-attention to accurately model the correspondences between appearance and pose information available in source and target images. Further, we propose 'disentangled classifier-free guidance' to ensure close resemblance between the conditional inputs and the synthesized output in terms of both pose and appearance information. Our extensive results on two large-scale benchmarks and a user study demonstrate the photorealism of our proposed approach under challenging scenarios. We also show how our generated images can help in downstream tasks. Our code and models will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Recent LSS-based multi-view 3D object detection has made tremendous progress, by processing the features in Brid-Eye-View (BEV) via the convolutional detector. However, the typical convolution ignores the radial symmetry of the BEV features and increases the difficulty of the detector optimization. To preserve the inherent property of the BEV features and ease the optimization, we propose an azimuth-equivariant convolution (AeConv) and an azimuth-equivariant anchor. The sampling grid of AeConv is always in the radial direction, thus it can learn azimuth-invariant BEV features. The proposed anchor enables the detection head to learn predicting azimuth-irrelevant targets. In addition, we introduce a camera-decoupled virtual depth to unify the depth prediction for the images with different camera intrinsic parameters. The resultant detector is dubbed Azimuth-equivariant Detector (AeDet). Extensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes, and AeDet achieves a 62.0% NDS, surpassing the recent multi-view 3D object detectors such as PETRv2 and BEVDepth by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Place recognition based on point clouds (LiDAR) is an important component for autonomous robots or self-driving vehicles. Current SOTA performance is achieved on accumulated LiDAR submaps using either point-based or voxel-based structures. While voxel-based approaches nicely integrate spatial context across multiple scales, they do not exhibit the local precision of point-based methods. As a result, existing methods struggle with fine-grained matching of subtle geometric features in sparse single-shot Li- DAR scans. To overcome these limitations, we propose CASSPR as a method to fuse point-based and voxel-based approaches using cross attention transformers. CASSPR leverages a sparse voxel branch for extracting and aggregating information at lower resolution and a point-wise branch for obtaining fine-grained local information. CASSPR uses queries from one branch to try to match structures in the other branch, ensuring that both extract self-contained descriptors of the point cloud (rather than one branch dominating), but using both to inform the output global descriptor of the point cloud. Extensive experiments show that CASSPR surpasses the state-of-the-art by a large margin on several datasets (Oxford RobotCar, TUM, USyd). For instance, it achieves AR@1 of 85.6% on the TUM dataset, surpassing the strongest prior model by ~15%. Our code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: We present Zero-NeRF, a projective surface registration method that, to the best of our knowledge, offers the first general solution capable of alignment between scene representations with minimal or zero visual correspondence. To do this, we enforce consistency between visible surfaces of partial and complete reconstructions, which allows us to constrain occluded geometry. We use a NeRF as our surface representation and the NeRF rendering pipeline to perform this alignment. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we register real-world scenes from opposite sides with infinitesimal overlaps that cannot be accurately registered using prior methods, and we compare these results against widely used registration methods.

- **Summary**: Heart failure is typically diagnosed with a global function assessment, such as ejection fraction. However, these metrics have low discriminate power, failing to distinguish different types of this disease. Quantifying local deformations in the form of cardiac strain can provide helpful information, but it remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN, a physics-informed neural network to perform image registration to obtain local metrics of the heart deformation. We apply this method to cine magnetic resonance images to estimate the motion during the cardiac cycle. We inform our neural network of near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue by penalizing the jacobian of the deformation field. The loss function has two components: an intensity-based similarity term between the reference and the warped template images, and a regularizer that represents the hyperelastic behavior of the tissue. The architecture of the neural network allows us to easily compute the strain via automatic differentiation to assess cardiac activity. We use Fourier feature mappings to overcome the spectral bias of neural networks, allowing us to capture discontinuities in the strain field. We test our algorithm on a synthetic example and on a cine-MRI benchmark of 15 healthy volunteers. We outperform current methodologies both landmark tracking and strain estimation. We expect that WarpPINN will enable more precise diagnostics of heart failure based on local deformation information. Source code is available at https://github.com/fsahli/WarpPINN.

- **Summary**: Recent multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-image and image-to-text generation. However, these models store all learned knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant text and images fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., documents on the web). Specifically, for the retriever, we use a pretrained CLIP, and for the generator, we train a CM3 Transformer on the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate both text and images. We show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MS-COCO), while requiring much less compute for training (<30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show that RA-CM3 exhibits novel capabilities, such as faithful image generation and multimodal in-context learning (e.g., image generation from demonstrations).

- **Summary**: Neural radiance-density field methods have become increasingly popular for the task of novel-view rendering. Their recent extension to hash-based positional encoding ensures fast training and inference with visually pleasing results. However, density-based methods struggle with recovering accurate surface geometry. Hybrid methods alleviate this issue by optimizing the density based on an underlying SDF. However, current SDF methods are overly smooth and miss fine geometric details. In this work, we combine the strengths of these two lines of work in a novel hash-based implicit surface representation. We propose improvements to the two areas by replacing the voxel hash encoding with a permutohedral lattice which optimizes faster, especially for higher dimensions. We additionally propose a regularization scheme which is crucial for recovering high-frequency geometric detail. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and show that we can recover geometric detail at the level of pores and wrinkles while using only RGB images for supervision. Furthermore, using sphere tracing we can render novel views at 30 fps on an RTX 3090. Code is publicly available at: https://radualexandru.github.io/permuto_sdf

- **Summary**: Polymicrogyria (PMG) is a disorder of cortical organization mainly seen in children, which can be associated with seizures, developmental delay and motor weakness. PMG is typically diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but some cases can be challenging to detect even for experienced radiologists. In this study, we create an open pediatric MRI dataset (PPMR) with PMG and controls from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Ottawa, Canada. The differences between PMG MRIs and control MRIs are subtle and the true distribution of the features of the disease is unknown. This makes automatic detection of cases of potential PMG in MRI difficult. We propose an anomaly detection method based on a novel center-based deep contrastive metric learning loss function (cDCM) which enables the automatic detection of cases of potential PMG. Additionally, based on our proposed loss function, we customize a deep learning model structure that integrates dilated convolution, squeeze-and-excitation blocks and feature fusion for our PPMR dataset. Despite working with a small and imbalanced dataset our method achieves 92.01% recall at 55.04% precision. This will facilitate a computer aided tool for radiologists to select potential PMG MRIs. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to apply machine learning techniques to identify PMG from MRI only.

- **Summary**: Large-scale text-to-image generative models have been a revolutionary breakthrough in the evolution of generative AI, allowing us to synthesize diverse images that convey highly complex visual concepts. However, a pivotal challenge in leveraging such models for real-world content creation tasks is providing users with control over the generated content. In this paper, we present a new framework that takes text-to-image synthesis to the realm of image-to-image translation -- given a guidance image and a target text prompt, our method harnesses the power of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to generate a new image that complies with the target text, while preserving the semantic layout of the source image. Specifically, we observe and empirically demonstrate that fine-grained control over the generated structure can be achieved by manipulating spatial features and their self-attention inside the model. This results in a simple and effective approach, where features extracted from the guidance image are directly injected into the generation process of the target image, requiring no training or fine-tuning and applicable for both real or generated guidance images. We demonstrate high-quality results on versatile text-guided image translation tasks, including translating sketches, rough drawings and animations into realistic images, changing of the class and appearance of objects in a given image, and modifications of global qualities such as lighting and color.

- **Summary**: This work focuses on low bitrate video streaming scenarios (e.g. 50 - 200Kbps) where the video quality is severely compromised. We present a family of novel deep generative models for enhancing perceptual video quality of such streams by performing super-resolution while also removing compression artifacts. Our model, which we call SuperTran, consumes as input a single high-quality, high-resolution reference images in addition to the low-quality, low-resolution video stream. The model thus learns how to borrow or copy visual elements like textures from the reference image and fill in the remaining details from the low resolution stream in order to produce perceptually enhanced output video. The reference frame can be sent once at the start of the video session or be retrieved from a gallery. Importantly, the resulting output has substantially better detail than what has been otherwise possible with methods that only use a low resolution input such as the SuperVEGAN method. SuperTran works in real-time (up to 30 frames/sec) on the cloud alongside standard pipelines.

- **Summary**: It is crucial to choose actions from an appropriate distribution while learning a sequential decision-making process in which a set of actions is expected given the states and previous reward. Yet, if there are more than two latent variables and every two variables have a covariance value, learning a known prior from data becomes challenging. Because when the data are big and diverse, many posterior estimate methods experience posterior collapse. In this paper, we propose the $\beta$-Multivariational Autoencoder ($\beta$MVAE) to learn a Multivariate Gaussian prior from video frames for use as part of a single object-tracking in form of a decision-making process. We present a novel formulation for object motion in videos with a set of dependent parameters to address a single object-tracking task. The true values of the motion parameters are obtained through data analysis on the training set. The parameters population is then assumed to have a Multivariate Gaussian distribution. The $\beta$MVAE is developed to learn this entangled prior $p = N(\mu, \Sigma)$ directly from frame patches where the output is the object masks of the frame patches. We devise a bottleneck to estimate the posterior's parameters, i.e. $\mu', \Sigma'$. Via a new reparameterization trick, we learn the likelihood $p(\hat{x}|z)$ as the object mask of the input. Furthermore, we alter the neural network of $\beta$MVAE with the U-Net architecture and name the new network $\beta$Multivariational U-Net ($\beta$MVUnet). Our networks are trained from scratch via over 85k video frames for 24 ($\beta$MVUnet) and 78 ($\beta$MVAE) million steps. We show that $\beta$MVUnet enhances both posterior estimation and segmentation functioning over the test set. Our code and the trained networks are publicly released.

- **Summary**: Because anomalous samples cannot be used for training, many anomaly detection and localization methods use pre-trained networks and non-parametric modeling to estimate encoded feature distribution. However, these methods neglect the impact of position and neighborhood information on the distribution of normal features. To overcome this, we propose a new algorithm, \textbf{PNI}, which estimates the normal distribution using conditional probability given neighborhood features, modeled with a multi-layer perceptron network. Moreover, position information is utilized by creating a histogram of representative features at each position. Instead of simply resizing the anomaly map, the proposed method employs an additional refine network trained on synthetic anomaly images to better interpolate and account for the shape and edge of the input image. We conducted experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark dataset and achieved state-of-the-art performance, with \textbf{99.56\%} and \textbf{98.98\%} AUROC scores in anomaly detection and localization, respectively.

- **Summary**: Image dehazing aims to restore spatial details from hazy images. There have emerged a number of image dehazing algorithms, designed to increase the visibility of those hazy images. However, much less work has been focused on evaluating the visual quality of dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a Reduced-Reference dehazed image quality evaluation approach based on Partial Discrepancy (RRPD) and then extend it to a No-Reference quality assessment metric with Blind Perception (NRBP). Specifically, inspired by the hierarchical characteristics of the human perceiving dehazed images, we introduce three groups of features: luminance discrimination, color appearance, and overall naturalness. In the proposed RRPD, the combined distance between a set of sender and receiver features is adopted to quantify the perceptually dehazed image quality. By integrating global and local channels from dehazed images, the RRPD is converted to NRBP which does not rely on any information from the references. Extensive experiment results on several dehazed image quality databases demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference quality assessment models. Furthermore, we show that the proposed dehazed image quality evaluation methods can be effectively applied to tune parameters for potential image dehazing algorithms.

- **Summary**: Road scene understanding tasks have recently become crucial for self-driving vehicles. In particular, real-time semantic segmentation is indispensable for intelligent self-driving agents to recognize roadside objects in the driving area. As prior research works have primarily sought to improve the segmentation performance with computationally heavy operations, they require far significant hardware resources for both training and deployment, and thus are not suitable for real-time applications. As such, we propose a doubly contrastive approach to improve the performance of a more practical lightweight model for self-driving, specifically under adverse weather conditions such as fog, nighttime, rain and snow. Our proposed approach exploits both image- and pixel-level contrasts in an end-to-end supervised learning scheme without requiring a memory bank for global consistency or the pretraining step used in conventional contrastive methods. We validate the effectiveness of our method using SwiftNet on the ACDC dataset, where it achieves up to 1.34%p improvement in mIoU (ResNet-18 backbone) at 66.7 FPS (2048x1024 resolution) on a single RTX 3080 Mobile GPU at inference. Furthermore, we demonstrate that replacing image-level supervision with self-supervision achieves comparable performance when pre-trained with clear weather images.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the two most popular families of deep neural architectures (i.e., ResNets and InceptionNets) for the autonomous driving task of steering angle prediction. This work provides preliminary evidence that Inception architectures can perform as well or sometimes better than ResNet architectures with less complexity for the autonomous driving task. Our focus is on the compact end of the complexity spectrum. Compact neural network architectures produce less carbon emissions and are thus more environmentally friendly. We look at various sizes of compact ResNet and InceptionNet models to compare results. Our derived models can achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of steering angle MSE. In addition, we also explore the attention mechanism and investigate its influence on steering angle prediction.

- **Summary**: In the past decade, exemplar-based texture synthesis algorithms have seen strong gains in performance by matching statistics of deep convolutional neural networks. However, these algorithms require regularization terms or user-added spatial tags to capture long range constraints in images. Having access to a user-added spatial tag for all situations is not always feasible, and regularization terms can be difficult to tune. It would be ideal to create an algorithm that does not have any of the aforementioned drawbacks. Thus, we propose a new set of statistics for exemplar based texture synthesis based on Sliced Wasserstein Loss and create a multi-scale algorithm to synthesize textures without a user-added spatial tag. Lastly, we study the ability of our proposed algorithm to capture long range constraints in images and compare our results to other exemplar-based neural texture synthesis algorithms.

- **Summary**: Generating images from graph-structured inputs, such as scene graphs, is uniquely challenging due to the difficulty of aligning nodes and connections in graphs with objects and their relations in images. Most existing methods address this challenge by using scene layouts, which are image-like representations of scene graphs designed to capture the coarse structures of scene images. Because scene layouts are manually crafted, the alignment with images may not be fully optimized, causing suboptimal compliance between the generated images and the original scene graphs. To tackle this issue, we propose to learn scene graph embeddings by directly optimizing their alignment with images. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder to extract both global and local information from scene graphs that are predictive of the corresponding images, relying on two loss functions: masked autoencoding loss and contrastive loss. The former trains embeddings by reconstructing randomly masked image regions, while the latter trains embeddings to discriminate between compliant and non-compliant images according to the scene graph. Given these embeddings, we build a latent diffusion model to generate images from scene graphs. The resulting method, called SGDiff, allows for the semantic manipulation of generated images by modifying scene graph nodes and connections. On the Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets, we demonstrate that SGDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, as measured by both the Inception Score and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) metrics. We will release our source code and trained models at https://github.com/YangLing0818/SGDiff.

- **Summary**: Four-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (4D-MRI) is an emerging technique for tumor motion management in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). However, current 4D-MRI suffers from low spatial resolution and strong motion artifacts owing to the long acquisition time and patients' respiratory variations; these limitations, if not managed properly, can adversely affect treatment planning and delivery in IGRT. Herein, we developed a novel deep learning framework called the coarse-super-resolution-fine network (CoSF-Net) to achieve simultaneous motion estimation and super-resolution in a unified model. We designed CoSF-Net by fully excavating the inherent properties of 4D-MRI, with consideration of limited and imperfectly matched training datasets. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple real patient datasets to verify the feasibility and robustness of the developed network. Compared with existing networks and three state-of-the-art conventional algorithms, CoSF-Net not only accurately estimated the deformable vector fields between the respiratory phases of 4D-MRI but also simultaneously improved the spatial resolution of 4D-MRI with enhanced anatomic features, yielding 4D-MR images with high spatiotemporal resolution.

- **Summary**: Large-scale Transformer models bring significant improvements for various downstream vision language tasks with a unified architecture. The performance improvements come with increasing model size, resulting in slow inference speed and increased cost for severing. While some certain predictions benefit from the full complexity of the large-scale model, not all of inputs need the same amount of computation to conduct, potentially leading to computation resource waste. To handle this challenge, early exiting is proposed to adaptively allocate computational power in term of input complexity to improve inference efficiency. The existing early exiting strategies usually adopt output confidence based on intermediate layers as a proxy of input complexity to incur the decision of skipping following layers. However, such strategies cannot apply to encoder in the widely-used unified architecture with both encoder and decoder due to difficulty of output confidence estimation in the encoder. It is suboptimal in term of saving computation power to ignore the early exiting in encoder component. To handle this challenge, we propose a novel early exiting strategy for unified visual language models, which allows dynamically skip the layers in encoder and decoder simultaneously in term of input layer-wise similarities with multiple times of early exiting, namely \textbf{MuE}. By decomposing the image and text modalities in the encoder, MuE is flexible and can skip different layers in term of modalities, advancing the inference efficiency while minimizing performance drop. Experiments on the SNLI-VE and MS COCO datasets show that the proposed approach MuE can reduce expected inference time by up to 50\% and 40\% while maintaining 99\% and 96\% performance respectively.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning is a form of distance learning that aims to learn invariant features from two related representations. In this paper, we explore the bold hypothesis that an image and its caption can be simply regarded as two different views of the underlying mutual information, and train a model to learn a unified vision-language representation space that encodes both modalities at once in a modality-agnostic manner. We first identify difficulties in learning a generic one-tower model for vision-language pretraining (VLP), and propose OneR as a simple yet effective framework for our goal. We discover intriguing properties that distinguish OneR from the previous works that learn modality-specific representation spaces such as zero-shot object localization, text-guided visual reasoning and multi-modal retrieval, and present analyses to provide insights into this new form of multi-modal representation learning. Thorough evaluations demonstrate the potential of a unified modality-agnostic VLP framework.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition is an important AI task, which has been progressed rapidly with the development of deep learning. However, existing learning based gait recognition methods mainly focus on the single domain, especially the constrained laboratory environment. In this paper, we study a new problem of unsupervised domain adaptive gait recognition (UDA-GR), that learns a gait identifier with supervised labels from the indoor scenes (source domain), and is applied to the outdoor wild scenes (target domain). For this purpose, we develop an uncertainty estimation and regularization based UDA-GR method. Specifically, we investigate the characteristic of gaits in the indoor and outdoor scenes, for estimating the gait sample uncertainty, which is used in the unsupervised fine-tuning on the target domain to alleviate the noises of the pseudo labels. We also establish a new benchmark for the proposed problem, experimental results on which show the effectiveness of the proposed method. We will release the benchmark and source code in this work to the public.

- **Summary**: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) are inherently interpretable models that factor model decisions into human-readable concepts. They allow people to easily understand why a model is failing, a critical feature for high-stakes applications. CBMs require manually specified concepts and often under-perform their black box counterparts, preventing their broad adoption. We address these shortcomings and are first to show how to construct high-performance CBMs without manual specification of similar accuracy to black box models. Our approach, Language Guided Bottlenecks (LaBo), leverages a language model, GPT-3, to define a large space of possible bottlenecks. Given a problem domain, LaBo uses GPT-3 to produce factual sentences about categories to form candidate concepts. LaBo efficiently searches possible bottlenecks through a novel submodular utility that promotes the selection of discriminative and diverse information. Ultimately, GPT-3's sentential concepts can be aligned to images using CLIP, to form a bottleneck layer. Experiments demonstrate that LaBo is a highly effective prior for concepts important to visual recognition. In the evaluation with 11 diverse datasets, LaBo bottlenecks excel at few-shot classification: they are 11.7% more accurate than black box linear probes at 1 shot and comparable with more data. Overall, LaBo demonstrates that inherently interpretable models can be widely applied at similar, or better, performance than black box approaches.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a classical computer vision task and has achieved great progress so far. Recently, long-term Re-ID with clothes-changing has attracted increasing attention. However, existing methods mainly focus on image-based setting, where richer temporal information is overlooked. In this paper, we focus on the relatively new yet practical problem of clothes-changing video-based person re-identification (CCVReID), which is less studied. We systematically study this problem by simultaneously considering the challenge of the clothes inconsistency issue and the temporal information contained in the video sequence for the person Re-ID problem. Based on this, we develop a two-branch confidence-aware re-ranking framework for handling the CCVReID problem. The proposed framework integrates two branches that consider both the classical appearance features and cloth-free gait features through a confidence-guided re-ranking strategy. This method provides the baseline method for further studies. Also, we build two new benchmark datasets for CCVReID problem, including a large-scale synthetic video dataset and a real-world one, both containing human sequences with various clothing changes. We will release the benchmark and code in this work to the public.



### Vision Transformer with Super Token Sampling

- **Summary**: Vision transformer has achieved impressive performance for many vision tasks. However, it may suffer from high redundancy in capturing local features for shallow layers. Local self-attention or early-stage convolutions are thus utilized, which sacrifice the capacity to capture long-range dependency. A challenge then arises: can we access efficient and effective global context modeling at the early stages of a neural network? To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the design of superpixels, which reduces the number of image primitives in subsequent processing, and introduce super tokens into vision transformer. Super tokens attempt to provide a semantically meaningful tessellation of visual content, thus reducing the token number in self-attention as well as preserving global modeling. Specifically, we propose a simple yet strong super token attention (STA) mechanism with three steps: the first samples super tokens from visual tokens via sparse association learning, the second performs self-attention on super tokens, and the last maps them back to the original token space. STA decomposes vanilla global attention into multiplications of a sparse association map and a low-dimensional attention, leading to high efficiency in capturing global dependencies. Based on STA, we develop a hierarchical vision transformer. Extensive experiments demonstrate its strong performance on various vision tasks. In particular, without any extra training data or label, it achieves 86.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with less than 100M parameters. It also achieves 53.9 box AP and 46.8 mask AP on the COCO detection task, and 51.9 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task. Code will be released at https://github.com/hhb072/SViT.



### On the Robustness, Generalization, and Forgetting of Shape-Texture Debiased Continual Learning

- **Summary**: Tremendous progress has been made in continual learning to maintain good performance on old tasks when learning new tasks by tackling the catastrophic forgetting problem of neural networks. This paper advances continual learning by further considering its out-of-distribution robustness, in response to the vulnerability of continually trained models to distribution shifts (e.g., due to data corruptions and domain shifts) in inference. To this end, we propose shape-texture debiased continual learning. The key idea is to learn generalizable and robust representations for each task with shape-texture debiased training. In order to transform standard continual learning to shape-texture debiased continual learning, we propose shape-texture debiased data generation and online shape-texture debiased self-distillation. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach in improving generalization and robustness, as well as reducing forgetting. Our analysis on the flatness of the loss landscape explains the advantages. Moreover, our approach can be easily combined with new advanced architectures such as vision transformer, and applied to more challenging scenarios such as exemplar-free continual learning.



### NeuMap: Neural Coordinate Mapping by Auto-Transdecoder for Camera Localization

- **Summary**: This paper presents an end-to-end neural mapping method for camera localization, dubbed NeuMap, encoding a whole scene into a grid of latent codes, with which a Transformer-based auto-decoder regresses 3D coordinates of query pixels. State-of-the-art feature matching methods require each scene to be stored as a 3D point cloud with per-point features, consuming several gigabytes of storage per scene. While compression is possible, performance drops significantly at high compression rates. Conversely, coordinate regression methods achieve high compression by storing scene information in a neural network but suffer from reduced robustness. NeuMap combines the advantages of both approaches by utilizing 1) learnable latent codes for efficient scene representation and 2) a scene-agnostic Transformer-based auto-decoder to infer coordinates for query pixels. This scene-agnostic network design learns robust matching priors from large-scale data and enables rapid optimization of codes for new scenes while keeping the network weights fixed. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that NeuMap significantly outperforms other coordinate regression methods and achieves comparable performance to feature matching methods while requiring a much smaller scene representation size. For example, NeuMap achieves 39.1% accuracy in the Aachen night benchmark with only 6MB of data, whereas alternative methods require 100MB or several gigabytes and fail completely under high compression settings.

- **Summary**: Laser scanning can provide timely assessments of mine sites despite adverse challenges in the operational environment. Although there are several published articles on laser scanning, there is a need to review them in the context of underground mining applications. To this end, a holistic review of laser scanning is presented including progress in 3D scanning systems, data capture/processing techniques and primary applications in underground mines. Laser scanning technology has advanced significantly in terms of mobility and mapping, but there are constraints in coherent and consistent data collection at certain mines due to feature deficiency, dynamics, and environmental influences such as dust and water. Studies suggest that laser scanning has matured over the years for change detection, clearance measurements and structure mapping applications. However, there is scope for improvements in lithology identification, surface parameter measurements, logistic tracking and autonomous navigation. Laser scanning has the potential to provide real-time solutions but the lack of infrastructure in underground mines for data transfer, geodetic networking and processing capacity remain limiting factors. Nevertheless, laser scanners are becoming an integral part of mine automation thanks to their affordability, accuracy and mobility, which should support their widespread usage in years to come.

- **Summary**: Orientation estimation is the core to a variety of vision and robotics tasks such as camera and object pose estimation. Deep learning has offered a way to develop image-based orientation estimators; however, such estimators often require training on a large labeled dataset, which can be time-intensive to collect. In this work, we explore whether self-supervised learning from unlabeled data can be used to alleviate this issue. Specifically, we assume access to estimates of the relative orientation between neighboring poses, such that can be obtained via a local alignment method. While self-supervised learning has been used successfully for translational object keypoints, in this work, we show that naively applying relative supervision to the rotational group $SO(3)$ will often fail to converge due to the non-convexity of the rotational space. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new algorithm for self-supervised orientation estimation which utilizes Modified Rodrigues Parameters to stereographically project the closed manifold of $SO(3)$ to the open manifold of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, allowing the optimization to be done in an open Euclidean space. We empirically validate the benefits of the proposed algorithm for rotational averaging problem in two settings: (1) direct optimization on rotation parameters, and (2) optimization of parameters of a convolutional neural network that predicts object orientations from images. In both settings, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is able to converge to a consistent relative orientation frame much faster than algorithms that purely operate in the $SO(3)$ space.

- **Summary**: Multiple object detection and pose estimation are vital computer vision tasks. The latter relates to the former as a downstream problem in applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, due to the high complexity of both tasks, existing methods generally treat them independently, which is sub-optimal. We propose simultaneous neural modeling of both using monocular vision and 3D model infusion. Our Simultaneous Multiple Object detection and Pose Estimation network (SMOPE-Net) is an end-to-end trainable multitasking network with a composite loss that also provides the advantages of anchor-free detections for efficient downstream pose estimation. To enable the annotation of training data for our learning objective, we develop a Twin-Space object labeling method and demonstrate its correctness analytically and empirically. Using the labeling method, we provide the KITTI-6DoF dataset with $\sim7.5$K annotated frames. Extensive experiments on KITTI-6DoF and the popular LineMod datasets show a consistent performance gain with SMOPE-Net over existing pose estimation methods. Here are links to our proposed SMOPE-Net, KITTI-6DoF dataset, and LabelImg3D labeling tool.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal reasoning in visual question answering (VQA) has witnessed rapid progress recently. However, most reasoning models heavily rely on shortcuts learned from training data, which prevents their usage in challenging real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective cross-modal contrastive learning strategy to get rid of the shortcut reasoning caused by imbalanced annotations and improve the overall performance. Different from existing contrastive learning with complex negative categories on coarse (Image, Question, Answer) triplet level, we leverage the correspondences between the language and image modalities to perform finer-grained cross-modal contrastive learning. We treat each Question-Answer (QA) pair as a whole, and differentiate between images that conform with it and those against it. To alleviate the issue of sampling bias, we further build connected graphs among images. For each positive pair, we regard the images from different graphs as negative samples and deduct the version of multi-positive contrastive learning. To our best knowledge, it is the first paper that reveals a general contrastive learning strategy without delicate hand-craft rules can contribute to robust VQA reasoning.

- **Summary**: Traversability estimation for mobile robots in off-road environments requires more than conventional semantic segmentation used in constrained environments like on-road conditions. Recently, approaches to learning a traversability estimation from past driving experiences in a self-supervised manner are arising as they can significantly reduce human labeling costs and labeling errors. However, the self-supervised data only provide supervision for the actually traversed regions, inducing epistemic uncertainty according to the scarcity of negative information. Negative data are rarely harvested as the system can be severely damaged while logging the data. To mitigate the uncertainty, we introduce a deep metric learning-based method to incorporate unlabeled data with a few positive and negative prototypes in order to leverage the uncertainty, which jointly learns using semantic segmentation and traversability regression. To firmly evaluate the proposed framework, we introduce a new evaluation metric that comprehensively evaluates the segmentation and regression. Additionally, we construct a driving dataset `Dtrail' in off-road environments with a mobile robot platform, which is composed of a wide variety of negative data. We examine our method on Dtrail as well as the publicly available SemanticKITTI dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the first significant work on directly predicting 3D face landmarks on neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Our 3D coarse-to-fine Face Landmarks NeRF (FLNeRF) model efficiently samples from a given face NeRF with individual facial features for accurate landmarks detection. Expression augmentation is applied to facial features in a fine scale to simulate large emotions range including exaggerated facial expressions (e.g., cheek blowing, wide opening mouth, eye blinking) for training FLNeRF. Qualitative and quantitative comparison with related state-of-the-art 3D facial landmark estimation methods demonstrate the efficacy of FLNeRF, which contributes to downstream tasks such as high-quality face editing and swapping with direct control using our NeRF landmarks. Code and data will be available. Github link: https://github.com/ZHANG1023/FLNeRF.

- **Summary**: 3D-aware generative adversarial networks (GANs) synthesize high-fidelity and multi-view-consistent facial images using only collections of single-view 2D imagery. Towards fine-grained control over facial attributes, recent efforts incorporate 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) to describe deformation in generative radiance fields either explicitly or implicitly. Explicit methods provide fine-grained expression control but cannot handle topological changes caused by hair and accessories, while implicit ones can model varied topologies but have limited generalization caused by the unconstrained deformation fields. We propose a novel 3D GAN framework for unsupervised learning of generative, high-quality and 3D-consistent facial avatars from unstructured 2D images. To achieve both deformation accuracy and topological flexibility, we propose a 3D representation called Generative Texture-Rasterized Tri-planes. The proposed representation learns Generative Neural Textures on top of parametric mesh templates and then projects them into three orthogonal-viewed feature planes through rasterization, forming a tri-plane feature representation for volume rendering. In this way, we combine both fine-grained expression control of mesh-guided explicit deformation and the flexibility of implicit volumetric representation. We further propose specific modules for modeling mouth interior which is not taken into account by 3DMM. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art 3D-aware synthesis quality and animation ability through extensive experiments. Furthermore, serving as 3D prior, our animatable 3D representation boosts multiple applications including one-shot facial avatars and 3D-aware stylization.

- **Summary**: Self-Supervised Video Hashing (SSVH) models learn to generate short binary representations for videos without ground-truth supervision, facilitating large-scale video retrieval efficiency and attracting increasing research attention. The success of SSVH lies in the understanding of video content and the ability to capture the semantic relation among unlabeled videos. Typically, state-of-the-art SSVH methods consider these two points in a two-stage training pipeline, where they firstly train an auxiliary network by instance-wise mask-and-predict tasks and secondly train a hashing model to preserve the pseudo-neighborhood structure transferred from the auxiliary network. This consecutive training strategy is inflexible and also unnecessary. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective one-stage SSVH method called ConMH, which incorporates video semantic information and video similarity relationship understanding in a single stage. To capture video semantic information for better hashing learning, we adopt an encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct the video from its temporal-masked frames. Particularly, we find that a higher masking ratio helps video understanding. Besides, we fully exploit the similarity relationship between videos by maximizing agreement between two augmented views of a video, which contributes to more discriminative and robust hash codes. Extensive experiments on three large-scale video datasets (i.e., FCVID, ActivityNet and YFCC) indicate that ConMH achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) boast impressive performances for generative tasks such as novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. Methods based on neural radiance fields are able to represent the 3D world implicitly by relying exclusively on posed images. Yet, they have seldom been explored in the realm of discriminative tasks such as 3D part segmentation. In this work, we attempt to bridge that gap by proposing SegNeRF: a neural field representation that integrates a semantic field along with the usual radiance field. SegNeRF inherits from previous works the ability to perform novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, and enables 3D part segmentation from a few images. Our extensive experiments on PartNet show that SegNeRF is capable of simultaneously predicting geometry, appearance, and semantic information from posed images, even for unseen objects. The predicted semantic fields allow SegNeRF to achieve an average mIoU of $\textbf{30.30%}$ for 2D novel view segmentation, and $\textbf{37.46%}$ for 3D part segmentation, boasting competitive performance against point-based methods by using only a few posed images. Additionally, SegNeRF is able to generate an explicit 3D model from a single image of an object taken in the wild, with its corresponding part segmentation.

- **Summary**: The pedestrian trajectory prediction task is an essential component of intelligent systems. Its applications include but are not limited to autonomous driving, robot navigation, and anomaly detection of monitoring systems. Due to the diversity of motion behaviors and the complex social interactions among pedestrians, accurately forecasting their future trajectory is challenging. Existing approaches commonly adopt GANs or CVAEs to generate diverse trajectories. However, GAN-based methods do not directly model data in a latent space, which may make them fail to have full support over the underlying data distribution; CVAE-based methods optimize a lower bound on the log-likelihood of observations, which may cause the learned distribution to deviate from the underlying distribution. The above limitations make existing approaches often generate highly biased or inaccurate trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel generative flow based framework with dual graphormer for pedestrian trajectory prediction (STGlow). Different from previous approaches, our method can more precisely model the underlying data distribution by optimizing the exact log-likelihood of motion behaviors. Besides, our method has clear physical meanings for simulating the evolution of human motion behaviors. The forward process of the flow gradually degrades complex motion behavior into simple behavior, while its reverse process represents the evolution of simple behavior into complex motion behavior. Further, we introduce a dual graphormer combining with the graph structure to more adequately model the temporal dependencies and the mutual spatial interactions. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves much better performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: The success of Deep Generative Models at high-resolution image generation has led to their extensive utilization for style editing of real images. Most existing methods work on the principle of inverting real images onto their latent space, followed by determining controllable directions. Both inversion of real images and determination of controllable latent directions are computationally expensive operations. Moreover, the determination of controllable latent directions requires additional human supervision. This work aims to explore the efficacy of mask-guided feature modulation in the latent space of a Deep Generative Model as a solution to these bottlenecks. To this end, we present the SemanticStyle Autoencoder (SSAE), a deep Generative Autoencoder model that leverages semantic mask-guided latent space manipulation for highly localized photorealistic style editing of real images. We present qualitative and quantitative results for the same and their analysis. This work shall serve as a guiding primer for future work.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which attach human invisible perturbations to benign inputs. Simultaneously, adversarial examples exhibit transferability under different models, which makes practical black-box attacks feasible. However, existing methods are still incapable of achieving desired transfer attack performance. In this work, from the perspective of gradient optimization and consistency, we analyze and discover the gradient elimination phenomenon as well as the local momentum optimum dilemma. To tackle these issues, we propose Global Momentum Initialization (GI) to suppress gradient elimination and help search for the global optimum. Specifically, we perform gradient pre-convergence before the attack and carry out a global search during the pre-convergence stage. Our method can be easily combined with almost all existing transfer methods, and we improve the success rate of transfer attacks significantly by an average of 6.4% under various advanced defense mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art methods. Eventually, we achieve an attack success rate of 95.4%, fully illustrating the insecurity of existing defense mechanisms.

- **Summary**: Camera relocalization has various applications in autonomous driving. Previous camera pose regression models consider only ideal scenarios where there is little environmental perturbation. To deal with challenging driving environments that may have changing seasons, weather, illumination, and the presence of unstable objects, we propose RobustLoc, which derives its robustness against perturbations from neural differential equations. Our model uses a convolutional neural network to extract feature maps from multi-view images, a robust neural differential equation diffusion block module to diffuse information interactively, and a branched pose decoder with multi-layer training to estimate the vehicle poses. Experiments demonstrate that RobustLoc surpasses current state-of-the-art camera pose regression models and achieves robust performance in various environments.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation models based on the conventional neural network can achieve remarkable performance in such tasks, while the dataset is crucial to the training model process. Significant progress in expanding datasets has been made in semi-supervised semantic segmentation recently. However, completing the pixel-level information remains challenging due to possible missing in a label. Inspired by Mask AutoEncoder, we present a simple yet effective Pixel-Level completion method, Label Mask AutoEncoder(L-MAE), that fully uses the existing information in the label to predict results. The proposed model adopts the fusion strategy that stacks the label and the corresponding image, namely Fuse Map. Moreover, since some of the image information is lost when masking the Fuse Map, direct reconstruction may lead to poor performance. Our proposed Image Patch Supplement algorithm can supplement the missing information, as the experiment shows, an average of 4.1% mIoU can be improved. The Pascal VOC2012 dataset (224 crop size, 20 classes) and the Cityscape dataset (448 crop size, 19 classes) are used in the comparative experiments. With the Mask Ratio setting to 50%, in terms of the prediction region, the proposed model achieves 91.0% and 86.4% of mIoU on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscape, respectively, outperforming other current supervised semantic segmentation models. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/jjrccop/Label-Mask-Auto-Encoder.

- **Summary**: Music is essential when editing videos, but selecting music manually is difficult and time-consuming. Thus, we seek to automatically generate background music tracks given video input. This is a challenging task since it requires music-video datasets, efficient architectures for video-to-music generation, and reasonable metrics, none of which currently exist. To close this gap, we introduce a complete recipe including dataset, benchmark model, and evaluation metric for video background music generation. We present SymMV, a video and symbolic music dataset with various musical annotations. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first video-music dataset with rich musical annotations. We also propose a benchmark video background music generation framework named V-MusProd, which utilizes music priors of chords, melody, and accompaniment along with video-music relations of semantic, color, and motion features. To address the lack of objective metrics for video-music correspondence, we design a retrieval-based metric VMCP built upon a powerful video-music representation learning model. Experiments show that with our dataset, V-MusProd outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both music quality and correspondence with videos. We believe our dataset, benchmark model, and evaluation metric will boost the development of video background music generation.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a crucial task for ensuring the reliability and safety of deep learning. Currently, discriminator models outperform other methods in this regard. However, the feature extraction process used by discriminator models suffers from the loss of critical information, leaving room for bad cases and malicious attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new perceptron bias assumption that suggests discriminator models are more sensitive to certain features of the input, leading to the overconfidence problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that combines discriminator and generation models and integrates diffusion models (DMs) into OOD detection. We demonstrate that the diffusion denoising process (DDP) of DMs serves as a novel form of asymmetric interpolation, which is well-suited to enhance the input and mitigate the overconfidence problem. The discriminator model features of OOD data exhibit sharp changes under DDP, and we utilize the norm of this change as the indicator score. Our experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet show that our method outperforms SOTA approaches. Notably, for the challenging InD ImageNet and OOD species datasets, our method achieves an AUROC of 85.7, surpassing the previous SOTA method's score of 77.4.

- **Summary**: Semantic scene understanding with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS) in mobile and wearable applications remains a challenge due to the corrupted imaging quality induced by optical aberrations. However, previous works only focus on improving the subjective imaging quality through computational optics, i.e. Computational Imaging (CI) technique, ignoring the feasibility in semantic segmentation. In this paper, we pioneer to investigate Semantic Segmentation under Optical Aberrations (SSOA) of MOS. To benchmark SSOA, we construct Virtual Prototype Lens (VPL) groups through optical simulation, generating Cityscapes-ab and KITTI-360-ab datasets under different behaviors and levels of aberrations. We look into SSOA via an unsupervised domain adaptation perspective to address the scarcity of labeled aberration data in real-world scenarios. Further, we propose Computational Imaging Assisted Domain Adaptation (CIADA) to leverage prior knowledge of CI for robust performance in SSOA. Based on our benchmark, we conduct experiments on the robustness of state-of-the-art segmenters against aberrations. In addition, extensive evaluations of possible solutions to SSOA reveal that CIADA achieves superior performance under all aberration distributions, paving the way for the applications of MOS in semantic scene understanding. Code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/CIADA.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has proven to be highly effective in transferring knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a label-scarce target domain. However, the presence of additional novel categories in the target domain has led to the development of open-set domain adaptation (ODA) and universal domain adaptation (UNDA). Existing ODA and UNDA methods treat all novel categories as a single, unified unknown class and attempt to detect it during training. However, we found that domain variance can lead to more significant view-noise in unsupervised data augmentation, which affects the effectiveness of contrastive learning (CL) and causes the model to be overconfident in novel category discovery. To address these issues, a framework named Soft-contrastive All-in-one Network (SAN) is proposed for ODA and UNDA tasks. SAN includes a novel data-augmentation-based soft contrastive learning (SCL) loss to fine-tune the backbone for feature transfer and a more human-intuitive classifier to improve new class discovery capability. The SCL loss weakens the adverse effects of the data augmentation view-noise problem which is amplified in domain transfer tasks. The All-in-One (AIO) classifier overcomes the overconfidence problem of current mainstream closed-set and open-set classifiers. Visualization and ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed innovations. Furthermore, extensive experiment results on ODA and UNDA show that SAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Complex soft tissues, for example the knee meniscus, play a crucial role in mobility and joint health, but when damaged are incredibly difficult to repair and replace. This is due to their highly hierarchical and porous nature which in turn leads to their unique mechanical properties. In order to design tissue substitutes, the internal architecture of the native tissue needs to be understood and replicated. Here we explore a combined audio-visual approach - so called transperceptual - to generate artificial architectures mimicking the native ones. The proposed method uses both traditional imagery, and sound generated from each image as a method of rapidly comparing and contrasting the porosity and pore size within the samples. We have trained and tested a generative adversarial network (GAN) on the 2D image stacks. The impact of the training set of images on the similarity of the artificial to the original dataset was assessed by analyzing two samples. The first consisting of n=478 pairs of audio and image files for which the images were downsampled to 64 $\times$ 64 pixels, the second one consisting of n=7640 pairs of audio and image files for which the full resolution 256 $\times$ 256 pixels is retained but each image is divided into 16 squares to maintain the limit of 64 $\times$ 64 pixels required by the GAN. We reconstruct the 2D stacks of artificially generated datasets into 3D objects and run image analysis algorithms to characterize statistically the architectural parameters - pore size, tortuosity and pore connectivity - and compare them with the original dataset. Results show that the artificially generated dataset that undergoes downsampling performs better in terms of parameter matching. Our audiovisual approach has the potential to be extended to larger data sets to explore both how similarities and differences can be audibly recognized across multiple samples.

- **Summary**: High dynamic range (HDR) image is widely-used in graphics and photography due to the rich information it contains. Recently the community has started using deep neural network (DNN) to reconstruct standard dynamic range (SDR) images into HDR. Albeit the superiority of current DNN-based methods, their application scenario is still limited: (1) heavy model impedes real-time processing, and (2) inapplicable to legacy SDR content with more degradation types. Therefore, we propose a lightweight DNN-based method trained to tackle legacy SDR. For better design, we reform the problem modeling and emphasize degradation model. Experiments show that our method reached appealing performance with minimal computational cost compared with others.

- **Summary**: Although speech is a simple and effective way for humans to communicate with the outside world, a more realistic speech interaction contains multimodal information, e.g., vision, text. How to design a unified framework to integrate different modal information and leverage different resources (e.g., visual-audio pairs, audio-text pairs, unlabeled speech, and unlabeled text) to facilitate speech representation learning was not well explored. In this paper, we propose a unified cross-modal representation learning framework VATLM (Visual-Audio-Text Language Model). The proposed VATLM employs a unified backbone network to model the modality-independent information and utilizes three simple modality-dependent modules to preprocess visual, speech, and text inputs. In order to integrate these three modalities into one shared semantic space, VATLM is optimized with a masked prediction task of unified tokens, given by our proposed unified tokenizer. We evaluate the pre-trained VATLM on audio-visual related downstream tasks, including audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), visual speech recognition (VSR) tasks. Results show that the proposed VATLM outperforms previous the state-of-the-art models, such as audio-visual pre-trained AV-HuBERT model, and analysis also demonstrates that VATLM is capable of aligning different modalities into the same space. To facilitate future research, we release the code and pre-trained models at https://aka.ms/vatlm.

- **Summary**: Recent approaches to drape garments quickly over arbitrary human bodies leverage self-supervision to eliminate the need for large training sets. However, they are designed to train one network per clothing item, which severely limits their generalization abilities. In our work, we rely on self-supervision to train a single network to drape multiple garments. This is achieved by predicting a 3D deformation field conditioned on the latent codes of a generative network, which models garments as unsigned distance fields. Our pipeline can generate and drape previously unseen garments of any topology, whose shape can be edited by manipulating their latent codes. Being fully differentiable, our formulation makes it possible to recover accurate 3D models of garments from partial observations -- images or 3D scans -- via gradient descent.

- **Summary**: Instance segmentation is applied widely in image editing, image analysis and autonomous driving, etc. However, insufficient data is a common problem in practical applications. The Visual Inductive Priors(VIPriors) Instance Segmentation Challenge has focused on this problem. VIPriors for Data-Efficient Computer Vision Challenges ask competitors to train models from scratch in a data-deficient setting, but there are some visual inductive priors that can be used. In order to address the VIPriors instance segmentation problem, we designed a Task-Specific Data Augmentation(TS-DA) strategy and Inference Processing(TS-IP) strategy. The main purpose of task-specific data augmentation strategy is to tackle the data-deficient problem. And in order to make the most of visual inductive priors, we designed a task-specific inference processing strategy. We demonstrate the applicability of proposed method on VIPriors Instance Segmentation Challenge. The segmentation model applied is Hybrid Task Cascade based detector on the Swin-Base based CBNetV2 backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method can achieve a competitive result on the test set of 2022 VIPriors Instance Segmentation Challenge, with 0.531 AP@0.50:0.95.

- **Summary**: Limited by hardware cost and system size, camera's Field-of-View (FoV) is not always satisfactory. However, from a spatio-temporal perspective, information beyond the camera's physical FoV is off-the-shelf and can actually be obtained "for free" from the past. In this paper, we propose a novel task termed Beyond-FoV Estimation, aiming to exploit past visual cues and bidirectional break through the physical FoV of a camera. We put forward a FlowLens architecture to expand the FoV by achieving feature propagation explicitly by optical flow and implicitly by a novel clip-recurrent transformer, which has two appealing features: 1) FlowLens comprises a newly proposed Clip-Recurrent Hub with 3D-Decoupled Cross Attention (DDCA) to progressively process global information accumulated in the temporal dimension. 2) A multi-branch Mix Fusion Feed Forward Network (MixF3N) is integrated to enhance the spatially-precise flow of local features. To foster training and evaluation, we establish KITTI360-EX, a dataset for outer- and inner FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on both video inpainting and beyond-FoV estimation tasks show that FlowLens achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Modern deepfake detectors have achieved encouraging results, when training and test images are drawn from the same collection. However, when applying these detectors to faces manipulated using an unknown technique, considerable performance drops are typically observed. In this work, we propose a novel deepfake detector, called SeeABLE, that formalizes the detection problem as a (one-class) out-of-distribution detection task and generalizes better to unseen deepfakes. Specifically, SeeABLE uses a novel data augmentation strategy to synthesize fine-grained local image anomalies (referred to as soft-discrepancies) and pushes those pristine disrupted faces towards predefined prototypes using a novel regression-based bounded contrastive loss. To strengthen the generalization performance of SeeABLE to unknown deepfake types, we generate a rich set of soft discrepancies and train the detector: (i) to localize, which part of the face was modified, and (ii) to identify the alteration type. Using extensive experiments on widely used datasets, SeeABLE considerably outperforms existing detectors, with gains of up to +10\% on the DFDC-preview dataset in term of detection accuracy over SoTA methods while using a simpler model. Code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: This work presents two astonishing findings on neural networks learned for large-scale image classification. 1) Given a well-trained model, the logits predicted for some category can be directly obtained by linearly combining the predictions of a few other categories, which we call \textbf{neural dependency}. 2) Neural dependencies exist not only within a single model, but even between two independently learned models, regardless of their architectures. Towards a theoretical analysis of such phenomena, we demonstrate that identifying neural dependencies is equivalent to solving the Covariance Lasso (CovLasso) regression problem proposed in this paper. Through investigating the properties of the problem solution, we confirm that neural dependency is guaranteed by a redundant logit covariance matrix, which condition is easily met given massive categories, and that neural dependency is highly sparse, implying that one category correlates to only a few others. We further empirically show the potential of neural dependencies in understanding internal data correlations, generalizing models to unseen categories, and improving model robustness with a dependency-derived regularizer. Code for this work will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Transfer learning schemes based on deep networks which have been trained on huge image corpora offer state-of-the-art technologies in computer vision. Here, supervised and semi-supervised approaches constitute efficient technologies which work well with comparably small data sets. Yet, such applications are currently restricted to application domains where suitable deepnetwork models are readily available. In this contribution, we address an important application area in the domain of biotechnology, the automatic analysis of CHO-K1 suspension growth in microfluidic single-cell cultivation, where data characteristics are very dissimilar to existing domains and trained deep networks cannot easily be adapted by classical transfer learning. We propose a novel transfer learning scheme which expands a recently introduced Twin-VAE architecture, which is trained on realistic and synthetic data, and we modify its specialized training procedure to the transfer learning domain. In the specific domain, often only few to no labels exist and annotations are costly. We investigate a novel transfer learning strategy, which incorporates a simultaneous retraining on natural and synthetic data using an invariant shared representation as well as suitable target variables, while it learns to handle unseen data from a different microscopy tech nology. We show the superiority of the variation of our Twin-VAE architecture over the state-of-the-art transfer learning methodology in image processing as well as classical image processing technologies, which persists, even with strongly shortened training times and leads to satisfactory results in this domain. The source code is available at https://github.com/dstallmann/transfer_learning_twinvae, works cross-platform, is open-source and free (MIT licensed) software.

- **Summary**: Capitalizing on the rapid development of neural networks, recent video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have achieved notable improvements. However, they still fall short for real-world videos containing large motions. Complex deformation and/or occlusion caused by large motions make it an extremely difficult problem in video frame interpolation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution, H-VFI, to deal with large motions in video frame interpolation. H-VFI contributes a hierarchical video interpolation transformer (HVIT) to learn a deformable kernel in a coarse-to-fine strategy in multiple scales. The learnt deformable kernel is then utilized in convolving the input frames for predicting the interpolated frame. Starting from the smallest scale, H-VFI updates the deformable kernel by a residual in succession based on former predicted kernels, intermediate interpolated results and hierarchical features from transformer. Bias and masks to refine the final outputs are then predicted by a transformer block based on interpolated results. The advantage of such a progressive approximation is that the large motion frame interpolation problem can be decomposed into several relatively simpler sub-tasks, which enables a very accurate prediction in the final results. Another noteworthy contribution of our paper consists of a large-scale high-quality dataset, YouTube200K, which contains videos depicting a great variety of scenarios captured at high resolution and high frame rate. Extensive experiments on multiple frame interpolation benchmarks validate that H-VFI outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods especially for videos with large motions.

- **Summary**: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been employed in a wide range of applications, e.g. self-driving cars, where safety and lives are at stake. Recently, the robustness of existing skeleton-based HAR methods has been questioned due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which causes concerns considering the scale of the implication. However, the proposed attacks require the full-knowledge of the attacked classifier, which is overly restrictive. In this paper, we show such threats indeed exist, even when the attacker only has access to the input/output of the model. To this end, we propose the very first black-box adversarial attack approach in skeleton-based HAR called BASAR. BASAR explores the interplay between the classification boundary and the natural motion manifold. To our best knowledge, this is the first time data manifold is introduced in adversarial attacks on time series. Via BASAR, we find on-manifold adversarial samples are extremely deceitful and rather common in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that adversarial samples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation, we show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across classifiers, datasets, and attack modes. By attack, BASAR helps identify the potential causes of the model vulnerability and provides insights on possible improvements. Finally, to mitigate the newly identified threat, we propose a new adversarial training approach by leveraging the sophisticated distributions of on/off-manifold adversarial samples, called mixed manifold-based adversarial training (MMAT). MMAT can successfully help defend against adversarial attacks without compromising classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers have achieved significant improvements on various vision tasks but their quadratic interactions between tokens significantly reduce computational efficiency. Many pruning methods have been proposed to remove redundant tokens for efficient vision transformers recently. However, existing studies mainly focus on the token importance to preserve local attentive tokens but completely ignore the global token diversity. In this paper, we emphasize the cruciality of diverse global semantics and propose an efficient token decoupling and merging method that can jointly consider the token importance and diversity for token pruning. According to the class token attention, we decouple the attentive and inattentive tokens. In addition to preserving the most discriminative local tokens, we merge similar inattentive tokens and match homogeneous attentive tokens to maximize the token diversity. Despite its simplicity, our method obtains a promising trade-off between model complexity and classification accuracy. On DeiT-S, our method reduces the FLOPs by 35% with only a 0.2% accuracy drop. Notably, benefiting from maintaining the token diversity, our method can even improve the accuracy of DeiT-T by 0.1% after reducing its FLOPs by 40%.

- **Summary**: This paper presents EHSNet, a new end-to-end segmentation network designed for the holistic learning of large-size remote sensing image semantic segmentation (LRISS). Large-size remote sensing images (LRIs) can lead to GPU memory exhaustion due to their extremely large size, which has been handled in previous works through either global-local fusion or multi-stage refinement, both of which are limited in their ability to fully exploit the abundant information available in LRIs. Unlike them, EHSNet features three memory-friendly modules to utilize the characteristics of LRIs: a long-range dependency module to develop long-range spatial context, an efficient cross-correlation module to build holistic contextual relationships, and a boundary-aware enhancement module to preserve complete object boundaries. Moreover, EHSNet manages to process holistic LRISS with the aid of memory offloading. To the best of our knowledge, EHSNet is the first method capable of performing holistic LRISS. To make matters better, EHSNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art competitors by a significant margin of +5.65 mIoU on FBP and +4.28 mIoU on Inria Aerial, demonstrating its effectiveness. We hope that EHSNet will provide a new perspective for LRISS. The code and models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Visual anomaly detection, an important problem in computer vision, is usually formulated as a one-class classification and segmentation task. The student-teacher (S-T) framework has proved to be effective in solving this challenge. However, previous works based on S-T only empirically applied constraints on normal data and fused multi-level information. In this study, we propose an improved model called DeSTSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student encoder-decoder, and a segmentation network into one framework. First, to strengthen the constraints on anomalous data, we introduce a denoising procedure that allows the student network to learn more robust representations. From synthetically corrupted normal images, we train the student network to match the teacher network feature of the same images without corruption. Second, to fuse the multi-level S-T features adaptively, we train a segmentation network with rich supervision from synthetic anomaly masks, achieving a substantial performance improvement. Experiments on the industrial inspection benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, 98.6% on image-level AUC, 75.8% on pixel-level average precision, and 76.4% on instance-level average precision.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown impressive results in text-to-image synthesis. Using massive datasets of captioned images, diffusion models learn to generate raster images of highly diverse objects and scenes. However, designers frequently use vector representations of images like Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) for digital icons or art. Vector graphics can be scaled to any size, and are compact. We show that a text-conditioned diffusion model trained on pixel representations of images can be used to generate SVG-exportable vector graphics. We do so without access to large datasets of captioned SVGs. By optimizing a differentiable vector graphics rasterizer, our method, VectorFusion, distills abstract semantic knowledge out of a pretrained diffusion model. Inspired by recent text-to-3D work, we learn an SVG consistent with a caption using Score Distillation Sampling. To accelerate generation and improve fidelity, VectorFusion also initializes from an image sample. Experiments show greater quality than prior work, and demonstrate a range of styles including pixel art and sketches. See our project webpage at https://ajayj.com/vectorfusion .

- **Summary**: Recent works on implicit neural representations have made significant strides. Learning implicit neural surfaces using volume rendering has gained popularity in multi-view reconstruction without 3D supervision. However, accurately recovering fine details is still challenging, due to the underlying ambiguity of geometry and appearance representation. In this paper, we present D-NeuS, a volume rendering-base neural implicit surface reconstruction method capable to recover fine geometry details, which extends NeuS by two additional loss functions targeting enhanced reconstruction quality. First, we encourage the rendered surface points from alpha compositing to have zero signed distance values, alleviating the geometry bias arising from transforming SDF to density for volume rendering. Second, we impose multi-view feature consistency on the surface points, derived by interpolating SDF zero-crossings from sampled points along rays. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method reconstructs high-accuracy surfaces with details, and outperforms the state of the art.



### Slow Motion Matters: A Slow Motion Enhanced Network for Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos with only weak supervision information (e.g. video-level labels). Most existing models handle all input videos with a fixed temporal scale. However, such models are not sensitive to actions whose pace of the movements is different from the ``normal" speed, especially slow-motion action instances, which complete the movements with a much slower speed than their counterparts with a normal speed. Here arises the slow-motion blurred issue: It is hard to explore salient slow-motion information from videos at ``normal" speed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Slow Motion Enhanced Network (SMEN) to improve the ability of a WTAL network by compensating its sensitivity on slow-motion action segments. The proposed SMEN comprises a Mining module and a Localization module. The mining module generates mask to mine slow-motion-related features by utilizing the relationships between the normal motion and slow motion; while the localization module leverages the mined slow-motion features as complementary information to improve the temporal action localization results. Our proposed framework can be easily adapted by existing WTAL networks and enable them be more sensitive to slow-motion actions. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks are conducted, which demonstrate the high performance of our proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Recently, semi-supervised semantic segmentation has achieved promising performance with a small fraction of labeled data. However, most existing studies treat all unlabeled data equally and barely consider the differences and training difficulties among unlabeled instances. Differentiating unlabeled instances can promote instance-specific supervision to adapt to the model's evolution dynamically. In this paper, we emphasize the cruciality of instance differences and propose an instance-specific and model-adaptive supervision for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, named iMAS. Relying on the model's performance, iMAS employs a class-weighted symmetric intersection-over-union to evaluate quantitative hardness of each unlabeled instance and supervises the training on unlabeled data in a model-adaptive manner. Specifically, iMAS learns from unlabeled instances progressively by weighing their corresponding consistency losses based on the evaluated hardness. Besides, iMAS dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance such that the distortion degree of augmented instances is adapted to the model's generalization capability across the training course. Not integrating additional losses and training procedures, iMAS can obtain remarkable performance gains against current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks under different semi-supervised partition protocols.

We embed the proposed network into the orientation correction command-line tool, which can implement orientation correction on 2D DICOM and 3D NIFTI images.

- **Summary**: Large-scale text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, feature-rich images with high resolution guided by texts. However, these models often struggle with novel concepts, eg, new styles, object entities, etc. Although recent attempts have employed fine-tuning or prompt-tuning strategies to teach the pre-trained diffusion model novel concepts from a reference image set,they have the drawback of overfitting to the given reference images, particularly in one-shot applications, which is harmful to generate diverse and high-quality images while maintaining generation controllability.   To tackle this challenge, we present a simple yet effective method called DreamArtist, which employs a positive-negative prompt-tuning learning strategy. Specifically, DreamArtist incorporates both positive and negative embeddings and jointly trains them. The positive embedding aggressively captures the salient characteristics of the reference image to drive diversified generation and the negative embedding rectifies inadequacies from the positive embedding. It learns not only what is correct, but also what can be avoided or improved. We have conducted extensive experiments and evaluated the proposed method from image similarity and diversity, generation controllability, and style cloning. And our DreamArtist has achieved a superior generation performance over existing methods. Besides, our additional evaluation on extended tasks, including concept compositions and prompt-guided image editing, demonstrates its effectiveness for more applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper we tackle the cross-modal video retrieval problem and, more specifically, we focus on text-to-video retrieval. We investigate how to optimally combine multiple diverse textual and visual features into feature pairs that lead to generating multiple joint feature spaces, which encode text-video pairs into comparable representations. To learn these representations our proposed network architecture is trained by following a multiple space learning procedure. Moreover, at the retrieval stage, we introduce additional softmax operations for revising the inferred query-video similarities. Extensive experiments in several setups based on three large-scale datasets (IACC.3, V3C1, and MSR-VTT) lead to conclusions on how to best combine text-visual features and document the performance of the proposed network.

- **Summary**: Autonomous robots that interact with their environment require a detailed semantic scene model. For this, volumetric semantic maps are frequently used. The scene understanding can further be improved by including object-level information in the map. In this work, we extend a multi-view 3D semantic mapping system consisting of a network of distributed smart edge sensors with object-level information, to enable downstream tasks that need object-level input. Objects are represented in the map via their 3D mesh model or as an object-centric volumetric sub-map that can model arbitrary object geometry when no detailed 3D model is available. We propose a keypoint-based approach to estimate object poses via PnP and refinement via ICP alignment of the 3D object model with the observed point cloud segments. Object instances are tracked to integrate observations over time and to be robust against temporary occlusions. Our method is evaluated on the public Behave dataset where it shows pose estimation accuracy within a few centimeters and in real-world experiments with the sensor network in a challenging lab environment where multiple chairs and a table are tracked through the scene online, in real time even under high occlusions.

- **Summary**: Optimizing neural networks with noisy labels is a challenging task, especially if the label set contains real-world noise. Networks tend to generalize to reasonable patterns in the early training stages and overfit to specific details of noisy samples in the latter ones. We introduce Blind Knowledge Distillation - a novel teacher-student approach for learning with noisy labels by masking the ground truth related teacher output to filter out potentially corrupted knowledge and to estimate the tipping point from generalizing to overfitting. Based on this, we enable the estimation of noise in the training data with Otsus algorithm. With this estimation, we train the network with a modified weighted cross-entropy loss function. We show in our experiments that Blind Knowledge Distillation detects overfitting effectively during training and improves the detection of clean and noisy labels on the recently published CIFAR-N dataset. Code is available at GitHub.

- **Summary**: The non-line-of-sight imaging technique aims to reconstruct targets from multiply reflected light. For most existing methods, dense points on the relay surface are raster scanned to obtain high-quality reconstructions, which requires a long acquisition time. In this work, we propose a signal-surface collaborative regularization (SSCR) framework that provides noise-robust reconstructions with a minimal number of measurements. Using Bayesian inference, we design joint regularizations of the estimated signal, the 3D voxel-based representation of the objects, and the 2D surface-based description of the targets. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that combines regularizations in mixed dimensions for hidden targets. Experiments on synthetic and experimental datasets illustrated the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method under both confocal and non-confocal settings. We report the reconstruction of the hidden targets with complex geometric structures with only $5 \times 5$ confocal measurements from public datasets, indicating an acceleration of the conventional measurement process by a factor of 10000. Besides, the proposed method enjoys low time and memory complexities with sparse measurements. Our approach has great potential in real-time non-line-of-sight imaging applications such as rescue operations and autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: The knowledge of the world is passed on through libraries. Accordingly, domain expertise and experiences should also be transferred within an enterprise by a knowledge base. Therefore, models are an established medium to describe good practices for complex systems, processes, and interconnections. However, there is no structured and detailed approach for a design of an enterprise model library. The objective of this work is the reference architecture of a repository for models with function of reuse. It includes the design of the data structure for filing, the processes for administration and possibilities for usage. Our approach enables consistent mapping of requirements into models via meta-data attributes. Furthermore, the adaptation of reference architectures in specific use cases as well as a reconciliation of interrelationships is enabled. A case study with industry demonstrates the practical benefits of reusing work already done. It provides an organization with systematic access to specifications, standards and guidelines. Thus, further development is accelerated and supported in a structured manner, while complexity remains controllable. The presented approach enriches various enterprise architecture frameworks. It provides benefits for development based on models.

- **Summary**: Advanced deep learning architectures consist of tens of fully connected and convolutional hidden layers, currently extended to hundreds, are far from their biological realization. Their implausible biological dynamics relies on changing a weight in a non-local manner, as the number of routes between an output unit and a weight is typically large, using the backpropagation technique. Here, a 3-layer tree architecture inspired by experimental-based dendritic tree adaptations is developed and applied to the offline and online learning of the CIFAR-10 database. The proposed architecture outperforms the achievable success rates of the 5-layer convolutional LeNet. Moreover, the highly pruned tree backpropagation approach of the proposed architecture, where a single route connects an output unit and a weight, represents an efficient dendritic deep learning.

- **Summary**: Automated radiology report generation aims at automatically generating a detailed description of medical images, which can greatly alleviate the workload of radiologists and provide better medical services to remote areas. Most existing works pay attention to the holistic impression of medical images, failing to utilize important anatomy information. However, in actual clinical practice, radiologists usually locate important anatomical structures, and then look for signs of abnormalities in certain structures and reason the underlying disease. In this paper, we propose a novel framework AGFNet to dynamically fuse the global and anatomy region feature to generate multi-grained radiology report. Firstly, we extract important anatomy region features and global features of input Chest X-ray (CXR). Then, with the region features and the global features as input, our proposed self-adaptive fusion gate module could dynamically fuse multi-granularity information. Finally, the captioning generator generates the radiology reports through multi-granularity features. Experiment results illustrate that our model achieved the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets including the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR. Further analyses also prove that our model is able to leverage the multi-grained information from radiology images and texts so as to help generate more accurate reports.

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework, Localized Image Stylization with Audio (LISA) which performs audio-driven localized image stylization. Sound often provides information about the specific context of the scene and is closely related to a certain part of the scene or object. However, existing image stylization works have focused on stylizing the entire image using an image or text input. Stylizing a particular part of the image based on audio input is natural but challenging. In this work, we propose a framework that a user provides an audio input to localize the sound source in the input image and another for locally stylizing the target object or scene. LISA first produces a delicate localization map with an audio-visual localization network by leveraging CLIP embedding space. We then utilize implicit neural representation (INR) along with the predicted localization map to stylize the target object or scene based on sound information. The proposed INR can manipulate the localized pixel values to be semantically consistent with the provided audio input. Through a series of experiments, we show that the proposed framework outperforms the other audio-guided stylization methods. Moreover, LISA constructs concise localization maps and naturally manipulates the target object or scene in accordance with the given audio input.

- **Summary**: Spectral imaging technologies have rapidly evolved during the past decades. The recent development of single-camera-one-shot techniques for hyperspectral imaging allows multiple spectral bands to be captured simultaneously (3x3, 4x4 or 5x5 mosaic), opening up a wide range of applications. Examples include intraoperative imaging, agricultural field inspection and food quality assessment. To capture images across a wide spectrum range, i.e. to achieve high spectral resolution, the sensor design sacrifices spatial resolution. With increasing mosaic size, this effect becomes increasingly detrimental. Furthermore, demosaicing is challenging. Without incorporating edge, shape, and object information during interpolation, chromatic artifacts are likely to appear in the obtained images. Recent approaches use neural networks for demosaicing, enabling direct information extraction from image data. However, obtaining training data for these approaches poses a challenge as well. This work proposes a parallel neural network based demosaicing procedure trained on a new ground truth dataset captured in a controlled environment by a hyperspectral snapshot camera with a 4x4 mosaic pattern. The dataset is a combination of real captured scenes with images from publicly available data adapted to the 4x4 mosaic pattern. To obtain real world ground-truth data, we performed multiple camera captures with 1-pixel shifts in order to compose the entire data cube. Experiments show that the proposed network outperforms state-of-art networks.

- **Summary**: Existing deep calibrated photometric stereo networks basically aggregate observations under different lights based on the pre-defined operations such as linear projection and max pooling. While they are effective with the dense capture, simple first-order operations often fail to capture the high-order interactions among observations under small number of different lights. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a deep sparse calibrated photometric stereo network named {\it PS-Transformer} which leverages the learnable self-attention mechanism to properly capture the complex inter-image interactions. PS-Transformer builds upon the dual-branch design to explore both pixel-wise and image-wise features and individual feature is trained with the intermediate surface normal supervision to maximize geometric feasibility. A new synthetic dataset named CyclesPS+ is also presented with the comprehensive analysis to successfully train the photometric stereo networks. Extensive results on the publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that the surface normal prediction accuracy of the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms with the same number of input images and is even comparable to that of dense algorithms which input 10$\times$ larger number of images.



### TFormer: A throughout fusion transformer for multi-modal skin lesion diagnosis

- **Summary**: Multi-modal skin lesion diagnosis (MSLD) has achieved remarkable success by modern computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology based on deep convolutions. However, the information aggregation across modalities in MSLD remains challenging due to severity unaligned spatial resolution (e.g., dermoscopic image and clinical image) and heterogeneous data (e.g., dermoscopic image and patients' meta-data). Limited by the intrinsic local attention, most recent MSLD pipelines using pure convolutions struggle to capture representative features in shallow layers, thus the fusion across different modalities is usually done at the end of the pipelines, even at the last layer, leading to an insufficient information aggregation. To tackle the issue, we introduce a pure transformer-based method, which we refer to as ``Throughout Fusion Transformer (TFormer)'', for sufficient information integration in MSLD. Different from the existing approaches with convolutions, the proposed network leverages transformer as feature extraction backbone, bringing more representative shallow features. We then carefully design a stack of dual-branch hierarchical multi-modal transformer (HMT) blocks to fuse information across different image modalities in a stage-by-stage way. With the aggregated information of image modalities, a multi-modal transformer post-fusion (MTP) block is designed to integrate features across image and non-image data. Such a strategy that information of the image modalities is firstly fused then the heterogeneous ones enables us to better divide and conquer the two major challenges while ensuring inter-modality dynamics are effectively modeled.

- **Summary**: Object pose estimation is a necessary prerequisite for autonomous robotic manipulation, but the presence of symmetry increases the complexity of the pose estimation task. Existing methods for object pose estimation output a single 6D pose. Thus, they lack the ability to reason about symmetries. Lately, modeling object orientation as a non-parametric probability distribution on the SO(3) manifold by neural networks has shown impressive results. However, acquiring large-scale datasets to train pose estimation models remains a bottleneck. To address this limitation, we introduce an automatic pose labeling scheme. Given RGB-D images without object pose annotations and 3D object models, we design a two-stage pipeline consisting of point cloud registration and render-and-compare validation to generate multiple symmetrical pseudo-ground-truth pose labels for each image. Using the generated pose labels, we train an ImplicitPDF model to estimate the likelihood of an orientation hypothesis given an RGB image. An efficient hierarchical sampling of the SO(3) manifold enables tractable generation of the complete set of symmetries at multiple resolutions. During inference, the most likely orientation of the target object is estimated using gradient ascent. We evaluate the proposed automatic pose labeling scheme and the ImplicitPDF model on a photorealistic dataset and the T-Less dataset, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Vector Quantization (VQ) is an appealing model compression method to obtain a tiny model with less accuracy loss. While methods to obtain better codebooks and codes under fixed clustering dimensionality have been extensively studied, optimizations of the vectors in favour of clustering performance are not carefully considered, especially via the reduction of vector dimensionality. This paper reports our recent progress on the combination of dimensionality compression and vector quantization, proposing a Low-Rank Representation Vector Quantization ($\text{LR}^2\text{VQ}$) method that outperforms previous VQ algorithms in various tasks and architectures. $\text{LR}^2\text{VQ}$ joins low-rank representation with subvector clustering to construct a new kind of building block that is directly optimized through end-to-end training over the task loss. Our proposed design pattern introduces three hyper-parameters, the number of clusters $k$, the size of subvectors $m$ and the clustering dimensionality $\tilde{d}$. In our method, the compression ratio could be directly controlled by $m$, and the final accuracy is solely determined by $\tilde{d}$. We recognize $\tilde{d}$ as a trade-off between low-rank approximation error and clustering error and carry out both theoretical analysis and experimental observations that empower the estimation of the proper $\tilde{d}$ before fine-tunning. With a proper $\tilde{d}$, we evaluate $\text{LR}^2\text{VQ}$ with ResNet-18/ResNet-50 on ImageNet classification datasets, achieving 2.8\%/1.0\% top-1 accuracy improvements over the current state-of-the-art VQ-based compression algorithms with 43$\times$/31$\times$ compression factor.

- **Summary**: 3D Morphable models of the human body capture variations among subjects and are useful in reconstruction and editing applications. Current dental models use an explicit mesh scene representation and model only the teeth, ignoring the gum. In this work, we present the first parametric 3D morphable dental model for both teeth and gum. Our model uses an implicit scene representation and is learned from rigidly aligned scans. It is based on a component-wise representation for each tooth and the gum, together with a learnable latent code for each of such components. It also learns a template shape thus enabling several applications such as segmentation, interpolation, and tooth replacement. Our reconstruction quality is on par with the most advanced global implicit representations while enabling novel applications. Project page: https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/DMM/

- **Summary**: Current Dynamic Texture Synthesis (DyTS) models can synthesize realistic videos. However, they require a slow iterative optimization process to synthesize a single fixed-size short video, and they do not offer any post-training control over the synthesis process. We propose Dynamic Neural Cellular Automata (DyNCA), a framework for real-time and controllable dynamic texture synthesis. Our method is built upon the recently introduced NCA models and can synthesize infinitely long and arbitrary-sized realistic video textures in real time. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our model and show that our synthesized videos appear more realistic than the existing results. We improve the SOTA DyTS performance by $2\sim 4$ orders of magnitude. Moreover, our model offers several real-time video controls including motion speed, motion direction, and an editing brush tool. We exhibit our trained models in an online interactive demo that runs on local hardware and is accessible on personal computers and smartphones.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the challenging problem of recovering motion from blur, also known as joint deblurring and interpolation or blur temporal super-resolution. The challenges are twofold: 1) the current methods still leave considerable room for improvement in terms of visual quality even on the synthetic dataset, and 2) poor generalization to real-world data. To this end, we propose a blur interpolation transformer (BiT) to effectively unravel the underlying temporal correlation encoded in blur. Based on multi-scale residual Swin transformer blocks, we introduce dual-end temporal supervision and temporally symmetric ensembling strategies to generate effective features for time-varying motion rendering. In addition, we design a hybrid camera system to collect the first real-world dataset of one-to-many blur-sharp video pairs. Experimental results show that BiT has a significant gain over the state-of-the-art methods on the public dataset Adobe240. Besides, the proposed real-world dataset effectively helps the model generalize well to real blurry scenarios. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zzh-tech/BiT.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation is a challenging task that aims to estimate a transferable model for unlabeled target domain by exploiting source labeled data. Optimal Transport (OT) based methods recently have been proven to be a promising direction for domain adaptation due to their competitive performance. However, most of these methods coarsely aligned source and target distributions, leading to the over-aligned problem where the category-discriminative information is mixed up although domain-invariant representations can be learned. In this paper, we propose a Deep Hierarchical Optimal Transport method (DeepHOT) for unsupervised domain adaptation. The main idea is to use hierarchical optimal transport to learn both domain-invariant and category-discriminative representations by mining the rich structural correlations among domain data. The DeepHOT framework consists of a domain-level OT and an image-level OT, where the latter is used as the ground distance metric for the former. The image-level OT captures structural associations of local image regions that are beneficial to image classification, while the domain-level OT learns domain-invariant representations by leveraging the underlying geometry of domains. However, due to the high computational complexity, the optimal transport based models are limited in some scenarios. To this end, we propose a robust and efficient implementation of the DeepHOT framework by approximating origin OT with sliced Wasserstein distance in image-level OT and using a mini-batch unbalanced optimal transport for domain-level OT. Extensive experiments show that DeepHOT surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in four benchmark datasets. Code will be released on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Micro-expressions have drawn increasing interest lately due to various potential applications. The task is, however, difficult as it incorporates many challenges from the fields of computer vision, machine learning and emotional sciences. Due to the spontaneous and subtle characteristics of micro-expressions, the available training and testing data are limited, which make evaluation complex. We show that data leakage and fragmented evaluation protocols are issues among the micro-expression literature. We find that fixing data leaks can drastically reduce model performance, in some cases even making the models perform similarly to a random classifier. To this end, we go through common pitfalls, propose a new standardized evaluation protocol using facial action units with over 2000 micro-expression samples, and provide an open source library that implements the evaluation protocols in a standardized manner.

- **Summary**: Applying traditional post-hoc attribution methods to segmentation or object detection predictors offers only limited insights, as the obtained feature attribution maps at input level typically resemble the models' predicted segmentation mask or bounding box. In this work, we address the need for more informative explanations for these predictors by proposing the post-hoc eXplainable Artificial Intelligence method L-CRP to generate explanations that automatically identify and visualize relevant concepts learned, recognized and used by the model during inference as well as precisely locate them in input space. Our method therefore goes beyond singular input-level attribution maps and, as an approach based on the recently published Concept Relevance Propagation technique, is efficiently applicable to state-of-the-art black-box architectures in segmentation and object detection, such as DeepLabV3+ and YOLOv6, among others. We verify the faithfulness of our proposed technique by quantitatively comparing different concept attribution methods, and discuss the effect on explanation complexity on popular datasets such as CityScapes, Pascal VOC and MS COCO 2017. The ability to precisely locate and communicate concepts is used to reveal and verify the use of background features, thereby highlighting possible biases of the model.



### Expectation-Maximization Contrastive Learning for Compact Video-and-Language Representations

- **Summary**: Most video-and-language representation learning approaches employ contrastive learning, e.g., CLIP, to project the video and text features into a common latent space according to the semantic similarities of text-video pairs. However, such learned shared latent spaces are not often optimal, and the modality gap between visual and textual representation can not be fully eliminated. In this paper, we propose Expectation-Maximization Contrastive Learning (EMCL) to learn compact video-and-language representations. Specifically, we use the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to find a compact set of bases for the latent space, where the features could be concisely represented as the linear combinations of these bases. Such feature decomposition of video-and-language representations reduces the rank of the latent space, resulting in increased representing power for the semantics. Extensive experiments on three benchmark text-video retrieval datasets prove that our EMCL can learn more discriminative video-and-language representations than previous methods, and significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. More encouragingly, the proposed method can be applied to boost the performance of existing approaches either as a jointly training layer or an out-of-the-box inference module with no extra training, making it easy to be incorporated into any existing methods.

- **Summary**: Our MATE is the first Test-Time-Training (TTT) method designed for 3D data, which makes deep networks trained for point cloud classification robust to distribution shifts occurring in test data. Like existing TTT methods from the 2D image domain, MATE also leverages test data for adaptation. Its test-time objective is that of a Masked Autoencoder: a large portion of each test point cloud is removed before it is fed to the network, tasked with reconstructing the full point cloud. Once the network is updated, it is used to classify the point cloud. We test MATE on several 3D object classification datasets and show that it significantly improves robustness of deep networks to several types of corruptions commonly occurring in 3D point clouds. We show that MATE is very efficient in terms of the fraction of points it needs for the adaptation. It can effectively adapt given as few as 5% of tokens of each test sample, making it extremely lightweight. Our experiments show that MATE also achieves competitive performance by adapting sparsely on the test data, which further reduces its computational overhead, making it ideal for real-time applications.

- **Summary**: Machine learning (ML) can help fight pandemics like COVID-19 by enabling rapid screening of large volumes of images. To perform data analysis while maintaining patient privacy, we create ML models that satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Previous works exploring private COVID-19 models are in part based on small datasets, provide weaker or unclear privacy guarantees, and do not investigate practical privacy. We suggest improvements to address these open gaps. We account for inherent class imbalances and evaluate the utility-privacy trade-off more extensively and over stricter privacy budgets. Our evaluation is supported by empirically estimating practical privacy through black-box Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). The introduced DP should help limit leakage threats posed by MIAs, and our practical analysis is the first to test this hypothesis on the COVID-19 classification task. Our results indicate that needed privacy levels might differ based on the task-dependent practical threat from MIAs. The results further suggest that with increasing DP guarantees, empirical privacy leakage only improves marginally, and DP therefore appears to have a limited impact on practical MIA defense. Our findings identify possibilities for better utility-privacy trade-offs, and we believe that empirical attack-specific privacy estimation can play a vital role in tuning for practical privacy.

- **Summary**: Whereas the ability of deep networks to produce useful predictions on many kinds of data has been amply demonstrated, estimating the reliability of these predictions remains challenging. Sampling approaches such as MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles have emerged as the most popular ones for this purpose. Unfortunately, they require many forward passes at inference time, which slows them down. Sampling-free approaches can be faster but suffer from other drawbacks, such as lower reliability of uncertainty estimates, difficulty of use, and limited applicability to different types of tasks and data.   In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach that is generic and easy to deploy, while producing reliable uncertainty estimates on par with state-of-the-art methods at a significantly lower computational cost. It is predicated on training the network to produce the same output with and without additional information about that output. At inference time, when no prior information is given, we use the network's own prediction as the additional information. We prove that the difference between the two predictions is an accurate uncertainty estimate and demonstrate our approach on various types of tasks and applications.

- **Summary**: While some studies have proven that Swin Transformer (Swin) with window self-attention (WSA) is suitable for single image super-resolution (SR), the plain WSA ignores the broad regions when reconstructing high-resolution images due to a limited receptive field. In addition, many deep learning SR methods suffer from intensive computations. To address these problems, we introduce the N-Gram context to the low-level vision with Transformers for the first time. We define N-Gram as neighboring local windows in Swin, which differs from text analysis that views N-Gram as consecutive characters or words. N-Grams interact with each other by sliding-WSA, expanding the regions seen to restore degraded pixels. Using the N-Gram context, we propose NGswin, an efficient SR network with SCDP bottleneck taking multi-scale outputs of the hierarchical encoder. Experimental results show that NGswin achieves competitive performance while maintaining an efficient structure when compared with previous leading methods. Moreover, we also improve other Swin-based SR methods with the N-Gram context, thereby building an enhanced model: SwinIR-NG. Our improved SwinIR-NG outperforms the current best lightweight SR approaches and establishes state-of-the-art results. Codes are available at https://github.com/rami0205/NGramSwin.



### Place Recognition under Occlusion and Changing Appearance via Disentangled Representations

- **Summary**: Place recognition is a critical and challenging task for mobile robots, aiming to retrieve an image captured at the same place as a query image from a database. Existing methods tend to fail while robots move autonomously under occlusion (e.g., car, bus, truck) and changing appearance (e.g., illumination changes, seasonal variation). Because they encode the image into only one code, entangling place features with appearance and occlusion features. To overcome this limitation, we propose PROCA, an unsupervised approach to decompose the image representation into three codes: a place code used as a descriptor to retrieve images, an appearance code that captures appearance properties, and an occlusion code that encodes occlusion content. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/rover-xingyu/PROCA.

- **Summary**: As the world is still trying to rebuild from the destruction caused by the widespread reach of the COVID-19 virus, and the recent alarming surge of human monkeypox disease outbreaks in numerous countries threatens to become a new global pandemic too. Human monkeypox disease syndromes are quite similar to chickenpox, and measles classic symptoms, with very intricate differences such as skin blisters, which come in diverse forms. Various deep-learning methods have shown promising performances in the image-based diagnosis of COVID-19, tumor cell, and skin disease classification tasks. In this paper, we try to integrate deep transfer-learning-based methods, along with a convolutional block attention module (CBAM), to focus on the relevant portion of the feature maps to conduct an image-based classification of human monkeypox disease. We implement five deep-learning models, VGG19, Xception, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB3, and MobileNetV2, along with integrated channel and spatial attention mechanisms, and perform a comparative analysis among them. An architecture consisting of Xception-CBAM-Dense layers performed better than the other models at classifying human monkeypox and other diseases with a validation accuracy of 83.89%.

- **Summary**: Video-language pre-training is crucial for learning powerful multi-modal representation. However, it typically requires a massive amount of computation. In this paper, we develop SMAUG, an efficient pre-training framework for video-language models. The foundation component in SMAUG is masked autoencoders. Different from prior works which only mask textual inputs, our masking strategy considers both visual and textual modalities, providing a better cross-modal alignment and saving more pre-training costs. On top of that, we introduce a space-time token sparsification module, which leverages context information to further select only "important" spatial regions and temporal frames for pre-training. Coupling all these designs allows our method to enjoy both competitive performances on text-to-video retrieval and video question answering tasks, and much less pre-training costs by 1.9X or more. For example, our SMAUG only needs about 50 NVIDIA A6000 GPU hours for pre-training to attain competitive performances on these two video-language tasks across six popular benchmarks.

- **Summary**: GAN inversion and editing via StyleGAN maps an input image into the embedding spaces ($\mathcal{W}$, $\mathcal{W^+}$, and $\mathcal{F}$) to simultaneously maintain image fidelity and meaningful manipulation. From latent space $\mathcal{W}$ to extended latent space $\mathcal{W^+}$ to feature space $\mathcal{F}$ in StyleGAN, the editability of GAN inversion decreases while its reconstruction quality increases. Recent GAN inversion methods typically explore $\mathcal{W^+}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ rather than $\mathcal{W}$ to improve reconstruction fidelity while maintaining editability. As $\mathcal{W^+}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ are derived from $\mathcal{W}$ that is essentially the foundation latent space of StyleGAN, these GAN inversion methods focusing on $\mathcal{W^+}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ spaces could be improved by stepping back to $\mathcal{W}$. In this work, we propose to first obtain the precise latent code in foundation latent space $\mathcal{W}$. We introduce contrastive learning to align $\mathcal{W}$ and the image space for precise latent code discovery. %The obtaining process is by using contrastive learning to align $\mathcal{W}$ and the image space. Then, we leverage a cross-attention encoder to transform the obtained latent code in $\mathcal{W}$ into $\mathcal{W^+}$ and $\mathcal{F}$, accordingly. Our experiments show that our exploration of the foundation latent space $\mathcal{W}$ improves the representation ability of latent codes in $\mathcal{W^+}$ and features in $\mathcal{F}$, which yields state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity and editability results on the standard benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Models in face of increasing complexity support development of new systems and enterprises. For an efficient procedure, reference models are adapted in order to reach a solution with les overhead which covers all necessary aspects. Here, a key challenge is applying a consistent methodology for the descriptions of such reference designs. This paper presents a holistic approach to describe reference models across different views and levels. Modeling stretches from the requirements and capabilities over their subdivision to services and components up to the realization in processes and data structures. Benefits include an end-to-end traceability of the capability coverage with performance parameters considered already at the starting point of the reference design. This enables focused development while considering design constraints and potential bottlenecks. We demonstrate the approach on the example of the development of a smart robot. Here, our methodology highly supports transferability of designs for the development of further systems.

- **Summary**: We present a Deep-Learning (DL) pipeline developed for the detection and characterization of astronomical sources within simulated Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data cubes. The pipeline is composed of six DL models: a Convolutional Autoencoder for source detection within the spatial domain of the integrated data cubes, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for denoising and peak detection within the frequency domain, and four Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) for source characterization. The combination of spatial and frequency information improves completeness while decreasing spurious signal detection. To train and test the pipeline, we developed a simulation algorithm able to generate realistic ALMA observations, i.e. both sky model and dirty cubes. The algorithm simulates always a central source surrounded by fainter ones scattered within the cube. Some sources were spatially superimposed in order to test the pipeline deblending capabilities. The detection performances of the pipeline were compared to those of other methods and significant improvements in performances were achieved. Source morphologies are detected with subpixel accuracies obtaining mean residual errors of $10^{-3}$ pixel ($0.1$ mas) and $10^{-1}$ mJy/beam on positions and flux estimations, respectively. Projection angles and flux densities are also recovered within $10\%$ of the true values for $80\%$ and $73\%$ of all sources in the test set, respectively. While our pipeline is fine-tuned for ALMA data, the technique is applicable to other interferometric observatories, as SKA, LOFAR, VLBI, and VLTI.

- **Summary**: Change detection (CD) is to decouple object changes (i.e., object missing or appearing) from background changes (i.e., environment variations) like light and season variations in two images captured in the same scene over a long time span, presenting critical applications in disaster management, urban development, etc. In particular, the endless patterns of background changes require detectors to have a high generalization against unseen environment variations, making this task significantly challenging. Recent deep learning-based methods develop novel network architectures or optimization strategies with paired-training examples, which do not handle the generalization issue explicitly and require huge manual pixel-level annotation efforts. In this work, for the first attempt in the CD community, we study the generalization issue of CD from the perspective of data augmentation and develop a novel weakly supervised training algorithm that only needs image-level labels. Different from general augmentation techniques for classification, we propose the background-mixed augmentation that is specifically designed for change detection by augmenting examples under the guidance of a set of background-changing images and letting deep CD models see diverse environment variations. Moreover, we propose the augmented & real data consistency loss that encourages the generalization increase significantly. Our method as a general framework can enhance a wide range of existing deep learning-based detectors. We conduct extensive experiments in two public datasets and enhance four state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the advantages of our method. We release the code at https://github.com/tsingqguo/bgmix.

- **Summary**: To fully uncover the great potential of deep neural networks (DNNs), various learning algorithms have been developed to improve the model's generalization ability. Recently, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) establishes a generic scheme for generalization improvements by minimizing the sharpness measure within a small neighborhood and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, SAM requires two consecutive gradient evaluations for solving the min-max problem and inevitably doubles the training time. In this paper, we resort to filter-wise random weight perturbations (RWP) to decouple the nested gradients in SAM. Different from the small adversarial perturbations in SAM, RWP is softer and allows a much larger magnitude of perturbations. Specifically, we jointly optimize the loss function with random perturbations and the original loss function: the former guides the network towards a wider flat region while the latter helps recover the necessary local information. These two loss terms are complementary to each other and mutually independent. Hence, the corresponding gradients can be efficiently computed in parallel, enabling nearly the same training speed as regular training. As a result, we achieve very competitive performance on CIFAR and remarkably better performance on ImageNet (e.g. $\mathbf{ +1.1\%}$) compared with SAM, but always require half of the training time.

- **Summary**: Image cropping has progressed tremendously under the data-driven paradigm. However, current approaches do not account for the intentions of the user, which is an issue especially when the composition of the input image is complex. Moreover, labeling of cropping data is costly and hence the amount of data is limited, leading to poor generalization performance of current algorithms in the wild. In this work, we take advantage of vision-language models as a foundation for creating robust and user-intentional cropping algorithms. By adapting a transformer decoder with a pre-trained CLIP-based detection model, OWL-ViT, we develop a method to perform cropping with a text or image query that reflects the user's intention as guidance. In addition, our pipeline design allows the model to learn text-conditioned aesthetic cropping with a small cropping dataset, while inheriting the open-vocabulary ability acquired from millions of text-image pairs. We validate our model through extensive experiments on existing datasets as well as a new cropping test set we compiled that is characterized by content ambiguity.

- **Summary**: The appearance of the same object may vary in different scene images due to perspectives and occlusions between objects. Humans can easily identify the same object, even if occlusions exist, by completing the occluded parts based on its canonical image in the memory. Achieving this ability is still a challenge for machine learning, especially under the unsupervised learning setting. Inspired by such an ability of humans, this paper proposes a compositional scene modeling method to infer global representations of canonical images of objects without any supervision. The representation of each object is divided into an intrinsic part, which characterizes globally invariant information (i.e. canonical representation of an object), and an extrinsic part, which characterizes scene-dependent information (e.g., position and size). To infer the intrinsic representation of each object, we employ a patch-matching strategy to align the representation of a potentially occluded object with the canonical representations of objects, and sample the most probable canonical representation based on the category of object determined by amortized variational inference. Extensive experiments are conducted on four object-centric learning benchmarks, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-arts in terms of segmentation and reconstruction, but also achieves good global object identification performance.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved photorealistic novel views synthesis; however, the requirement of accurate camera poses limits its application. Despite analysis-by-synthesis extensions for jointly learning neural 3D representations and registering camera frames exist, they are susceptible to suboptimal solutions if poorly initialized. We propose L2G-NeRF, a Local-to-Global registration method for bundle-adjusting Neural Radiance Fields: first, a pixel-wise flexible alignment, followed by a frame-wise constrained parametric alignment. Pixel-wise local alignment is learned in an unsupervised way via a deep network which optimizes photometric reconstruction errors. Frame-wise global alignment is performed using differentiable parameter estimation solvers on the pixel-wise correspondences to find a global transformation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of high-fidelity reconstruction and resolving large camera pose misalignment. Our module is an easy-to-use plugin that can be applied to NeRF variants and other neural field applications.

- **Summary**: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes that can cause blindness. Although effective treatments exist (notably laser) to slow the progression of the disease and prevent blindness, the best treatment remains prevention through regular check-ups (at least once a year) with an ophthalmologist. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) allows for the visualization of the retinal vascularization, and the choroid at the microvascular level in great detail. This allows doctors to diagnose DR with more precision. In recent years, algorithms for DR diagnosis have emerged along with the development of deep learning and the improvement of computer hardware. However, these usually focus on retina photography. There are no current methods that can automatically analyze DR using Ultra-Wide OCTA (UW-OCTA). The Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Challenge 2022 (DRAC22) provides a standardized UW-OCTA dataset to train and test the effectiveness of various algorithms on three tasks: lesions segmentation, quality assessment, and DR grading. In this paper, we will present our solutions for the three tasks of the DRAC22 challenge. The obtained results are promising and have allowed us to position ourselves in the TOP 5 of the segmentation task, the TOP 4 of the quality assessment task, and the TOP 3 of the DR grading task.

- **Summary**: The domain discrepancy existed between medical images acquired in different situations renders a major hurdle in deploying pre-trained medical image segmentation models for clinical use. Since it is less possible to distribute training data with the pre-trained model due to the huge data size and privacy concern, source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFDA) has recently been increasingly studied based on either pseudo labels or prior knowledge. However, the image features and probability maps used by pseudo label-based SFDA and the consistent prior assumption and the prior prediction network used by prior-guided SFDA may become less reliable when the domain discrepancy is large. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{Pro}mpt learning based \textbf{SFDA} (\textbf{ProSFDA}) method for medical image segmentation, which aims to improve the quality of domain adaption by minimizing explicitly the domain discrepancy. Specifically, in the prompt learning stage, we estimate source-domain images via adding a domain-aware prompt to target-domain images, then optimize the prompt via minimizing the statistic alignment loss, and thereby prompt the source model to generate reliable predictions on (altered) target-domain images. In the feature alignment stage, we also align the features of target-domain images and their styles-augmented counterparts to optimize the source model, and hence push the model to extract compact features. We evaluate our ProSFDA on two multi-domain medical image segmentation benchmarks. Our results indicate that the proposed ProSFDA outperforms substantially other SFDA methods and is even comparable to UDA methods.

- **Summary**: Detecting both known and unknown objects is a fundamental skill for robot manipulation in unstructured environments. Open-set object detection (OSOD) is a promising direction to handle the problem consisting of two subtasks: objects and background separation, and open-set object classification. In this paper, we present Openset RCNN to address the challenging OSOD. To disambiguate unknown objects and background in the first subtask, we propose to use classification-free region proposal network (CF-RPN) which estimates the objectness score of each region purely using cues from object's location and shape preventing overfitting to the training categories. To identify unknown objects in the second subtask, we propose to represent them using the complementary region of known categories in a latent space which is accomplished by a prototype learning network (PLN). PLN performs instance-level contrastive learning to encode proposals to a latent space and builds a compact region centering with a prototype for each known category. Further, we note that the detection performance of unknown objects can not be unbiasedly evaluated on the situation that commonly used object detection datasets are not fully annotated. Thus, a new benchmark is introduced by reorganizing GraspNet-1billion, a robotic grasp pose detection dataset with complete annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the merits of our method. We finally show that our Openset RCNN can endow the robot with an open-set perception ability to support robotic rearrangement tasks in cluttered environments.

- **Summary**: Planes are generally used in 3D reconstruction for depth sensors, such as RGB-D cameras and LiDARs. This paper focuses on the problem of estimating the optimal planes and sensor poses to minimize the point-to-plane distance. The resulting least-squares problem is referred to as plane adjustment (PA) in the literature, which is the counterpart of bundle adjustment (BA) in visual reconstruction. Iterative methods are adopted to solve these least-squares problems. Typically, Newton's method is rarely used for a large-scale least-squares problem, due to the high computational complexity of the Hessian matrix. Instead, methods using an approximation of the Hessian matrix, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method, are generally adopted. This paper challenges this ingrained idea. We adopt the Newton's method to efficiently solve the PA problem. Specifically, given poses, the optimal planes have close-form solutions. Thus we can eliminate planes from the cost function, which significantly reduces the number of variables. Furthermore, as the optimal planes are functions of poses, this method actually ensures that the optimal planes for the current estimated poses can be obtained at each iteration, which benefits the convergence. The difficulty lies in how to efficiently compute the Hessian matrix and the gradient of the resulting cost. This paper provides an efficient solution. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm converges significantly faster than the widely used LM algorithm.

- **Summary**: Multi-task learning is central to many real-world applications. Unfortunately, obtaining labelled data for all tasks is time-consuming, challenging, and expensive. Active Learning (AL) can be used to reduce this burden. Existing techniques typically involve picking images to be annotated and providing annotations for all tasks.   In this paper, we show that it is more effective to select not only the images to be annotated but also a subset of tasks for which to provide annotations at each AL iteration. Furthermore, the annotations that are provided can be used to guess pseudo-labels for the tasks that remain unannotated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several popular multi-task datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has been successfully applied to recognizing both natural images and medical images. However, there remains a gap in recognizing 3D neuroimaging data, especially for psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and depression that have no visible alteration in specific slices. In this study, we propose to process the 3D data by a 2+1D framework so that we can exploit the powerful deep 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) networks pre-trained on the huge ImageNet dataset for 3D neuroimaging recognition. Specifically, 3D volumes of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) metrics (grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) are decomposed to 2D slices according to neighboring voxel positions and inputted to 2D CNN models pre-trained on the ImageNet to extract feature maps from three views (axial, coronal, and sagittal). Global pooling is applied to remove redundant information as the activation patterns are sparsely distributed over feature maps. Channel-wise and slice-wise convolutions are proposed to aggregate the contextual information in the third view dimension unprocessed by the 2D CNN model. Multi-metric and multi-view information are fused for final prediction. Our approach outperforms handcrafted feature-based machine learning, deep feature approach with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and 3D CNN models trained from scratch with better cross-validation results on publicly available Northwestern University Schizophrenia Dataset and the results are replicated on another independent dataset.



### SLLEN: Semantic-aware Low-light Image Enhancement Network

- **Summary**: How to effectively explore semantic feature is vital for low-light image enhancement (LLE). Existing methods usually utilize the semantic feature that is only drawn from the output produced by high-level semantic segmentation (SS) network. However, if the output is not accurately estimated, it would affect the high-level semantic feature (HSF) extraction, which accordingly interferes with LLE. To this end, we develop a simple and effective semantic-aware LLE network (SSLEN) composed of a LLE main-network (LLEmN) and a SS auxiliary-network (SSaN). In SLLEN, LLEmN integrates the random intermediate embedding feature (IEF), i.e., the information extracted from the intermediate layer of SSaN, together with the HSF into a unified framework for better LLE. SSaN is designed to act as a SS role to provide HSF and IEF. Moreover, thanks to a shared encoder between LLEmN and SSaN, we further propose an alternating training mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between them. Unlike currently available approaches, the proposed SLLEN is able to fully lever the semantic information, e.g., IEF, HSF, and SS dataset, to assist LLE, thereby leading to a more promising enhancement performance. Comparisons between the proposed SLLEN and other state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the superiority of SLLEN with respect to LLE quality over all the comparable alternatives.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of finding a continuous and non-rigid matching between a 2D contour and a 3D mesh. While such problems can be solved to global optimality by finding a shortest path in the product graph between both shapes, existing solutions heavily rely on unrealistic prior assumptions to avoid degenerate solutions (e.g. knowledge to which region of the 3D shape each point of the 2D contour is matched). To address this, we propose a novel 2D-3D shape matching formalism based on the conjugate product graph between the 2D contour and the 3D shape. Doing so allows us for the first time to consider higher-order costs, i.e. defined for edge chains, as opposed to costs defined for single edges. This offers substantially more flexibility, which we utilise to incorporate a local rigidity prior. By doing so, we effectively circumvent degenerate solutions and thereby obtain smoother and more realistic matchings, even when using only a one-dimensional feature descriptor. Overall, our method finds globally optimal and continuous 2D-3D matchings, has the same asymptotic complexity as previous solutions, produces state-of-the-art results for shape matching and is even capable of matching partial shapes. Our code is publicly available (https://github.com/paul0noah/sm-2D3D).

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is getting increased attention for processing sensitive, distributed datasets common to domains such as healthcare. Instead of directly training classification models on these datasets, recent works have considered training data generators capable of synthesising a new dataset which is not protected by any privacy restrictions. Thus, the synthetic data can be made available to anyone, which enables further evaluation of machine learning architectures and research questions off-site. As an additional layer of privacy-preservation, differential privacy can be introduced into the training process. We propose DPD-fVAE, a federated Variational Autoencoder with Differentially-Private Decoder, to synthesise a new, labelled dataset for subsequent machine learning tasks. By synchronising only the decoder component with FL, we can reduce the privacy cost per epoch and thus enable better data generators. In our evaluation on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CelebA, we show the benefits of DPD-fVAE and report competitive performance to related work in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance and accuracy of classifiers trained on the synthesised dataset.

- **Summary**: Performing super-resolution of a depth image using the guidance from an RGB image is a problem that concerns several fields, such as robotics, medical imaging, and remote sensing. While deep learning methods have achieved good results in this problem, recent work highlighted the value of combining modern methods with more formal frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel approach which combines guided anisotropic diffusion with a deep convolutional network and advances the state of the art for guided depth super-resolution. The edge transferring/enhancing properties of the diffusion are boosted by the contextual reasoning capabilities of modern networks, and a strict adjustment step guarantees perfect adherence to the source image. We achieve unprecedented results in three commonly used benchmarks for guided depth super-resolution. The performance gain compared to other methods is the largest at larger scales, such as x32 scaling. Code (https://github.com/prs-eth/Diffusion-Super-Resolution) for the proposed method is available to promote reproducibility of our results.

- **Summary**: Biofouling is a major challenge for sustainable shipping, filter membranes, heat exchangers, and medical devices. The development of fouling-resistant coatings requires the evaluation of their effectiveness. Such an evaluation is usually based on the assessment of fouling progression after different exposure times to the target medium (e.g., salt water). The manual assessment of macrofouling requires expert knowledge about local fouling communities due to high variances in phenotypical appearance, has single-image sampling inaccuracies for certain species, and lacks spatial information. Here we present an approach for automatic image-based macrofouling analysis. We created a dataset with dense labels prepared from field panel images and propose a convolutional network (adapted U-Net) for the semantic segmentation of different macrofouling classes. The establishment of macrofouling localization allows for the generation of a successional model which enables the determination of direct surface attachment and in-depth epibiotic studies.

- **Summary**: We present Deformable Voxel Grids (DVGs) for 3D shapes comparison and processing. It consists of a voxel grid which is deformed to approximate the silhouette of a shape, via energy-minimization. By interpreting the DVG as a local coordinates system, it provides a better embedding space than a regular voxel grid, since it is adapted to the geometry of the shape. It also allows to deform the shape by moving the control points of the DVG, in a similar manner to the Free Form Deformation, but with easier interpretability of the control points positions. After proposing a computation scheme of the energies compatible with meshes and pointclouds, we demonstrate the use of DVGs in a variety of applications: correspondences via cubification, style transfer, shape retrieval and PCA deformations. The first two require no learning and can be readily run on any shapes in a matter of minutes on modest hardware. As for the last two, they require to first optimize DVGs on a collection of shapes, which amounts to a pre-processing step. Then, determining PCA coordinates is straightforward and brings a few parameters to deform a shape.

- **Summary**: We present Tensor4D, an efficient yet effective approach to dynamic scene modeling. The key of our solution is an efficient 4D tensor decomposition method so that the dynamic scene can be directly represented as a 4D spatio-temporal tensor. To tackle the accompanying memory issue, we decompose the 4D tensor hierarchically by projecting it first into three time-aware volumes and then nine compact feature planes. In this way, spatial information over time can be simultaneously captured in a compact and memory-efficient manner. When applying Tensor4D for dynamic scene reconstruction and rendering, we further factorize the 4D fields to different scales in the sense that structural motions and dynamic detailed changes can be learned from coarse to fine. The effectiveness of our method is validated on both synthetic and real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that our method is able to achieve high-quality dynamic reconstruction and rendering from sparse-view camera rigs or even a monocular camera. The code and dataset will be released at https://liuyebin.com/tensor4d/tensor4d.html.

- **Summary**: Annotating data for supervised learning is expensive and tedious, and we want to do as little of it as possible. To make the most of a given "annotation budget" we can turn to active learning (AL) which aims to identify the most informative samples in a dataset for annotation. Active learning algorithms are typically uncertainty-based or diversity-based. Both have seen success in image classification, but fall short when it comes to object detection. We hypothesise that this is because: (1) it is difficult to quantify uncertainty for object detection as it consists of both localisation and classification, where some classes are harder to localise, and others are harder to classify; (2) it is difficult to measure similarities for diversity-based AL when images contain different numbers of objects. We propose a two-stage active learning algorithm Plug and Play Active Learning (PPAL) that overcomes these difficulties. It consists of (1) Difficulty Calibrated Uncertainty Sampling, in which we used a category-wise difficulty coefficient that takes both classification and localisation into account to re-weight object uncertainties for uncertainty-based sampling; (2) Category Conditioned Matching Similarity to compute the similarities of multi-instance images as ensembles of their instance similarities. PPAL is highly generalisable because it makes no change to model architectures or detector training pipelines. We benchmark PPAL on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets using different detector architectures and show that our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Visual object tracking is essential to intelligent robots. Most existing approaches have ignored the online latency that can cause severe performance degradation during real-world processing. Especially for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where robust tracking is more challenging and onboard computation is limited, the latency issue can be fatal. In this work, we present a simple framework for end-to-end latency-aware tracking, i.e., end-to-end predictive visual tracking (PVT++). Unlike existing solutions that naively append Kalman Filters after trackers, PVT++ can be jointly optimized, so that it takes not only motion information but can also leverage the rich visual knowledge in most pre-trained tracker models for robust prediction. Besides, to bridge the training-evaluation domain gap, we propose a relative motion factor, empowering PVT++ to generalize to the challenging and complex UAV tracking scenes. These careful designs have made the small-capacity lightweight PVT++ a widely effective solution. Additionally, this work presents an extended latency-aware evaluation benchmark for assessing an any-speed tracker in the online setting. Empirical results on a robotic platform from the aerial perspective show that PVT++ can achieve significant performance gain on various trackers and exhibit higher accuracy than prior solutions, largely mitigating the degradation brought by latency.

- **Summary**: Recently, remote respiratory rate measurement techniques gained much attention as they were developed to overcome the limitations of device-based classical methods and manual counting. Many approaches for RR extraction from the video stream of the visible light camera were proposed, including the pixel intensity changes method. In this paper, we propose a new method for 1D profile creation for pixel intensity changes-based method, which significantly increases the algorithm's performance. Additional accuracy gain is obtained via a new method of motion signals grouping presented in this work. We introduce several changes to the standard pipeline, which enables real-time continuous RR monitoring and allows applications in the human-computer interaction systems. Evaluation results on two internal and one public datasets showed 0.7 BPM, 0.6 BPM, and 1.4 BPM MAE, respectively.

- **Summary**: We revisit and advance visual prompting (VP), an input prompting technique for vision tasks. VP can reprogram a fixed, pre-trained source model to accomplish downstream tasks in the target domain by simply incorporating universal prompts (in terms of input perturbation patterns) into downstream data points. Yet, it remains elusive why VP stays effective even given a ruleless label mapping (LM) between the source classes and the target classes. Inspired by the above, we ask: How is LM interrelated with VP? And how to exploit such a relationship to improve its accuracy on target tasks? We peer into the influence of LM on VP and provide an affirmative answer that a better 'quality' of LM (assessed by mapping precision and explanation) can consistently improve the effectiveness of VP. This is in contrast to the prior art where the factor of LM was missing. To optimize LM, we propose a new VP framework, termed ILM-VP (iterative label mapping-based visual prompting), which automatically re-maps the source labels to the target labels and progressively improves the target task accuracy of VP. Further, when using a contrastive language-image pretrained (CLIP) model, we propose to integrate an LM process to assist the text prompt selection of CLIP and to improve the target task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VP methods. As highlighted below, we show that when reprogramming an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-18 to 13 target tasks, our method outperforms baselines by a substantial margin, e.g., 7.9% and 6.7% accuracy improvements in transfer learning to the target Flowers102 and CIFAR100 datasets. Besides, our proposal on CLIP-based VP provides 13.7% and 7.1% accuracy improvements on Flowers102 and DTD respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/ILM-VP.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the first significant object detection framework, NeRF-RPN, which directly operates on NeRF. Given a pre-trained NeRF model, NeRF-RPN aims to detect all bounding boxes of objects in a scene. By exploiting a novel voxel representation that incorporates multi-scale 3D neural volumetric features, we demonstrate it is possible to regress the 3D bounding boxes of objects in NeRF directly without rendering the NeRF at any viewpoint. NeRF-RPN is a general framework and can be applied to detect objects without class labels. We experimented NeRF-RPN with various backbone architectures, RPN head designs and loss functions. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to estimate high quality 3D bounding boxes. To facilitate future research in object detection for NeRF, we built a new benchmark dataset which consists of both synthetic and real-world data with careful labeling and clean up. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lyclyc52/NeRF_RPN.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Visual perception enables robots to perceive the environment. Visual data is processed using computer vision algorithms that are usually time-expensive and require powerful devices to process the visual data in real-time, which is unfeasible for open-field robots with limited energy. This work benchmarks the performance of different heterogeneous platforms for object detection in real-time. This research benchmarks three architectures: embedded GPU -- Graphical Processing Units (such as NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2 GB and 4 GB, and NVIDIA Jetson TX2), TPU -- Tensor Processing Unit (such as Coral Dev Board TPU), and DPU -- Deep Learning Processor Unit (such as in AMD-Xilinx ZCU104 Development Board, and AMD-Xilinx Kria KV260 Starter Kit). Method: The authors used the RetinaNet ResNet-50 fine-tuned using the natural VineSet dataset. After the trained model was converted and compiled for target-specific hardware formats to improve the execution efficiency. Conclusions and Results: The platforms were assessed in terms of performance of the evaluation metrics and efficiency (time of inference). Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) were the slowest devices, running at 3 FPS to 5 FPS, and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) were the fastest devices, running at 14 FPS to 25 FPS. The efficiency of the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is irrelevant and similar to NVIDIA Jetson TX2. TPU and GPU are the most power-efficient, consuming about 5W. The performance differences, in the evaluation metrics, across devices are irrelevant and have an F1 of about 70 % and mean Average Precision (mAP) of about 60 %.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) coupled with GANs represent a promising direction in the area of 3D reconstruction from a single view, owing to their ability to efficiently model arbitrary topologies. Recent work in this area, however, has mostly focused on synthetic datasets where exact ground-truth poses are known, and has overlooked pose estimation, which is important for certain downstream applications such as augmented reality (AR) and robotics. We introduce a principled end-to-end reconstruction framework for natural images, where accurate ground-truth poses are not available. Our approach recovers an SDF-parameterized 3D shape, pose, and appearance from a single image of an object, without exploiting multiple views during training. More specifically, we leverage an unconditional 3D-aware generator, to which we apply a hybrid inversion scheme where a model produces a first guess of the solution which is then refined via optimization. Our framework can de-render an image in as few as 10 steps, enabling its use in practical scenarios. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on a variety of real and synthetic benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Segmenting unseen objects from images is a critical perception skill that a robot needs to acquire. In robot manipulation, it can facilitate a robot to grasp and manipulate unseen objects. Mean shift clustering is a widely used method for image segmentation tasks. However, the traditional mean shift clustering algorithm is not differentiable, making it difficult to integrate it into an end-to-end neural network training framework. In this work, we propose the Mean Shift Mask Transformer (MSMFormer), a new transformer architecture that simulates the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mean shift clustering algorithm, allowing for the joint training and inference of both the feature extractor and the clustering. Its central component is a hypersphere attention mechanism, which updates object queries on a hypersphere. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply MSMFormer to unseen object instance segmentation. Our experiments show that MSMFormer achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for unseen object instance segmentation.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-trained models have shown promising open-world performance for both vision and language tasks. However, their transferred capacity on 3D point clouds is still limited and only constrained to the classification task. In this paper, we first collaborate CLIP and GPT to be a unified 3D open-world learner, named as PointCLIP V2, which fully unleashes their potential for zero-shot 3D classification, segmentation, and detection. To better align 3D data with the pre-trained language knowledge, PointCLIP V2 contains two key designs. For the visual end, we prompt CLIP via a shape projection module to generate more realistic depth maps, narrowing the domain gap between projected point clouds with natural images. For the textual end, we prompt the GPT model to generate 3D-specific text as the input of CLIP's textual encoder. Without any training in 3D domains, our approach significantly surpasses PointCLIP by +42.90%, +40.44%, and +28.75% accuracy on three datasets for zero-shot 3D classification. On top of that, V2 can be extended to few-shot 3D classification, zero-shot 3D part segmentation, and 3D object detection in a simple manner, demonstrating our generalization ability for unified 3D open-world learning.

- **Summary**: Image registration is an essential but challenging task in medical image computing, especially for echocardiography, where the anatomical structures are relatively noisy compared to other imaging modalities. Traditional (non-learning) registration approaches rely on the iterative optimization of a similarity metric which is usually costly in time complexity. In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based image registration methods have shown good effectiveness. In the meantime, recent studies show that the attention-based model (e.g., Transformer) can bring superior performance in pattern recognition tasks. In contrast, whether the superior performance of the Transformer comes from the long-winded architecture or is attributed to the use of patches for dividing the inputs is unclear yet. This work introduces three patch-based frameworks for image registration using MLPs and transformers. We provide experiments on 2D-echocardiography registration to answer the former question partially and provide a benchmark solution. Our results on a large public 2D echocardiography dataset show that the patch-based MLP/Transformer model can be effectively used for unsupervised echocardiography registration. They demonstrate comparable and even better registration performance than a popular CNN registration model. In particular, patch-based models better preserve volume changes in terms of Jacobian determinants, thus generating robust registration fields with less unrealistic deformation. Our results demonstrate that patch-based learning methods, whether with attention or not, can perform high-performance unsupervised registration tasks with adequate time and space complexity.

- **Summary**: The image captioning task is typically realized by an auto-regressive method that decodes the text tokens one by one. We present a diffusion-based captioning model, dubbed the name DDCap, to allow more decoding flexibility. Unlike image generation, where the output is continuous and redundant with a fixed length, texts in image captions are categorical and short with varied lengths. Therefore, naively applying the discrete diffusion model to text decoding does not work well, as shown in our experiments. To address the performance gap, we propose several key techniques including best-first inference, concentrated attention mask, text length prediction, and image-free training. On COCO without additional caption pre-training, it achieves a CIDEr score of 117.8, which is +5.0 higher than the auto-regressive baseline with the same architecture in the controlled setting. It also performs +26.8 higher CIDEr score than the auto-regressive baseline (230.3 v.s.203.5) on a caption infilling task. With 4M vision-language pre-training images and the base-sized model, we reach a CIDEr score of 125.1 on COCO, which is competitive to the best well-developed auto-regressive frameworks.

- **Summary**: We present Perceiver-VL, a vision-and-language framework that efficiently handles high-dimensional multimodal inputs such as long videos and text. Powered by the iterative latent cross-attention of Perceiver, our framework scales with linear complexity, in contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention used in many state-of-the-art transformer-based models. To further improve the efficiency of our framework, we also study applying LayerDrop on cross-attention layers and introduce a mixed-stream architecture for cross-modal retrieval. We evaluate Perceiver-VL on diverse video-text and image-text benchmarks, where Perceiver-VL achieves the lowest GFLOPs and latency while maintaining competitive performance. In addition, we also provide comprehensive analyses of various aspects of our framework, including pretraining data, scalability of latent size and input size, dropping cross-attention layers at inference to reduce latency, modality aggregation strategy, positional encoding, and weight initialization strategy.

- **Summary**: We present ESLAM, an efficient implicit neural representation method for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). ESLAM reads RGB-D frames with unknown camera poses in a sequential manner and incrementally reconstructs the scene representation while estimating the current camera position in the scene. We incorporate the latest advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into a SLAM system, resulting in an efficient and accurate dense visual SLAM method. Our scene representation consists of multi-scale axis-aligned perpendicular feature planes and shallow decoders that, for each point in the continuous space, decode the interpolated features into Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) and RGB values. Our extensive experiments on three standard datasets, Replica, ScanNet, and TUM RGB-D show that ESLAM improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction and camera localization of state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM methods by more than 50%, while it runs up to 10 times faster and does not require any pre-training.

- **Summary**: Prompt Tuning, conditioning on task-specific learned prompt vectors, has emerged as a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method for adapting large pretrained vision-language models to multiple downstream tasks. However, existing approaches usually consider learning prompt vectors for each task independently from scratch, thereby failing to exploit the rich shareable knowledge across different vision-language tasks. In this paper, we propose multitask vision-language prompt tuning (MVLPT), which incorporates cross-task knowledge into prompt tuning for vision-language models. Specifically, (i) we demonstrate the effectiveness of learning a single transferable prompt from multiple source tasks to initialize the prompt for each target task; (ii) we show many target tasks can benefit each other from sharing prompt vectors and thus can be jointly learned via multitask prompt tuning. We benchmark the proposed MVLPT using three representative prompt tuning methods, namely text prompt tuning, visual prompt tuning, and the unified vision-language prompt tuning. Results in 20 vision tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms all single-task baseline prompt tuning methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on the few-shot ELEVATER benchmarks and cross-task generalization benchmarks. To understand where the cross-task knowledge is most effective, we also conduct a large-scale study on task transferability with 20 vision tasks in 400 combinations for each prompt tuning method. It shows that the most performant MVLPT for each prompt tuning method prefers different task combinations and many tasks can benefit each other, depending on their visual similarity and label similarity.

- **Summary**: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to discover novel categories in unlabelled datasets using knowledge learned from labelled samples. Previous studies argued that parametric classifiers are prone to overfitting to seen categories, and endorsed using a non-parametric classifier formed with semi-supervised k-means. However, in this study, we investigate the failure of parametric classifiers, verify the effectiveness of previous design choices when high-quality supervision is available, and identify unreliable pseudo-labels as a key problem. We demonstrate that two prediction biases exist: the classifier tends to predict seen classes more often, and produces an imbalanced distribution across seen and novel categories. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective parametric classification method that benefits from entropy regularisation, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple GCD benchmarks and shows strong robustness to unknown class numbers. We hope the investigation and proposed simple framework can serve as a strong baseline to facilitate future studies in this field. Our code is available at: https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SimGCD.

- **Summary**: Vision and Language (VL) models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot performance in a variety of tasks. However, some aspects of complex language understanding still remain a challenge. We introduce the collective notion of Structured Vision&Language Concepts (SVLC) which includes object attributes, relations, and states which are present in the text and visible in the image. Recent studies have shown that even the best VL models struggle with SVLC. A possible way of fixing this issue is by collecting dedicated datasets for teaching each SVLC type, yet this might be expensive and time-consuming. Instead, we propose a more elegant data-driven approach for enhancing VL models' understanding of SVLCs that makes more effective use of existing VL pre-training datasets and does not require any additional data. While automatic understanding of image structure still remains largely unsolved, language structure is much better modeled and understood, allowing for its effective utilization in teaching VL models. In this paper, we propose various techniques based on language structure understanding that can be used to manipulate the textual part of off-the-shelf paired VL datasets. VL models trained with the updated data exhibit a significant improvement of up to 15% in their SVLC understanding with only a mild degradation in their zero-shot capabilities both when training from scratch or fine-tuning a pre-trained model.

- **Summary**: We introduce PLIKS (Pseudo-Linear Inverse Kinematic Solver) for reconstruction of a 3D mesh of the human body from a single 2D image. Current techniques directly regress the shape, pose, and translation of a parametric model from an input image through a non-linear mapping with minimal flexibility to any external influences. We approach the task as a model-in-the-loop optimization problem. PLIKS is built on a linearized formulation of the parametric SMPL model. Using PLIKS, we can analytically reconstruct the human model via 2D pixel-aligned vertices. This enables us with the flexibility to use accurate camera calibration information when available. PLIKS offers an easy way to introduce additional constraints such as shape and translation. We present quantitative evaluations which confirm that PLIKS achieves more accurate reconstruction with greater than 10% improvement compared to other state-of-the-art methods with respect to the standard 3D human pose and shape benchmarks while also obtaining a reconstruction error improvement of 12.9 mm on the newer AGORA dataset.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently emerged as a powerful representation to synthesize photorealistic novel views. While showing impressive performance, it relies on the availability of dense input views with highly accurate camera poses, thus limiting its application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce Sparse Pose Adjusting Radiance Field (SPARF), to address the challenge of novel-view synthesis given only few wide-baseline input images (as low as 3) with noisy camera poses. Our approach exploits multi-view geometry constraints in order to jointly learn the NeRF and refine the camera poses. By relying on pixel matches extracted between the input views, our multi-view correspondence objective enforces the optimized scene and camera poses to converge to a global and geometrically accurate solution. Our depth consistency loss further encourages the reconstructed scene to be consistent from any viewpoint. Our approach sets a new state of the art in the sparse-view regime on multiple challenging datasets.

- **Summary**: We propose a new framework for conditional image synthesis from semantic layouts of any precision levels, ranging from pure text to a 2D semantic canvas with precise shapes. More specifically, the input layout consists of one or more semantic regions with free-form text descriptions and adjustable precision levels, which can be set based on the desired controllability. The framework naturally reduces to text-to-image (T2I) at the lowest level with no shape information, and it becomes segmentation-to-image (S2I) at the highest level. By supporting the levels in-between, our framework is flexible in assisting users of different drawing expertise and at different stages of their creative workflow. We introduce several novel techniques to address the challenges coming with this new setup, including a pipeline for collecting training data; a precision-encoded mask pyramid and a text feature map representation to jointly encode precision level, semantics, and composition information; and a multi-scale guided diffusion model to synthesize images. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect a test dataset containing user-drawn layouts with diverse scenes and styles. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality images following the layout at given precision, and compares favorably against existing methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models exhibited tremendous progress in image and video generation, exceeding GANs in quality and diversity. However, they are usually trained on very large datasets and are not naturally adapted to manipulate a given input image or video. In this paper we show how this can be resolved by training a diffusion model on a single input image or video. Our image/video-specific diffusion model (SinFusion) learns the appearance and dynamics of the single image or video, while utilizing the conditioning capabilities of diffusion models. It can solve a wide array of image/video-specific manipulation tasks. In particular, our model can learn from few frames the motion and dynamics of a single input video. It can then generate diverse new video samples of the same dynamic scene, extrapolate short videos into long ones (both forward and backward in time) and perform video upsampling. Most of these tasks are not realizable by current video-specific generation methods.

- **Summary**: In-hand object reorientation is necessary for performing many dexterous manipulation tasks, such as tool use in unstructured environments that remain beyond the reach of current robots. Prior works built reorientation systems that assume one or many of the following specific circumstances: reorienting only specific objects with simple shapes, limited range of reorientation, slow or quasistatic manipulation, the need for specialized and costly sensor suites, simulation-only results, and other constraints which make the system infeasible for real-world deployment. We overcome these limitations and present a general object reorientation controller that is trained using reinforcement learning in simulation and evaluated in the real world. Our system uses readings from a single commodity depth camera to dynamically reorient complex objects by any amount in real time. The controller generalizes to novel objects not used during training. It is successful in the most challenging test: the ability to reorient objects in the air held by a downward-facing hand that must counteract gravity during reorientation. The results demonstrate that the policy transfer from simulation to the real world can be accomplished even for dynamic and contact-rich tasks. Lastly, our hardware only uses open-source components that cost less than five thousand dollars. Such construction makes it possible to replicate the work and democratize future research in dexterous manipulation.

- **Summary**: Realistic long-horizon tasks like image-goal navigation involve exploratory and exploitative phases. Assigned with an image of the goal, an embodied agent must explore to discover the goal, i.e., search efficiently using learned priors. Once the goal is discovered, the agent must accurately calibrate the last-mile of navigation to the goal. As with any robust system, switches between exploratory goal discovery and exploitative last-mile navigation enable better recovery from errors. Following these intuitive guide rails, we propose SLING to improve the performance of existing image-goal navigation systems. Entirely complementing prior methods, we focus on last-mile navigation and leverage the underlying geometric structure of the problem with neural descriptors. With simple but effective switches, we can easily connect SLING with heuristic, reinforcement learning, and neural modular policies. On a standardized image-goal navigation benchmark (Hahn et al. 2021), we improve performance across policies, scenes, and episode complexity, raising the state-of-the-art from 45% to 55% success rate. Beyond photorealistic simulation, we conduct real-robot experiments in three physical scenes and find these improvements to transfer well to real environments.

- **Summary**: Multi-spectral imagery is invaluable for remote sensing due to different spectral signatures exhibited by materials that often appear identical in greyscale and RGB imagery. Paired with modern deep learning methods, this modality has great potential utility in a variety of remote sensing applications, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster recovery efforts. State-of-the-art deep learning methods have greatly benefited from large-scale annotations like in ImageNet, but existing MSI image datasets lack annotations at a similar scale. As an alternative to transfer learning on such data with few annotations, we apply complex-valued co-domain symmetric models to classify real-valued MSI images. Our experiments on 8-band xView data show that our ultra-lean model trained on xView from scratch without data augmentations can outperform ResNet with data augmentation and modified transfer learning on xView. Our work is the first to demonstrate the value of complex-valued deep learning on real-valued MSI data.

- **Summary**: Reducing the quantity of annotations required for supervised training is vital when labels are scarce and costly. This reduction is especially important for semantic segmentation tasks involving 3D datasets that are often significantly smaller and more challenging to annotate than their image-based counterparts. Self-supervised pre-training on large unlabelled datasets is one way to reduce the amount of manual annotations needed. Previous work has focused on pre-training with point cloud data exclusively; this approach often requires two or more registered views. In the present work, we combine image and point cloud modalities, by first learning self-supervised image features and then using these features to train a 3D model. By incorporating image data, which is often included in many 3D datasets, our pre-training method only requires a single scan of a scene. We demonstrate that our pre-training approach, despite using single scans, achieves comparable performance to other multi-scan, point cloud-only methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, convolutional neural network has shown good performance in many image processing and computer vision tasks. However, a standard CNN model is not invariant to image rotations. In fact, even slight rotation of an input image will seriously degrade its performance. This shortcoming precludes the use of CNN in some practical scenarios. Thus, in this paper, we focus on designing convolutional layer with good rotation invariance. Specifically, based on a simple rotation-invariant coordinate system, we propose a new convolutional operation, called Rotation-Invariant Coordinate Convolution (RIC-C). Without additional trainable parameters and data augmentation, RIC-C is naturally invariant to arbitrary rotations around the input center. Furthermore, we find the connection between RIC-C and deformable convolution, and propose a simple but efficient approach to implement RIC-C using Pytorch. By replacing all standard convolutional layers in a CNN with the corresponding RIC-C, a RIC-CNN can be derived. Using MNIST dataset, we first evaluate the rotation invariance of RIC-CNN and compare its performance with most of existing rotation-invariant CNN models. It can be observed that RIC-CNN achieves the state-of-the-art classification on the rotated test dataset of MNIST. Then, we deploy RIC-C to VGG, ResNet and DenseNet, and conduct the classification experiments on two real image datasets. Also, a shallow CNN and the corresponding RIC-CNN are trained to extract image patch descriptors, and we compare their performance in patch verification. These experimental results again show that RIC-C can be easily used as drop in replacement for standard convolutions, and greatly enhances the rotation invariance of CNN models designed for different applications.

- **Summary**: This paper describes a new technique for finding disentangled semantic directions in the latent space of StyleGAN. Our method identifies meaningful orthogonal subspaces that allow editing of one human face attribute, while minimizing undesired changes in other attributes. Our model is capable of editing a single attribute in multiple directions, resulting in a range of possible generated images. We compare our scheme with three state-of-the-art models and show that our method outperforms them in terms of face editing and disentanglement capabilities. Additionally, we suggest quantitative measures for evaluating attribute separation and disentanglement, and exhibit the superiority of our model with respect to those measures.

- **Summary**: JPEG is arguably the most popular image coding format, achieving high compression ratios via lossy quantization that may create visual artifacts degradation. Numerous attempts to remove these artifacts were conceived over the years, and common to most of these is the use of deterministic post-processing algorithms that optimize some distortion measure (e.g., PSNR, SSIM). In this paper we propose a different paradigm for JPEG artifact correction: Our method is stochastic, and the objective we target is high perceptual quality -- striving to obtain sharp, detailed and visually pleasing reconstructed images, while being consistent with the compressed input. These goals are achieved by training a stochastic conditional generator (conditioned on the compressed input), accompanied by a theoretically well-founded loss term, resulting in a sampler from the posterior distribution. Our solution offers a diverse set of plausible and fast reconstructions for a given input with perfect consistency. We demonstrate our scheme's unique properties and its superiority to a variety of alternative methods on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets.

- **Summary**: Mixed reality (MR) is a key technology which promises to change the future of warfare. An MR hybrid of physical outdoor environments and virtual military training will enable engagements with long distance enemies, both real and simulated. To enable this technology, a large-scale 3D model of a physical environment must be maintained based on live sensor observations. 3D reconstruction algorithms should utilize the low cost and pervasiveness of video camera sensors, from both overhead and soldier-level perspectives. Mapping speed and 3D quality can be balanced to enable live MR training in dynamic environments. Given these requirements, we survey several 3D reconstruction algorithms for large-scale mapping for military applications given only live video. We measure 3D reconstruction performance from common structure from motion, visual-SLAM, and photogrammetry techniques. This includes the open source algorithms COLMAP, ORB-SLAM3, and NeRF using Instant-NGP. We utilize the autonomous driving academic benchmark KITTI, which includes both dashboard camera video and lidar produced 3D ground truth. With the KITTI data, our primary contribution is a quantitative evaluation of 3D reconstruction computational speed when considering live video.

- **Summary**: Much recent work has been devoted to the problem of ensuring that a neural network's confidence scores match the true probability of being correct, i.e. the calibration problem. Of note, it was found that training with focal loss leads to better calibration than cross-entropy while achieving similar level of accuracy \cite{mukhoti2020}. This success stems from focal loss regularizing the entropy of the model's prediction (controlled by the parameter $\gamma$), thereby reining in the model's overconfidence. Further improvement is expected if $\gamma$ is selected independently for each training sample (Sample-Dependent Focal Loss (FLSD-53) \cite{mukhoti2020}). However, FLSD-53 is based on heuristics and does not generalize well. In this paper, we propose a calibration-aware adaptive focal loss called AdaFocal that utilizes the calibration properties of focal (and inverse-focal) loss and adaptively modifies $\gamma_t$ for different groups of samples based on $\gamma_{t-1}$ from the previous step and the knowledge of model's under/over-confidence on the validation set. We evaluate AdaFocal on various image recognition and one NLP task, covering a wide variety of network architectures, to confirm the improvement in calibration while achieving similar levels of accuracy. Additionally, we show that models trained with AdaFocal achieve a significant boost in out-of-distribution detection.

- **Summary**: Polyp segmentation is a crucial step towards computer-aided diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, most of the polyp segmentation methods require pixel-wise annotated datasets. Annotated datasets are tedious and time-consuming to produce, especially for physicians who must dedicate their time to their patients. We tackle this issue by proposing a novel framework that can be trained using only weakly annotated images along with exploiting unlabeled images. To this end, we propose three ideas to address this problem, more specifically our contributions are: 1) a novel sparse foreground loss that suppresses false positives and improves weakly-supervised training, 2) a batch-wise weighted consistency loss utilizing predicted segmentation maps from identical networks trained using different initialization during semi-supervised training, 3) a deformable transformer encoder neck for feature enhancement by fusing information across levels and flexible spatial locations.   Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits of our ideas on five challenging datasets outperforming some state-of-the-art fully supervised models. Also, our framework can be utilized to fine-tune models trained on natural image segmentation datasets drastically improving their performance for polyp segmentation and impressively demonstrating superior performance to fully supervised fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Digital twins are virtual interactive models of the real world, exhibiting identical behavior and properties. In surgical applications, computational analysis from digital twins can be used, for example, to enhance situational awareness. Methods: We present a digital twin framework for skull-base surgeries, named Twin-S, which can be integrated within various image-guided interventions seamlessly. Twin-S combines high-precision optical tracking and real-time simulation. We rely on rigorous calibration routines to ensure that the digital twin representation precisely mimics all real-world processes. Twin-S models and tracks the critical components of skull-base surgery, including the surgical tool, patient anatomy, and surgical camera. Significantly, Twin-S updates and reflects real-world drilling of the anatomical model in frame rate. Results: We extensively evaluate the accuracy of Twin-S, which achieves an average 1.39 mm error during the drilling process. We further illustrate how segmentation masks derived from the continuously updated digital twin can augment the surgical microscope view in a mixed reality setting, where bone requiring ablation is highlighted to provide surgeons additional situational awareness. Conclusion: We present Twin-S, a digital twin environment for skull-base surgery. Twin-S tracks and updates the virtual model in real-time given measurements from modern tracking technologies. Future research on complementing optical tracking with higher-precision vision-based approaches may further increase the accuracy of Twin-S.

- **Summary**: Due to the lack of training labels and the difficulty of annotating, dealing with adverse driving conditions such as nighttime has posed a huge challenge to the perception system of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, adapting knowledge from a labelled daytime domain to an unlabelled nighttime domain has been widely researched. In addition to labelled daytime datasets, existing nighttime datasets usually provide nighttime images with corresponding daytime reference images captured at nearby locations for reference. The key challenge is to minimize the performance gap between the two domains. In this paper, we propose LoopDA for domain adaptive nighttime semantic segmentation. It consists of self-loops that result in reconstructing the input data using predicted semantic maps, by rendering them into the encoded features. In a warm-up training stage, the self-loops comprise of an inner-loop and an outer-loop, which are responsible for intra-domain refinement and inter-domain alignment, respectively. To reduce the impact of day-night pose shifts, in the later self-training stage, we propose a co-teaching pipeline that involves an offline pseudo-supervision signal and an online reference-guided signal `DNA' (Day-Night Agreement), bringing substantial benefits to enhance nighttime segmentation. Our model outperforms prior methods on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets for semantic segmentation. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/fy-vision/LoopDA.

- **Summary**: Skin cancer is a fatal disease that takes a heavy toll over human lives annually. The colored skin images show a significant degree of resemblance between different skin lesions such as melanoma and nevus, making identification and diagnosis more challenging. Melanocytic nevi may mature to cause fatal melanoma. Therefore, the current management protocol involves the removal of those nevi that appear intimidating. However, this necessitates resilient classification paradigms for classifying benign and malignant melanocytic nevi. Early diagnosis necessitates a dependable automated system for melanocytic nevi classification to render diagnosis efficient, timely, and successful. An automated classification algorithm is proposed in the given research. A neural network previously-trained on a separate problem statement is leveraged in this technique for classifying melanocytic nevus images. The suggested method uses BigTransfer (BiT), a ResNet-based transfer learning approach for classifying melanocytic nevi as malignant or benign. The results obtained are compared to that of current techniques, and the new method's classification rate is proven to outperform that of existing methods.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing 3D human avatars interacting realistically with a scene is an important problem with applications in AR/VR, video games and robotics. Towards this goal, we address the task of generating a virtual human -- hands and full body -- grasping everyday objects. Existing methods approach this problem by collecting a 3D dataset of humans interacting with objects and training on this data. However, 1) these methods do not generalize to different object positions and orientations, or to the presence of furniture in the scene, and 2) the diversity of their generated full-body poses is very limited. In this work, we address all the above challenges to generate realistic, diverse full-body grasps in everyday scenes without requiring any 3D full-body grasping data. Our key insight is to leverage the existence of both full-body pose and hand grasping priors, composing them using 3D geometrical constraints to obtain full-body grasps. We empirically validate that these constraints can generate a variety of feasible human grasps that are superior to baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively.

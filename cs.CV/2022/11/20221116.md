- **Summary**: Advances in neural networks enable tackling complex computer vision tasks such as depth estimation of outdoor scenes at unprecedented accuracy. Promising research has been done on depth estimation. However, current efforts are computationally resource-intensive and do not consider the resource constraints of autonomous devices, such as robots and drones. In this work, we present a fast and battery-efficient approach for depth estimation. Our approach devises model-agnostic curriculum-based learning for depth estimation. Our experiments show that the accuracy of our model performs on par with the state-of-the-art models, while its response time outperforms other models by 71%.

- **Summary**: Predicting the future motion of dynamic agents is of paramount importance to ensuring safety and assessing risks in motion planning for autonomous robots. In this study, we propose a two-stage motion prediction method, called R-Pred, designed to effectively utilize both scene and interaction context using a cascade of the initial trajectory proposal and trajectory refinement networks. The initial trajectory proposal network produces M trajectory proposals corresponding to the M modes of the future trajectory distribution. The trajectory refinement network enhances each of the M proposals using 1) tube-query scene attention (TQSA) and 2) proposal-level interaction attention (PIA) mechanisms. TQSA uses tube-queries to aggregate local scene context features pooled from proximity around trajectory proposals of interest. PIA further enhances the trajectory proposals by modeling inter-agent interactions using a group of trajectory proposals selected by their distances from neighboring agents. Our experiments conducted on Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that the proposed refinement network provides significant performance improvements compared to the single-stage baseline and that R-Pred achieves state-of-the-art performance in some categories of the benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are compelling techniques for modeling dynamic 3D scenes from 2D image collections. These volumetric representations would be well suited for synthesizing novel facial expressions but for two problems. First, deformable NeRFs are object agnostic and model holistic movement of the scene: they can replay how the motion changes over time, but they cannot alter it in an interpretable way. Second, controllable volumetric representations typically require either time-consuming manual annotations or 3D supervision to provide semantic meaning to the scene. We propose a controllable neural representation for face self-portraits (CoNFies), that solves both of these problems within a common framework, and it can rely on automated processing. We use automated facial action recognition (AFAR) to characterize facial expressions as a combination of action units (AU) and their intensities. AUs provide both the semantic locations and control labels for the system. CoNFies outperformed competing methods for novel view and expression synthesis in terms of visual and anatomic fidelity of expressions.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of deep generative models (such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Auto-encoders), AI-synthesized images of the human face are now of such high quality that humans can hardly distinguish them from pristine ones. Although existing detection methods have shown high performance in specific evaluation settings, e.g., on images from seen models or on images without real-world post-processings, they tend to suffer serious performance degradation in real-world scenarios where testing images can be generated by more powerful generation models or combined with various post-processing operations. To address this issue, we propose a Global and Local Feature Fusion (GLFF) to learn rich and discriminative representations by combining multi-scale global features from the whole image with refined local features from informative patches for face forgery detection. GLFF fuses information from two branches: the global branch to extract multi-scale semantic features and the local branch to select informative patches for detailed local artifacts extraction. Due to the lack of a face forgery dataset simulating real-world applications for evaluation, we further create a challenging face forgery dataset, named DeepFakeFaceForensics (DF^3), which contains 6 state-of-the-art generation models and a variety of post-processing techniques to approach the real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state-of-the-art methods on the proposed DF^3 dataset and three other open-source datasets.

- **Summary**: Keypoint annotation in point clouds is an important task for 3D reconstruction, object tracking and alignment, in particular in deformable or moving scenes. In the context of agriculture robotics, it is a critical task for livestock automation to work toward condition assessment or behaviour recognition. In this work, we propose a novel approach for semantic keypoint annotation in point clouds, by reformulating the keypoint extraction as a regression problem of the distance between the keypoints and the rest of the point cloud. We use the distance on the point cloud manifold mapped into a radial basis function (RBF), which is then learned using an encoder-decoder architecture. Special consideration is given to the data augmentation specific to multi-depth-camera systems by considering noise over the extrinsic calibration and camera frame dropout. Additionally, we investigate computationally efficient non-rigid deformation methods that can be applied to animal point clouds. Our method is tested on data collected in the field, on moving beef cattle, with a calibrated system of multiple hardware-synchronised RGB-D cameras.

- **Summary**: Vulnerability and risk assessment of neighborhoods is essential for effective disaster preparedness. Existing traditional systems, due to dependency on time-consuming and cost-intensive field surveying, do not provide a scalable way to decipher warnings and assess the precise extent of the risk at a hyper-local level. In this work, machine learning was used to automate the process of identifying dwellings and their type to build a potentially more effective disaster vulnerability assessment system. First, satellite imageries of low-income settlements and vulnerable areas in India were used to identify 7 different dwelling types. Specifically, we formulated the dwelling type classification as a semantic segmentation task and trained a U-net based neural network model, namely TernausNet, with the data we collected. Then a risk score assessment model was employed, using the determined dwelling type along with an inundation model of the regions. The entire pipeline was deployed to multiple locations prior to natural hazards in India in 2020. Post hoc ground-truth data from those regions was collected to validate the efficacy of this model which showed promising performance. This work can aid disaster response organizations and communities at risk by providing household-level risk information that can inform preemptive actions.

- **Summary**: Image harmonization is a critical task in computer vision, which aims to adjust the foreground to make it compatible with the background. Recent works mainly focus on using global transformations (i.e., normalization and color curve rendering) to achieve visual consistency. However, these models ignore local visual consistency and their huge model sizes limit their harmonization ability on edge devices. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical dynamic network (HDNet) to adapt features from local to global view for better feature transformation in efficient image harmonization. Inspired by the success of various dynamic models, local dynamic (LD) module and mask-aware global dynamic (MGD) module are proposed in this paper. Specifically, LD matches local representations between the foreground and background regions based on semantic similarities, then adaptively adjust every foreground local representation according to the appearance of its $K$-nearest neighbor background regions. In this way, LD can produce more realistic images at a more fine-grained level, and simultaneously enjoy the characteristic of semantic alignment. The MGD effectively applies distinct convolution to the foreground and background, learning the representations of foreground and background regions as well as their correlations to the global harmonization, facilitating local visual consistency for the images much more efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HDNet significantly reduces the total model parameters by more than 80\% compared to previous methods, while still attaining state-of-the-art performance on the popular iHarmony4 dataset. Notably, the HDNet achieves a 4\% improvement in PSNR and a 19\% reduction in MSE compared to the prior state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Understanding of spatial attributes is central to effective 3D radiology image analysis where crop-based learning is the de facto standard. Given an image patch, its core spatial properties (e.g., position & orientation) provide helpful priors on expected object sizes, appearances, and structures through inherent anatomical consistencies. Spatial correspondences, in particular, can effectively gauge semantic similarities between inter-image regions, while their approximate extraction requires no annotations or overbearing computational costs. However, recent 3D contrastive learning approaches either neglect correspondences or fail to maximally capitalize on them. To this end, we propose an extensible 3D contrastive framework (Spade, for Spatial Debiasing) that leverages extracted correspondences to select more effective positive & negative samples for representation learning. Our method learns both globally invariant and locally equivariant representations with downstream segmentation in mind. We also propose separate selection strategies for global & local scopes that tailor to their respective representational requirements. Compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches, Spade shows notable improvements on three downstream segmentation tasks (CT Abdominal Organ, CT Heart, MR Heart).

- **Summary**: Person text-image matching, also known as text based person search, aims to retrieve images of specific pedestrians using text descriptions. Although person text-image matching has made great research progress, existing methods still face two challenges. First, the lack of interpretability of text features makes it challenging to effectively align them with their corresponding image features. Second, the same pedestrian image often corresponds to multiple different text descriptions, and a single text description can correspond to multiple different images of the same identity. The diversity of text descriptions and images makes it difficult for a network to extract robust features that match the two modalities. To address these problems, we propose a person text-image matching method by embedding text-feature interpretability and an external attack node. Specifically, we improve the interpretability of text features by providing them with consistent semantic information with image features to achieve the alignment of text and describe image region features.To address the challenges posed by the diversity of text and the corresponding person images, we treat the variation caused by diversity to features as caused by perturbation information and propose a novel adversarial attack and defense method to solve it. In the model design, graph convolution is used as the basic framework for feature representation and the adversarial attacks caused by text and image diversity on feature extraction is simulated by implanting an additional attack node in the graph convolution layer to improve the robustness of the model against text and image diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of text-pedestrian image matching over existing methods. The source code of the method is published at

- **Summary**: Direct time-of-flight (dToF) sensors are promising for next-generation on-device 3D sensing. However, limited by manufacturing capabilities in a compact module, the dToF data has a low spatial resolution (e.g., $\sim 20\times30$ for iPhone dToF), and it requires a super-resolution step before being passed to downstream tasks. In this paper, we solve this super-resolution problem by fusing the low-resolution dToF data with the corresponding high-resolution RGB guidance. Unlike the conventional RGB-guided depth enhancement approaches, which perform the fusion in a per-frame manner, we propose the first multi-frame fusion scheme to mitigate the spatial ambiguity resulting from the low-resolution dToF imaging. In addition, dToF sensors provide unique depth histogram information for each local patch, and we incorporate this dToF-specific feature in our network design to further alleviate spatial ambiguity. To evaluate our models on complex dynamic indoor environments and to provide a large-scale dToF sensor dataset, we introduce DyDToF, the first synthetic RGB-dToF video dataset that features dynamic objects and a realistic dToF simulator following the physical imaging process. We believe the methods and dataset are beneficial to a broad community as dToF depth sensing is becoming mainstream on mobile devices.

- **Summary**: Recent neural architecture search (NAS) works proposed training-free metrics to rank networks which largely reduced the search cost in NAS. In this paper, we revisit these training-free metrics and find that: (1) the number of parameters (\#Param), which is the most straightforward training-free metric, is overlooked in previous works but is surprisingly effective, (2) recent training-free metrics largely rely on the \#Param information to rank networks. Our experiments show that the performance of recent training-free metrics drops dramatically when the \#Param information is not available. Motivated by these observations, we argue that metrics less correlated with the \#Param are desired to provide additional information for NAS. We propose a light-weight training-based metric which has a weak correlation with the \#Param while achieving better performance than training-free metrics at a lower search cost. Specifically, on DARTS search space, our method completes searching directly on ImageNet in only 2.6 GPU hours and achieves a top-1/top-5 error rate of 24.1\%/7.1\%, which is competitive among state-of-the-art NAS methods.

- **Summary**: Contrastive self-supervised learning is widely employed in visual recognition for geographic image data (remote or proximal sensing), but because of landscape heterogeneity, models can show disparate performance across spatial units. In this work, we consider fairness risks in such contrastive pre-training; we show learnt representations present large performance gaps across selected sensitive groups: urban and rural areas for satellite images and city GDP level for street view images on downstream semantic segmentation. We propose fair dense representations with contrastive learning (FairDCL) to address the issue, a multi-level latent space de-biasing objective, using a novel dense sensitive attribute encoding technique to constrain spurious local information disparately distributes across groups. The method achieves improved downstream task fairness and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for the absence of a fairness-accuracy trade-off. Image embedding evaluation and ablation studies further demonstrate effectiveness of FairDCL. As fairness in geographic imagery is a nascent topic without existing state-of-the-art data or results, our work motivates researchers to consider fairness metrics in such applications, especially reinforced by our results showing no accuracy degradation.

### Interclass Prototype Relation for Few-Shot Segmentation

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Traditional semantic segmentation requires a large labeled image dataset and can only be predicted within predefined classes. To solve this problem, few-shot segmentation, which requires only a handful of annotations for the new target class, is important. However, with few-shot segmentation, the target class data distribution in the feature space is sparse and has low coverage because of the slight variations in the sample data. Setting the classification boundary that properly separates the target class from other classes is an impossible task. In particular, it is difficult to classify classes that are similar to the target class near the boundary. This study proposes the Interclass Prototype Relation Network (IPRNet), which improves the separation performance by reducing the similarity between other classes. We conducted extensive experiments with Pascal-5i and COCO-20i and showed that IPRNet provides the best segmentation performance compared with previous research.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly effective at tackling many real-world tasks. However, their wide adoption in mission-critical contexts is hampered by two major weaknesses - their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and their opaqueness. The former raises concerns about the security and generalization of DNNs in real-world conditions, whereas the latter impedes users' trust in their output. In this research, we (1) examine the effect of adversarial robustness on interpretability and (2) present a novel approach for improving the interpretability of DNNs that is based on regularization of neural activation sensitivity. We evaluate the interpretability of models trained using our method to that of standard models and models trained using state-of-the-art adversarial robustness techniques. Our results show that adversarially robust models are superior to standard models and that models trained using our proposed method are even better than adversarially robust models in terms of interpretability.



### Towards Long-Tailed 3D Detection

- **Summary**: Contemporary autonomous vehicle (AV) benchmarks have advanced techniques for training 3D detectors, particularly on large-scale lidar data. Surprisingly, although semantic class labels naturally follow a long-tailed distribution, contemporary benchmarks focus on only a few common classes (e.g., pedestrian and car) and neglect many rare classes in-the-tail (e.g., debris and stroller). However, AVs must still detect rare classes to ensure safe operation. Moreover, semantic classes are often organized within a hierarchy, e.g., tail classes such as child and construction-worker are arguably subclasses of pedestrian. However, such hierarchical relationships are often ignored, which may lead to misleading estimates of performance and missed opportunities for algorithmic innovation. We address these challenges by formally studying the problem of Long-Tailed 3D Detection (LT3D), which evaluates on all classes, including those in-the-tail. We evaluate and innovate upon popular 3D detection codebases, such as CenterPoint and PointPillars, adapting them for LT3D. We develop hierarchical losses that promote feature sharing across common-vs-rare classes, as well as improved detection metrics that award partial credit to "reasonable" mistakes respecting the hierarchy (e.g., mistaking a child for an adult). Finally, we point out that fine-grained tail class accuracy is particularly improved via multimodal fusion of RGB images with LiDAR; simply put, small fine-grained classes are challenging to identify from sparse (lidar) geometry alone, suggesting that multimodal cues are crucial to long-tailed 3D detection. Our modifications improve accuracy by 5% AP on average for all classes, and dramatically improve AP for rare classes (e.g., stroller AP improves from 3.6 to 31.6)!

- **Summary**: Although neural networks have seen tremendous success as predictive models in a variety of domains, they can be overly confident in their predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To be viable for safety-critical applications, like autonomous vehicles, neural networks must accurately estimate their epistemic or model uncertainty, achieving a level of system self-awareness. Techniques for epistemic uncertainty quantification often require OOD data during training or multiple neural network forward passes during inference. These approaches may not be suitable for real-time performance on high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, existing methods lack interpretability of the estimated uncertainty, which limits their usefulness both to engineers for further system development and to downstream modules in the autonomy stack. We propose the use of evidential deep learning to estimate the epistemic uncertainty over a low-dimensional, interpretable latent space in a trajectory prediction setting. We introduce an interpretable paradigm for trajectory prediction that distributes the uncertainty among the semantic concepts: past agent behavior, road structure, and social context. We validate our approach on real-world autonomous driving data, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new method for mapping a 3D point cloud to the latent space of a 3D generative adversarial network. Our generative model for 3D point clouds is based on SP-GAN, a state-of-the-art sphere-guided 3D point cloud generator. We derive an efficient way to encode an input 3D point cloud to the latent space of the SP-GAN. Our point cloud encoder can resolve the point ordering issue during inversion, and thus can determine the correspondences between points in the generated 3D point cloud and those in the canonical sphere used by the generator. We show that our method outperforms previous GAN inversion methods for 3D point clouds, achieving state-of-the-art results both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Video Super-Resolution (VSR) aims to recover sequences of high-resolution (HR) frames from low-resolution (LR) frames. Previous methods mainly utilize temporally adjacent frames to assist the reconstruction of target frames. However, in the real world, there is a lot of irrelevant information in adjacent frames of videos with fast scene switching, these VSR methods cannot adaptively distinguish and select useful information. In contrast, with a transformer structure suitable for temporal tasks, we devise a novel adaptive scenario video super-resolution method. Specifically, we use optical flow to label the patches in each video frame, only calculate the attention of patches with the same label. Then select the most relevant label among them to supplement the spatial-temporal information of the target frame. This design can directly make the supplementary information come from the same scene as much as possible. We further propose a cross-scale feature aggregation module to better handle the scale variation problem. Compared with other video super-resolution methods, our method not only achieves significant performance gains on single-scene videos but also has better robustness on cross-scene datasets.

- **Summary**: Feature matching is crucial in visual localization, where 2D-3D correspondence plays a major role in determining the accuracy of camera pose. A sufficient number of well-distributed 2D-3D correspondences is essential for accurate pose estimation due to noise. However, existing 2D-3D feature matching methods rely on finding nearest neighbors in the feature space and removing outliers using hand-crafted heuristics, which may lead to potential matches being missed or the correct matches being filtered out. In this work, we propose a novel method called Geometry-Aided Matching (GAM), which incorporates both appearance information and geometric context to address this issue and to improve 2D-3D feature matching. GAM can greatly boost the recall of 2D-3D matches while maintaining high precision. We apply GAM to a new hierarchical visual localization pipeline and show that GAM can effectively improve the robustness and accuracy of localization. Extensive experiments show that GAM can find more real matches than hand-crafted heuristics and learning baselines. Our proposed localization method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple visual localization datasets. Experiments on Cambridge Landmarks dataset show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods and is six times faster than the top-performed method.

- **Summary**: Incorporating various mass shapes and sizes in training deep learning architectures has made breast mass segmentation challenging. Moreover, manual segmentation of masses of irregular shapes is time-consuming and error-prone. Though Deep Neural Network has shown outstanding performance in breast mass segmentation, it fails in segmenting micro-masses. In this paper, we propose a novel U-net-shaped transformer-based architecture, called Swin-SFTNet, that outperforms state-of-the-art architectures in breast mammography-based micro-mass segmentation. Firstly to capture the global context, we designed a novel Spatial Feature Expansion and Aggregation Block(SFEA) that transforms sequential linear patches into a structured spatial feature. Next, we combine it with the local linear features extracted by the swin transformer block to improve overall accuracy. We also incorporate a novel embedding loss that calculates similarities between linear feature embeddings of the encoder and decoder blocks. With this approach, we achieve higher segmentation dice over the state-of-the-art by 3.10% on CBIS-DDSM, 3.81% on InBreast, and 3.13% on CBIS pre-trained model on the InBreast test data set.

- **Summary**: Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) has attracted significant attention from the research community. Many recent LNL methods rely on the assumption that clean samples tend to have "small loss". However, this assumption always fails to generalize to some real-world cases with imbalanced subpopulations, i.e., training subpopulations varying in sample size or recognition difficulty. Therefore, recent LNL methods face the risk of misclassifying those "informative" samples (e.g., hard samples or samples in the tail subpopulations) into noisy samples, leading to poor generalization performance.   To address the above issue, we propose a novel LNL method to simultaneously deal with noisy labels and imbalanced subpopulations. It first leverages sample correlation to estimate samples' clean probabilities for label correction and then utilizes corrected labels for Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to further improve the robustness. Specifically, in contrast to previous works using classification loss as the selection criterion, we introduce a feature-based metric that takes the sample correlation into account for estimating samples' clean probabilities. Then, we refurbish the noisy labels using the estimated clean probabilities and the pseudo-labels from the model's predictions. With refurbished labels, we use DRO to train the model to be robust to subpopulation imbalance. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that our technique can consistently improve current state-of-the-art robust learning paradigms against noisy labels, especially when encountering imbalanced subpopulations.

- **Summary**: It is believed that human vision system (HVS) consists of pre-attentive process and attention process when performing salient object detection (SOD). Based on this fact, we propose a four-stage framework for SOD, in which the first two stages match the \textbf{P}re-\textbf{A}ttentive process consisting of general feature extraction (GFE) and feature preprocessing (FP), and the last two stages are corresponding to \textbf{A}ttention process containing saliency feature extraction (SFE) and the feature aggregation (FA), namely \textbf{PAANet}. According to the pre-attentive process, the GFE stage applies the fully-trained backbone and needs no further finetuning for different datasets. This modification can greatly increase the training speed. The FP stage plays the role of finetuning but works more efficiently because of its simpler structure and fewer parameters. Moreover, in SFE stage we design for saliency feature extraction a novel contrast operator, which works more semantically in contrast with the traditional convolution operator when extracting the interactive information between the foreground and its surroundings. Interestingly, this contrast operator can be cascaded to form a deeper structure and extract higher-order saliency more effective for complex scene. Comparative experiments with the state-of-the-art methods on 5 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

- **Summary**: Medical images are widely used in clinical practice for diagnosis. Automatically generating interpretable medical reports can reduce radiologists' burden and facilitate timely care. However, most existing approaches to automatic report generation require sufficient labeled data for training. In addition, the learned model can only generate reports for the training classes, lacking the ability to adapt to previously unseen novel diseases. To this end, we propose a lesion guided explainable few weak-shot medical report generation framework that learns correlation between seen and novel classes through visual and semantic feature alignment, aiming to generate medical reports for diseases not observed in training. It integrates a lesion-centric feature extractor and a Transformer-based report generation module. Concretely, the lesion-centric feature extractor detects the abnormal regions and learns correlations between seen and novel classes with multi-view (visual and lexical) embeddings. Then, features of the detected regions and corresponding embeddings are concatenated as multi-view input to the report generation module for explainable report generation, including text descriptions and corresponding abnormal regions detected in the images. We conduct experiments on FFA-IR, a dataset providing explainable annotations, showing that our framework outperforms others on report generation for novel diseases.

- **Summary**: Visual entailment (VE) is to recognize whether the semantics of a hypothesis text can be inferred from the given premise image, which is one special task among recent emerged vision and language understanding tasks. Currently, most of the existing VE approaches are derived from the methods of visual question answering. They recognize visual entailment by quantifying the similarity between the hypothesis and premise in the content semantic features from multi modalities. Such approaches, however, ignore the VE's unique nature of relation inference between the premise and hypothesis. Therefore, in this paper, a new architecture called AlignVE is proposed to solve the visual entailment problem with a relation interaction method. It models the relation between the premise and hypothesis as an alignment matrix. Then it introduces a pooling operation to get feature vectors with a fixed size. Finally, it goes through the fully-connected layer and normalization layer to complete the classification. Experiments show that our alignment-based architecture reaches 72.45\% accuracy on SNLI-VE dataset, outperforming previous content-based models under the same settings.

- **Summary**: In the field of planting fruit trees, pre-harvest estimation of fruit yield is important for fruit storage and price evaluation. However, considering the cost, the yield of each tree cannot be assessed by directly picking the immature fruit. Therefore, the problem is a very difficult task. In this paper, a fruit counting and yield assessment method based on computer vision is proposed for citrus fruit trees as an example. Firstly, images of single fruit trees from different angles are acquired and the number of fruits is detected using a deep Convolutional Neural Network model YOLOv5, and the model is compressed using a knowledge distillation method. Then, a linear regression method is used to model yield-related features and evaluate yield. Experiments show that the proposed method can accurately count fruits and approximate the yield.

- **Summary**: The assumption of a uniform light color distribution is no longer applicable in scenes that have multiple light colors. Most color constancy methods are designed to deal with a single light color, and thus are erroneous when applied to multiple light colors. The spatial variability in multiple light colors causes the color constancy problem to be more challenging and requires the extraction of local surface/light information. Motivated by this, we introduce a multi-task learning method to discount multiple light colors in a single input image. To have better cues of the local surface/light colors under multiple light color conditions, we design a novel multi-task learning framework. Our framework includes auxiliary tasks of achromatic-pixel detection and surface-color similarity prediction, providing better cues for local light and surface colors, respectively. Moreover, to ensure that our model maintains the constancy of surface colors regardless of the variations of light colors, a novel local surface color feature preservation scheme is developed. We demonstrate that our model achieves 47.1% improvement (from 4.69 mean angular error to 2.48) compared to a state-of-the-art multi-illuminant color constancy method on a multi-illuminant dataset (LSMI).

- **Summary**: This technical report describes the CONE approach for Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ) Challenge in ECCV 2022. We leverage our model CONE, an efficient window-centric COarse-to-fiNE alignment framework. Specifically, CONE dynamically slices the long video into candidate windows via a sliding window approach. Centering at windows, CONE (1) learns the inter-window (coarse-grained) semantic variance through contrastive learning and speeds up inference by pre-filtering the candidate windows relevant to the NL query, and (2) conducts intra-window (fine-grained) candidate moments ranking utilizing the powerful multi-modal alignment ability of the contrastive vision-text pre-trained model EgoVLP. On the blind test set, CONE achieves 15.26 and 9.24 for R1@IoU=0.3 and R1@IoU=0.5, respectively.

- **Summary**: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an indispensable tool in the clinic. Consequently, automatic volume-of-interest segmentation based on multi-parametric MR imaging is crucial for computer-aided disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis monitoring. Despite the extensive studies conducted in deep learning-based medical image analysis, further investigations are still required to effectively exploit the information provided by different imaging parameters. How to fuse the information is a key question in this field. Here, we propose an uncertainty-aware multi-parametric MR image feature fusion method to fully exploit the information for enhanced 3D image segmentation. Uncertainties in the independent predictions of individual modalities are utilized to guide the fusion of multi-modal image features. Extensive experiments on two datasets, one for brain tissue segmentation and the other for abdominal multi-organ segmentation, have been conducted, and our proposed method achieves better segmentation performance when compared to existing models.

- **Summary**: Recent unsupervised multi-object detection models have shown impressive performance improvements, largely attributed to novel architectural inductive biases. Unfortunately, they may produce suboptimal object encodings for downstream tasks. To overcome this, we propose to exploit object motion and continuity, i.e., objects do not pop in and out of existence. This is accomplished through two mechanisms: (i) providing priors on the location of objects through integration of optical flow, and (ii) a contrastive object continuity loss across consecutive image frames. Rather than developing an explicit deep architecture, the resulting Motion and Object Continuity (MOC) scheme can be instantiated using any baseline object detection model. Our results show large improvements in the performances of a SOTA model in terms of object discovery, convergence speed and overall latent object representations, particularly for playing Atari games. Overall, we show clear benefits of integrating motion and object continuity for downstream tasks, moving beyond object representation learning based only on reconstruction.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Deep Learning has shown good results in the Single Image Superresolution Reconstruction (SISR) task, thus becoming the most widely used methods in this field. The SISR task is a typical task to solve an uncertainty problem. Therefore, it is often challenging to meet the requirements of High-quality sampling, fast Sampling, and diversity of details and texture after Sampling simultaneously in a SISR task.It leads to model collapse, lack of details and texture features after Sampling, and too long Sampling time in High Resolution (HR) image reconstruction methods. This paper proposes a Diffusion Probability model for Latent features (LDDPM) to solve these problems. Firstly, a Conditional Encoder is designed to effectively encode Low-Resolution (LR) images, thereby reducing the solution space of reconstructed images to improve the performance of reconstructed images. Then, the Normalized Flow and Multi-modal adversarial training are used to model the denoising distribution with complex Multi-modal distribution so that the Generative Modeling ability of the model can be improved with a small number of Sampling steps. Experimental results on mainstream datasets demonstrate that our proposed model reconstructs more realistic HR images and obtains better PSNR and SSIM performance compared to existing SISR tasks, thus providing a new idea for SISR tasks.

- **Summary**: 3D hand-object pose estimation is the key to the success of many computer vision applications. The main focus of this task is to effectively model the interaction between the hand and an object. To this end, existing works either rely on interaction constraints in a computationally-expensive iterative optimization, or consider only a sparse correlation between sampled hand and object keypoints. In contrast, we propose a novel dense mutual attention mechanism that is able to model fine-grained dependencies between the hand and the object. Specifically, we first construct the hand and object graphs according to their mesh structures. For each hand node, we aggregate features from every object node by the learned attention and vice versa for each object node. Thanks to such dense mutual attention, our method is able to produce physically plausible poses with high quality and real-time inference speed. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on large benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Compared to query-based black-box attacks, transfer-based black-box attacks do not require any information of the attacked models, which ensures their secrecy. However, most existing transfer-based approaches rely on ensembling multiple models to boost the attack transferability, which is time- and resource-intensive, not to mention the difficulty of obtaining diverse models on the same task. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on the single-model transfer-based black-box attack on object detection, utilizing only one model to achieve a high-transferability adversarial attack on multiple black-box detectors. Specifically, we first make observations on the patch optimization process of the existing method and propose an enhanced attack framework by slightly adjusting its training strategies. Then, we analogize patch optimization with regular model optimization, proposing a series of self-ensemble approaches on the input data, the attacked model, and the adversarial patch to efficiently make use of the limited information and prevent the patch from overfitting. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can be applied with multiple classical base attack methods (e.g., PGD and MIM) to greatly improve the black-box transferability of the well-optimized patch on multiple mainstream detectors, meanwhile boosting white-box performance.

- **Summary**: Despite recent progress in Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), several obstacles such as occlusions, similar objects, and complex scenes remain an open challenge. Meanwhile, a systematic study of the cost-performance tradeoff for the popular tracking-by-detection paradigm is still lacking. This paper introduces SMILEtrack, an innovative object tracker that effectively addresses these challenges by integrating an efficient object detector with a Siamese network-based Similarity Learning Module (SLM). The technical contributions of SMILETrack are twofold. First, we propose an SLM that calculates the appearance similarity between two objects, overcoming the limitations of feature descriptors in Separate Detection and Embedding (SDE) models. The SLM incorporates a Patch Self-Attention (PSA) block inspired by the vision Transformer, which generates reliable features for accurate similarity matching. Second, we develop a Similarity Matching Cascade (SMC) module with a novel GATE function for robust object matching across consecutive video frames, further enhancing MOT performance. Together, these innovations help SMILETrack achieve an improved trade-off between the cost ({\em e.g.}, running speed) and performance (e.g., tracking accuracy) over several existing state-of-the-art benchmarks, including the popular BYTETrack method.

- **Summary**: A major challenge in medical image analysis is the automated detection of biomarkers from neuroimaging data. Traditional approaches, often based on image registration, are limited in capturing the high variability of cortical organisation across individuals. Deep learning methods have been shown to be successful in overcoming this difficulty, and some of them have even outperformed medical professionals on certain datasets. In this paper, we apply a deep neural network to analyse the cortical surface data of neonates, derived from the publicly available Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Our goal is to identify neurodevelopmental biomarkers and to predict gestational age at birth based on these biomarkers. Using scans of preterm neonates acquired around the term-equivalent age, we were able to investigate the impact of preterm birth on cortical growth and maturation during late gestation. Besides reaching state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, the proposed model has much fewer parameters than the baselines, and its error stays low on both unregistered and registered cortical surfaces.

- **Summary**: The handling of long videos with complex and occluded sequences has recently emerged as a new challenge in the video instance segmentation (VIS) community. However, existing methods have limitations in addressing this challenge. We argue that the biggest bottleneck in current approaches is the discrepancy between training and inference. To effectively bridge this gap, we propose a Generalized framework for VIS, namely GenVIS, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks without designing complicated architectures or requiring extra post-processing. The key contribution of GenVIS is the learning strategy, which includes a query-based training pipeline for sequential learning with a novel target label assignment. Additionally, we introduce a memory that effectively acquires information from previous states. Thanks to the new perspective, which focuses on building relationships between separate frames or clips, GenVIS can be flexibly executed in both online and semi-online manner. We evaluate our approach on popular VIS benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on YouTube-VIS 2019/2021/2022 and Occluded VIS (OVIS). Notably, we greatly outperform the state-of-the-art on the long VIS benchmark (OVIS), improving 5.6 AP with ResNet-50 backbone. Code is available at https://github.com/miranheo/GenVIS.

- **Summary**: Wireless tags are increasingly used to track and identify common items of interest such as retail goods, food, medicine, clothing, books, documents, keys, equipment, and more. At the same time, there is a need for labelled visual data featuring such items for the purpose of training object detection and recognition models for robots operating in homes, warehouses, stores, libraries, pharmacies, and so on. In this paper, we ask: can we leverage the tracking and identification capabilities of such tags as a basis for a large-scale automatic image annotation system for robotic perception tasks? We present RF-Annotate, a pipeline for autonomous pixel-wise image annotation which enables robots to collect labelled visual data of objects of interest as they encounter them within their environment. Our pipeline uses unmodified commodity RFID readers and RGB-D cameras, and exploits arbitrary small-scale motions afforded by mobile robotic platforms to spatially map RFIDs to corresponding objects in the scene. Our only assumption is that the objects of interest within the environment are pre-tagged with inexpensive battery-free RFIDs costing 3-15 cents each. We demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline on several RGB-D sequences of tabletop scenes featuring common objects in a variety of indoor environments.

- **Summary**: Volumetric magnetic resonance (MR) image segmentation plays an important role in many clinical applications. Deep learning (DL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art or even human-level performance on various image segmentation tasks. Nevertheless, manually annotating volumetric MR images for DL model training is labor-exhaustive and time-consuming. In this work, we aim to train a semi-supervised and self-supervised collaborative learning framework for prostate 3D MR image segmentation while using extremely sparse annotations, for which the ground truth annotations are provided for just the central slice of each volumetric MR image. Specifically, semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning methods are used to generate two independent sets of pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are then fused by Boolean operation to extract a more confident pseudo label set. The images with either manual or network self-generated labels are then employed to train a segmentation model for target volume extraction. Experimental results on a publicly available prostate MR image dataset demonstrate that, while requiring significantly less annotation effort, our framework generates very encouraging segmentation results. The proposed framework is very useful in clinical applications when training data with dense annotations are difficult to obtain.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object detectors (ODs) have been studied extensively in the past few years. These attacks cause the model to make incorrect predictions by placing a patch containing an adversarial pattern on the target object or anywhere within the frame. However, none of prior research proposed a misclassification attack on ODs, in which the patch is applied on the target object. In this study, we propose a novel, universal, targeted, label-switch attack against the state-of-the-art object detector, YOLO. In our attack, we use (i) a tailored projection function to enable the placement of the adversarial patch on multiple target objects in the image (e.g., cars), each of which may be located a different distance away from the camera or have a different view angle relative to the camera, and (ii) a unique loss function capable of changing the label of the attacked objects. The proposed universal patch, which is trained in the digital domain, is transferable to the physical domain. We performed an extensive evaluation using different types of object detectors, different video streams captured by different cameras, and various target classes, and evaluated different configurations of the adversarial patch in the physical domain.

- **Summary**: Infographics are often an integral component of scientific documents for reporting qualitative or quantitative findings as they make it much simpler to comprehend the underlying complex information. However, their interpretation continues to be a challenge for the blind, low-vision, and other print-impaired (BLV) individuals. In this paper, we propose ChartParser, a fully automated pipeline that leverages deep learning, OCR, and image processing techniques to extract all figures from a research paper, classify them into various chart categories (bar chart, line chart, etc.) and obtain relevant information from them, specifically bar charts (including horizontal, vertical, stacked horizontal and stacked vertical charts) which already have several exciting challenges. Finally, we present the retrieved content in a tabular format that is screen-reader friendly and accessible to the BLV users. We present a thorough evaluation of our approach by applying our pipeline to sample real-world annotated bar charts from research papers.

- **Summary**: Soft-biometric privacy-enhancing techniques represent machine learning methods that aim to: (i) mitigate privacy concerns associated with face recognition technology by suppressing selected soft-biometric attributes in facial images (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity) and (ii) make unsolicited extraction of sensitive personal information infeasible. Because such techniques are increasingly used in real-world applications, it is imperative to understand to what extent the privacy enhancement can be inverted and how much attribute information can be recovered from privacy-enhanced images. While these aspects are critical, they have not been investigated in the literature. We, therefore, study the robustness of several state-of-the-art soft-biometric privacy-enhancing techniques to attribute recovery attempts. We propose PrivacyProber, a high-level framework for restoring soft-biometric information from privacy-enhanced facial images, and apply it for attribute recovery in comprehensive experiments on three public face datasets, i.e., LFW, MUCT and Adience. Our experiments show that the proposed framework is able to restore a considerable amount of suppressed information, regardless of the privacy-enhancing technique used, but also that there are significant differences between the considered privacy models. These results point to the need for novel mechanisms that can improve the robustness of existing privacy-enhancing techniques and secure them against potential adversaries trying to restore suppressed information.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to improve the prediction performance in the target domain under distribution shifts from the source domain. The key principle of UDA is to minimize the divergence between the source and the target domains. To follow this principle, many methods employ a domain discriminator to match the feature distributions. Some recent methods evaluate the discrepancy between two predictions on target samples to detect those that deviate from the source distribution. However, their performance is limited because they either match the marginal distributions or measure the divergence conservatively. In this paper, we present a novel UDA method that learns domain-invariant features that minimize the domain divergence. We propose model uncertainty as a measure of the domain divergence. Our UDA method based on model uncertainty (MUDA) adopts a Bayesian framework and provides an efficient way to evaluate model uncertainty by means of Monte Carlo dropout sampling. Empirical results on image recognition tasks show that our method is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods. We also extend MUDA to multi-source domain adaptation problems.

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework for explainable labeling and interpretation of medical images. Medical images require specialized professionals for interpretation, and are explained (typically) via elaborate textual reports. Different from prior methods that focus on medical report generation from images or vice-versa, we novelly generate congruent image--report pairs employing a cyclic-Generative Adversarial Network (cycleGAN); thereby, the generated report will adequately explain a medical image, while a report-generated image that effectively characterizes the text visually should (sufficiently) resemble the original. The aim of the work is to generate trustworthy and faithful explanations for the outputs of a model diagnosing chest x-ray images by pointing a human user to similar cases in support of a diagnostic decision. Apart from enabling transparent medical image labeling and interpretation, we achieve report and image-based labeling comparable to prior methods, including state-of-the-art performance in some cases as evidenced by experiments on the Indiana Chest X-ray dataset

- **Summary**: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have been prevailing paradigms for large-scale vision representation pre-training. By reconstructing masked image patches from a small portion of visible image regions, MAE forces the model to infer semantic correlation within an image. Recently, some approaches apply semantic-rich teacher models to extract image features as the reconstruction target, leading to better performance. However, unlike the low-level features such as pixel values, we argue the features extracted by powerful teacher models already encode rich semantic correlation across regions in an intact image.This raises one question: is reconstruction necessary in Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with a teacher model? In this paper, we propose an efficient MIM paradigm named MaskAlign. MaskAlign simply learns the consistency of visible patch features extracted by the student model and intact image features extracted by the teacher model. To further advance the performance and tackle the problem of input inconsistency between the student and teacher model, we propose a Dynamic Alignment (DA) module to apply learnable alignment. Our experimental results demonstrate that masked modeling does not lose effectiveness even without reconstruction on masked regions. Combined with Dynamic Alignment, MaskAlign can achieve state-of-the-art performance with much higher efficiency. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/maskalign.

- **Summary**: Many unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been proposed to bridge the domain gap by utilizing domain invariant information. Most approaches have chosen depth as such information and achieved remarkable success. Despite their effectiveness, using depth as domain invariant information in UDA tasks may lead to multiple issues, such as excessively high extraction costs and difficulties in achieving a reliable prediction quality. As a result, we introduce Edge Learning based Domain Adaptation (ELDA), a framework which incorporates edge information into its training process to serve as a type of domain invariant information. In our experiments, we quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that the incorporation of edge information is indeed beneficial and effective and enables ELDA to outperform the contemporary state-of-the-art methods on two commonly adopted benchmarks for semantic segmentation based UDA tasks. In addition, we show that ELDA is able to better separate the feature distributions of different classes. We further provide an ablation analysis to justify our design decisions.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) is a transfer learning task where the data and annotations of the source domain are available but only have access to the unlabeled target data during training. Most previous methods try to minimise the domain gap by performing distribution alignment between the source and target domains, which has a notable limitation, i.e., operating at the domain level, but neglecting the sample-level differences. To mitigate this weakness, we propose to improve the unsupervised domain adaptation task with an inter-domain sample matching scheme. We apply the widely-used and robust Triplet loss to match the inter-domain samples. To reduce the catastrophic effect of the inaccurate pseudo-labels generated during training, we propose a novel uncertainty measurement method to select reliable pseudo-labels automatically and progressively refine them. We apply the advanced discrete relaxation Gumbel Softmax technique to realise an adaptive Topk scheme to fulfil the functionality. In addition, to enable the global ranking optimisation within one batch for the domain matching, the whole model is optimised via a novel reinforced attention mechanism with supervision from the policy gradient algorithm, using the Average Precision (AP) as the reward. Our model (termed \textbf{\textit{AdaTriplet-RA}}) achieves State-of-the-art results on several public benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is validated via comprehensive ablation studies. Our method improves the accuracy of the baseline by 9.7\% (ResNet-101) and 6.2\% (ResNet-50) on the VisDa dataset and 4.22\% (ResNet-50) on the Domainnet dataset. {The source code is publicly available at \textit{https://github.com/shuxy0120/AdaTriplet-RA}}.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning of egomotion and depth has recently attracted great attentions. These learning models can provide pose and depth maps to support navigation and perception task for autonomous driving and robots, while they do not require high-precision ground-truth labels to train the networks. However, monocular vision based methods suffer from pose scale-ambiguity problem, so that can not generate physical meaningful trajectory, and thus their applications are limited in real-world. We propose a novel self-learning deep neural network framework that can learn to estimate egomotion and depths with absolute metric scale from monocular images. Coarse depth scale is recovered via comparing point cloud data against a pretrained model that ensures the consistency of photometric loss. The scale-ambiguity problem is solved by introducing a novel two-stages coarse-to-fine scale recovery strategy that jointly refines coarse poses and depths. Our model successfully produces pose and depth estimates in global scale-metric, even in low-light condition, i.e. driving at night. The evaluation on the public datasets demonstrates that our model outperforms both representative traditional and learning based VOs and VIOs, e.g. VINS-mono, ORB-SLAM, SC-Learner, and UnVIO.

- **Summary**: Machine learning models have shone in a variety of domains and attracted increasing attention from both the security and the privacy communities. One important yet worrying question is: will training models under the differential privacy (DP) constraint unfavorably impact on the adversarial robustness? While previous works have postulated that privacy comes at the cost of worse robustness, we give the first theoretical analysis to show that DP models can indeed be robust and accurate, even sometimes more robust than their naturally-trained non-private counterparts. We observe three key factors that influence the privacy-robustness-accuracy tradeoff: (1) hyperparameters for DP optimizers are critical; (2) pre-training on public data significantly mitigates the accuracy and robustness drop; (3) choice of DP optimizers makes a difference. With these factors set properly, we achieve 90\% natural accuracy, 72\% robust accuracy ($+9\%$ than the non-private model) under $l_2(0.5)$ attack, and 69\% robust accuracy ($+16\%$ than the non-private model) with pre-trained SimCLRv2 model under $l_\infty(4/255)$ attack on CIFAR10 with $\epsilon=2$. In fact, we show both theoretically and empirically that DP models are Pareto optimal on the accuracy-robustness tradeoff. Empirically, the robustness of DP models is consistently observed on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CelebA datasets, with ResNet and Vision Transformer. We believe our encouraging results are a significant step towards training models that are private as well as robust.

- **Summary**: Stochastic restoration algorithms allow to explore the space of solutions that correspond to the degraded input. In this paper we reveal additional fundamental advantages of stochastic methods over deterministic ones, which further motivate their use. First, we prove that any restoration algorithm that attains perfect perceptual quality and whose outputs are consistent with the input must be a posterior sampler, and is thus required to be stochastic. Second, we illustrate that while deterministic restoration algorithms may attain high perceptual quality, this can be achieved only by filling up the space of all possible source images using an extremely sensitive mapping, which makes them highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Indeed, we show that enforcing deterministic models to be robust to such attacks profoundly hinders their perceptual quality, while robustifying stochastic models hardly influences their perceptual quality, and improves their output variability. These findings provide a motivation to foster progress in stochastic restoration methods, paving the way to better recovery algorithms.

- **Summary**: The goal of this work is to detect and recognize sequences of letters signed using fingerspelling in British Sign Language (BSL). Previous fingerspelling recognition methods have not focused on BSL, which has a very different signing alphabet (e.g., two-handed instead of one-handed) to American Sign Language (ASL). They also use manual annotations for training. In contrast to previous methods, our method only uses weak annotations from subtitles for training. We localize potential instances of fingerspelling using a simple feature similarity method, then automatically annotate these instances by querying subtitle words and searching for corresponding mouthing cues from the signer. We propose a Transformer architecture adapted to this task, with a multiple-hypothesis CTC loss function to learn from alternative annotation possibilities. We employ a multi-stage training approach, where we make use of an initial version of our trained model to extend and enhance our training data before re-training again to achieve better performance. Through extensive evaluations, we verify our method for automatic annotation and our model architecture. Moreover, we provide a human expert annotated test set of 5K video clips for evaluating BSL fingerspelling recognition methods to support sign language research.

- **Summary**: The assessment and valuation of real estate requires large datasets with real estate information. Unfortunately, real estate databases are usually sparse in practice, i.e., not for each property every important attribute is available. In this paper, we study the potential of predicting high-level real estate attributes from visual data, specifically from two visual modalities, namely indoor (interior) and outdoor (facade) photos. We design three models using different multimodal fusion strategies and evaluate them for three different use cases. Thereby, a particular challenge is to handle missing modalities. We evaluate different fusion strategies, present baselines for the different prediction tasks, and find that enriching the training data with additional incomplete samples can lead to an improvement in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the fusion of information from indoor and outdoor photos results in a performance boost of up to 5% in Macro F1-score.

- **Summary**: Observing a human demonstrator manipulate objects provides a rich, scalable and inexpensive source of data for learning robotic policies. However, transferring skills from human videos to a robotic manipulator poses several challenges, not least a difference in action and observation spaces. In this work, we use unlabeled videos of humans solving a wide range of manipulation tasks to learn a task-agnostic reward function for robotic manipulation policies. Thanks to the diversity of this training data, the learned reward function sufficiently generalizes to image observations from a previously unseen robot embodiment and environment to provide a meaningful prior for directed exploration in reinforcement learning. We propose two methods for scoring states relative to a goal image: through direct temporal regression, and through distances in an embedding space obtained with time-contrastive learning. By conditioning the function on a goal image, we are able to reuse one model across a variety of tasks. Unlike prior work on leveraging human videos to teach robots, our method, Human Offline Learned Distances (HOLD) requires neither a priori data from the robot environment, nor a set of task-specific human demonstrations, nor a predefined notion of correspondence across morphologies, yet it is able to accelerate training of several manipulation tasks on a simulated robot arm compared to using only a sparse reward obtained from task completion.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised pre-training, based on the pretext task of instance discrimination, has fueled the recent advance in label-efficient object detection. However, existing studies focus on pre-training only a feature extractor network to learn transferable representations for downstream detection tasks. This leads to the necessity of training multiple detection-specific modules from scratch in the fine-tuning phase. We argue that the region proposal network (RPN), a common detection-specific module, can additionally be pre-trained towards reducing the localization error of multi-stage detectors. In this work, we propose a simple pretext task that provides an effective pre-training for the RPN, towards efficiently improving downstream object detection performance. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on benchmark object detection tasks and additional downstream tasks, including instance segmentation and few-shot detection. In comparison with multi-stage detectors without RPN pre-training, our approach is able to consistently improve downstream task performance, with largest gains found in label-scarce settings.

- **Summary**: This article introduces a method of evaluating subsamples until any prescribed level of classification accuracy is attained, thus obtaining arbitrary accuracy. A logarithmic reduction in error rate is obtained with a linear increase in sample count. The technique is applied to specific emitter identification on a published dataset of physically recorded over-the-air signals from 16 ostensibly identical high-performance radios. The technique uses a multi-channel deep learning convolutional neural network acting on the bispectra of I/Q signal subsamples each consisting of 56 parts per million (ppm) of the original signal duration. High levels of accuracy are obtained with minimal computation time: in this application, each addition of eight samples decreases error by one order of magnitude.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a method to partially mimic natural intelligence for the problem of lifelong learning representations that are compatible. We take the perspective of a learning agent that is interested in recognizing object instances in an open dynamic universe in a way in which any update to its internal feature representation does not render the features in the gallery unusable for visual search. We refer to this learning problem as Compatible Lifelong Learning Representations (CL2R) as it considers compatible representation learning within the lifelong learning paradigm. We identify stationarity as the property that the feature representation is required to hold to achieve compatibility and propose a novel training procedure that encourages local and global stationarity on the learned representation. Due to stationarity, the statistical properties of the learned features do not change over time, making them interoperable with previously learned features. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that our CL2R training procedure outperforms alternative baselines and state-of-the-art methods. We also provide novel metrics to specifically evaluate compatible representation learning under catastrophic forgetting in various sequential learning tasks.

- **Summary**: Most image generation methods are difficult to precisely control the properties of the generated images, such as structure, scale, shape, etc., which limits its large-scale application in creative industries such as conceptual design and graphic design, and so on. Using the prompt and the sketch is a practical solution for controllability. Existing datasets lack either prompt or sketch and are not designed for the creative industry. Here is the main contribution of our work. a) This is the first dataset that covers the 4 most important areas of creative industry domains and is labeled with prompt and sketch. b) We provide multiple reference images in the test set and fine-grained scores for each reference which are useful for measurement. c) We apply two state-of-the-art models to our dataset and then find some shortcomings, such as the prompt is more highly valued than the sketch.

- **Summary**: Deep anomaly detection (AD) aims to provide robust and efficient classifiers for one-class and unbalanced settings. However current AD models still struggle on edge-case normal samples and are often unable to keep high performance over different scales of anomalies. Moreover, there currently does not exist a unified framework efficiently covering both one-class and unbalanced learnings. In the light of these limitations, we introduce a new two-stage anomaly detector which memorizes during training multi-scale normal prototypes to compute an anomaly deviation score. First, we simultaneously learn representations and memory modules on multiple scales using a novel memory-augmented contrastive learning. Then, we train an anomaly distance detector on the spatial deviation maps between prototypes and observations. Our model highly improves the state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of object, style and local anomalies with up to 50% error relative improvement on CIFAR-100. It is also the first model to keep high performance across the one-class and unbalanced settings.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a method to jointly determine the status of hand-object interaction. This is crucial for egocentric human activity understanding and interaction. From a computer vision perspective, we believe that determining whether a hand is interacting with an object depends on whether there is an interactive hand pose and whether the hand is touching the object. Thus, we extract the hand pose, hand-object masks to jointly determine the interaction status. In order to solve the problem of hand pose estimation due to in-hand object occlusion, we use a multi-cam system to capture hand pose data from multiple perspectives. We evaluate and compare our method with the most recent work from Shan et al. \cite{Shan20} on selected images from EPIC-KITCHENS \cite{damen2018scaling} dataset and achieve $89\%$ accuracy on HOI (hand-object interaction) detection which is comparative to Shan's ($92\%$). However, for real-time performance, our method can run over $\textbf{30}$ FPS which is much more efficient than Shan's ($\textbf{1}\sim\textbf{2}$ FPS).

- **Summary**: As one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide, Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) occurs when the blood supply to the brain is suddenly interrupted because of a blocked artery. Within seconds of AIS onset, the brain cells surrounding the blocked artery die, which leads to the progression of the lesion. The automated and precise prediction of the existing lesion plays a vital role in the AIS treatment planning and prevention of further injuries. The current standard AIS assessment method, which thresholds the 3D measurement maps extracted from Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) images, is not accurate enough. Due to this fact, in this article, we propose the imbalanced Temporal Deep Gaussian Process (iTDGP), a probabilistic model that can improve AIS lesions prediction by using baseline CTP time series. Our proposed model can effectively extract temporal information from the CTP time series and map it to the class labels of the brain's voxels. In addition, by using batch training and voxel-level analysis iTDGP can learn from a few patients and it is robust against imbalanced classes. Moreover, our model incorporates a post-processor capable of improving prediction accuracy using spatial information. Our comprehensive experiments, on the ISLES 2018 and the University of Alberta Hospital (UAH) datasets, show that iTDGP performs better than state-of-the-art AIS lesion predictors, obtaining the (cross-validation) Dice score of 71.42% and 65.37% with a significant p<0.05, respectively.

- **Summary**: Event cameras such as DAVIS can simultaneously output high temporal resolution events and low frame-rate intensity images, which own great potential in capturing scene motion, such as optical flow estimation. Most of the existing optical flow estimation methods are based on two consecutive image frames and can only estimate discrete flow at a fixed time interval. Previous work has shown that continuous flow estimation can be achieved by changing the quantities or time intervals of events. However, they are difficult to estimate reliable dense flow , especially in the regions without any triggered events. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based dense and continuous optical flow estimation framework from a single image with event streams, which facilitates the accurate perception of high-speed motion. Specifically, we first propose an event-image fusion and correlation module to effectively exploit the internal motion from two different modalities of data. Then we propose an iterative update network structure with bidirectional training for optical flow prediction. Therefore, our model can estimate reliable dense flow as two-frame-based methods, as well as estimate temporal continuous flow as event-based methods. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real captured datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing event-based state-of-the-art methods and our designed baselines for accurate dense and continuous optical flow estimation.

- **Summary**: The vehicle recognition area, including vehicle make-model recognition (VMMR), re-id, tracking, and parts-detection, has made significant progress in recent years, driven by several large-scale datasets for each task. These datasets are often non-overlapping, with different label schemas for each task: VMMR focuses on make and model, while re-id focuses on vehicle ID. It is promising to combine these datasets to take advantage of knowledge across datasets as well as increased training data; however, dataset integration is challenging due to the domain gap problem. This paper proposes ATEAM, an annotation team-of-experts to perform cross-dataset labeling and integration of disjoint annotation schemas. ATEAM uses diverse experts, each trained on datasets that contain an annotation schema, to transfer knowledge to datasets without that annotation. Using ATEAM, we integrated several common vehicle recognition datasets into a Knowledge Integrated Dataset (KID). We evaluate ATEAM and KID for vehicle recognition problems and show that our integrated dataset can help off-the-shelf models achieve excellent accuracy on VMMR and vehicle re-id with no changes to model architectures. We achieve mAP of 0.83 on VeRi, and accuracy of 0.97 on CompCars. We have released both the dataset and the ATEAM framework for public use.

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging learning problem in which only a few samples are available for each class. Decision interpretation is more important in few-shot classification since there is a greater chance of error than in traditional classification. However, most of the previous FSL methods are black-box models. In this paper, we propose an inherently interpretable model for FSL based on human-friendly attributes. Moreover, we propose an online attribute selection mechanism that can effectively filter out irrelevant attributes in each episode. The attribute selection mechanism improves the accuracy and helps with interpretability by reducing the number of participated attributes in each episode. We propose a mechanism that automatically detects the episodes where the pool of human-friendly attributes are not adequate, and compensates by engaging learned unknown attributes. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results on par with black-box few-shot-learning models on four widely used datasets.

- **Summary**: Recently, transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results on Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). However, most of these top-performing methods run in an offline manner by processing the entire video clip at once to predict instance mask volumes. This makes them incapable of handling the long videos that appear in challenging new video instance segmentation datasets like UVO and OVIS. We propose a fully online transformer-based video instance segmentation model that performs comparably to top offline methods on the YouTube-VIS 2019 benchmark and considerably outperforms them on UVO and OVIS. This method, called Robust Online Video Segmentation (ROVIS), augments the Mask2Former image instance segmentation model with track queries, a lightweight mechanism for carrying track information from frame to frame, originally introduced by the TrackFormer method for multi-object tracking. We show that, when combined with a strong enough image segmentation architecture, track queries can exhibit impressive accuracy while not being constrained to short videos.

- **Summary**: Generative modeling and representation learning are two key tasks in computer vision. However, these models are typically trained independently, which ignores the potential for each task to help the other, and leads to training and model maintenance overheads. In this work, we propose MAsked Generative Encoder (MAGE), the first framework to unify SOTA image generation and self-supervised representation learning. Our key insight is that using variable masking ratios in masked image modeling pre-training can allow generative training (very high masking ratio) and representation learning (lower masking ratio) under the same training framework. Inspired by previous generative models, MAGE uses semantic tokens learned by a vector-quantized GAN at inputs and outputs, combining this with masking. We can further improve the representation by adding a contrastive loss to the encoder output. We extensively evaluate the generation and representation learning capabilities of MAGE. On ImageNet-1K, a single MAGE ViT-L model obtains 9.10 FID in the task of class-unconditional image generation and 78.9% top-1 accuracy for linear probing, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image generation and representation learning.

- **Summary**: We propose Token Turing Machines (TTM), a sequential, autoregressive Transformer model with memory for real-world sequential visual understanding. Our model is inspired by the seminal Neural Turing Machine, and has an external memory consisting of a set of tokens which summarise the previous history (i.e., frames). This memory is efficiently addressed, read and written using a Transformer as the processing unit/controller at each step. The model's memory module ensures that a new observation will only be processed with the contents of the memory (and not the entire history), meaning that it can efficiently process long sequences with a bounded computational cost at each step. We show that TTM outperforms other alternatives, such as other Transformer models designed for long sequences and recurrent neural networks, on two real-world sequential visual understanding tasks: online temporal activity detection from videos and vision-based robot action policy learning.

- **Summary**: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn generalizable representations for image, text, audio, video, etc., by reconstructing masked input data from tokens of the visible data. Current MAE approaches for videos rely on random patch, tube, or frame-based masking strategies to select these tokens. This paper proposes AdaMAE, an adaptive masking strategy for MAEs that is end-to-end trainable. Our adaptive masking strategy samples visible tokens based on the semantic context using an auxiliary sampling network. This network estimates a categorical distribution over spacetime-patch tokens. The tokens that increase the expected reconstruction error are rewarded and selected as visible tokens, motivated by the policy gradient algorithm in reinforcement learning. We show that AdaMAE samples more tokens from the high spatiotemporal information regions, thereby allowing us to mask 95% of tokens, resulting in lower memory requirements and faster pre-training. We conduct ablation studies on the Something-Something v2 (SSv2) dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our adaptive sampling approach and report state-of-the-art results of 70.0% and 81.7% in top-1 accuracy on SSv2 and Kinetics-400 action classification datasets with a ViT-Base backbone and 800 pre-training epochs.

- **Summary**: Motion recognition is a promising direction in computer vision, but the training of video classification models is much harder than images due to insufficient data and considerable parameters. To get around this, some works strive to explore multimodal cues from RGB-D data. Although improving motion recognition to some extent, these methods still face sub-optimal situations in the following aspects: (i) Data augmentation, i.e., the scale of the RGB-D datasets is still limited, and few efforts have been made to explore novel data augmentation strategies for videos; (ii) Optimization mechanism, i.e., the tightly space-time-entangled network structure brings more challenges to spatiotemporal information modeling; And (iii) cross-modal knowledge fusion, i.e., the high similarity between multimodal representations caused to insufficient late fusion. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to improve RGB-D-based motion recognition both from data and algorithm perspectives in this paper. In more detail, firstly, we introduce a novel video data augmentation method dubbed ShuffleMix, which acts as a supplement to MixUp, to provide additional temporal regularization for motion recognition. Secondly, a Unified Multimodal De-coupling and multi-stage Re-coupling framework, termed UMDR, is proposed for video representation learning. Finally, a novel cross-modal Complement Feature Catcher (CFCer) is explored to mine potential commonalities features in multimodal information as the auxiliary fusion stream, to improve the late fusion results. The seamless combination of these novel designs forms a robust spatiotemporal representation and achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods on four public motion datasets. Specifically, UMDR achieves unprecedented improvements of +4.5% on the Chalearn IsoGD dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoubenjia/MotionRGBD-PAMI.

- **Summary**: In practical applications, multi-view data depicting objectives from assorted perspectives can facilitate the accuracy increase of learning algorithms. However, given multi-view data, there is limited work for learning discriminative node relationships and graph information simultaneously via graph convolutional network that has drawn the attention from considerable researchers in recent years. Most of existing methods only consider the weighted sum of adjacency matrices, yet a joint neural network of both feature and graph fusion is still under-explored. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes a joint deep learning framework called Learnable Graph Convolutional Network and Feature Fusion (LGCN-FF), consisting of two stages: feature fusion network and learnable graph convolutional network. The former aims to learn an underlying feature representation from heterogeneous views, while the latter explores a more discriminative graph fusion via learnable weights and a parametric activation function dubbed Differentiable Shrinkage Activation (DSA) function.

- **Summary**: Capturing highly appreciated star field images is extremely challenging due to light pollution, the requirements of specialized hardware, and the high level of photographic skills needed. Deep learning-based techniques have achieved remarkable results in low-light image enhancement (LLIE) but have not been widely applied to star field image enhancement due to the lack of training data. To address this problem, we construct the first Star Field Image Enhancement Benchmark (SFIEB) that contains 355 real-shot and 854 semi-synthetic star field images, all having the corresponding reference images. Using the presented dataset, we propose the first star field image enhancement approach, namely StarDiffusion, based on conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). We introduce dynamic stochastic corruptions to the inputs of conditional DDPM to improve the performance and generalization of the network on our small-scale dataset. Experiments show promising results of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement algorithms. The dataset and codes will be open-sourced.

- **Summary**: We present edBB-Demo, a demonstrator of an AI-powered research platform for student monitoring in remote education. The edBB platform aims to study the challenges associated to user recognition and behavior understanding in digital platforms. This platform has been developed for data collection, acquiring signals from a variety of sensors including keyboard, mouse, webcam, microphone, smartwatch, and an Electroencephalography band. The information captured from the sensors during the student sessions is modelled in a multimodal learning framework. The demonstrator includes: i) Biometric user authentication in an unsupervised environment; ii) Human action recognition based on remote video analysis; iii) Heart rate estimation from webcam video; and iv) Attention level estimation from facial expression analysis.

- **Summary**: The progress in modelling time series and, more generally, sequences of structured data has recently revamped research in anomaly detection. The task stands for identifying abnormal behaviors in financial series, IT systems, aerospace measurements, and the medical domain, where anomaly detection may aid in isolating cases of depression and attend the elderly. Anomaly detection in time series is a complex task since anomalies are rare due to highly non-linear temporal correlations and since the definition of anomalous is sometimes subjective. Here we propose the novel use of Hyperbolic uncertainty for Anomaly Detection (HypAD). HypAD learns self-supervisedly to reconstruct the input signal. We adopt best practices from the state-of-the-art to encode the sequence by an LSTM, jointly learned with a decoder to reconstruct the signal, with the aid of GAN critics. Uncertainty is estimated end-to-end by means of a hyperbolic neural network. By using uncertainty, HypAD may assess whether it is certain about the input signal but it fails to reconstruct it because this is anomalous; or whether the reconstruction error does not necessarily imply anomaly, as the model is uncertain, e.g. a complex but regular input signal. The novel key idea is that a detectable anomaly is one where the model is certain but it predicts wrongly. HypAD outperforms the current state-of-the-art for univariate anomaly detection on established benchmarks based on data from NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, Amazon, and Twitter. It also yields state-of-the-art performance on a multivariate dataset of anomaly activities in elderly home residences, and it outperforms the baseline on SWaT. Overall, HypAD yields the lowest false alarms at the best performance rate, thanks to successfully identifying detectable anomalies.

- **Summary**: Neural networks pre-trained on a self-supervision scheme have become the standard when operating in data rich environments with scarce annotations. As such, fine-tuning a model to a downstream task in a parameter-efficient but effective way, e.g. for a new set of classes in the case of semantic segmentation, is of increasing importance. In this work, we propose and investigate several contributions to achieve a parameter-efficient but effective adaptation for semantic segmentation on two medical imaging datasets. Relying on the recently popularized prompt tuning approach, we provide a prompt-able UNet (PUNet) architecture, that is frozen after pre-training, but adaptable throughout the network by class-dependent learnable prompt tokens. We pre-train this architecture with a dedicated dense self-supervision scheme based on assignments to online generated prototypes (contrastive prototype assignment, CPA) of a student teacher combination alongside a concurrent segmentation loss on a subset of classes. We demonstrate that the resulting neural network model is able to attenuate the gap between fully fine-tuned and parameter-efficiently adapted models on CT imaging datasets. As such, the difference between fully fine-tuned and prompt-tuned variants amounts to only 3.83 pp for the TCIA/BTCV dataset and 2.67 pp for the CT-ORG dataset in the mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC, in %) while only prompt tokens, corresponding to 0.85% of the pre-trained backbone model with 6.8M frozen parameters, are adjusted.

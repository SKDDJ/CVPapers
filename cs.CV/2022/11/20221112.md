- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence methods including deep neural networks (DNN) can provide rapid molecular classification of tumors from routine histology with accuracy that matches or exceeds human pathologists. Discerning how neural networks make their predictions remains a significant challenge, but explainability tools help provide insights into what models have learned when corresponding histologic features are poorly defined. Here, we present a method for improving explainability of DNN models using synthetic histology generated by a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We show that cGANs generate high-quality synthetic histology images that can be leveraged for explaining DNN models trained to classify molecularly-subtyped tumors, exposing histologic features associated with molecular state. Fine-tuning synthetic histology through class and layer blending illustrates nuanced morphologic differences between tumor subtypes. Finally, we demonstrate the use of synthetic histology for augmenting pathologist-in-training education, showing that these intuitive visualizations can reinforce and improve understanding of histologic manifestations of tumor biology.

- **Summary**: As maintaining road networks is labor-intensive, many automatic road extraction approaches have been introduced to solve this real-world problem, fueled by the abundance of large-scale high-resolution satellite imagery and advances in data-driven vision technology. However, their performance is limited to fully automating road map extraction in real-world services. Hence, many services employ the human-in-the-loop approaches on the extracted road maps: semi-automatic detection and repairing faulty road maps. Our paper exclusively focuses on the latter, introducing a novel data-driven approach for fixing road maps. We incorporate image inpainting approaches to tackle complex road geometries without custom-made algorithms for each road shape, yielding a method that is readily applicable to any road map segmentation model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various real-world road geometries, such as straight and curvy roads, T-junctions, and intersections.

- **Summary**: We present ThreshNet, a post-processing method to refine the output of neural networks designed for binary segmentation tasks. ThreshNet uses the confidence map produced by a base network along with global and local patch information to significantly improve the performance of even state-of-the-art methods. Binary segmentation models typically convert confidence maps into predictions by thresholding the confidence scores at 0.5 (or some other fixed number). However, we observe that the best threshold is image-dependent and often even region-specific -- different parts of the image benefit from using different thresholds. Thus ThreshNet takes a trained segmentation model and learns to correct its predictions by using a memory-efficient post-processing architecture that incorporates region-specific thresholds as part of the training mechanism. Our experiments show that ThreshNet consistently improves over current the state-of-the-art methods in binary segmentation and saliency detection, typically by 3 to 5% in mIoU and mBA.

- **Summary**: Scene text removal aims to remove the text and fill the regions with perceptually plausible background information in natural images. It has attracted increasing attention due to its various applications in privacy protection, scene text retrieval, and text editing. With the development of deep learning, the previous methods have achieved significant improvements. However, most of the existing methods seem to ignore the large perceptive fields and global information. The pioneer method can get significant improvements by only changing training data from the cropped image to the full image. In this paper, we present a single-stage multi-scale network MSLKANet for scene text removal in full images. For obtaining large perceptive fields and global information, we propose multi-scale large kernel attention (MSLKA) to obtain long-range dependencies between the text regions and the backgrounds at various granularity levels. Furthermore, we combine the large kernel decomposition mechanism and atrous spatial pyramid pooling to build a large kernel spatial pyramid pooling (LKSPP), which can perceive more valid pixels in the spatial dimension while maintaining large receptive fields and low cost of computation. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets and the effectiveness of the proposed components MSLKA and LKSPP.

- **Summary**: Pain is a common occurrence among patients admitted to Intensive Care Units. Pain assessment in ICU patients still remains a challenge for clinicians and ICU staff, specifically in cases of non-verbal sedated, mechanically ventilated, and intubated patients. Current manual observation-based pain assessment tools are limited by the frequency of pain observations administered and are subjective to the observer. Facial behavior is a major component in observation-based tools. Furthermore, previous literature shows the feasibility of painful facial expression detection using facial action units (AUs). However, these approaches are limited to controlled or semi-controlled environments and have never been validated in clinical settings. In this study, we present our Pain-ICU dataset, the largest dataset available targeting facial behavior analysis in the dynamic ICU environment. Our dataset comprises 76,388 patient facial image frames annotated with AUs obtained from 49 adult patients admitted to ICUs at the University of Florida Health Shands hospital. In this work, we evaluated two vision transformer models, namely ViT and SWIN, for AU detection on our Pain-ICU dataset and also external datasets. We developed a completely end-to-end AU detection pipeline with the objective of performing real-time AU detection in the ICU. The SWIN transformer Base variant achieved 0.88 F1-score and 0.85 accuracy on the held-out test partition of the Pain-ICU dataset.

- **Summary**: The DEtection TRansformer (DETR) approach, which uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture and a set-based global loss, has become a building block in many transformer based applications. However, as originally presented, the assignment cost and the global loss are not aligned, i.e., reducing the former is likely but not guaranteed to reduce the latter. And the issue of gradient is ignored when a combinatorial solver such as Hungarian is used. In this paper we show that the global loss can be expressed as the sum of an assignment-independent term, and an assignment-dependent term which can be used to define the assignment cost matrix. Recent results on generalized gradients of optimal assignment cost with respect to parameters of an assignment problem are then used to define generalized gradients of the loss with respect to network parameters, and backpropagation is carried out properly. Our experiments using the same loss weights show interesting convergence properties and a potential for further performance improvements.

- **Summary**: Vessel segmentation is crucial in many medical image applications, such as detecting coronary stenoses, retinal vessel diseases and brain aneurysms. However, achieving high pixel-wise accuracy, complete topology structure and robustness to various contrast variations are critical and challenging, and most existing methods focus only on achieving one or two of these aspects. In this paper, we present a novel approach, the affinity feature strengthening network (AFN), which jointly models geometry and refines pixel-wise segmentation features using a contrast-insensitive, multiscale affinity approach. Specifically, we compute a multiscale affinity field for each pixel, capturing its semantic relationships with neighboring pixels in the predicted mask image. This field represents the local geometry of vessel segments of different sizes, allowing us to learn spatial- and scale-aware adaptive weights to strengthen vessel features. We evaluate our AFN on four different types of vascular datasets: X-ray angiography coronary vessel dataset (XCAD), portal vein dataset (PV), digital subtraction angiography cerebrovascular vessel dataset (DSA) and retinal vessel dataset (DRIVE). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our AFN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both higher accuracy and topological metrics, while also being more robust to various contrast changes.

- **Summary**: Historical Document Image Binarization is a well-known segmentation problem in image processing. Despite ubiquity, traditional thresholding algorithms achieved limited success on severely degraded document images. With the advent of deep learning, several segmentation models were proposed that made significant progress in the field but were limited by the unavailability of large training datasets. To mitigate this problem, we have proposed a novel two-stage framework -- the first of which comprises a generator that generates degraded samples using variational inference and the second being a CNN-based binarization network that trains on the generated data. We evaluated our framework on a range of DIBCO datasets, where it achieved competitive results against previous state-of-the-art methods.



### Exploiting the Partly Scratch-off Lottery Ticket for Quantization-Aware Training

- **Summary**: Quantization-aware training (QAT) receives extensive popularity as it well retains the performance of quantized networks. In QAT, the contemporary experience is that all quantized weights are updated for an entire training process. In this paper, this experience is challenged based on an interesting phenomenon we observed. Specifically, a large portion of quantized weights reaches the optimal quantization level after a few training epochs, which we refer to as the partly scratch-off lottery ticket. This straightforward-yet-valuable observation naturally inspires us to zero out gradient calculations of these weights in the remaining training period to avoid meaningless updating. To effectively find the ticket, we develop a heuristic method, dubbed lottery ticket scratcher (LTS), which freezes a weight once the distance between the full-precision one and its quantization level is smaller than a controllable threshold. Surprisingly, the proposed LTS typically eliminates 50%-70% weight updating and 25%-35% FLOPs of the backward pass, while still resulting on par with or even better performance than the compared baseline. For example, compared with the baseline, LTS improves 2-bit MobileNetV2 by 5.05%, eliminating 46% weight updating and 23% FLOPs of the backward pass. Code is at url{https://github.com/zysxmu/LTS}.

- **Summary**: We tackle the task of NeRF inversion for style-based neural radiance fields, (e.g., StyleNeRF). In the task, we aim to learn an inversion function to project an input image to the latent space of a NeRF generator and then synthesize novel views of the original image based on the latent code. Compared with GAN inversion for 2D generative models, NeRF inversion not only needs to 1) preserve the identity of the input image, but also 2) ensure 3D consistency in generated novel views. This requires the latent code obtained from the single-view image to be invariant across multiple views. To address this new challenge, we propose a two-stage encoder for style-based NeRF inversion. In the first stage, we introduce a base encoder that converts the input image to a latent code. To ensure the latent code is view-invariant and is able to synthesize 3D consistent novel view images, we utilize identity contrastive learning to train the base encoder. Second, to better preserve the identity of the input image, we introduce a refining encoder to refine the latent code and add finer details to the output image. Importantly note that the novelty of this model lies in the design of its first-stage encoder which produces the closest latent code lying on the latent manifold and thus the refinement in the second stage would be close to the NeRF manifold. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed two-stage encoder qualitatively and quantitatively exhibits superiority over the existing encoders for inversion in both image reconstruction and novel-view rendering.



### DEYO: DETR with YOLO for Step-by-Step Object Detection

- **Summary**: Object detection is an important topic in computer vision, with post-processing, an essential part of the typical object detection pipeline, posing a significant bottleneck affecting the performance of traditional object detection models. The detection transformer (DETR), as the first end-to-end target detection model, discards the requirement of manual components like the anchor and non-maximum suppression (NMS), significantly simplifying the target detection process. However, compared with most traditional object detection models, DETR converges very slowly, and a query's meaning is obscure. Thus, inspired by the Step-by-Step concept, this paper proposes a new two-stage object detection model, named DETR with YOLO (DEYO), which relies on a progressive inference to solve the above problems. DEYO is a two-stage architecture comprising a classic target detection model and a DETR-like model as the first and second stages, respectively. Specifically, the first stage provides high-quality query and anchor feeding into the second stage, improving the performance and efficiency of the second stage compared to the original DETR model. Meanwhile, the second stage compensates for the performance degradation caused by the first stage detector's limitations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DEYO attains 50.6 AP and 52.1 AP in 12 and 36 epochs, respectively, while utilizing ResNet-50 as the backbone and multi-scale features on the COCO dataset. Compared with DINO, an optimal DETR-like model, the developed DEYO model affords a significant performance improvement of 1.6 AP and 1.2 AP in two epoch settings.

- **Summary**: Spectral Normalization is one of the best methods for stabilizing the training of Generative Adversarial Network. Spectral Normalization limits the gradient of discriminator between the distribution between real data and fake data. However, even with this normalization, GAN's training sometimes fails. In this paper, we reveal that more severe restriction is sometimes needed depending on the training dataset, then we propose a novel stabilizer which offers an adaptive normalization method, called ABCAS. Our method decides discriminator's Lipschitz constant adaptively, by checking the distance of distributions of real and fake data. Our method improves the stability of the training of Generative Adversarial Network and achieved better Fr\'echet Inception Distance score of generated images. We also investigated suitable spectral norm for three datasets. We show the result as an ablation study.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition is one of the most critical long-distance identification technologies and increasingly gains popularity in both research and industry communities. Despite the significant progress made in indoor datasets, much evidence shows that gait recognition techniques perform poorly in the wild. More importantly, we also find that some conclusions drawn from indoor datasets cannot be generalized to real applications. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive benchmark study for better practicality rather than only a particular model for better performance. To this end, we first develop a flexible and efficient gait recognition codebase named OpenGait. Based on OpenGait, we deeply revisit the recent development of gait recognition by re-conducting the ablative experiments. Encouragingly,we detect some unperfect parts of certain prior woks, as well as new insights. Inspired by these discoveries, we develop a structurally simple, empirically powerful, and practically robust baseline model, GaitBase. Experimentally, we comprehensively compare GaitBase with many current gait recognition methods on multiple public datasets, and the results reflect that GaitBase achieves significantly strong performance in most cases regardless of indoor or outdoor situations.

- **Summary**: Fast screening and diagnosis are critical in COVID-19 patient treatment. In addition to the gold standard RT-PCR, radiological imaging like X-ray and CT also works as an important means in patient screening and follow-up. However, due to the excessive number of patients, writing reports becomes a heavy burden for radiologists. To reduce the workload of radiologists, we propose DeltaNet to generate medical reports automatically. Different from typical image captioning approaches that generate reports with an encoder and a decoder, DeltaNet applies a conditional generation process. In particular, given a medical image, DeltaNet employs three steps to generate a report: 1) first retrieving related medical reports, i.e., the historical reports from the same or similar patients; 2) then comparing retrieved images and current image to find the differences; 3) finally generating a new report to accommodate identified differences based on the conditional report. We evaluate DeltaNet on a COVID-19 dataset, where DeltaNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Besides COVID-19, the proposed DeltaNet can be applied to other diseases as well. We validate its generalization capabilities on the public IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets for chest-related diseases. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/LX-doctorAI1/DeltaNet}.

- **Summary**: Studies have proven that domain bias and label bias exist in different Facial Expression Recognition (FER) datasets, making it hard to improve the performance of a specific dataset by adding other datasets. For the FER bias issue, recent researches mainly focus on the cross-domain issue with advanced domain adaption algorithms. This paper addresses another problem: how to boost FER performance by leveraging cross-domain datasets. Unlike the coarse and biased expression label, the facial Action Unit (AU) is fine-grained and objective suggested by psychological studies. Motivated by this, we resort to the AU information of different FER datasets for performance boosting and make contributions as follows. First, we experimentally show that the naive joint training of multiple FER datasets is harmful to the FER performance of individual datasets. We further introduce expression-specific mean images and AU cosine distances to measure FER dataset bias. This novel measurement shows consistent conclusions with experimental degradation of joint training. Second, we propose a simple yet conceptually-new framework, AU-aware Vision Transformer (AU-ViT). It improves the performance of individual datasets by jointly training auxiliary datasets with AU or pseudo-AU labels. We also find that the AU-ViT is robust to real-world occlusions. Moreover, for the first time, we prove that a carefully-initialized ViT achieves comparable performance to advanced deep convolutional networks. Our AU-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular datasets, namely 91.10% on RAF-DB, 65.59% on AffectNet, and 90.15% on FERPlus. The code and models will be released soon.

- **Summary**: We investigate a practical domain adaptation task, called source-free domain adaptation (SFUDA), where the source-pretrained model is adapted to the target domain without access to the source data. Existing techniques mainly leverage self-supervised pseudo labeling to achieve class-wise global alignment [1] or rely on local structure extraction that encourages feature consistency among neighborhoods [2]. While impressive progress has been made, both lines of methods have their own drawbacks - the "global" approach is sensitive to noisy labels while the "local" counterpart suffers from source bias. In this paper, we present Divide and Contrast (DaC), a new paradigm for SFUDA that strives to connect the good ends of both worlds while bypassing their limitations. Based on the prediction confidence of the source model, DaC divides the target data into source-like and target-specific samples, where either group of samples is treated with tailored goals under an adaptive contrastive learning framework. Specifically, the source-like samples are utilized for learning global class clustering thanks to their relatively clean labels. The more noisy target-specific data are harnessed at the instance level for learning the intrinsic local structures. We further align the source-like domain with the target-specific samples using a memory bank-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to reduce the distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments on VisDA, Office-Home, and the more challenging DomainNet have verified the superior performance of DaC over current state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early-stage detection of lung cancer is essential for a more favorable prognosis. Radiogenomics is an emerging discipline that combines medical imaging and genomics features for modeling patient outcomes non-invasively. This study presents a radiogenomics pipeline that has: 1) a novel mixed architecture (RA-Seg) to segment lung cancer through attention and recurrent blocks; and 2) deep feature classifiers to distinguish Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation status. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on multiple public datasets to assess its generalizability and robustness. We demonstrate how the proposed segmentation and classification methods outperform existing baseline and SOTA approaches (73.54 Dice and 93 F1 scores).

- **Summary**: Humans and animals have the ability to continuously learn new information over their lifetime without losing previously acquired knowledge. However, artificial neural networks struggle with this due to new information conflicting with old knowledge, resulting in catastrophic forgetting. The complementary learning systems (CLS) theory suggests that the interplay between hippocampus and neocortex systems enables long-term and efficient learning in the mammalian brain, with memory replay facilitating the interaction between these two systems to reduce forgetting. The proposed Lifelong Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation (LLEDA) framework draws inspiration from the CLS theory and mimics the interaction between two networks: a DA network inspired by the hippocampus that quickly adjusts to changes in data distribution and an SSL network inspired by the neocortex that gradually learns domain-agnostic general representations. LLEDA's latent replay technique facilitates communication between these two networks by reactivating and replaying the past memory latent representations to stabilise long-term generalisation and retention without interfering with the previously learned information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several other methods resulting in a long-term adaptation while being less prone to catastrophic forgetting when transferred to new domains.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a self-supervised approach to learn universal facial representations from videos, that can transfer across a variety of facial analysis tasks such as Facial Attribute Recognition (FAR), Facial Expression Recognition (FER), DeepFake Detection (DFD), and Lip Synchronization (LS). Our proposed framework, named MARLIN, is a facial video masked autoencoder, that learns highly robust and generic facial embeddings from abundantly available non-annotated web crawled facial videos. As a challenging auxiliary task, MARLIN reconstructs the spatio-temporal details of the face from the densely masked facial regions which mainly include eyes, nose, mouth, lips, and skin to capture local and global aspects that in turn help in encoding generic and transferable features. Through a variety of experiments on diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate MARLIN to be an excellent facial video encoder as well as feature extractor, that performs consistently well across a variety of downstream tasks including FAR (1.13% gain over supervised benchmark), FER (2.64% gain over unsupervised benchmark), DFD (1.86% gain over unsupervised benchmark), LS (29.36% gain for Frechet Inception Distance), and even in low data regime.

- **Summary**: 3D single object tracking plays an essential role in many applications, such as autonomous driving. It remains a challenging problem due to the large appearance variation and the sparsity of points caused by occlusion and limited sensor capabilities. Therefore, contextual information across two consecutive frames is crucial for effective object tracking. However, points containing such useful information are often overlooked and cropped out in existing methods, leading to insufficient use of important contextual knowledge. To address this issue, we propose CXTrack, a novel transformer-based network for 3D object tracking, which exploits ConteXtual information to improve the tracking results. Specifically, we design a target-centric transformer network that directly takes point features from two consecutive frames and the previous bounding box as input to explore contextual information and implicitly propagate target cues. To achieve accurate localization for objects of all sizes, we propose a transformer-based localization head with a novel center embedding module to distinguish the target from distractors. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, show that CXTrack achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance while running at 34 FPS.

- **Summary**: In the field of medical image, deep convolutional neural networks(ConvNets) have achieved great success in the classification, segmentation, and registration tasks thanks to their unparalleled capacity to learn image features. However, these tasks often require large amounts of manually annotated data and are labor-intensive. Therefore, it is of significant importance for us to study unsupervised semantic feature learning tasks. In our work, we propose to learn features in medical images by training ConvNets to recognize the geometric transformation applied to images and present a simple self-supervised task that can easily predict the geometric transformation. We precisely define a set of geometric transformations in mathematical terms and generalize this model to 3D, taking into account the distinction between spatial and time dimensions. We evaluated our self-supervised method on CMR images of different modalities (bSSFP, T2, LGE) and achieved accuracies of 96.4%, 97.5%, and 96.4%, respectively. The code and models of our paper will be published on: https://github.com/gaoxin492/Geometric_Transformation_CMR

- **Summary**: Considerable research attention has been paid to table detection by developing not only rule-based approaches reliant on hand-crafted heuristics but also deep learning approaches. Although recent studies successfully perform table detection with enhanced results, they often experience performance degradation when they are used for transferred domains whose table layout features might differ from the source domain in which the underlying model has been trained. To overcome this problem, we present DATa, a novel Domain Adaptation-aided deep Table detection method that guarantees satisfactory performance in a specific target domain where few trusted labels are available. To this end, we newly design lexical features and an augmented model used for re-training. More specifically, after pre-training one of state-of-the-art vision-based models as our backbone network, we re-train our augmented model, consisting of the vision-based model and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. Using new confidence scores acquired based on the trained MLP architecture as well as an initial prediction of bounding boxes and their confidence scores, we calculate each confidence score more accurately. To validate the superiority of DATa, we perform experimental evaluations by adopting a real-world benchmark dataset in a source domain and another dataset in our target domain consisting of materials science articles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DATa method substantially outperforms competing methods that only utilize visual representations in the target domain. Such gains are possible owing to the capability of eliminating high false positives or false negatives according to the setting of a confidence score threshold.

- **Summary**: Mural image inpainting refers to repairing the damage or missing areas in a mural image to restore the visual appearance. Most existing image-inpainting methods tend to take a target image as the only input and directly repair the damage to generate a visually plausible result. These methods obtain high performance in restoration or completion of some specific objects, e.g., human face, fabric texture, and printed texts, etc., however, are not suitable for repairing murals with varied subjects, especially for murals with large damaged areas. Moreover, due to the discrete colors in paints, mural inpainting may suffer from apparent color bias as compared to natural image inpainting. To this end, in this paper, we propose a line drawing guided progressive mural inpainting method. It divides the inpainting process into two steps: structure reconstruction and color correction, executed by a structure reconstruction network (SRN) and a color correction network (CCN), respectively. In the structure reconstruction, line drawings are used by SRN as a guarantee for large-scale content authenticity and structural stability. In the color correction, CCN operates a local color adjustment for missing pixels which reduces the negative effects of color bias and edge jumping. The proposed approach is evaluated against the current state-of-the-art image inpainting methods. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in mural image inpainting.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel machine learning framework to consistently detect, localize and rate congenital cleft lip anomalies in human faces. The goal is to provide a universal, objective measure of facial differences and reconstructive surgical outcomes that matches human judgments. The proposed method employs the StyleGAN2 generative adversarial network with model adaptation to produce normalized transformations of cleft-affected faces in order to allow for subsequent measurement of deformity using a pixel-wise subtraction approach. The complete pipeline of the proposed framework consists of the following steps: image preprocessing, face normalization, color transformation, morphological erosion, heat-map generation and abnormality scoring. Heatmaps that finely discern anatomic anomalies are proposed by exploiting the features of the considered framework. The proposed framework is validated through computer simulations and surveys containing human ratings. The anomaly scores yielded by the proposed computer model correlate closely with the human ratings of facial differences, leading to 0.942 Pearson's r score.

- **Summary**: The key to out-of-distribution detection is density estimation of the in-distribution data or of its feature representations. While good parametric solutions to this problem exist for well curated classification data, these are less suitable for complex domains, such as semantic segmentation. In this paper, we show that a k-Nearest-Neighbors approach can achieve surprisingly good results with small reference datasets and runtimes, and be robust with respect to hyperparameters, such as the number of neighbors and the choice of the support set size. Moreover, we show that it combines well with anomaly scores from standard parametric approaches, and we find that transformer features are particularly well suited to detect novel objects in combination with k-Nearest-Neighbors. Ultimately, the approach is simple and non-invasive, i.e., it does not affect the primary segmentation performance, avoids training on examples of anomalies, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the common benchmarks with +23% and +16% AP improvements on on RoadAnomaly and StreetHazards respectively.

- **Summary**: We propose a post-processor, called NeighborTrack, that leverages neighbor information of the tracking target to validate and improve single-object tracking (SOT) results. It requires no additional data or retraining. Instead, it uses the confidence score predicted by the backbone SOT network to automatically derive neighbor information and then uses this information to improve the tracking results. When tracking an occluded target, its appearance features are untrustworthy. However, a general siamese network often cannot tell whether the tracked object is occluded by reading the confidence score alone, because it could be misled by neighbors with high confidence scores. Our proposed NeighborTrack takes advantage of unoccluded neighbors' information to reconfirm the tracking target and reduces false tracking when the target is occluded. It not only reduces the impact caused by occlusion, but also fixes tracking problems caused by object appearance changes. NeighborTrack is agnostic to SOT networks and post-processing methods. For the VOT challenge dataset commonly used in short-term object tracking, we improve three famous SOT networks, Ocean, TransT, and OSTrack, by an average of ${1.92\%}$ EAO and ${2.11\%}$ robustness. For the mid- and long-term tracking experiments based on OSTrack, we achieve state-of-the-art ${72.25\%}$ AUC on LaSOT and ${75.7\%}$ AO on GOT-10K.

- **Summary**: In this study, we propose a technology called the Fashion Intelligence System based on the visual-semantic embedding (VSE) model to quantify abstract and complex expressions unique to fashion, such as ''casual,'' ''adult-casual,'' and ''office-casual,'' and to support users' understanding of fashion. However, the existing VSE model does not support the situations in which the image is composed of multiple parts such as hair, tops, pants, skirts, and shoes. We propose partial VSE, which enables sensitive learning for each part of the fashion coordinates. The proposed model partially learns embedded representations. This helps retain the various existing practical functionalities and enables image-retrieval tasks in which changes are made only to the specified parts and image reordering tasks that focus on the specified parts. This was not possible with conventional models. Based on both the qualitative and quantitative evaluation experiments, we show that the proposed model is superior to conventional models without increasing the computational complexity.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representation (INR) can describe the target scenes with high fidelity using a small number of parameters, and is emerging as a promising data compression technique. However, limited spectrum coverage is intrinsic to INR, and it is non-trivial to remove redundancy in diverse complex data effectively. Preliminary studies can only exploit either global or local correlation in the target data and thus of limited performance. In this paper, we propose a Tree-structured Implicit Neural Compression (TINC) to conduct compact representation for local regions and extract the shared features of these local representations in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, we use Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to fit the partitioned local regions, and these MLPs are organized in tree structure to share parameters according to the spatial distance. The parameter sharing scheme not only ensures the continuity between adjacent regions, but also jointly removes the local and non-local redundancy. Extensive experiments show that TINC improves the compression fidelity of INR, and has shown impressive compression capabilities over commercial tools and other deep learning based methods. Besides, the approach is of high flexibility and can be tailored for different data and parameter settings. The source code can be found at https://github.com/RichealYoung/TINC .

- **Summary**: Pain monitoring is essential to the quality of care for patients undergoing a medical procedure with sedation. An automated mechanism for detecting pain could improve sedation dose titration. Previous studies on facial pain detection have shown the viability of computer vision methods in detecting pain in unoccluded faces. However, the faces of patients undergoing procedures are often partially occluded by medical devices and face masks. A previous preliminary study on pain detection on artificially occluded faces has shown a feasible approach to detect pain from a narrow band around the eyes. This study has collected video data from masked faces of 14 patients undergoing procedures in an interventional radiology department and has trained a deep learning model using this dataset. The model was able to detect expressions of pain accurately and, after causal temporal smoothing, achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.72 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.82. These results outperform baseline models and show viability of computer vision approaches for pain detection of masked faces during procedural sedation. Cross-dataset performance is also examined when a model is trained on a publicly available dataset and tested on the sedation videos. The ways in which pain expressions differ in the two datasets are qualitatively examined.

- **Summary**: This work demonstrates a novel, state of the art method to reconstruct colored images via the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The DVS is an image sensor that indicates only a binary change in brightness, with no information about the captured wavelength (color), or intensity level. We present a novel method to reconstruct a full spatial resolution colored image with the DVS and an active colored light source. We analyze the DVS response and present two reconstruction algorithms: Linear based and Convolutional Neural Network Based. In addition, we demonstrate our algorithm robustness to changes in environmental conditions such as illumination and distance. Finally, comparing with previous works, we show how we reach the state of the art results.

- **Summary**: Recent works on salient object detection have made use of multi-scale features in a way such that high-level features and low-level features can collaborate in locating salient objects. Many of the previous methods have achieved great performance in salient object detection. By merging the high-level and low-level features, a large number of feature information can be extracted. Generally, they are doing these in a one-way framework, and interweaving the variable features all the way to the final feature output. Which may cause some blurring or inaccurate localization of saliency maps. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce a multistep feature aggregation (MSFA) framework for salient object detection, which is composed of three modules, including the Diverse Reception (DR) module, multiscale interaction (MSI) module and Feature Enhancement (FE) module to accomplish better multi-level feature fusion. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSFA achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: 3D Garment modeling is a critical and challenging topic in the area of computer vision and graphics, with increasing attention focused on garment representation learning, garment reconstruction, and controllable garment manipulation, whereas existing methods were constrained to model garments under specific categories or with relatively simple topologies. In this paper, we propose a novel Neural Sewing Machine (NSM), a learning-based framework for structure-preserving 3D garment modeling, which is capable of learning representations for garments with diverse shapes and topologies and is successfully applied to 3D garment reconstruction and controllable manipulation. To model generic garments, we first obtain sewing pattern embedding via a unified sewing pattern encoding module, as the sewing pattern can accurately describe the intrinsic structure and the topology of the 3D garment. Then we use a 3D garment decoder to decode the sewing pattern embedding into a 3D garment using the UV-position maps with masks. To preserve the intrinsic structure of the predicted 3D garment, we introduce an inner-panel structure-preserving loss, an inter-panel structure-preserving loss, and a surface-normal loss in the learning process of our framework. We evaluate NSM on the public 3D garment dataset with sewing patterns with diverse garment shapes and categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed NSM is capable of representing 3D garments under diverse garment shapes and topologies, realistically reconstructing 3D garments from 2D images with the preserved structure, and accurately manipulating the 3D garment categories, shapes, and topologies, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin.

- **Summary**: We present a novel bipartite graph reasoning Generative Adversarial Network (BiGraphGAN) for two challenging tasks: person pose and facial image synthesis. The proposed graph generator consists of two novel blocks that aim to model the pose-to-pose and pose-to-image relations, respectively. Specifically, the proposed bipartite graph reasoning (BGR) block aims to reason the long-range cross relations between the source and target pose in a bipartite graph, which mitigates some of the challenges caused by pose deformation. Moreover, we propose a new interaction-and-aggregation (IA) block to effectively update and enhance the feature representation capability of both a person's shape and appearance in an interactive way. To further capture the change in pose of each part more precisely, we propose a novel part-aware bipartite graph reasoning (PBGR) block to decompose the task of reasoning the global structure transformation with a bipartite graph into learning different local transformations for different semantic body/face parts. Experiments on two challenging generation tasks with three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in terms of objective quantitative scores and subjective visual realness.

- **Summary**: Purpose: An Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the simplest and fastest bio-medical test that is used to detect any heart-related disease. ECG signals are generally stored in paper form, which makes it difficult to store and analyze the data. While capturing ECG leads from paper ECG records, a lot of background information is also captured, which results in incorrect data interpretation.   Methods: We propose a deep learning-based model for individually extracting all 12 leads from 12-lead ECG images captured using a camera. To simplify the analysis of the ECG and the calculation of complex parameters, we also propose a method to convert the paper ECG format into a storable digital format. The You Only Look Once, Version 3 (YOLOv3) algorithm has been used to extract the leads present in the image. These leads are then passed on to another deep learning model which separates the ECG signal and background from the single-lead image. After that, vertical scanning is performed on the ECG signal to convert it into a 1-Dimensional (1D) digital form. To perform the task of digitalization, we used the pix-2-pix deep learning model and binarized the ECG signals.   Results: Our proposed method was able to achieve an accuracy of 97.4 %.   Conclusion: The information on the paper ECG fades away over time. Hence, the digitized ECG signals make it possible to store the records and access them anytime. This proves highly beneficial for heart patients who require frequent ECG reports. The stored data can also be useful for research purposes, as this data can be used to develop computer algorithms that are capable of analyzing the data.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) is a pioneering deep learning framework that can address real-world computer vision issues, such as image classification and object recognition. Importantly, ViTs are proven to outperform traditional deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Relatively recently, a number of ViT mutations have been transplanted into the field of medical imaging, thereby resolving a variety of critical classification and segmentation challenges, especially in terms of brain imaging data. In this work, we provide a novel multimodal deep learning pipeline, MultiCrossViT, which is capable of analyzing both structural MRI (sMRI) and static functional network connectivity (sFNC) data for the prediction of schizophrenia disease. On a dataset with minimal training subjects, our novel model can achieve an AUC of 0.832. Finally, we visualize multiple brain regions and covariance patterns most relevant to schizophrenia based on the resulting ViT attention maps by extracting features from transformer encoders.

- **Summary**: Histopathological analysis is crucial in artery characterization for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, histology requires an invasive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose to generate virtual histology staining using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images to enable real-time histological visualization. We develop a deep learning network, namely Coronary-GAN, to transfer coronary OCT images to virtual histology images. With a special consideration on the structural constraints in coronary OCT images, our method achieves better image generation performance than the conventional GAN-based method. The experimental results indicate that Coronary-GAN generates virtual histology images that are similar to real histology images, revealing the human coronary layers.

- **Summary**: Binarization has proven to be amongst the most effective ways of neural network compression, reducing the FLOPs of the original model by a large extent. However, such levels of compression are often accompanied by a significant drop in the performance. There exist some approaches that reduce this performance drop by facilitating partial binarization of the network, however, a systematic approach to mix binary and full-precision parameters in a single network is still missing. In this paper, we propose a paradigm to perform partial binarization of neural networks in a controlled sense, thereby constructing budgeted binary neural network (B2NN). We present MixBin, an iterative search-based strategy that constructs B2NN through optimized mixing of the binary and full-precision components. MixBin allows to explicitly choose the approximate fraction of the network to be kept as binary, thereby presenting the flexibility to adapt the inference cost at a prescribed budget. We demonstrate through experiments that B2NNs obtained from our MixBin strategy are significantly better than those obtained from random selection of the network layers. To perform partial binarization in an effective manner, it is important that both the full-precision as well as the binary components of the B2NN are appropriately optimized. We also demonstrate that the choice of the activation function can have a significant effect on this process, and to circumvent this issue, we present BinReLU, that can be used as an effective activation function for the full-precision as well as the binary components of any B2NN. Experimental investigations reveal that BinReLU outperforms the other activation functions in all possible scenarios of B2NN: zero-, partial- as well as full binarization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of MixBin on the tasks of classification and object tracking using benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Video processing and analysis have become an urgent task since a huge amount of videos (e.g., Youtube, Hulu) are uploaded online every day. The extraction of representative key frames from videos is very important in video processing and analysis since it greatly reduces computing resources and time. Although great progress has been made recently, large-scale video classification remains an open problem, as the existing methods have not well balanced the performance and efficiency simultaneously. To tackle this problem, this work presents an unsupervised method to retrieve the key frames, which combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Temporal Segment Density Peaks Clustering (TSDPC). The proposed TSDPC is a generic and powerful framework and it has two advantages compared with previous works, one is that it can calculate the number of key frames automatically. The other is that it can preserve the temporal information of the video. Thus it improves the efficiency of video classification. Furthermore, a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is added on the top of the CNN to further elevate the performance of classification. Moreover, a weight fusion strategy of different input networks is presented to boost the performance. By optimizing both video classification and key frame extraction simultaneously, we achieve better classification performance and higher efficiency. We evaluate our method on two popular datasets (i.e., HMDB51 and UCF101) and the experimental results consistently demonstrate that our strategy achieves competitive performance and efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: In this work, we utilize the high-fidelity generation abilities of diffusion models to solve blind JPEG restoration at high compression levels. We propose an elegant modification of the forward stochastic differential equation of diffusion models to adapt them to this restoration task and name our method DriftRec. Comparing DriftRec against an $L_2$ regression baseline with the same network architecture and two state-of-the-art techniques for JPEG restoration, we show that our approach can escape the tendency of other methods to generate blurry images, and recovers the distribution of clean images significantly more faithfully. For this, only a dataset of clean/corrupted image pairs and no knowledge about the corruption operation is required, enabling wider applicability to other restoration tasks. In contrast to other conditional and unconditional diffusion models, we utilize the idea that the distributions of clean and corrupted images are much closer to each other than each is to the usual Gaussian prior of the reverse process in diffusion models. Our approach therefore requires only low levels of added noise, and needs comparatively few sampling steps even without further optimizations. We show that DriftRec naturally generalizes to realistic and difficult scenarios such as unaligned double JPEG compression and blind restoration of JPEGs found online, without having encountered such examples during training.

- **Summary**: In machine learning applications, it is common practice to feed as much information as possible. In most cases, the model can handle large data sets that allow to predict more accurately. In the presence of data scarcity, a Few-Shot learning (FSL) approach aims to build more accurate algorithms with limited training data. We propose a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture that verifies biometric data by producing competitive results as compared to state-of-the-art accuracies through Few-Shot learning methods. The dense layers add to the complexity of state-of-the-art deep learning models which inhibits them to be used in low-power applications. In presented approach, a shallow network is coupled with a conventional machine learning technique that exploits hand-crafted features to verify biometric images from multi-modal sources such as signatures, periocular region, iris, face, fingerprints etc. We introduce a self-estimated threshold that strictly monitors False Acceptance Rate (FAR) while generalizing its results hence eliminating user-defined thresholds from ROC curves that are likely to be biased on local data distribution. This hybrid model benefits from few-shot learning to make up for scarcity of data in biometric use-cases. We have conducted extensive experimentation with commonly used biometric datasets. The obtained results provided an effective solution for biometric verification systems.

- **Summary**: Rare genetic disorders affect more than 6% of the global population. Reaching a diagnosis is challenging because rare disorders are very diverse. Many disorders have recognizable facial features that are hints for clinicians to diagnose patients. Previous work, such as GestaltMatcher, utilized representation vectors produced by a DCNN similar to AlexNet to match patients in high-dimensional feature space to support "unseen" ultra-rare disorders. However, the architecture and dataset used for transfer learning in GestaltMatcher have become outdated. Moreover, a way to train the model for generating better representation vectors for unseen ultra-rare disorders has not yet been studied. Because of the overall scarcity of patients with ultra-rare disorders, it is infeasible to directly train a model on them. Therefore, we first analyzed the influence of replacing GestaltMatcher DCNN with a state-of-the-art face recognition approach, iResNet with ArcFace. Additionally, we experimented with different face recognition datasets for transfer learning. Furthermore, we proposed test-time augmentation, and model ensembles that mix general face verification models and models specific for verifying disorders to improve the disorder verification accuracy of unseen ultra-rare disorders. Our proposed ensemble model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both seen and unseen disorders.

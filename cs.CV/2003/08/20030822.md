- **Summary**: A very complex vision system is developed to detect luminosity variations connected with the discovery of new planets in the Universe. The traditional imaging system can not manage a so large load. A private net is implemented to perform an automatic vision and decision architecture. It lets to carry out an on-line discrimination of interesting events by using two levels of triggers. This system can even manage many Tbytes of data per day. The architecture avails itself of a distributed parallel network system based on a maximum of 256 standard workstations with Microsoft Window as OS.

- **Summary**: It is developed a very complex system (hardware/software) to detect luminosity variations connected with the discovery of new planets outside the Solar System. Traditional imaging approaches are very demanding in terms of computing time; then, the implementation of an automatic vision and decision software architecture is presented. It allows to perform an on-line discrimination of interesting events by using two levels of triggers. A fundamental challenge was to work with very large CCD camera (even 16k*16k pixels) in line with very large telescopes. Then, the architecture can use a distributed parallel network system based on a maximum of 256 standard workstations.

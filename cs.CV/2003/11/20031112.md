- **Summary**: We suggest that 'axial lines' defined by (Hillier and Hanson, 1984) as lines of uninterrupted movement within urban streetscapes or buildings, appear as ridges in isovist fields (Benedikt, 1979). These are formed from the maximum diametric lengths of the individual isovists, sometimes called viewsheds, that make up these fields (Batty and Rana, 2004). We present an image processing technique for the identification of lines from ridges, discuss current strengths and weaknesses of the method, and show how it can be implemented easily and effectively.

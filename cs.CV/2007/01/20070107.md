- **Summary**: This paper is on the spatio-temporal signals with the topologically modulated electromagnetic fields. The carrier of the digital information is the topological scheme composed of the separatrices-manifolds and equilibrium positions of the field. The signals and developed hardware for their processing in the space-time domain are considered

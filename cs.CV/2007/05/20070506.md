- **Summary**: This paper presents deformable templates as a tool for segmentation and localization of biological structures in medical images. Structures are represented by a prototype template, combined with a parametric warp mapping used to deform the original shape. The localization procedure is achieved using a multi-stage, multi-resolution algorithm de-signed to reduce computational complexity and time. The algorithm initially identifies regions in the image most likely to contain the desired objects and then examines these regions at progressively increasing resolutions. The final stage of the algorithm involves warping the prototype template to match the localized objects. The algorithm is presented along with the results of four example applications using MRI, x-ray and ultrasound images.

- **Summary**: Nuclear medicine (NM) images inherently suffer from large amounts of noise and blur. The purpose of this research is to reduce the noise and blur while maintaining image integrity for improved diagnosis. The proposed solution is to increase image quality after the standard pre- and post-processing undertaken by a gamma camera system. Mean Field Annealing (MFA) is the image processing technique used in this research. It is a computational iterative technique that makes use of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the noise associated with the NM image. MFA is applied to NM images with the objective of reducing noise while not compromising edge integrity. Using a sharpening filter as a post-processing technique (after MFA) yields image enhancement of planar NM images.

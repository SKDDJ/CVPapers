- **Summary**: In this paper, designs and analyses of compressive recognition systems are discussed, and also a method of establishing a dual connection between designs of good communication codes and designs of recognition systems is presented. Pattern recognition systems based on compressed patterns and compressed sensor measurements can be designed using low-density matrices. We examine truncation encoding where a subset of the patterns and measurements are stored perfectly while the rest is discarded. We also examine the use of LDPC parity check matrices for compressing measurements and patterns. We show how more general ensembles of good linear codes can be used as the basis for pattern recognition system design, yielding system design strategies for more general noise models.

- **Summary**: I describe an approach to similarity motivated by Bayesian methods. This yields a similarity function that is learnable using a standard Bayesian methods. The relationship of the approach to variable kernel and variable metric methods is discussed. The approach is related to variable kernel Experimental results on character recognition and 3D object recognition are presented..

- **Summary**: Learning object models from views in 3D visual object recognition is usually formulated either as a function approximation problem of a function describing the view-manifold of an object, or as that of learning a class-conditional density. This paper describes an alternative framework for learning in visual object recognition, that of learning the view-generalization function. Using the view-generalization function, an observer can perform Bayes-optimal 3D object recognition given one or more 2D training views directly, without the need for a separate model acquisition step. The paper shows that view generalization functions can be computationally practical by restating two widely-used methods, the eigenspace and linear combination of views approaches, in a view generalization framework. The paper relates the approach to recent methods for object recognition based on non-uniform blurring. The paper presents results both on simulated 3D ``paperclip'' objects and real-world images from the COIL-100 database showing that useful view-generalization functions can be realistically be learned from a comparatively small number of training examples.

- **Summary**: This paper proves that visual object recognition systems using only 2D Euclidean similarity measurements to compare object views against previously seen views can achieve the same recognition performance as observers having access to all coordinate information and able of using arbitrary 3D models internally. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such systems do not require more training views than Bayes-optimal 3D model-based systems. For building computer vision systems, these results imply that using view-based or appearance-based techniques with carefully constructed combination of evidence mechanisms may not be at a disadvantage relative to 3D model-based systems. For computational approaches to human vision, they show that it is impossible to distinguish view-based and 3D model-based techniques for 3D object recognition solely by comparing the performance achievable by human and 3D model-based systems.}

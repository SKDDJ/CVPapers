- **Summary**: <PLOT > is a collection of routines to draw surfaces, contours and so on. In this work we are presenting a version, that functions over work stations with the operative system UNIX, that count with the graphic ambiance X-WINDOW with the tools XLIB and OSF/MOTIF. This implant was realized for the work stations DEC 5000-200, DEC IPX, and DEC ALFA of the CINVESTAV (Center of Investigation and Advanced Studies). Also implanted in SILICON GRAPHICS of the CENAC (National Center of Calculation of the Polytechnic National Institute

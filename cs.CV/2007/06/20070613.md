- **Summary**: Measuring and modeling human behavior is a very complex task. In this paper we present our initial thoughts on modeling and automatic recognition of some human activities in an office. We argue that to successfully model human activities, we need to consider both individual behavior and group dynamics. To demonstrate these theoretical approaches, we introduce an experimental system for analyzing everyday activity in our office.

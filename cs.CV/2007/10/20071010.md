- **Summary**: In this paper, we firstly modify a parameter in affinity propagation (AP) to improve its convergence ability, and then, we apply it to vector quantization (VQ) codebook design problem. In order to improve the quality of the resulted codebook, we combine the improved AP (IAP) with the conventional LBG algorithm to generate an effective algorithm call IAP-LBG. According to the experimental results, the proposed method not only enhances the convergence abilities but also is capable of providing higher-quality codebooks than conventional LBG method.

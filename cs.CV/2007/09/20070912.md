- **Summary**: Super-resolution is an important but difficult problem in image/video processing. If a video sequence or some training set other than the given low-resolution image is available, this kind of extra information can greatly aid in the reconstruction of the high-resolution image. The problem is substantially more difficult with only a single low-resolution image on hand. The image reconstruction methods designed primarily for denoising is insufficient for super-resolution problem in the sense that it tends to oversmooth images with essentially no noise. We propose a new adaptive linear interpolation method based on variational method and inspired by local linear embedding (LLE). The experimental result shows that our method avoids the problem of oversmoothing and preserves image structures well.

- **Summary**: Kernel estimation techniques, such as mean shift, suffer from one major drawback: the kernel bandwidth selection. The bandwidth can be fixed for all the data set or can vary at each points. Automatic bandwidth selection becomes a real challenge in case of multidimensional heterogeneous features. This paper presents a solution to this problem. It is an extension of \cite{Comaniciu03a} which was based on the fundamental property of normal distributions regarding the bias of the normalized density gradient. The selection is done iteratively for each type of features, by looking for the stability of local bandwidth estimates across a predefined range of bandwidths. A pseudo balloon mean shift filtering and partitioning are introduced. The validity of the method is demonstrated in the context of color image segmentation based on a 5-dimensional space.

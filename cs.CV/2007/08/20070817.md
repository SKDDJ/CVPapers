- **Summary**: Both in the plane and in space, we invert the nonlinear Ullman transformation for 3 points and 3 orthographic cameras. While Ullman's theorem assures a unique reconstruction modulo a reflection for 3 cameras and 4 points, we find a locally unique reconstruction for 3 cameras and 3 points. Explicit reconstruction formulas allow to decide whether picture data of three cameras seeing three points can be realized as a point-camera configuration.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the inverse problem of reconstructing a scene as well as the camera motion from the image sequence taken by an omni-directional camera. Our structure from motion results give sharp conditions under which the reconstruction is unique. For example, if there are three points in general position and three omni-directional cameras in general position, a unique reconstruction is possible up to a similarity. We then look at the reconstruction problem with m cameras and n points, where n and m can be large and the over-determined system is solved by least square methods. The reconstruction is robust and generalizes to the case of a dynamic environment where landmarks can move during the movie capture. Possible applications of the result are computer assisted scene reconstruction, 3D scanning, autonomous robot navigation, medical tomography and city reconstructions.

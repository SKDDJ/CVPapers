- **Summary**: We state an elementary inequality for the structure from motion problem for m cameras and n points. This structure from motion inequality relates space dimension, camera parameter dimension, the number of cameras and number points and global symmetry properties and provides a rigorous criterion for which reconstruction is not possible with probability 1. Mathematically the inequality is based on Frobenius theorem which is a geometric incarnation of the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. The paper also provides a general mathematical formalism for the structure from motion problem. It includes the situation the points can move while the camera takes the pictures.

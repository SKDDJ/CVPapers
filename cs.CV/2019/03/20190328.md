- **Summary**: The scarcity of richly annotated medical images is limiting supervised deep learning based solutions to medical image analysis tasks, such as localizing discriminatory radiomic disease signatures. Therefore, it is desirable to leverage unsupervised and weakly supervised models. Most recent weakly supervised localization methods apply attention maps or region proposals in a multiple instance learning formulation. While attention maps can be noisy, leading to erroneously highlighted regions, it is not simple to decide on an optimal window/bag size for multiple instance learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned spatial masking mechanism to filter out irrelevant background signals from attention maps. The proposed method minimizes mutual information between a masked variational representation and the input while maximizing the information between the masked representation and class labels. This results in more accurate localization of discriminatory regions. We tested the proposed model on the ChestX-ray8 dataset to localize pneumonia from chest X-ray images without using any pixel-level or bounding-box annotations.

- **Summary**: Recent progress on salient object detection mainly aims at exploiting how to effectively integrate multi-scale convolutional features in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Many popular methods impose deep supervision to perform side-output predictions that are linearly aggregated for final saliency prediction. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that linear aggregation of side-output predictions is suboptimal, and it only makes limited use of the side-output information obtained by deep supervision. To solve this problem, we propose Deeply-supervised Nonlinear Aggregation (DNA) for better leveraging the complementary information of various side-outputs. Compared with existing methods, it i) aggregates side-output features rather than predictions, and ii) adopts nonlinear instead of linear transformations. Experiments demonstrate that DNA can successfully break through the bottleneck of current linear approaches. Specifically, the proposed saliency detector, a modified U-Net architecture with DNA, performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on various datasets and evaluation metrics without bells and whistles.

- **Summary**: Real-time generic object detection on mobile platforms is a crucial but challenging computer vision task. However, previous CNN-based detectors suffer from enormous computational cost, which hinders them from real-time inference in computation-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two-stage detectors in real-time generic detection and propose a lightweight two-stage detector named ThunderNet. In the backbone part, we analyze the drawbacks in previous lightweight backbones and present a lightweight backbone designed for object detection. In the detection part, we exploit an extremely efficient RPN and detection head design. To generate more discriminative feature representation, we design two efficient architecture blocks, Context Enhancement Module and Spatial Attention Module. At last, we investigate the balance between the input resolution, the backbone, and the detection head. Compared with lightweight one-stage detectors, ThunderNet achieves superior performance with only 40% of the computational cost on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Without bells and whistles, our model runs at 24.1 fps on an ARM-based device. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time detector reported on ARM platforms. Our code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/qinzheng93/ThunderNet}.



### BubbleNets: Learning to Select the Guidance Frame in Video Object Segmentation by Deep Sorting Frames

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised video object segmentation has made significant progress on real and challenging videos in recent years. The current paradigm for segmentation methods and benchmark datasets is to segment objects in video provided a single annotation in the first frame. However, we find that segmentation performance across the entire video varies dramatically when selecting an alternative frame for annotation. This paper address the problem of learning to suggest the single best frame across the video for user annotation-this is, in fact, never the first frame of video. We achieve this by introducing BubbleNets, a novel deep sorting network that learns to select frames using a performance-based loss function that enables the conversion of expansive amounts of training examples from already existing datasets. Using BubbleNets, we are able to achieve an 11% relative improvement in segmentation performance on the DAVIS benchmark without any changes to the underlying method of segmentation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we report on a parallel freeviewpoint video synthesis algorithm that can efficiently reconstruct a high-quality 3D scene representation of sports scenes. The proposed method focuses on a scene that is captured by multiple synchronized cameras featuring wide-baselines. The following strategies are introduced to accelerate the production of a free-viewpoint video taking the improvement of visual quality into account: (1) a sparse point cloud is reconstructed using a volumetric visual hull approach, and an exact 3D ROI is found for each object using an efficient connected components labeling algorithm. Next, the reconstruction of a dense point cloud is accelerated by implementing visual hull only in the ROIs; (2) an accurate polyhedral surface mesh is built by estimating the exact intersections between grid cells and the visual hull; (3) the appearance of the reconstructed presentation is reproduced in a view-dependent manner that respectively renders the non-occluded and occluded region with the nearest camera and its neighboring cameras. The production for volleyball and judo sequences demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in terms of both execution time and visual quality.

- **Summary**: Scene text detection has witnessed rapid progress especially with the recent development of convolutional neural networks. However, there still exists two challenges which prevent the algorithm into industry applications. On the one hand, most of the state-of-art algorithms require quadrangle bounding box which is in-accurate to locate the texts with arbitrary shape. On the other hand, two text instances which are close to each other may lead to a false detection which covers both instances. Traditionally, the segmentation-based approach can relieve the first problem but usually fail to solve the second challenge. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Scale Expansion Network (PSENet), which can precisely detect text instances with arbitrary shapes. More specifically, PSENet generates the different scale of kernels for each text instance, and gradually expands the minimal scale kernel to the text instance with the complete shape. Due to the fact that there are large geometrical margins among the minimal scale kernels, our method is effective to split the close text instances, making it easier to use segmentation-based methods to detect arbitrary-shaped text instances. Extensive experiments on CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT validate the effectiveness of PSENet. Notably, on CTW1500, a dataset full of long curve texts, PSENet achieves a F-measure of 74.3% at 27 FPS, and our best F-measure (82.2%) outperforms state-of-art algorithms by 6.6%. The code will be released in the future.

- **Summary**: Scene text detection, an essential step of scene text recognition system, is to locate text instances in natural scene images automatically. Some recent attempts benefiting from Mask R-CNN formulate scene text detection task as an instance segmentation problem and achieve remarkable performance. In this paper, we present a new Mask R-CNN based framework named Pyramid Mask Text Detector (PMTD) to handle the scene text detection. Instead of binary text mask generated by the existing Mask R-CNN based methods, our PMTD performs pixel-level regression under the guidance of location-aware supervision, yielding a more informative soft text mask for each text instance. As for the generation of text boxes, PMTD reinterprets the obtained 2D soft mask into 3D space and introduces a novel plane clustering algorithm to derive the optimal text box on the basis of 3D shape. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed PMTD brings consistent and noticeable gain and clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it achieves an F-measure of 80.13% on ICDAR 2017 MLT dataset.



### FastFCN: Rethinking Dilated Convolution in the Backbone for Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: Modern approaches for semantic segmentation usually employ dilated convolutions in the backbone to extract high-resolution feature maps, which brings heavy computation complexity and memory footprint. To replace the time and memory consuming dilated convolutions, we propose a novel joint upsampling module named Joint Pyramid Upsampling (JPU) by formulating the task of extracting high-resolution feature maps into a joint upsampling problem. With the proposed JPU, our method reduces the computation complexity by more than three times without performance loss. Experiments show that JPU is superior to other upsampling modules, which can be plugged into many existing approaches to reduce computation complexity and improve performance. By replacing dilated convolutions with the proposed JPU module, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in Pascal Context dataset (mIoU of 53.13%) and ADE20K dataset (final score of 0.5584) while running 3 times faster.

- **Summary**: Liver lesion segmentation is a difficult yet critical task for medical image analysis. Recently, deep learning based image segmentation methods have achieved promising performance, which can be divided into three categories: 2D, 2.5D and 3D, based on the dimensionality of the models. However, 2.5D and 3D methods can have very high complexity and 2D methods may not perform satisfactorily. To obtain competitive performance with low complexity, in this paper, we propose a Feature-fusion Encoder-Decoder Network (FED-Net) based 2D segmentation model to tackle the challenging problem of liver lesion segmentation from CT images. Our feature fusion method is based on the attention mechanism, which fuses high-level features carrying semantic information with low-level features having image details. Additionally, to compensate for the information loss during the upsampling process, a dense upsampling convolution and a residual convolutional structure are proposed. We tested our method on the dataset of MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge and achieved competitive results compared with other state-of-the-art methods.



### Feature Intertwiner for Object Detection

- **Summary**: A well-trained model should classify objects with a unanimous score for every category. This requires the high-level semantic features should be as much alike as possible among samples. To achive this, previous works focus on re-designing the loss or proposing new regularization constraints. In this paper, we provide a new perspective. For each category, it is assumed that there are two feature sets: one with reliable information and the other with less reliable source. We argue that the reliable set could guide the feature learning of the less reliable set during training - in spirit of student mimicking teacher behavior and thus pushing towards a more compact class centroid in the feature space. Such a scheme also benefits the reliable set since samples become closer within the same category - implying that it is easier for the classifier to identify. We refer to this mutual learning process as feature intertwiner and embed it into object detection. It is well-known that objects of low resolution are more difficult to detect due to the loss of detailed information during network forward pass (e.g., RoI operation). We thus regard objects of high resolution as the reliable set and objects of low resolution as the less reliable set. Specifically, an intertwiner is designed to minimize the distribution divergence between two sets. The choice of generating an effective feature representation for the reliable set is further investigated, where we introduce the optimal transport (OT) theory into the framework. Samples in the less reliable set are better aligned with aid of OT metric. Incorporated with such a plug-and-play intertwiner, we achieve an evident improvement over previous state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the visual quality of the adversarial examples. Recent papers propose to smooth the perturbations to get rid of high frequency artefacts. In this work, smoothing has a different meaning as it perceptually shapes the perturbation according to the visual content of the image to be attacked. The perturbation becomes locally smooth on the flat areas of the input image, but it may be noisy on its textured areas and sharp across its edges.   This operation relies on Laplacian smoothing, well-known in graph signal processing, which we integrate in the attack pipeline. We benchmark several attacks with and without smoothing under a white-box scenario and evaluate their transferability. Despite the additional constraint of smoothness, our attack has the same probability of success at lower distortion.

- **Summary**: It is challenging to detect the anomaly in crowded scenes for quite a long time. In this paper, a self-supervised framework, abnormal event detection network (AED-Net), which is composed of PCAnet and kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), is proposed to address this problem. Using surveillance video sequences of different scenes as raw data, PCAnet is trained to extract high-level semantics of crowd's situation. Next, kPCA,a one-class classifier, is trained to determine anomaly of the scene. In contrast to some prevailing deep learning methods,the framework is completely self-supervised because it utilizes only video sequences in a normal situation. Experiments of global and local abnormal event detection are carried out on UMN and UCSD datasets, and competitive results with higher EER and AUC compared to other state-of-the-art methods are observed. Furthermore, by adding local response normalization (LRN) layer, we propose an improvement to original AED-Net. And it is proved to perform better by promoting the framework's generalization capacity according to the experiments.

- **Summary**: We are concerned with the vulnerability of computer vision models to distributional shifts. We formulate a combinatorial optimization problem that allows evaluating the regions in the image space where a given model is more vulnerable, in terms of image transformations applied to the input, and face it with standard search algorithms. We further embed this idea in a training procedure, where we define new data augmentation rules according to the image transformations that the current model is most vulnerable to, over iterations. An empirical evaluation on classification and semantic segmentation problems suggests that the devised algorithm allows to train models that are more robust against content-preserving image manipulations and, in general, against distributional shifts.

- **Summary**: A major challenge in current optimization research for deep learning is to automatically find optimal step sizes for each update step. The optimal step size is closely related to the shape of the loss in the update step direction. However, this shape has not yet been examined in detail. This work shows empirically that the batch loss over lines in negative gradient direction is mostly convex locally and well suited for one-dimensional parabolic approximations. By exploiting this parabolic property we introduce a simple and robust line search approach, which performs loss-shape dependent update steps. Our approach combines well-known methods such as parabolic approximation, line search and conjugate gradient, to perform efficiently. It surpasses other step size estimating methods and competes with common optimization methods on a large variety of experiments without the need of hand-designed step size schedules. Thus, it is of interest for objectives where step-size schedules are unknown or do not perform well. Our extensive evaluation includes multiple comprehensive hyperparameter grid searches on several datasets and architectures. Finally, we provide a general investigation of exact line searches in the context of batch losses and exact losses, including their relation to our line search approach.

- **Summary**: Face manipulation has shown remarkable advances with the flourish of Generative Adversarial Networks. However, due to the difficulties of controlling structures and textures, it is challenging to model poses and expressions simultaneously, especially for the extreme manipulation at high-resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simplifies face manipulation into two correlated stages: a boundary prediction stage and a disentangled face synthesis stage. The first stage models poses and expressions jointly via boundary images. Specifically, a conditional encoder-decoder network is employed to predict the boundary image of the target face in a semi-supervised way. Pose and expression estimators are introduced to improve the prediction performance. In the second stage, the predicted boundary image and the input face image are encoded into the structure and the texture latent space by two encoder networks, respectively. A proxy network and a feature threshold loss are further imposed to disentangle the latent space. Furthermore, due to the lack of high-resolution face manipulation databases to verify the effectiveness of our method, we collect a new high-quality Multi-View Face (MVF-HQ) database. It contains 120,283 images at 6000x4000 resolution from 479 identities with diverse poses, expressions, and illuminations. MVF-HQ is much larger in scale and much higher in resolution than publicly available high-resolution face manipulation databases. We will release MVF-HQ soon to push forward the advance of face manipulation. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on four databases show that our method dramatically improves the synthesis quality.

- **Summary**: Recently, the state-of-the-art models for image captioning have overtaken human performance based on the most popular metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr. Does this mean we have solved the task of image captioning? The above metrics only measure the similarity of the generated caption to the human annotations, which reflects its accuracy. However, an image contains many concepts and multiple levels of detail, and thus there is a variety of captions that express different concepts and details that might be interesting for different humans. Therefore only evaluating accuracy is not sufficient for measuring the performance of captioning models --- the diversity of the generated captions should also be considered. In this paper, we proposed a new metric for measuring the diversity of image captions, which is derived from latent semantic analysis and kernelized to use CIDEr similarity. We conduct extensive experiments to re-evaluate recent captioning models in the context of both diversity and accuracy. We find that there is still a large gap between the model and human performance in terms of both accuracy and diversity and the models that have optimized accuracy (CIDEr) have low diversity. We also show that balancing the cross-entropy loss and CIDEr reward in reinforcement learning during training can effectively control the tradeoff between diversity and accuracy of the generated captions.

- **Summary**: Successive frames of a video are highly redundant, and the most popular object detection methods do not take advantage of this fact. Using multiple consecutive frames can improve detection of small objects or difficult examples and can improve speed and detection consistency in a video sequence, for instance by interpolating features between frames. In this work, a novel approach is introduced to perform online video object detection using two consecutive frames of video sequences involving road users. Two new models, RetinaNet-Double and RetinaNet-Flow, are proposed, based respectively on the concatenation of a target frame with a preceding frame, and the concatenation of the optical flow with the target frame. The models are trained and evaluated on three public datasets. Experiments show that using a preceding frame improves performance over single frame detectors, but using explicit optical flow usually does not.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a hybrid depth imaging system in which a polarisation camera is augmented by a second image from a standard digital camera. For this modest increase in equipment complexity over conventional shape-from-polarisation, we obtain a number of benefits that enable us to overcome longstanding problems with the polarisation shape cue. The stereo cue provides a depth map which, although coarse, is metrically accurate. This is used as a guide surface for disambiguation of the polarisation surface normal estimates using a higher order graphical model. In turn, these are used to estimate diffuse albedo. By extending a previous shape-from-polarisation method to the perspective case, we show how to compute dense, detailed maps of absolute depth, while retaining a linear formulation. We show that our hybrid method is able to recover dense 3D geometry that is superior to state-of-the-art shape-from-polarisation or two view stereo alone.

- **Summary**: We present a 3-step registration pipeline for differently stained histological serial sections that consists of 1) a robust pre-alignment, 2) a parametric registration computed on coarse resolution images, and 3) an accurate nonlinear registration. In all three steps the NGF distance measure is minimized with respect to an increasingly flexible transformation. We apply the method in the ANHIR image registration challenge and evaluate its performance on the training data. The presented method is robust (error reduction in 99.6% of the cases), fast (runtime 4 seconds) and accurate (median relative target registration error 0.19%).

- **Summary**: In this paper, we proposed a no-reference (NR) quality metric for RGB plus image-depth (RGB-D) synthesis images based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), namely GANs-NQM. Due to the failure of the inpainting on dis-occluded regions in RGB-D synthesis process, to capture the non-uniformly distributed local distortions and to learn their impact on perceptual quality are challenging tasks for objective quality metrics. In our study, based on the characteristics of GANs, we proposed i) a novel training strategy of GANs for RGB-D synthesis images using existing large-scale computer vision datasets rather than RGB-D dataset; ii) a referenceless quality metric based on the trained discriminator by learning a `Bag of Distortion Word' (BDW) codebook and a local distortion regions selector; iii) a hole filling inpainter, i.e., the generator of the trained GANs, for RGB-D dis-occluded regions as a side outcome. According to the experimental results on IRCCyN/IVC DIBR database, the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art quality metrics, in addition, is more applicable in real scenarios. The corresponding context inpainter also shows appealing results over other inpainting algorithms.

- **Summary**: Typical multi-task learning (MTL) methods rely on architectural adjustments and a large trainable parameter set to jointly optimize over several tasks. However, when the number of tasks increases so do the complexity of the architectural adjustments and resource requirements. In this paper, we introduce a method which applies a conditional feature-wise transformation over the convolutional activations that enables a model to successfully perform a large number of tasks. To distinguish from regular MTL, we introduce Many Task Learning (MaTL) as a special case of MTL where more than 20 tasks are performed by a single model. Our method dubbed Task Routing (TR) is encapsulated in a layer we call the Task Routing Layer (TRL), which applied in an MaTL scenario successfully fits hundreds of classification tasks in one model. We evaluate our method on 5 datasets against strong baselines and state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Leather is a natural and durable material created through a process of tanning of hides and skins of animals. The price of the leather is subjective as it is highly sensitive to its quality and surface defects condition. In the literature, there are very few works investigating on the defects detection for leather using automatic image processing techniques. The manual defect inspection process is essential in an leather production industry to control the quality of the finished products. However, it is tedious, as it is labour intensive, time consuming, causes eye fatigue and often prone to human error. In this paper, a fully automatic defect detection and marking system on a calf leather is proposed. The proposed system consists of a piece of leather, LED light, high resolution camera and a robot arm. Succinctly, a machine vision method is presented to identify the position of the defects on the leather using a deep learning architecture. Then, a series of processes are conducted to predict the defect instances, including elicitation of the leather images with a robot arm, train and test the images using a deep learning architecture and determination of the boundary of the defects using mathematical derivation of the geometry. Note that, all the processes do not involve human intervention, except for the defect ground truths construction stage. The proposed algorithm is capable to exhibit 91.5% segmentation accuracy on the train data and 70.35% on the test data. We also report confusion matrix, F1-score, precision and specificity, sensitivity performance metrics to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: In this work, we study robust deep learning against abnormal training data from the perspective of example weighting built in empirical loss functions, i.e., gradient magnitude with respect to logits, an angle that is not thoroughly studied so far. Consequently, we have two key findings: (1) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Does Not Treat Examples Equally. We present new observations and insightful analysis about MAE, which is theoretically proved to be noise-robust. First, we reveal its underfitting problem in practice. Second, we analyse that MAE's noise-robustness is from emphasising on uncertain examples instead of treating training samples equally, as claimed in prior work. (2) The Variance of Gradient Magnitude Matters. We propose an effective and simple solution to enhance MAE's fitting ability while preserving its noise-robustness. Without changing MAE's overall weighting scheme, i.e., what examples get higher weights, we simply change its weighting variance non-linearly so that the impact ratio between two examples are adjusted. Our solution is termed Improved MAE (IMAE). We prove IMAE's effectiveness using extensive experiments: image classification under clean labels, synthetic label noise, and real-world unknown noise.

- **Summary**: Detailed whole brain segmentation is an essential quantitative technique, which provides a non-invasive way of measuring brain regions from a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, deep convolution neural network (CNN) has been applied to whole brain segmentation. However, restricted by current GPU memory, 2D based methods, downsampling based 3D CNN methods, and patch-based high-resolution 3D CNN methods have been the de facto standard solutions. 3D patch-based high resolution methods typically yield superior performance among CNN approaches on detailed whole brain segmentation (>100 labels), however, whose performance are still commonly inferior compared with multi-atlas segmentation methods (MAS) due to the following challenges: (1) a single network is typically used to learn both spatial and contextual information for the patches, (2) limited manually traced whole brain volumes are available (typically less than 50) for training a network. In this work, we propose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to distribute multiple independent 3D fully convolutional networks (FCN) for high-resolution whole brain segmentation. To address the first challenge, multiple spatially distributed networks were used in the SLANT method, in which each network learned contextual information for a fixed spatial location. To address the second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled scans were created by multi-atlas segmentation for training. Since the method integrated multiple traditional medical image processing methods with deep learning, we developed a containerized pipeline to deploy the end-to-end solution. From the results, the proposed method achieved superior performance compared with multi-atlas segmentation methods, while reducing the computational time from >30 hours to 15 minutes (https://github.com/MASILab/SLANTbrainSeg).

- **Summary**: Learning descriptive spatio-temporal object models from data is paramount for the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation. Most existing approaches mainly rely on models that estimate the segmentation mask based on a reference mask at the first frame (aided sometimes by optical flow or the previous mask). These models, however, are prone to fail under rapid appearance changes or occlusions due to their limitations in modelling the temporal component. On the other hand, very recently, other approaches learned long-term features using a convolutional LSTM to leverage the information from all previous video frames. Even though these models achieve better temporal representations, they still have to be fine-tuned for every new video sequence. In this paper, we present an intermediate solution and devise a novel GAN architecture, FaSTGAN, to learn spatio-temporal object models over finite temporal windows. To achieve this, we concentrate all the heavy computational load to the training phase with two critics that enforce spatial and temporal mask consistency over the last K frames. Then at test time, we only use a relatively light regressor, which reduces the inference time considerably. As a result, our approach combines a high resiliency to sudden geometric and photometric object changes with efficiency at test time (no need for fine-tuning nor post-processing). We demonstrate that the accuracy of our method is on par with state-of-the-art techniques on the challenging YouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets, while running at 32 fps, about 4x faster than the closest competitor.

- **Summary**: Sliding-window object detectors that generate bounding-box object predictions over a dense, regular grid have advanced rapidly and proven popular. In contrast, modern instance segmentation approaches are dominated by methods that first detect object bounding boxes, and then crop and segment these regions, as popularized by Mask R-CNN. In this work, we investigate the paradigm of dense sliding-window instance segmentation, which is surprisingly under-explored. Our core observation is that this task is fundamentally different than other dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or bounding-box object detection, as the output at every spatial location is itself a geometric structure with its own spatial dimensions. To formalize this, we treat dense instance segmentation as a prediction task over 4D tensors and present a general framework called TensorMask that explicitly captures this geometry and enables novel operators on 4D tensors. We demonstrate that the tensor view leads to large gains over baselines that ignore this structure, and leads to results comparable to Mask R-CNN. These promising results suggest that TensorMask can serve as a foundation for novel advances in dense mask prediction and a more complete understanding of the task. Code will be made available.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to count arbitrary objects in images. The leading counting approaches start from point annotations per object from which they construct density maps. Then, their training objective transforms input images to density maps through deep convolutional networks. We posit that the point annotations serve more supervision purposes than just constructing density maps. We introduce ways to repurpose the points for free. First, we propose supervised focus from segmentation, where points are converted into binary maps. The binary maps are combined with a network branch and accompanying loss function to focus on areas of interest. Second, we propose supervised focus from global density, where the ratio of point annotations to image pixels is used in another branch to regularize the overall density estimation. To assist both the density estimation and the focus from segmentation, we also introduce an improved kernel size estimator for the point annotations. Experiments on six datasets show that all our contributions reduce the counting error, regardless of the base network, resulting in state-of-the-art accuracy using only a single network. Finally, we are the first to count on WIDER FACE, allowing us to show the benefits of our approach in handling varying object scales and crowding levels.

- **Summary**: In a wide array of areas, algorithms are matching and surpassing the performance of human experts, leading to consideration of the roles of human judgment and algorithmic prediction in these domains. The discussion around these developments, however, has implicitly equated the specific task of prediction with the general task of automation. We argue here that automation is broader than just a comparison of human versus algorithmic performance on a task; it also involves the decision of which instances of the task to give to the algorithm in the first place. We develop a general framework that poses this latter decision as an optimization problem, and we show how basic heuristics for this optimization problem can lead to performance gains even on heavily-studied applications of AI in medicine. Our framework also serves to highlight how effective automation depends crucially on estimating both algorithmic and human error on an instance-by-instance basis, and our results show how improvements in these error estimation problems can yield significant gains for automation as well.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation is critical for learning in new and unseen environments. With domain adversarial training, deep networks can learn disentangled and transferable features that effectively diminish the dataset shift between the source and target domains for knowledge transfer. In the era of Big Data, the ready availability of large-scale labeled datasets has stimulated wide interest in partial domain adaptation (PDA), which transfers a recognizer from a labeled large domain to an unlabeled small domain. It extends standard domain adaptation to the scenario where target labels are only a subset of source labels. Under the condition that target labels are unknown, the key challenge of PDA is how to transfer relevant examples in the shared classes to promote positive transfer, and ignore irrelevant ones in the specific classes to mitigate negative transfer. In this work, we propose a unified approach to PDA, Example Transfer Network (ETN), which jointly learns domain-invariant representations across the source and target domains, and a progressive weighting scheme that quantifies the transferability of source examples while controlling their importance to the learning task in the target domain. A thorough evaluation on several benchmark datasets shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for partial domain adaptation tasks.

- **Summary**: Detection and segmentation of objects in overheard imagery is a challenging task. The variable density, random orientation, small size, and instance-to-instance heterogeneity of objects in overhead imagery calls for approaches distinct from existing models designed for natural scene datasets. Though new overhead imagery datasets are being developed, they almost universally comprise a single view taken from directly overhead ("at nadir"), failing to address a critical variable: look angle. By contrast, views vary in real-world overhead imagery, particularly in dynamic scenarios such as natural disasters where first looks are often over 40 degrees off-nadir. This represents an important challenge to computer vision methods, as changing view angle adds distortions, alters resolution, and changes lighting. At present, the impact of these perturbations for algorithmic detection and segmentation of objects is untested. To address this problem, we present an open source Multi-View Overhead Imagery dataset, termed SpaceNet MVOI, with 27 unique looks from a broad range of viewing angles (-32.5 degrees to 54.0 degrees). Each of these images cover the same 665 square km geographic extent and are annotated with 126,747 building footprint labels, enabling direct assessment of the impact of viewpoint perturbation on model performance. We benchmark multiple leading segmentation and object detection models on: (1) building detection, (2) generalization to unseen viewing angles and resolutions, and (3) sensitivity of building footprint extraction to changes in resolution. We find that state of the art segmentation and object detection models struggle to identify buildings in off-nadir imagery and generalize poorly to unseen views, presenting an important benchmark to explore the broadly relevant challenge of detecting small, heterogeneous target objects in visually dynamic contexts.

- **Summary**: Improving object detectors against occlusion, blur and noise is a critical step to deploy detectors in real applications. Since it is not possible to exhaust all image defects through data collection, many researchers seek to generate hard samples in training. The generated hard samples are either images or feature maps with coarse patches dropped out in the spatial dimensions. Significant overheads are required in training the extra hard samples and/or estimating drop-out patches using extra network branches. In this paper, we improve object detectors using a highly efficient and fine-grain mechanism called Inverted Attention (IA). Different from the original detector network that only focuses on the dominant part of objects, the detector network with IA iteratively inverts attention on feature maps and puts more attention on complementary object parts, feature channels and even context. Our approach (1) operates along both the spatial and channels dimensions of the feature maps; (2) requires no extra training on hard samples, no extra network parameters for attention estimation, and no testing overheads. Experiments show that our approach consistently improved both two-stage and single-stage detectors on benchmark databases.

- **Summary**: In this paper we establish rigorous benchmarks for image classifier robustness. Our first benchmark, ImageNet-C, standardizes and expands the corruption robustness topic, while showing which classifiers are preferable in safety-critical applications. Then we propose a new dataset called ImageNet-P which enables researchers to benchmark a classifier's robustness to common perturbations. Unlike recent robustness research, this benchmark evaluates performance on common corruptions and perturbations not worst-case adversarial perturbations. We find that there are negligible changes in relative corruption robustness from AlexNet classifiers to ResNet classifiers. Afterward we discover ways to enhance corruption and perturbation robustness. We even find that a bypassed adversarial defense provides substantial common perturbation robustness. Together our benchmarks may aid future work toward networks that robustly generalize.

- **Summary**: Several important security issues of Deep Neural Network (DNN) have been raised recently associated with different applications and components. The most widely investigated security concern of DNN is from its malicious input, a.k.a adversarial example. Nevertheless, the security challenge of DNN's parameters is not well explored yet. In this work, we are the first to propose a novel DNN weight attack methodology called Bit-Flip Attack (BFA) which can crush a neural network through maliciously flipping extremely small amount of bits within its weight storage memory system (i.e., DRAM). The bit-flip operations could be conducted through well-known Row-Hammer attack, while our main contribution is to develop an algorithm to identify the most vulnerable bits of DNN weight parameters (stored in memory as binary bits), that could maximize the accuracy degradation with a minimum number of bit-flips. Our proposed BFA utilizes a Progressive Bit Search (PBS) method which combines gradient ranking and progressive search to identify the most vulnerable bit to be flipped. With the aid of PBS, we can successfully attack a ResNet-18 fully malfunction (i.e., top-1 accuracy degrade from 69.8% to 0.1%) only through 13 bit-flips out of 93 million bits, while randomly flipping 100 bits merely degrades the accuracy by less than 1%.

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning in image classification aims to learn a classifier to classify images when only few training examples are available for each class. Recent work has achieved promising classification performance, where an image-level feature based measure is usually used. In this paper, we argue that a measure at such a level may not be effective enough in light of the scarcity of examples in few-shot learning. Instead, we think a local descriptor based image-to-class measure should be taken, inspired by its surprising success in the heydays of local invariant features. Specifically, building upon the recent episodic training mechanism, we propose a Deep Nearest Neighbor Neural Network (DN4 in short) and train it in an end-to-end manner. Its key difference from the literature is the replacement of the image-level feature based measure in the final layer by a local descriptor based image-to-class measure. This measure is conducted online via a $k$-nearest neighbor search over the deep local descriptors of convolutional feature maps. The proposed DN4 not only learns the optimal deep local descriptors for the image-to-class measure, but also utilizes the higher efficiency of such a measure in the case of example scarcity, thanks to the exchangeability of visual patterns across the images in the same class. Our work leads to a simple, effective, and computationally efficient framework for few-shot learning. Experimental study on benchmark datasets consistently shows its superiority over the related state-of-the-art, with the largest absolute improvement of $17\%$ over the next best.

- **Summary**: The use of large-scale multifaceted data is common in a wide variety of scientific applications. In many cases, this multifaceted data takes the form of a field-based (Eulerian) and point/trajectory-based (Lagrangian) representation as each has a unique set of advantages in characterizing a system of study. Furthermore, studying the increasing scale and complexity of these multifaceted datasets is limited by perceptual ability and available computational resources, necessitating sophisticated data reduction and feature extraction techniques. In this work, we present a new 4D feature segmentation/extraction scheme that can operate on both the field and point/trajectory data types simultaneously. The resulting features are time-varying data subsets that have both a field and point-based component, and were extracted based on underlying patterns from both data types. This enables researchers to better explore both the spatial and temporal interplay between the two data representations and study underlying phenomena from new perspectives. We parallelize our approach using GPU acceleration and apply it to real world multifaceted datasets to illustrate the types of features that can be extracted and explored.

- **Summary**: The state-of-the-art approaches in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are able to learn a mapping function from one image domain to another with unpaired image data. However, these methods often produce artifacts and can only be able to convert low-level information, but fail to transfer high-level semantic part of images. The reason is mainly that generators do not have the ability to detect the most discriminative semantic part of images, which thus makes the generated images with low-quality. To handle the limitation, in this paper we propose a novel Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (AGGAN), which can detect the most discriminative semantic object and minimize changes of unwanted part for semantic manipulation problems without using extra data and models. The attention-guided generators in AGGAN are able to produce attention masks via a built-in attention mechanism, and then fuse the input image with the attention mask to obtain a target image with high-quality. Moreover, we propose a novel attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions. The proposed AGGAN is trained by an end-to-end fashion with an adversarial loss, cycle-consistency loss, pixel loss and attention loss. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our approach is effective to generate sharper and more accurate images than existing models.

- **Summary**: Mobile robots, performing long-term manipulation activities in human environments, have to perceive a wide variety of objects possessing very different visual characteristics and need to reliably keep track of these throughout the execution of a task. In order to be efficient, robot perception capabilities need to go beyond what is currently perceivable and should be able to answer queries about both current and past scenes. In this paper we investigate a perception system for long-term robot manipulation that keeps track of the changing environment and builds a representation of the perceived world. Specifically we introduce an amortized component that spreads perception tasks throughout the execution cycle. The resulting query driven perception system asynchronously integrates results from logged images into a symbolic and numeric (what we call sub-symbolic) representation that forms the perceptual belief state of the robot.

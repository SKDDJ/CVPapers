- **Summary**: Crowd counting aims to count the number of instantaneous people in a crowded space, and many promising solutions have been proposed for single image crowd counting. With the ubiquitous video capture devices in public safety field, how to effectively apply the crowd counting technique to video content has become an urgent problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on temporal aware modeling of the relationship between video frames. The proposed network contains a few dilated residual blocks, and each of them consists of the layers that compute the temporal convolutions of features from the adjacent frames to improve the prediction. To alleviate the expensive computation and satisfy the demand of fast video crowd counting, we also introduce a lightweight network to balance the computational cost with representation ability. We conduct experiments on the crowd counting benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority in terms of effectiveness and efficiency over previous video-based approaches.

- **Summary**: Recognition of ancient Tamil characters has always been a challenge for epigraphers. This is primarily because the language has evolved over the several centuries and the character set over this time has both expanded and diversified. This proposed work focuses on improving optical character recognition techniques for ancient Tamil script which was in use between the 7th and 12th centuries. While comprehensively curating a functional data set for ancient Tamil characters is an arduous task, in this work, a data set has been curated using cropped images of characters found on certain temple inscriptions, specific to this time as a case study. After using Otsu thresholding method for binarization of the image a two dimensional convolution neural network is defined and used to train, classify and, recognize the ancient Tamil characters. To implement the optical character recognition techniques, the neural network is linked to the Tesseract using the pytesseract library of Python. As an added feature, the work also incorporates Google's text to speech voice engine to produce an audio output of the digitized text. Various samples for both modern and ancient Tamil were collected and passed through the system. It is found that for Tamil inscriptions studied over the considered time period, a combined efficiency of 77.7 percent can be achieved.

- **Summary**: Text detection plays a critical role in the whole procedure of textual information extraction and understanding. On a high note, recent years have seen a surge in the high recall text detectors in scene text images, however text boxes for individual words is still a challenging when dense text is present in the scene. In this work, we propose an elegant solution that promotes prediction of words or text lines of arbitrary orientations and directions, providing emphasis on individual words. We also investigate the effects of Receptive Field Blocks(RFB) and its impact in receptive fields for text segments. Experiments were done on the ICDAR2015 and achieves an F-score of 47.09 at 720p

- **Summary**: In this age of social media, people often look at what others are wearing. In particular, Instagram and Twitter influencers often provide images of themselves wearing different outfits and their followers are often inspired to buy similar clothes.We propose a system to automatically find the closest visually similar clothes in the online Catalog (street-to-shop searching). The problem is challenging since the original images are taken under different pose and lighting conditions. The system initially localizes high-level descriptive regions (top, bottom, wristwear. . . ) using multiple CNN detectors such as YOLO and SSD that are trained specifically for apparel domain. It then classifies these regions into more specific regions such as t-shirts, tunic or dresses. Finally, a feature embedding learned using a multi-task function is recovered for every item and then compared with corresponding items in the online Catalog database and ranked according to distance. We validate our approach component-wise using benchmark datasets and end-to-end using human evaluation.

- **Summary**: Timely, accurate and automatic detection of pavement cracks is necessary for making cost-effective decisions concerning road maintenance. Conventional crack detection algorithms focus on the design of single or multiple crack features and classifiers. However, complicated topological structures, varying degrees of damage and oil stains make the design of crack features difficult. In addition, the contextual information around a crack is not investigated extensively in the design process. Accordingly, these design features have limited discriminative adaptability and cannot fuse effectively with the classifiers. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a deep learning network for pavement crack detection. Using the Encoder-Decoder structure, crack characteristics with multiple contexts are automatically learned, and end-to-end crack detection is achieved. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-Dilation (MD) module, which can synthesize the crack features of multiple context sizes via dilated convolution with multiple rates. The crack MD features obtained in this module can describe cracks of different widths and topologies. Next, we propose the SE-Upsampling (SEU) module, which uses the Squeeze-and-Excitation learning operation to optimize the MD features. Finally, the above two modules are integrated to develop the fast crack detection network, namely, FPCNet. This network continuously optimizes the MD features step-by-step to realize fast pixel-level crack detection. Experiments are conducted on challenging public CFD datasets and G45 crack datasets involving various crack types under different shooting conditions. The distinct performance and speed improvements over all the datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art crack detection methods.

- **Summary**: Image deblurring is a fundamental and challenging low-level vision problem. Previous vision research indicates that edge structure in natural scenes is one of the most important factors to estimate the abilities of human visual perception. In this paper, we resort to human visual demands of sharp edges and propose a two-phase edge-aware deep network to improve deep image deblurring. An edge detection convolutional subnet is designed in the first phase and a residual fully convolutional deblur subnet is then used for generating deblur results. The introduction of the edge-aware network enables our model with the specific capacity of enhancing images with sharp edges. We successfully apply our framework on standard benchmarks and promising results are achieved by our proposed deblur model.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning have pushed the performances of visual saliency models way further than it has ever been. Numerous models in the literature present new ways to design neural networks, to arrange gaze pattern data, or to extract as much high and low-level image features as possible in order to create the best saliency representation. However, one key part of a typical deep learning model is often neglected: the choice of the loss function.   In this work, we explore some of the most popular loss functions that are used in deep saliency models. We demonstrate that on a fixed network architecture, modifying the loss function can significantly improve (or depreciate) the results, hence emphasizing the importance of the choice of the loss function when designing a model. We also introduce new loss functions that have never been used for saliency prediction to our knowledge. And finally, we show that a linear combination of several well-chosen loss functions leads to significant improvements in performances on different datasets as well as on a different network architecture, hence demonstrating the robustness of a combined metric.

- **Summary**: With the recent advances in complex networks theory, graph-based techniques for image segmentation has attracted great attention recently. In order to segment the image into meaningful connected components, this paper proposes an image segmentation general framework using complex networks based community detection algorithms. If we consider regions as communities, using community detection algorithms directly can lead to an over-segmented image. To address this problem, we start by splitting the image into small regions using an initial segmentation. The obtained regions are used for building the complex network. To produce meaningful connected components and detect homogeneous communities, some combinations of color and texture based features are employed in order to quantify the regions similarities. To sum up, the network of regions is constructed adaptively to avoid many small regions in the image, and then, community detection algorithms are applied on the resulting adaptive similarity matrix to obtain the final segmented image. Experiments are conducted on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and four of the most influential community detection algorithms are tested. Experimental results have shown that the proposed general framework increases the segmentation performances compared to some existing methods.

- **Summary**: By borrowing the wisdom of human in gaze following, we propose a two-stage solution for gaze point prediction of the target persons in a scene. Specifically, in the first stage, both head image and its position are fed into a gaze direction pathway to predict the gaze direction, and then multi-scale gaze direction fields are generated to characterize the distribution of gaze points without considering the scene contents. In the second stage, the multi-scale gaze direction fields are concatenated with the image contents and fed into a heatmap pathway for heatmap regression. There are two merits for our two-stage solution based gaze following: i) our solution mimics the behavior of human in gaze following, therefore it is more psychological plausible; ii) besides using heatmap to supervise the output of our network, we can also leverage gaze direction to facilitate the training of gaze direction pathway, therefore our network can be more robustly trained. Considering that existing gaze following dataset is annotated by the third-view persons, we build a video gaze following dataset, where the ground truth is annotated by the observers in the videos. Therefore it is more reliable. The evaluation with such a dataset reflects the capacity of different methods in real scenarios better. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, which validates the effectiveness of our solution for gaze following. Our dataset and codes are released in https://github.com/svip-lab/GazeFollowing.

- **Summary**: In this work, we address the task of natural image generation guided by a conditioning input. We introduce a new architecture called conditional invertible neural network (cINN). The cINN combines the purely generative INN model with an unconstrained feed-forward network, which efficiently preprocesses the conditioning input into useful features. All parameters of the cINN are jointly optimized with a stable, maximum likelihood-based training procedure. By construction, the cINN does not experience mode collapse and generates diverse samples, in contrast to e.g. cGANs. At the same time our model produces sharp images since no reconstruction loss is required, in contrast to e.g. VAEs. We demonstrate these properties for the tasks of MNIST digit generation and image colorization. Furthermore, we take advantage of our bi-directional cINN architecture to explore and manipulate emergent properties of the latent space, such as changing the image style in an intuitive way.

- **Summary**: Deep learning for medical image classification faces three major challenges: 1) the number of annotated medical images for training are usually small; 2) regions of interest (ROIs) are relatively small with unclear boundaries in the whole medical images, and may appear in arbitrary positions across the x,y (and also z in 3D images) dimensions. However often only labels of the whole images are annotated, and localized ROIs are unavailable; and 3) ROIs in medical images often appear in varying sizes (scales). We approach these three challenges with a Multi-Instance Multi-Scale (MIMS) CNN: 1) We propose a multi-scale convolutional layer, which extracts patterns of different receptive fields with a shared set of convolutional kernels, so that scale-invariant patterns are captured by this compact set of kernels. As this layer contains only a small number of parameters, training on small datasets becomes feasible; 2) We propose a "top-k pooling" to aggregate the feature maps in varying scales from multiple spatial dimensions, allowing the model to be trained using weak annotations within the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework. Our method is shown to perform well on three classification tasks involving two 3D and two 2D medical image datasets.

- **Summary**: Synthetic visual data can provide practically infinite diversity and rich labels, while avoiding ethical issues with privacy and bias. However, for many tasks, current models trained on synthetic data generalize poorly to real data. The task of 3D human pose estimation is a particularly interesting example of this sim2real problem, because learning-based approaches perform reasonably well given real training data, yet labeled 3D poses are extremely difficult to obtain in the wild, limiting scalability. In this paper, we show that standard neural-network approaches, which perform poorly when trained on synthetic RGB images, can perform well when the data is pre-processed to extract cues about the person's motion, notably as optical flow and the motion of 2D keypoints. Therefore, our results suggest that motion can be a simple way to bridge a sim2real gap when video is available. We evaluate on the 3D Poses in the Wild dataset, the most challenging modern benchmark for 3D pose estimation, where we show full 3D mesh recovery that is on par with state-of-the-art methods trained on real 3D sequences, despite training only on synthetic humans from the SURREAL dataset.

- **Summary**: Adversarially trained generative models (GANs) have recently achieved compelling image synthesis results. But despite early successes in using GANs for unsupervised representation learning, they have since been superseded by approaches based on self-supervision. In this work we show that progress in image generation quality translates to substantially improved representation learning performance. Our approach, BigBiGAN, builds upon the state-of-the-art BigGAN model, extending it to representation learning by adding an encoder and modifying the discriminator. We extensively evaluate the representation learning and generation capabilities of these BigBiGAN models, demonstrating that these generation-based models achieve the state of the art in unsupervised representation learning on ImageNet, as well as in unconditional image generation. Pretrained BigBiGAN models -- including image generators and encoders -- are available on TensorFlow Hub (https://tfhub.dev/s?publisher=deepmind&q=bigbigan).

- **Summary**: Many problems in computer vision require dealing with sparse, unordered data in the form of point clouds. Permutation-equivariant networks have become a popular solution-they operate on individual data points with simple perceptrons and extract contextual information with global pooling. This can be achieved with a simple normalization of the feature maps, a global operation that is unaffected by the order. In this paper, we propose Attentive Context Normalization (ACN), a simple yet effective technique to build permutation-equivariant networks robust to outliers. Specifically, we show how to normalize the feature maps with weights that are estimated within the network, excluding outliers from this normalization. We use this mechanism to leverage two types of attention: local and global-by combining them, our method is able to find the essential data points in high-dimensional space to solve a given task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach, which we call Attentive Context Networks (ACNe), provides a significant leap in performance compared to the state-of-the-art on camera pose estimation, robust fitting, and point cloud classification under noise and outliers.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed a substantial increase in the deep learning (DL)architectures proposed for visual recognition tasks like person re-identification,where individuals must be recognized over multiple distributed cameras. Althoughthese architectures have greatly improved the state-of-the-art accuracy, thecomputational complexity of the CNNs commonly used for feature extractionremains an issue, hindering their deployment on platforms with limited resources,or in applications with real-time constraints. There is an obvious advantage toaccelerating and compressing DL models without significantly decreasing theiraccuracy. However, the source (pruning) domain differs from operational (target)domains, and the domain shift between image data captured with differentnon-overlapping camera viewpoints leads to lower recognition accuracy. In thispaper, we investigate the prunability of these architectures under different designscenarios. This paper first revisits pruning techniques that are suitable forreducing the computational complexity of deep CNN networks applied to personre-identification. Then, these techniques are analysed according to their pruningcriteria and strategy, and according to different scenarios for exploiting pruningmethods to fine-tuning networks to target domains. Experimental resultsobtained using DL models with ResNet feature extractors, and multiplebenchmarks re-identification datasets, indicate that pruning can considerablyreduce network complexity while maintaining a high level of accuracy. Inscenarios where pruning is performed with large pre-training or fine-tuningdatasets, the number of FLOPS required by ResNet architectures is reduced byhalf, while maintaining a comparable rank-1 accuracy (within 1% of the originalmodel). Pruning while training a larger CNNs can also provide a significantlybetter performance than fine-tuning smaller ones.

- **Summary**: We propose a deep learning-based technique for detection and quantification of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The condition, which leads to more than 10,000 deaths per year in the United States, is asymptomatic, often detected incidentally, and often missed by radiologists. Our model architecture is a modified 3D U-Net combined with ellipse fitting that performs aorta segmentation and AAA detection. The study uses 321 abdominal-pelvic CT examinations performed by Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Radiology for training and validation. The model is then further tested for generalizability on a separate set of 57 examinations with differing patient demographics and acquisition characteristics than the original dataset. DeepAAA achieves high performance on both sets of data (sensitivity/specificity 0.91/0.95 and 0.85 / 1.0 respectively), on contrast and non-contrast CT scans and works with image volumes with varying numbers of images. We find that DeepAAA exceeds literature-reported performance of radiologists on incidental AAA detection. It is expected that the model can serve as an effective background detector in routine CT examinations to prevent incidental AAAs from being missed.

- **Summary**: Predicting the future trajectories of multiple interacting agents in a scene has become an increasingly important problem for many different applications ranging from control of autonomous vehicles and social robots to security and surveillance. This problem is compounded by the presence of social interactions between humans and their physical interactions with the scene. While the existing literature has explored some of these cues, they mainly ignored the multimodal nature of each human's future trajectory. In this paper, we present Social-BiGAT, a graph-based generative adversarial network that generates realistic, multimodal trajectory predictions by better modelling the social interactions of pedestrians in a scene. Our method is based on a graph attention network (GAT) that learns reliable feature representations that encode the social interactions between humans in the scene, and a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture that is trained adversarially to predict, based on the features, the humans' paths. We explicitly account for the multimodal nature of the prediction problem by forming a reversible transformation between each scene and its latent noise vector, as in Bicycle-GAN. We show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance comparing it to several baselines on existing trajectory forecasting benchmarks.

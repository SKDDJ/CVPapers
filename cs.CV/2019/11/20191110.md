- **Summary**: Effective fusion of data from multiple modalities, such as video, speech, and text, is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of multimodal data. In this paper, we propose adaptive fusion techniques that aim to model context from different modalities effectively. Instead of defining a deterministic fusion operation, such as concatenation, for the network, we let the network decide "how" to combine a given set of multimodal features more effectively. We propose two networks: 1) Auto-Fusion, which learns to compress information from different modalities while preserving the context, and 2) GAN-Fusion, which regularizes the learned latent space given context from complementing modalities. A quantitative evaluation on the tasks of multimodal machine translation and emotion recognition suggests that our lightweight, adaptive networks can better model context from other modalities than existing methods, many of which employ massive transformer-based networks.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the task of interactive image retrieval using natural language queries, where a user progressively provides input queries to refine a set of retrieval results. Moreover, our work explores this problem in the context of complex image scenes containing multiple objects. We propose Drill-down, an effective framework for encoding multiple queries with an efficient compact state representation that significantly extends current methods for single-round image retrieval. We show that using multiple rounds of natural language queries as input can be surprisingly effective to find arbitrarily specific images of complex scenes. Furthermore, we find that existing image datasets with textual captions can provide a surprisingly effective form of weak supervision for this task. We compare our method with existing sequential encoding and embedding networks, demonstrating superior performance on two proposed benchmarks: automatic image retrieval on a simulated scenario that uses region captions as queries, and interactive image retrieval using real queries from human evaluators.

- **Summary**: Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is a challenging task due to the large cross-domain gap between sketches and natural images. How to align abstract sketches and natural images into a common high-level semantic space remains a key problem in SBIR. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-heterogeneous three-way joint embedding network (Semi3-Net), which integrates three branches (a sketch branch, a natural image branch, and an edgemap branch) to learn more discriminative cross-domain feature representations for the SBIR task. The key insight lies with how we cultivate the mutual and subtle relationships amongst the sketches, natural images, and edgemaps. A semi-heterogeneous feature mapping is designed to extract bottom features from each domain, where the sketch and edgemap branches are shared while the natural image branch is heterogeneous to the other branches. In addition, a joint semantic embedding is introduced to embed the features from different domains into a common high-level semantic space, where all of the three branches are shared. To further capture informative features common to both natural images and the corresponding edgemaps, a co-attention model is introduced to conduct common channel-wise feature recalibration between different domains. A hybrid-loss mechanism is designed to align the three branches, where an alignment loss and a sketch-edgemap contrastive loss are presented to encourage the network to learn invariant cross-domain representations. Experimental results on two widely used category-level datasets (Sketchy and TU-Berlin Extension) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have revealed that neural network-based policies can be easily fooled by adversarial examples. However, while most prior works analyze the effects of perturbing every pixel of every frame assuming white-box policy access, in this paper we take a more restrictive view towards adversary generation - with the goal of unveiling the limits of a model's vulnerability. In particular, we explore minimalistic attacks by defining three key settings: (1) black-box policy access: where the attacker only has access to the input (state) and output (action probability) of an RL policy; (2) fractional-state adversary: where only several pixels are perturbed, with the extreme case being a single-pixel adversary; and (3) tactically-chanced attack: where only significant frames are tactically chosen to be attacked. We formulate the adversarial attack by accommodating the three key settings and explore their potency on six Atari games by examining four fully trained state-of-the-art policies. In Breakout, for example, we surprisingly find that: (i) all policies showcase significant performance degradation by merely modifying 0.01% of the input state, and (ii) the policy trained by DQN is totally deceived by perturbation to only 1% frames.

- **Summary**: Quantization is an effective method for reducing memory footprint and inference time of Neural Networks, e.g., for efficient inference in the cloud, especially at the edge. However, ultra low precision quantization could lead to significant degradation in model generalization. A promising method to address this is to perform mixed-precision quantization, where more sensitive layers are kept at higher precision. However, the search space for a mixed-precision quantization is exponential in the number of layers. Recent work has proposed HAWQ, a novel Hessian based framework, with the aim of reducing this exponential search space by using second-order information. While promising, this prior work has three major limitations: (i) HAWQV1 only uses the top Hessian eigenvalue as a measure of sensitivity and do not consider the rest of the Hessian spectrum; (ii) HAWQV1 approach only provides relative sensitivity of different layers and therefore requires a manual selection of the mixed-precision setting; and (iii) HAWQV1 does not consider mixed-precision activation quantization. Here, we present HAWQV2 which addresses these shortcomings. For (i), we perform a theoretical analysis showing that a better sensitivity metric is to compute the average of all of the Hessian eigenvalues. For (ii), we develop a Pareto frontier based method for selecting the exact bit precision of different layers without any manual selection. For (iii), we extend the Hessian analysis to mixed-precision activation quantization. We have found this to be very beneficial for object detection. We show that HAWQV2 achieves new state-of-the-art results for a wide range of tasks.

- **Summary**: Gesture recognition and hand motion tracking are important tasks in advanced gesture based interaction systems. In this paper, we propose to apply a sliding windows filtering approach to sample the incoming streams of data from data gloves and a decision tree model to recognize the gestures in real time for a manual grafting operation of a vegetable seedling propagation facility. The sequence of these recognized gestures defines the tasks that are taking place, which helps to evaluate individuals' performances and to identify any bottlenecks in real time. In this work, two pairs of data gloves are utilized, which reports the location of the fingers, hands, and wrists wirelessly (i.e., via Bluetooth). To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, a preliminary experiment was conducted in multiple lab settings of tomato grafting operations, where multiple subjects wear the data gloves while performing different tasks. Our results show an accuracy of 91% on average, in terms of gesture recognition in real time by employing our proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Treatment of patients with obstructive coronary artery disease is guided by the functional significance of a coronary artery stenosis. Fractional flow reserve (FFR), measured during invasive coronary angiography (ICA), is considered the gold standard to define the functional significance of a coronary stenosis. Here, we present a method for non-invasive detection of patients with functionally significant coronary artery stenosis, combining analysis of the coronary artery tree and the left ventricular (LV) myocardium in cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) images. We retrospectively collected CCTA scans of 126 patients who underwent invasive FFR measurements, to determine the functional significance of coronary stenoses. We combine our previous works for the analysis of the complete coronary artery tree and the LV myocardium: Coronary arteries are encoded by two disjoint convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) and the LV myocardium is characterized by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a CAE. Thereafter, using the extracted encodings of all coronary arteries and the LV myocardium, patients are classified according to the presence of functionally significant stenosis, as defined by the invasively measured FFR. To handle the varying number of coronary arteries in a patient, the classification is formulated as a multiple instance learning problem and is performed using an attention-based neural network. Cross-validation experiments resulted in an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of $0.74 \pm 0.01$, and showed that the proposed combined analysis outperformed the analysis of the coronary arteries or the LV myocardium only. The results demonstrate the feasibility of combining the analyses of the complete coronary artery tree and the LV myocardium in CCTA images for the detection of patients with functionally significant stenosis in coronary arteries.

- **Summary**: Learned dynamic weighting of the conditioning signal (attention) has been shown to improve neural language generation in a variety of settings. The weights applied when generating a particular output sequence have also been viewed as providing a potentially explanatory insight into the internal workings of the generator. In this paper, we reverse the direction of this connection and ask whether through the control of the attention of the model we can control its output. Specifically, we take a standard neural image captioning model that uses attention, and fix the attention to pre-determined areas in the image. We evaluate whether the resulting output is more likely to mention the class of the object in that area than the normally generated caption. We introduce three effective methods to control the attention and find that these are producing expected results in up to 28.56% of the cases.

- **Summary**: When the direct view between the target and the observer is not available, due to obstacles with non-zero sizes, the observation is received after reflection from a reflector, this is the indirect view or Non-Line-Of Sight condition. Localization of a target in NLOS condition still one of the open problems yet. In this paper, we address this problem by localizing the reflector and the target simultaneously using a single stationary receiver, and a determined number of beacons, in which their placements are also analyzed in an unknown map. The work is done in mirror space, when the receiver is a camera, and the reflector is a planar mirror. Furthermore, the distance from the observer to the target is estimated by size constancy concept, and the angle of coming signal is the same as the orientation of the camera, with respect to a global frame. The results show the validation of the proposed work and the simulation results are matched with the theoretical results.

- **Summary**: The progress of deep convolutional neural networks has been successfully exploited in various real-time computer vision tasks such as image classification and segmentation. Owing to the development of computational units, availability of digital datasets, and improved performance of deep learning models, fully automatic and accurate tracking of tongue contours in real-time ultrasound data became practical only in recent years. Recent studies have shown that the performance of deep learning techniques is significant in the tracking of ultrasound tongue contours in real-time applications such as pronunciation training using multimodal ultrasound-enhanced approaches. Due to the high correlation between ultrasound tongue datasets, it is feasible to have a general model that accomplishes automatic tongue tracking for almost all datasets. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning model comprises of a convolutional module mimicking the peripheral vision ability of the human eye to handle real-time, accurate, and fully automatic tongue contour tracking tasks, applicable for almost all primary ultrasound tongue datasets. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of IrisNet on different ultrasound tongue datasets and PASCAL VOC2012 revealed its outstanding generalization achievement in compare with similar techniques.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods have revolutionized speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing since 2010. Each of these tasks involves a single modality in their input signals. However, many applications in the artificial intelligence field involve multiple modalities. Therefore, it is of broad interest to study the more difficult and complex problem of modeling and learning across multiple modalities. In this paper, we provide a technical review of available models and learning methods for multimodal intelligence. The main focus of this review is the combination of vision and natural language modalities, which has become an important topic in both the computer vision and natural language processing research communities. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent works on multimodal deep learning from three perspectives: learning multimodal representations, fusing multimodal signals at various levels, and multimodal applications. Regarding multimodal representation learning, we review the key concepts of embedding, which unify multimodal signals into a single vector space and thereby enable cross-modality signal processing. We also review the properties of many types of embeddings that are constructed and learned for general downstream tasks. Regarding multimodal fusion, this review focuses on special architectures for the integration of representations of unimodal signals for a particular task. Regarding applications, selected areas of a broad interest in the current literature are covered, including image-to-text caption generation, text-to-image generation, and visual question answering. We believe that this review will facilitate future studies in the emerging field of multimodal intelligence for related communities.

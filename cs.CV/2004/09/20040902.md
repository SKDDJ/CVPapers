- **Summary**: As computing technology becomes more pervasive, personal devices such as the PDA, cell-phone, and notebook should use context to determine how to act. Location is one form of context that can be used in many ways. We present a multiple-device system that collects and clusters GPS data into significant locations. These locations are then used to determine travel times and a probabilistic model of the user's schedule, which is used to intelligently alert the user. We evaluate our system and suggest how it should be integrated with a variety of applications.

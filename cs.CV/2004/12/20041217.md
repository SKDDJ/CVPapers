- **Summary**: The collection of wild larvae seed as a source of raw material is a major sub industry of shellfish aquaculture. To predict when, where and in what quantities wild seed will be available, it is necessary to track the appearance and growth of planktonic larvae. One of the most difficult groups to identify, particularly at the species level are the Bivalvia. This difficulty arises from the fact that fundamentally all bivalve larvae have a similar shape and colour. Identification based on gross morphological appearance is limited by the time-consuming nature of the microscopic examination and by the limited availability of expertise in this field. Molecular and immunological methods are also being studied. We describe the application of computational pattern recognition methods to the automated identification and size analysis of scallop larvae. For identification, the shape features used are binary invariant moments; that is, the features are invariant to shift (position within the image), scale (induced either by growth or differential image magnification) and rotation. Images of a sample of scallop and non-scallop larvae covering a range of maturities have been analysed. In order to overcome the automatic identification, as well as to allow the system to receive new unknown samples at any moment, a self-organized and unsupervised ant-like clustering algorithm based on Swarm Intelligence is proposed, followed by simple k-NNR nearest neighbour classification on the final map. Results achieve a full recognition rate of 100% under several situations (k =1 or 3).

- **Summary**: Automatic marbles classification based on their visual appearance is an important industrial issue. However, there is no definitive solution to the problem mainly due to the presence of randomly distributed high number of different colours and its subjective evaluation by the human expert. In this paper we present a study of segmentation techniques, we evaluate they overall performance using a training set and standard quality measures and finally we apply different clustering techniques to automatically classify the marbles.

- **Summary**: This paper is concerned with the problem of establishing an index based on word matching. It is assumed that the book was digitised as better as possible and some pre-processing techniques were already applied as line orientation correction and some noise removal. However two main factor are responsible for being not possible to apply ordinary optical character recognition techniques (OCR): the presence of antique fonts and the degraded state of many characters due to unrecoverable original time degradation. In this paper we make a short introduction to word segmentation that involves finding the lines that characterise a word. After we discuss different approaches for word matching and how they can be combined to obtain an ordered list for candidate words for the matching. This discussion will be illustrated by examples.

- **Summary**: Some recent studies have pointed that, the self-organization of neurons into brain-like structures, and the self-organization of ants into a swarm are similar in many respects. If possible to implement, these features could lead to important developments in pattern recognition systems, where perceptive capabilities can emerge and evolve from the interaction of many simple local rules. The principle of the method is inspired by the work of Chialvo and Millonas who developed the first numerical simulation in which swarm cognitive map formation could be explained. From this point, an extended model is presented in order to deal with digital image habitats, in which artificial ants could be able to react to the environment and perceive it. Evolution of pheromone fields point that artificial ant colonies could react and adapt appropriately to any type of digital habitat.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of a colour image composed of different kinds of texture regions can be a hard problem, namely to compute for an exact texture fields and a decision of the optimum number of segmentation areas in an image when it contains similar and/or unstationary texture fields. In this work, a method is described for evolving adaptive procedures for these problems. In many real world applications data clustering constitutes a fundamental issue whenever behavioural or feature domains can be mapped into topological domains. We formulate the segmentation problem upon such images as an optimisation problem and adopt evolutionary strategy of Genetic Algorithms for the clustering of small regions in colour feature space. The present approach uses k-Means unsupervised clustering methods into Genetic Algorithms, namely for guiding this last Evolutionary Algorithm in his search for finding the optimal or sub-optimal data partition, task that as we know, requires a non-trivial search because of its intrinsic NP-complete nature. To solve this task, the appropriate genetic coding is also discussed, since this is a key aspect in the implementation. Our purpose is to demonstrate the efficiency of Genetic Algorithms to automatic and unsupervised texture segmentation. Some examples in Colour Maps, Ornamental Stones and in Human Skin Mark segmentation are presented and overall results discussed.

- **Summary**: In the absence of a pure noise-free image it is hard to define what noise is, in any original noisy image, and as a consequence also where it is, and in what amount. In fact, the definition of noise depends largely on our own aim in the whole image analysis process, and (perhaps more important) in our self-perception of noise. For instance, when we perceive noise as disconnected and small it is normal to use MM-ASF filters to treat it. There is two evidences of this. First, in many instances there is no ideal and pure noise-free image to compare our filtering process (nothing but our self-perception of its pure image); second, and related with this first point, MM transformations that we chose are only based on our self - and perhaps - fuzzy notion. The present proposal combines the results of two MM filtering transformations (FT1, FT2) and makes use of some measures and quantitative relations on their Size/Intensity Diagrams to find the most appropriate noise removal process. Results can also be used for finding the most appropriate stop criteria, and the right sequence of MM operators combination on Alternating Sequential Filters (ASF), if these measures are applied, for instance, on a Genetic Algorithm's target function.

- **Summary**: The purpose of this paper is to present a complete methodology based on a multidisciplinary approach, that goes from the extraction of features till the classification of a set of different portuguese granites. The set of tools to extract the features that characterise polished surfaces of the granites is mainly based on mathematical morphology. The classification methodology is based on a genetic algorithm capable of search the input feature space used by the nearest neighbour rule classifier. Results show that is adequate to perform feature reduction and simultaneous improve the recognition rate. Moreover, the present methodology represents a robust strategy to understand the proper nature of the images treated, and their discriminant features.

- **Summary**: The present paper deals with optimisation of Nearest Neighbour rule Classifiers via Genetic Algorithms. The methodology consists on implement a Genetic Algorithm capable of search the input feature space used by the NNR classifier. Results show that is adequate to perform feature reduction and simultaneous improve the Recognition Rate. Some practical examples prove that is possible to Recognise Portuguese Granites in 100%, with only 3 morphological features (from an original set of 117 features), which is well suited for real time applications. Moreover, the present method represents a robust strategy to understand the proper nature of the images treated, and their discriminant features.

- **Summary**: A person is given a numbered sequence of positions on a sheet of paper. The person is asked, "Which will be the next (or the next after that) position?" Everyone has an opinion as to how he or she would proceed. There are regular sequences for which there is general agreement on how to continue. However, there are less regular sequences for which this assessment is less certain. There are sequences for which every continuation is perceived to be arbitrary. I would like to present a mathematical model that reflects these opinions and perceptions with the aid of a valuation function. It is necessary to apply a rich set of invariant features of position sequences to ensure the quality of this model. All other properties of the model are arbitrary.

- **Summary**: Efficient visual fault detection of freight trains is a critical part of ensuring the safe operation of railways under the restricted hardware environment. Although deep learning-based approaches have excelled in object detection, the efficiency of freight train fault detection is still insufficient to apply in real-world engineering. This paper proposes a heterogeneous self-distillation framework to ensure detection accuracy and speed while satisfying low resource requirements. The privileged information in the output feature knowledge can be transferred from the teacher to the student model through distillation to boost performance. We first adopt a lightweight backbone to extract features and generate a new heterogeneous knowledge neck. Such neck models positional information and long-range dependencies among channels through parallel encoding to optimize feature extraction capabilities. Then, we utilize the general distribution to obtain more credible and accurate bounding box estimates. Finally, we employ a novel loss function that makes the network easily concentrate on values near the label to improve learning efficiency. Experiments on four fault datasets reveal that our framework can achieve over 37 frames per second and maintain the highest accuracy in comparison with traditional distillation approaches. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our framework demonstrates more competitive performance with lower memory usage and the smallest model size.

- **Summary**: Most existing ultra-high resolution (UHR) segmentation methods always struggle in the dilemma of balancing memory cost and local characterization accuracy, which are both taken into account in our proposed Guided Patch-Grouping Wavelet Transformer (GPWFormer) that achieves impressive performances. In this work, GPWFormer is a Transformer ($\mathcal{T}$)-CNN ($\mathcal{C}$) mutual leaning framework, where $\mathcal{T}$ takes the whole UHR image as input and harvests both local details and fine-grained long-range contextual dependencies, while $\mathcal{C}$ takes downsampled image as input for learning the category-wise deep context. For the sake of high inference speed and low computation complexity, $\mathcal{T}$ partitions the original UHR image into patches and groups them dynamically, then learns the low-level local details with the lightweight multi-head Wavelet Transformer (WFormer) network. Meanwhile, the fine-grained long-range contextual dependencies are also captured during this process, since patches that are far away in the spatial domain can also be assigned to the same group. In addition, masks produced by $\mathcal{C}$ are utilized to guide the patch grouping process, providing a heuristics decision. Moreover, the congruence constraints between the two branches are also exploited to maintain the spatial consistency among the patches. Overall, we stack the multi-stage process in a pyramid way. Experiments show that GPWFormer outperforms the existing methods with significant improvements on five benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: While recent advancements in vision-language models have revolutionized multi-modal understanding, it remains unclear whether they possess the capabilities of comprehending the generated images. Compared to real data, synthetic images exhibit a higher degree of diversity in both content and style, for which there are significant difficulties for the models to fully apprehend. To this end, we present a large-scale dataset, JourneyDB, for multi-modal visual understanding in generative images. Our curated dataset covers 4 million diverse and high-quality generated images paired with the text prompts used to produce them. We further design 4 benchmarks to quantify the performance of generated image understanding in terms of both content and style interpretation. These benchmarks include prompt inversion, style retrieval, image captioning and visual question answering. Lastly, we assess the performance of current state-of-the-art multi-modal models when applied to JourneyDB, and provide an in-depth analysis of their strengths and limitations in generated content understanding. We hope the proposed dataset and benchmarks will facilitate the research in the field of generative content understanding. The dataset will be available on https://journeydb.github.io.

- **Summary**: Collaborative 3D object detection, with its improved interaction advantage among multiple agents, has been widely explored in autonomous driving. However, existing collaborative 3D object detectors in a fully supervised paradigm heavily rely on large-scale annotated 3D bounding boxes, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To tackle this issue, we propose a sparsely supervised collaborative 3D object detection framework SSC3OD, which only requires each agent to randomly label one object in the scene. Specifically, this model consists of two novel components, i.e., the pillar-based masked autoencoder (Pillar-MAE) and the instance mining module. The Pillar-MAE module aims to reason over high-level semantics in a self-supervised manner, and the instance mining module generates high-quality pseudo labels for collaborative detectors online. By introducing these simple yet effective mechanisms, the proposed SSC3OD can alleviate the adverse impacts of incomplete annotations. We generate sparse labels based on collaborative perception datasets to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets reveal that our proposed SSC3OD can effectively improve the performance of sparsely supervised collaborative 3D object detectors.



### LXL: LiDAR Excluded Lean 3D Object Detection with 4D Imaging Radar and Camera Fusion

- **Summary**: As an emerging technology and a relatively affordable device, the 4D imaging radar has already been confirmed effective in performing 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, the sparsity and noisiness of 4D radar point clouds hinder further performance improvement, and in-depth studies about its fusion with other modalities are lacking. On the other hand, as a new image view transformation strategy, "sampling" has been applied in a few image-based detectors and shown to outperform the widely applied "depth-based splatting" proposed in Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS), even without image depth prediction. However, the potential of "sampling" is not fully unleashed. In this paper, we investigate the "sampling" view transformation strategy on the camera and 4D imaging radar fusion-based 3D object detection. In the proposed LiDAR Excluded Lean (LXL) model, predicted image depth distribution maps and radar 3D occupancy grids are generated from image perspective view (PV) features and radar bird's eye view (BEV) features, respectively. They are sent to the core of LXL, called "radar occupancy-assisted depth-based sampling", to aid image view transformation. Introducing image depths and radar information enhances the "sampling" strategy and leads to more accurate view transformation. Experiments on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods by a significant margin without bells and whistles. Ablation studies demonstrate that our method performs the best among different enhancement settings.

- **Summary**: Localization is a fundamental task in robotics for autonomous navigation. Existing localization methods rely on a single input data modality or train several computational models to process different modalities. This leads to stringent computational requirements and sub-optimal results that fail to capitalize on the complementary information in other data streams. This paper proposes UnLoc, a novel unified neural modeling approach for localization with multi-sensor input in all weather conditions. Our multi-stream network can handle LiDAR, Camera and RADAR inputs for localization on demand, i.e., it can work with one or more input sensors, making it robust to sensor failure. UnLoc uses 3D sparse convolutions and cylindrical partitioning of the space to process LiDAR frames and implements ResNet blocks with a slot attention-based feature filtering module for the Radar and image modalities. We introduce a unique learnable modality encoding scheme to distinguish between the input sensor data. Our method is extensively evaluated on Oxford Radar RobotCar, ApolloSouthBay and Perth-WA datasets. The results ascertain the efficacy of our technique.

- **Summary**: Many anomaly detection approaches, especially deep learning methods, have been recently developed to identify abnormal image morphology by only employing normal images during training. Unfortunately, many prior anomaly detection methods were optimized for a specific "known" abnormality (e.g., brain tumor, bone fraction, cell types). Moreover, even though only the normal images were used in the training process, the abnormal images were often employed during the validation process (e.g., epoch selection, hyper-parameter tuning), which might leak the supposed ``unknown" abnormality unintentionally. In this study, we investigated these two essential aspects regarding universal anomaly detection in medical images by (1) comparing various anomaly detection methods across four medical datasets, (2) investigating the inevitable but often neglected issues on how to unbiasedly select the optimal anomaly detection model during the validation phase using only normal images, and (3) proposing a simple decision-level ensemble method to leverage the advantage of different kinds of anomaly detection without knowing the abnormality. The results of our experiments indicate that none of the evaluated methods consistently achieved the best performance across all datasets. Our proposed method enhanced the robustness of performance in general (average AUC 0.956).

- **Summary**: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal graphs that exhibit deviant structures and node attributes compared to the majority in a graph set. One primary challenge is to learn normal patterns manifested in both fine-grained and holistic views of graphs for identifying graphs that are abnormal in part or in whole. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Hierarchical Memory Networks (HimNet), which learns hierarchical memory modules -- node and graph memory modules -- via a graph autoencoder network architecture. The node-level memory module is trained to model fine-grained, internal graph interactions among nodes for detecting locally abnormal graphs, while the graph-level memory module is dedicated to the learning of holistic normal patterns for detecting globally abnormal graphs. The two modules are jointly optimized to detect both locally- and globally-anomalous graphs. Extensive empirical results on 16 real-world graph datasets from various domains show that i) HimNet significantly outperforms the state-of-art methods and ii) it is robust to anomaly contamination.

- **Summary**: Structured network pruning is a practical approach to reduce computation cost directly while retaining the CNNs' generalization performance in real applications. However, identifying redundant filters is a core problem in structured network pruning, and current redundancy criteria only focus on individual filters' attributes. When pruning sparsity increases, these redundancy criteria are not effective or efficient enough. Since the filter-wise interaction also contributes to the CNN's prediction accuracy, we integrate the filter-wise interaction into the redundancy criterion. In our criterion, we introduce the filter importance and filter utilization strength to reflect the decision ability of individual and multiple filters. Utilizing this new redundancy criterion, we propose a structured network pruning approach SNPFI (Structured Network Pruning by measuring Filter-wise Interaction). During the pruning, the SNPFI can automatically assign the proper sparsity based on the filter utilization strength and eliminate the useless filters by filter importance. After the pruning, the SNPFI can recover pruned model's performance effectively without iterative training by minimizing the interaction difference. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNPFI with several commonly used CNN models, including AlexNet, MobileNetv1, and ResNet-50, on various image classification datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. For all experimental CNN models, nearly 60% of computation is reduced in a network compression while the classification accuracy remains.



### Learning Noise-Resistant Image Representation by Aligning Clean and Noisy Domains

- **Summary**: Recent supervised and unsupervised image representation learning algorithms have achieved quantum leaps. However, these techniques do not account for representation resilience against noise in their design paradigms. Consequently, these effective methods suffer failure when confronted with noise outside the training distribution, such as complicated real-world noise that is usually opaque to model training. To address this issue, dual domains are optimized to separately model a canonical space for noisy representations, namely the Noise-Robust (NR) domain, and a twinned canonical clean space, namely the Noise-Free (NF) domain, by maximizing the interaction information between the representations. Given the dual canonical domains, we design a target-guided implicit neural mapping function to accurately translate the NR representations to the NF domain, yielding noise-resistant representations by eliminating noise regencies. The proposed method is a scalable module that can be readily integrated into existing learning systems to improve their robustness against noise. Comprehensive trials of various tasks using both synthetic and real-world noisy data demonstrate that the proposed Target-Guided Dual-Domain Translation (TDDT) method is able to achieve remarkable performance and robustness in the face of complex noisy images.



### Hierarchical Open-vocabulary Universal Image Segmentation

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary image segmentation aims to partition an image into semantic regions according to arbitrary text descriptions. However, complex visual scenes can be naturally decomposed into simpler parts and abstracted at multiple levels of granularity, introducing inherent segmentation ambiguity. Unlike existing methods that typically sidestep this ambiguity and treat it as an external factor, our approach actively incorporates a hierarchical representation encompassing different semantic-levels into the learning process. We propose a decoupled text-image fusion mechanism and representation learning modules for both "things" and "stuff".1 Additionally, we systematically examine the differences that exist in the textual and visual features between these types of categories. Our resulting model, named HIPIE, tackles HIerarchical, oPen-vocabulary, and unIvErsal segmentation tasks within a unified framework. Benchmarked on over 40 datasets, e.g., ADE20K, COCO, Pascal-VOC Part, RefCOCO/RefCOCOg, ODinW and SeginW, HIPIE achieves the state-of-the-art results at various levels of image comprehension, including semantic-level (e.g., semantic segmentation), instance-level (e.g., panoptic/referring segmentation and object detection), as well as part-level (e.g., part/subpart segmentation) tasks. Our code is released at https://github.com/berkeley-hipie/HIPIE.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated excellent performance in image generation. Although various few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) models with different network structures have been proposed, performance improvement has reached a bottleneck. This paper presents the first work to leverage the diffusion model for FSS task, called DifFSS. DifFSS, a novel FSS paradigm, can further improve the performance of the state-of-the-art FSS models by a large margin without modifying their network structure. Specifically, we utilize the powerful generation ability of diffusion models to generate diverse auxiliary support images by using the semantic mask, scribble or soft HED boundary of the support image as control conditions. This generation process simulates the variety within the class of the query image, such as color, texture variation, lighting, $etc$. As a result, FSS models can refer to more diverse support images, yielding more robust representations, thereby achieving a consistent improvement in segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets based on existing advanced FSS models demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model for FSS task. Furthermore, we explore in detail the impact of different input settings of the diffusion model on segmentation performance. Hopefully, this completely new paradigm will bring inspiration to the study of FSS task integrated with AI-generated content.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have gained significant popularity in the field of image-to-image translation. Previous efforts applying diffusion models to image super-resolution (SR) have demonstrated that iteratively refining pure Gaussian noise using a U-Net architecture trained on denoising at various noise levels can yield satisfactory high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. However, this iterative refinement process comes with the drawback of low inference speed, which strongly limits its applications. To speed up inference and further enhance the performance, our research revisits diffusion models in image super-resolution and proposes a straightforward yet significant diffusion model-based super-resolution method called ACDMSR (accelerated conditional diffusion model for image super-resolution). Specifically, our method adapts the standard diffusion model to perform super-resolution through a deterministic iterative denoising process. Our study also highlights the effectiveness of using a pre-trained SR model to provide the conditional image of the given low-resolution (LR) image to achieve superior high-resolution results. We demonstrate that our method surpasses previous attempts in qualitative and quantitative results through extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets such as Set5, Set14, Urban100, BSD100, and Manga109. Moreover, our approach generates more visually realistic counterparts for low-resolution images, emphasizing its effectiveness in practical scenarios.

- **Summary**: Modeling 3D avatars benefits various application scenarios such as AR/VR, gaming, and filming. Character faces contribute significant diversity and vividity as a vital component of avatars. However, building 3D character face models usually requires a heavy workload with commercial tools, even for experienced artists. Various existing sketch-based tools fail to support amateurs in modeling diverse facial shapes and rich geometric details. In this paper, we present SketchMetaFace - a sketching system targeting amateur users to model high-fidelity 3D faces in minutes. We carefully design both the user interface and the underlying algorithm. First, curvature-aware strokes are adopted to better support the controllability of carving facial details. Second, considering the key problem of mapping a 2D sketch map to a 3D model, we develop a novel learning-based method termed "Implicit and Depth Guided Mesh Modeling" (IDGMM). It fuses the advantages of mesh, implicit, and depth representations to achieve high-quality results with high efficiency. In addition, to further support usability, we present a coarse-to-fine 2D sketching interface design and a data-driven stroke suggestion tool. User studies demonstrate the superiority of our system over existing modeling tools in terms of the ease to use and visual quality of results. Experimental analyses also show that IDGMM reaches a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. SketchMetaFace is available at https://zhongjinluo.github.io/SketchMetaFace/.

- **Summary**: Reviewing plays an important role when learning knowledge. The knowledge acquisition at a certain time point may be strongly inspired with the help of previous experience. Thus the knowledge growing procedure should show strong relationship along the temporal dimension. In our research, we find that during the network training, the evolution of feature map follows temporal sequence property. A proper temporal supervision may further improve the network training performance. Inspired by this observation, we propose Temporal Supervised Knowledge Distillation (TSKD). Specifically, we extract the spatiotemporal features in the different training phases of student by convolutional Long Short-term memory network (Conv-LSTM). Then, we train the student net through a dynamic target, rather than static teacher network features. This process realizes the refinement of old knowledge in student network, and utilizes it to assist current learning. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and advantages of our method over existing knowledge distillation methods, including various network architectures and different tasks (image classification and object detection) .

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present Motion-X, a large-scale 3D expressive whole-body motion dataset. Existing motion datasets predominantly contain body-only poses, lacking facial expressions, hand gestures, and fine-grained pose descriptions. Moreover, they are primarily collected from limited laboratory scenes with textual descriptions manually labeled, which greatly limits their scalability. To overcome these limitations, we develop a whole-body motion and text annotation pipeline, which can automatically annotate motion from either single- or multi-view videos and provide comprehensive semantic labels for each video and fine-grained whole-body pose descriptions for each frame. This pipeline is of high precision, cost-effective, and scalable for further research. Based on it, we construct Motion-X, which comprises 13.7M precise 3D whole-body pose annotations (i.e., SMPL-X) covering 96K motion sequences from massive scenes. Besides, Motion-X provides 13.7M frame-level whole-body pose descriptions and 96K sequence-level semantic labels. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the annotation pipeline and the significant benefit of Motion-X in enhancing expressive, diverse, and natural motion generation, as well as 3D whole-body human mesh recovery.

- **Summary**: The extraction of a clean background image by removing foreground occlusion holds immense practical significance, but it also presents several challenges. Presently, the majority of de-occlusion research focuses on addressing this issue through the extraction and synthesis of discrete images from calibrated camera arrays. Nonetheless, the restoration quality tends to suffer when faced with dense occlusions or high-speed motions due to limited perspectives and motion blur. To successfully remove dense foreground occlusion, an effective multi-view visual information integration approach is required. Introducing the spike camera as a novel type of neuromorphic sensor offers promising capabilities with its ultra-high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. In this paper, we propose an innovative solution for tackling the de-occlusion problem through continuous multi-view imaging using only one spike camera without any prior knowledge of camera intrinsic parameters and camera poses. By rapidly moving the spike camera, we continually capture the dense stream of spikes from the occluded scene. To process the spikes, we build a novel model \textbf{SpkOccNet}, in which we integrate information of spikes from continuous viewpoints within multi-windows, and propose a novel cross-view mutual attention mechanism for effective fusion and refinement. In addition, we contribute the first real-world spike-based dataset \textbf{S-OCC} for occlusion removal. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model efficiently removes dense occlusions in diverse scenes while exhibiting strong generalization.

- **Summary**: Over the past few years, surgical data science has attracted substantial interest from the machine learning (ML) community. Various studies have demonstrated the efficacy of emerging ML techniques in analysing surgical data, particularly recordings of procedures, for digitizing clinical and non-clinical functions like preoperative planning, context-aware decision-making, and operating skill assessment. However, this field is still in its infancy and lacks representative, well-annotated datasets for training robust models in intermediate ML tasks. Also, existing datasets suffer from inaccurate labels, hindering the development of reliable models. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing robust models for surgical tool detection using noisy data. Our methodology introduces two key innovations: (1) an intelligent active learning strategy for minimal dataset identification and label correction by human experts; and (2) an assembling strategy for a student-teacher model-based self-training framework to achieve the robust classification of 14 surgical tools in a semi-supervised fashion. Furthermore, we employ weighted data loaders to handle difficult class labels and address class imbalance issues. The proposed methodology achieves an average F1-score of 85.88\% for the ensemble model-based self-training with class weights, and 80.88\% without class weights for noisy labels. Also, our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches, which effectively demonstrates its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Mobile robots will play a crucial role in the transition towards sustainable agriculture. To autonomously and effectively monitor the state of plants, robots ought to be equipped with visual perception capabilities that are robust to the rapid changes that characterise agricultural settings. In this paper, we focus on the challenging task of segmenting grape bunches from images collected by mobile robots in vineyards. In this context, we present the first study that applies surgical fine-tuning to instance segmentation tasks. We show how selectively tuning only specific model layers can support the adaptation of pre-trained Deep Learning models to newly-collected grape images that introduce visual domain shifts, while also substantially reducing the number of tuned parameters.

- **Summary**: Rigging and skinning clothed human avatars is a challenging task and traditionally requires a lot of manual work and expertise. Recent methods addressing it either generalize across different characters or focus on capturing the dynamics of a single character observed under different pose configurations. However, the former methods typically predict solely static skinning weights, which perform poorly for highly articulated poses, and the latter ones either require dense 3D character scans in different poses or cannot generate an explicit mesh with vertex correspondence over time. To address these challenges, we propose a fully automated approach for creating a fully rigged character with pose-dependent skinning weights, which can be solely learned from multi-view video. Therefore, we first acquire a rigged template, which is then statically skinned. Next, a coordinate-based MLP learns a skinning weights field parameterized over the position in a canonical pose space and the respective pose. Moreover, we introduce our pose- and view-dependent appearance field allowing us to differentiably render and supervise the posed mesh using multi-view imagery. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art while not relying on dense 4D scans.

- **Summary**: Vision-language tasks, such as VQA, SNLI-VE, and VCR are challenging because they require the model's reasoning ability to understand the semantics of the visual world and natural language. Supervised methods working for vision-language tasks have been well-studied. However, solving these tasks in a zero-shot setting is less explored. Since Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown remarkable zero-shot performance on image-text matching, previous works utilized its strong zero-shot ability by converting vision-language tasks into an image-text matching problem, and they mainly consider global-level matching (e.g., the whole image or sentence). However, we find visual and textual fine-grained information, e.g., keywords in the sentence and objects in the image, can be fairly informative for semantics understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a unified framework to take advantage of the fine-grained information for zero-shot vision-language learning, covering multiple tasks such as VQA, SNLI-VE, and VCR. Our experiments show that our framework outperforms former zero-shot methods on VQA and achieves substantial improvement on SNLI-VE and VCR. Furthermore, our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method. Code will be available at https://github.com/ThreeSR/UniFine

- **Summary**: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a highly prevalent chronic musculoskeletal condition with no currently available treatment. The manifestation of KOA is heterogeneous and prediction of its progression is challenging. Current literature suggests that the use of multi-modal data and advanced modeling methods, such as the ones based on Deep Learning, has promise in tackling this challenge. To date, however, the evidence on the efficacy of this approach is limited. In this study, we leveraged recent advances in Deep Learning and, using a Transformer approach, developed a unified framework for the multi-modal fusion of knee imaging data. Subsequently, we analyzed its performance across a range of scenarios by investigating multiple progression horizons -- from short-term to long-term. We report our findings using a large cohort (n=2421-3967) derived from the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset. We show that structural knee MRI allows identifying radiographic KOA progressors on par with multi-modal fusion approaches, achieving an area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) of 0.70-0.76 and Average Precision (AP) of 0.15-0.54 in 2-8 year horizons. Progression within 1 year was better predicted with a multi-modal method using X-ray, structural, and compositional MR images -- ROC AUC of 0.76(0.04), AP of 0.13(0.04) -- or via clinical data. Our follow-up analysis generally shows that prediction from the imaging data is more accurate for post-traumatic subjects, and we further investigate which subject subgroups may benefit the most. The present study provides novel insights into multi-modal imaging of KOA and brings a unified data-driven framework for studying its progression in an end-to-end manner, providing new tools for the design of more efficient clinical trials. The source code of our framework and the pre-trained models are made publicly available.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, collected and annotated data often exhibit the characteristics of multiple classes and long-tailed distribution. Additionally, label noise is inevitable in large-scale annotations and hinders the applications of learning-based models. Although many deep learning based methods have been proposed for handling long-tailed multi-label recognition or label noise respectively, learning with noisy labels in long-tailed multi-label visual data has not been well-studied because of the complexity of long-tailed distribution entangled with multi-label correlation. To tackle such a critical yet thorny problem, this paper focuses on reducing noise based on some inherent properties of multi-label classification and long-tailed learning under noisy cases. In detail, we propose a Stitch-Up augmentation to synthesize a cleaner sample, which directly reduces multi-label noise by stitching up multiple noisy training samples. Equipped with Stitch-Up, a Heterogeneous Co-Learning framework is further designed to leverage the inconsistency between long-tailed and balanced distributions, yielding cleaner labels for more robust representation learning with noisy long-tailed data. To validate our method, we build two challenging benchmarks, named VOC-MLT-Noise and COCO-MLT-Noise, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared to a variety of baselines, our method achieves superior results.

- **Summary**: Deep learning advancements have revolutionized scalable classification in many domains including computer vision. However, when it comes to wearable-based classification and domain adaptation, existing computer vision-based deep learning architectures and pretrained models trained on thousands of labeled images for months fall short. This is primarily because wearable sensor data necessitates sensor-specific preprocessing, architectural modification, and extensive data collection. To overcome these challenges, researchers have proposed encoding of wearable temporal sensor data in images using recurrent plots. In this paper, we present a novel modified-recurrent plot-based image representation that seamlessly integrates both temporal and frequency domain information. Our approach incorporates an efficient Fourier transform-based frequency domain angular difference estimation scheme in conjunction with the existing temporal recurrent plot image. Furthermore, we employ mixup image augmentation to enhance the representation. We evaluate the proposed method using accelerometer-based activity recognition data and a pretrained ResNet model, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Multi-sequence MRI is valuable in clinical settings for reliable diagnosis and treatment prognosis, but some sequences may be unusable or missing for various reasons. To address this issue, MRI synthesis is a potential solution. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved good performance in combining multiple available sequences for missing sequence synthesis. Despite their success, these methods lack the ability to quantify the contributions of different input sequences and estimate the quality of generated images, making it hard to be practical. Hence, we propose an explainable task-specific synthesis network, which adapts weights automatically for specific sequence generation tasks and provides interpretability and reliability from two sides: (1) visualize the contribution of each input sequence in the fusion stage by a trainable task-specific weighted average module; (2) highlight the area the network tried to refine during synthesizing by a task-specific attention module. We conduct experiments on the BraTS2021 dataset of 1251 subjects, and results on arbitrary sequence synthesis indicate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the challenging domain adaptation setting in which knowledge from the labelled source domain dataset is available only from the pretrained black-box segmentation model. The pretrained model's predictions for the target domain images are noisy because of the distributional differences between the source domain data and the target domain data. Since the model's predictions serve as pseudo labels during self-training, the noise in the predictions impose an upper bound on model performance. Therefore, we propose a simple yet novel image translation workflow, ReGEN, to address this problem. ReGEN comprises an image-to-image translation network and a segmentation network. Our workflow generates target-like images using the noisy predictions from the original target domain images. These target-like images are semantically consistent with the noisy model predictions and therefore can be used to train the segmentation network. In addition to being semantically consistent with the predictions from the original target domain images, the generated target-like images are also stylistically similar to the target domain images. This allows us to leverage the stylistic differences between the target-like images and the target domain image as an additional source of supervision while training the segmentation model. We evaluate our model with two benchmark domain adaptation settings and demonstrate that our approach performs favourably relative to recent state-of-the-art work. The source code will be made available.

- **Summary**: Trees play a crucial role in urban environments, offering various ecosystem services that contribute to public health and human well-being. China has initiated a range of urban greening policies over the past decades, however, monitoring their impact on urban tree dynamics at a national scale has proven challenging. In this study, we deployed nano-satellites to quantify urban tree coverage in all major Chinese cities larger than 50 km2 in 2010 and 2019. Our findings indicate that approximately 6000 km2 (11%) of urban areas were covered by trees in 2019, and 76% of these cities experienced an increase in tree cover compared to 2010. Notably, the increase in tree cover in mega-cities such as Beijing, and Shanghai was approximately twice as large as in most other cities (7.69% vs 3.94%). The study employs a data-driven approach towards assessing urban tree cover changes in relation to greening policies, showing clear signs of tree cover increases but also suggesting an uneven implementation primarily benefiting a few mega-cities.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive technique for breast cancer detection among current clinical imaging modalities. Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) provides superior differentiation between tumors and invaded healthy tissue, and has become an indispensable technique in the detection and evaluation of cancer. However, the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) to obtain CE-MRI may be associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and may lead to bioaccumulation in the brain, posing a potential risk to human health. Moreover, and likely more important, the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents requires the cannulation of a vein, and the injection of the contrast media which is cumbersome and places a burden on the patient. To reduce the use of contrast agents, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is emerging as a key imaging technique, although currently usually complementing breast CE-MRI. In this study, we develop a multi-sequence fusion network to synthesize CE-MRI based on T1-weighted MRI and DWIs. DWIs with different b-values are fused to efficiently utilize the difference features of DWIs. Rather than proposing a pure data-driven approach, we invent a multi-sequence attention module to obtain refined feature maps, and leverage hierarchical representation information fused at different scales while utilizing the contributions from different sequences from a model-driven approach by introducing the weighted difference module. The results show that the multi-b-value DWI-based fusion model can potentially be used to synthesize CE-MRI, thus theoretically reducing or avoiding the use of GBCA, thereby minimizing the burden to patients.

- **Summary**: There is a growing interest in single-class modelling and out-of-distribution detection as fully supervised machine learning models cannot reliably identify classes not included in their training. The long tail of infinitely many out-of-distribution classes in real-world scenarios, e.g., for screening, triage, and quality control, means that it is often necessary to train single-class models that represent an expected feature distribution, e.g., from only strictly healthy volunteer data. Conventional supervised machine learning would require the collection of datasets that contain enough samples of all possible diseases in every imaging modality, which is not realistic. Self-supervised learning methods with synthetic anomalies are currently amongst the most promising approaches, alongside generative auto-encoders that analyse the residual reconstruction error. However, all methods suffer from a lack of structured validation, which makes calibration for deployment difficult and dataset-dependant. Our method alleviates this by making use of multiple visually-distinct synthetic anomaly learning tasks for both training and validation. This enables more robust training and generalisation. With our approach we can readily outperform state-of-the-art methods, which we demonstrate on exemplars in brain MRI and chest X-rays.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in multimodal learning has resulted in powerful vision-language models, whose representations are generalizable across a variety of downstream tasks. Recently, their generalizability has been further extended by incorporating trainable prompts, borrowed from the natural language processing literature. While such prompt learning techniques have shown impressive results, we identify that these prompts are trained based on global image features which limits itself in two aspects: First, by using global features, these prompts could be focusing less on the discriminative foreground image, resulting in poor generalization to various out-of-distribution test cases. Second, existing work weights all prompts equally whereas our intuition is that these prompts are more specific to the type of the image. We address these issues with as part of our proposed Contextual Prompt Learning (CoPL) framework, capable of aligning the prompts to the localized features of the image. Our key innovations over earlier works include using local image features as part of the prompt learning process, and more crucially, learning to weight these prompts based on local features that are appropriate for the task at hand. This gives us dynamic prompts that are both aligned to local image features as well as aware of local contextual relationships. Our extensive set of experiments on a variety of standard and few-shot datasets show that our method produces substantially improved performance when compared to the current state of the art methods. We also demonstrate both few-shot and out-of-distribution performance to establish the utility of learning dynamic prompts that are aligned to local image features.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision, with convolutional neural network models proving to be very effective for image classification benchmarks. However, a fundamental theoretical questions remain answered: why can they solve discrete image classification tasks that involve feature extraction? We address this question in this paper by introducing a novel mathematical model for image classification, based on feature extraction, that can be used to generate images resembling real-world datasets. We show that convolutional neural network classifiers can solve these image classification tasks with zero error. In our proof, we construct piecewise linear functions that detect the presence of features, and show that they can be realized by a convolutional network.

- **Summary**: Concept Factorization (CF), as a novel paradigm of representation learning, has demonstrated superior performance in multi-view clustering tasks. It overcomes limitations such as the non-negativity constraint imposed by traditional matrix factorization methods and leverages kernel methods to learn latent representations that capture the underlying structure of the data, thereby improving data representation. However, existing multi-view concept factorization methods fail to consider the limited labeled information inherent in real-world multi-view data. This often leads to significant performance loss. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-view concept factorization model, named SMVCF. In the SMVCF model, we first extend the conventional single-view CF to a multi-view version, enabling more effective exploration of complementary information across multiple views. We then integrate multi-view CF, label propagation, and manifold learning into a unified framework to leverage and incorporate valuable information present in the data. Additionally, an adaptive weight vector is introduced to balance the importance of different views in the clustering process. We further develop targeted optimization methods specifically tailored for the SMVCF model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four diverse datasets with varying label ratios to evaluate the performance of SMVCF. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach in multi-view clustering tasks.

- **Summary**: Visual reasoning is essential for building intelligent agents that understand the world and perform problem-solving beyond perception. Differentiable forward reasoning has been developed to integrate reasoning with gradient-based machine learning paradigms. However, due to the memory intensity, most existing approaches do not bring the best of the expressivity of first-order logic, excluding a crucial ability to solve abstract visual reasoning, where agents need to perform reasoning by using analogies on abstract concepts in different scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose NEUro-symbolic Message-pAssiNg reasoNer (NEUMANN), which is a graph-based differentiable forward reasoner, passing messages in a memory-efficient manner and handling structured programs with functors. Moreover, we propose a computationally-efficient structure learning algorithm to perform explanatory program induction on complex visual scenes. To evaluate, in addition to conventional visual reasoning tasks, we propose a new task, visual reasoning behind-the-scenes, where agents need to learn abstract programs and then answer queries by imagining scenes that are not observed. We empirically demonstrate that NEUMANN solves visual reasoning tasks efficiently, outperforming neural, symbolic, and neuro-symbolic baselines.

- **Summary**: The visual system evolved to process natural scenes, yet most of our understanding of the topology and function of visual cortex derives from studies using artificial stimuli. To gain deeper insights into visual processing of natural scenes, we utilized widefield calcium-imaging of primate V4 in response to many natural images, generating a large dataset of columnar-scale responses. We used this dataset to build a digital twin of V4 via deep learning, generating a detailed topographical map of natural image preferences at each cortical position. The map revealed clustered functional domains for specific classes of natural image features. These ranged from surface-related attributes like color and texture to shape-related features such as edges, curvature, and facial features. We validated the model-predicted domains with additional widefield calcium-imaging and single-cell resolution two-photon imaging. Our study illuminates the detailed topological organization and neural codes in V4 that represent natural scenes.

- **Summary**: The current approach for testing the robustness of object detectors suffers from serious deficiencies such as improper methods of performing out-of-distribution detection and using calibration metrics which do not consider both localisation and classification quality. In this work, we address these issues, and introduce the Self-Aware Object Detection (SAOD) task, a unified testing framework which respects and adheres to the challenges that object detectors face in safety-critical environments such as autonomous driving. Specifically, the SAOD task requires an object detector to be: robust to domain shift; obtain reliable uncertainty estimates for the entire scene; and provide calibrated confidence scores for the detections. We extensively use our framework, which introduces novel metrics and large scale test datasets, to test numerous object detectors in two different use-cases, allowing us to highlight critical insights into their robustness performance. Finally, we introduce a simple baseline for the SAOD task, enabling researchers to benchmark future proposed methods and move towards robust object detectors which are fit for purpose.

- **Summary**: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to detect the prominent regions by jointly modeling RGB and depth information. Most RGB-D SOD methods apply the same type of backbones and fusion modules to identically learn the multimodality and multistage features. However, these features contribute differently to the final saliency results, which raises two issues: 1) how to model discrepant characteristics of RGB images and depth maps; 2) how to fuse these cross-modality features in different stages. In this paper, we propose a high-order discrepant interaction network (HODINet) for RGB-D SOD. Concretely, we first employ transformer-based and CNN-based architectures as backbones to encode RGB and depth features, respectively. Then, the high-order representations are delicately extracted and embedded into spatial and channel attentions for cross-modality feature fusion in different stages. Specifically, we design a high-order spatial fusion (HOSF) module and a high-order channel fusion (HOCF) module to fuse features of the first two and the last two stages, respectively. Besides, a cascaded pyramid reconstruction network is adopted to progressively decode the fused features in a top-down pathway. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven widely used datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We achieve competitive performance against 24 state-of-the-art methods under four evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Deep learning is increasingly impacting various aspects of contemporary society. Artificial neural networks have emerged as the dominant models for solving an expanding range of tasks. The introduction of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques, which enable the automatic design of task-optimal networks, has led to remarkable advances. However, the NAS process is typically associated with long execution times and significant computational resource requirements. Once-For-All (OFA) and its successor, Once-For-All-2 (OFAv2), have been developed to mitigate these challenges. While maintaining exceptional performance and eliminating the need for retraining, they aim to build a single super-network model capable of directly extracting sub-networks satisfying different constraints. Neural Architecture Transfer (NAT) was developed to maximise the effectiveness of extracting sub-networks from a super-network. In this paper, we present NATv2, an extension of NAT that improves multi-objective search algorithms applied to dynamic super-network architectures. NATv2 achieves qualitative improvements in the extractable sub-networks by exploiting the improved super-networks generated by OFAv2 and incorporating new policies for initialisation, pre-processing and updating its networks archive. In addition, a post-processing pipeline based on fine-tuning is introduced. Experimental results show that NATv2 successfully improves NAT and is highly recommended for investigating high-performance architectures with a minimal number of parameters.

- **Summary**: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents trained on limited views face significant challenges in generalizing their learned abilities to unseen views. This inherent difficulty is known as the problem of $\textit{view generalization}$. In this work, we systematically categorize this fundamental problem into four distinct and highly challenging scenarios that closely resemble real-world situations. Subsequently, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach to enable successful adaptation of visual $\textbf{Mo}$del-based policies for $\textbf{Vie}$w generalization ($\textbf{MoVie}$) during test time, without any need for explicit reward signals and any modification during training time. Our method demonstrates substantial advancements across all four scenarios encompassing a total of $\textbf{18}$ tasks sourced from DMControl, xArm, and Adroit, with a relative improvement of $\mathbf{33}$%, $\mathbf{86}$%, and $\mathbf{152}$% respectively. The superior results highlight the immense potential of our approach for real-world robotics applications. Videos are available at https://yangsizhe.github.io/MoVie/ .

- **Summary**: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly disabling mental disease that brings significant impairments of social interaction ability to the patients, making early screening and intervention of ASD critical. With the development of the machine learning and neuroimaging technology, extensive research has been conducted on machine classification of ASD based on structural MRI (s-MRI). However, most studies involve with datasets where participants' age are above 5. Few studies conduct machine classification of ASD for participants below 5-year-old, but, with mediocre predictive accuracy. In this paper, we push the boundary of predictive accuracy (above 0.97) of machine classification of ASD in children (age range: 0.92-4.83 years), based on s-MRI features extracted using contrastive variational autoencoder (CVAE). 78 s-MRI, collected from Shenzhen Children's Hospital, are used for training CVAE, which consists of both ASD-specific feature channel and common shared feature channel. The ASD participants represented by ASD-specific features can be easily discriminated from TC participants represented by the common shared features, leading to high classification accuracy. In case of degraded predictive accuracy when data size is extremely small, a transfer learning strategy is proposed here as a potential solution. Finally, we conduct neuroanatomical interpretation based on the correlation between s-MRI features extracted from CVAE and surface area of different cortical regions, which discloses potential biomarkers that could help target treatments of ASD in the future.

- **Summary**: In the fields of Experimental and Computational Aesthetics, numerous image datasets have been created over the last two decades. In the present work, we provide a comparative overview of twelve image datasets that include aesthetic ratings (beauty, liking or aesthetic quality) and investigate the reproducibility of results across different datasets. Specifically, we examine how consistently the ratings can be predicted by using either (A) a set of 20 previously studied statistical image properties, or (B) the layers of a convolutional neural network developed for object recognition. Our findings reveal substantial variation in the predictability of aesthetic ratings across the different datasets. However, consistent similarities were found for datasets containing either photographs or paintings, suggesting different relevant features in the aesthetic evaluation of these two image genres. To our surprise, statistical image properties and the convolutional neural network predict aesthetic ratings with similar accuracy, highlighting a significant overlap in the image information captured by the two methods. Nevertheless, the discrepancies between the datasets call into question the generalizability of previous research findings on single datasets. Our study underscores the importance of considering multiple datasets to improve the validity and generalizability of research results in the fields of experimental and computational aesthetics.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant attention for its impressive performance in image segmentation. However, it lacks proficiency in referring video object segmentation (RVOS) due to the need for precise user-interactive prompts and limited understanding of different modalities, such as language and vision. This paper presents the RefSAM model, which for the first time explores the potential of SAM for RVOS by incorporating multi-view information from diverse modalities and successive frames at different timestamps. Our proposed approach adapts the original SAM model to enhance cross-modality learning by employing a lightweight Cross-Modal MLP that projects the text embedding of the referring expression into sparse and dense embeddings, serving as user-interactive prompts. Subsequently, a parameter-efficient tuning strategy is employed to effectively align and fuse the language and vision features. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the practical and effective design choices of our strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on Ref-Youtu-VOS and Ref-DAVIS17 datasets validate the superiority and effectiveness of our RefSAM model over existing methods.

- **Summary**: Recent research has demonstrated that the multi-task fine-tuning of multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) using an assortment of annotated downstream vision-language datasets significantly enhances their performance. Yet, during this process, a side effect, which we termed as the "multi-modal alignment tax", surfaces. This side effect negatively impacts the model's ability to format responses appropriately -- for instance, its "politeness" -- due to the overly succinct and unformatted nature of raw annotations, resulting in reduced human preference. In this paper, we introduce Polite Flamingo, a multi-modal response rewriter that transforms raw annotations into a more appealing, "polite" format. Polite Flamingo is trained to reconstruct high-quality responses from their automatically distorted counterparts and is subsequently applied to a vast array of vision-language datasets for response rewriting. After rigorous filtering, we generate the PF-1M dataset and further validate its value by fine-tuning a multi-modal LLM with it. Combined with novel methodologies including U-shaped multi-stage tuning and multi-turn augmentation, the resulting model, Clever Flamingo, demonstrates its advantages in both multi-modal understanding and response politeness according to automated and human evaluations.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel one-stage end-to-end multi-person 2D pose estimation algorithm, known as Joint Coordinate Regression and Association (JCRA), that produces human pose joints and associations without requiring any post-processing. The proposed algorithm is fast, accurate, effective, and simple. The one-stage end-to-end network architecture significantly improves the inference speed of JCRA. Meanwhile, we devised a symmetric network structure for both the encoder and decoder, which ensures high accuracy in identifying keypoints. It follows an architecture that directly outputs part positions via a transformer network, resulting in a significant improvement in performance. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO and CrowdPose benchmarks demonstrate that JCRA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, JCRA demonstrates 69.2 mAP and is 78\% faster at inference acceleration than previous state-of-the-art bottom-up algorithms. The code for this algorithm will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Accurate camera calibration is crucial for various computer vision applications. However, measuring camera parameters in the real world is challenging and arduous, and there needs to be a dataset with ground truth to evaluate calibration algorithms' accuracy. In this paper, we present SynthCal, a synthetic camera calibration benchmarking pipeline that generates images of calibration patterns to measure and enable accurate quantification of calibration algorithm performance in camera parameter estimation. We present a SynthCal-generated calibration dataset with four common patterns, two camera types, and two environments with varying view, distortion, lighting, and noise levels. The dataset evaluates single-view calibration algorithms by measuring reprojection and root-mean-square errors for identical patterns and camera settings. Additionally, we analyze the significance of different patterns using Zhang's method, which estimates intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters with known correspondences between 3D points and their 2D projections in different configurations and environments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SynthCal in evaluating various calibration algorithms and patterns.

- **Summary**: Tumor region segmentation is an essential task for the quantitative analysis of digital pathology. Recently presented deep neural networks have shown state-of-the-art performance in various image-segmentation tasks. However, because of the unclear boundary between the cancerous and normal regions in pathology images, despite using modern methods, it is difficult to produce satisfactory segmentation results in terms of the reliability and accuracy required for medical data. In this study, we propose an interactive segmentation method that allows users to refine the output of deep neural networks through click-type user interactions. The primary method is to formulate interactive segmentation as an optimization problem that leverages both user-provided click constraints and semantic information in a feature map using a click-guided attention module (CGAM). Unlike other existing methods, CGAM avoids excessive changes in segmentation results, which can lead to the overfitting of user clicks. Another advantage of CGAM is that the model size is independent of input image size. Experimental results on pathology image datasets indicated that our method performs better than existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation (DA) has demonstrated significant promise for real-time nighttime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) DA still lacks the potential object with accurate pixel-level location and boundary to generate the high-quality target domain training sample. This key issue constrains the transfer learning of the real-time daytime SOTA trackers for challenging nighttime UAV tracking. Recently, the notable Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable zero-shot generalization ability to discover abundant potential objects due to its huge data-driven training approach. To solve the aforementioned issue, this work proposes a novel SAM-powered DA framework for real-time nighttime UAV tracking, i.e., SAM-DA. Specifically, an innovative SAM-powered target domain training sample swelling is designed to determine enormous high-quality target domain training samples from every single raw nighttime image. This novel one-to-many method significantly expands the high-quality target domain training sample for DA. Comprehensive experiments on extensive nighttime UAV videos prove the robustness and domain adaptability of SAM-DA for nighttime UAV tracking. Especially, compared to the SOTA DA, SAM-DA can achieve better performance with fewer raw nighttime images, i.e., the fewer-better training. This economized training approach facilitates the quick validation and deployment of algorithms for UAVs. The code is available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/SAM-DA.

- **Summary**: Visual place recognition is an important problem towards global localization in many robotics tasks. One of the biggest challenges is that it may suffer from illumination or appearance changes in surrounding environments. Event cameras are interesting alternatives to frame-based sensors as their high dynamic range enables robust perception in difficult illumination conditions. However, current event-based place recognition methods only rely on event information, which restricts downstream applications of VPR. In this paper, we present the first cross-modal visual place recognition framework that is capable of retrieving regular images from a database given an event query. Our method demonstrates promising results with respect to the state-of-the-art frame-based and event-based methods on the Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset under different scenarios. We also verify the effectiveness of the combination of retrieval and classification, which can boost performance by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) models aim to answer natural language questions about given images. Due to its ability to ask questions that differ from those used when training the model, medical VQA has received substantial attention in recent years. However, existing medical VQA models typically focus on answering questions that refer to an entire image rather than where the relevant content may be located in the image. Consequently, VQA models are limited in their interpretability power and the possibility to probe the model about specific image regions. This paper proposes a novel approach for medical VQA that addresses this limitation by developing a model that can answer questions about image regions while considering the context necessary to answer the questions. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, outperforming existing methods on three datasets. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/sergiotasconmorales/locvqa.

- **Summary**: Learning a feature point detector presents a challenge both due to the ambiguity of the definition of a keypoint and correspondingly the need for a specially prepared ground truth labels for such points. In our work, we address both of these issues by utilizing a combination of a hand-crafted Shi detector and a neural network. We build on the principled and localized keypoints provided by the Shi detector and perform their selection using the keypoint stability score regressed by the neural network - Neural Stability Score (NeSS). Therefore, our method is named Shi-NeSS since it combines the Shi detector and the properties of the keypoint stability score, and it only requires for training sets of images without dataset pre-labeling or the need for reconstructed correspondence labels. We evaluate Shi-NeSS on HPatches, ScanNet, MegaDepth and IMC-PT, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and good generalization on downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Conformal prediction has emerged as a rigorous means of providing deep learning models with reliable uncertainty estimates and safety guarantees. Yet, its performance is known to degrade under distribution shift and long-tailed class distributions, which are often present in real world applications. Here, we characterize the performance of several post-hoc and training-based conformal prediction methods under these settings, providing the first empirical evaluation on large-scale datasets and models. We show that across numerous conformal methods and neural network families, performance greatly degrades under distribution shifts violating safety guarantees. Similarly, we show that in long-tailed settings the guarantees are frequently violated on many classes. Understanding the limitations of these methods is necessary for deployment in real world and safety-critical applications.

- **Summary**: Quasars experiencing strong lensing offer unique viewpoints on subjects related to the cosmic expansion rate, the dark matter profile within the foreground deflectors, and the quasar host galaxies. Unfortunately, identifying them in astronomical images is challenging since they are overwhelmed by the abundance of non-lenses. To address this, we have developed a novel approach by ensembling cutting-edge convolutional networks (CNNs) -- for instance, ResNet, Inception, NASNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and RegNet -- along with vision transformers (ViTs) trained on realistic galaxy-quasar lens simulations based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) multiband images. While the individual model exhibits remarkable performance when evaluated against the test dataset, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of $>$97.3% and a median false positive rate of 3.6%, it struggles to generalize in real data, indicated by numerous spurious sources picked by each classifier. A significant improvement is achieved by averaging these CNNs and ViTs, resulting in the impurities being downsized by factors up to 50. Subsequently, combining the HSC images with the UKIRT, VISTA, and unWISE data, we retrieve approximately 60 million sources as parent samples and reduce this to 892,609 after employing a photometry preselection to discover $z>1.5$ lensed quasars with Einstein radii of $\theta_\mathrm{E}<5$ arcsec. Afterward, the ensemble classifier indicates 3080 sources with a high probability of being lenses, for which we visually inspect, yielding 210 prevailing candidates awaiting spectroscopic confirmation. These outcomes suggest that automated deep learning pipelines hold great potential in effectively detecting strong lenses in vast datasets with minimal manual visual inspection involved.

- **Summary**: Underwater images are fundamental for studying and understanding the status of marine life. We focus on reducing the memory space required for image storage while the memory space consumption in the collecting phase limits the time lasting of this phase leading to the need for more image collection campaigns. We present a novel machine-learning model that reconstructs the colours of underwater images from their luminescence channel, thus saving 2/3 of the available storage space. Our model specialises in underwater colour reconstruction and consists of an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is composed of a convolutional encoder and a parallel specialised classifier trained with webly-supervised data. The encoder and the decoder use layers of capsules to capture the features of the entities in the image. The colour reconstruction process recalls the progressive and the generative adversarial training procedures. The progressive training gives the ground for a generative adversarial routine focused on the refining of colours giving the image bright and saturated colours which bring the image back to life. We validate the model both qualitatively and quantitatively on four benchmark datasets. This is the first attempt at colour reconstruction in greyscale underwater images. Extensive results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions. We also demonstrate that the generated colourisation enhances the quality of images compared to enhancement models at the SOTA.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces MVDiffusion, a simple yet effective method for generating consistent multi-view images from text prompts given pixel-to-pixel correspondences (e.g., perspective crops from a panorama or multi-view images given depth maps and poses). Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative image warping and inpainting, MVDiffusion simultaneously generates all images with a global awareness, effectively addressing the prevalent error accumulation issue. At its core, MVDiffusion processes perspective images in parallel with a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, while integrating novel correspondence-aware attention layers to facilitate cross-view interactions. For panorama generation, while only trained with 10k panoramas, MVDiffusion is able to generate high-resolution photorealistic images for arbitrary texts or extrapolate one perspective image to a 360-degree view. For multi-view depth-to-image generation, MVDiffusion demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for texturing a scene mesh. The project page is at https://mvdiffusion.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Polygonal meshes have become the standard for discretely approximating 3D shapes, thanks to their efficiency and high flexibility in capturing non-uniform shapes. This non-uniformity, however, leads to irregularity in the mesh structure, making tasks like segmentation of 3D meshes particularly challenging. Semantic segmentation of 3D mesh has been typically addressed through CNN-based approaches, leading to good accuracy. Recently, transformers have gained enough momentum both in NLP and computer vision fields, achieving performance at least on par with CNN models, supporting the long-sought architecture universalism. Following this trend, we propose a transformer-based method for semantic segmentation of 3D mesh motivated by a better modeling of the graph structure of meshes, by means of global attention mechanisms. In order to address the limitations of standard transformer architectures in modeling relative positions of non-sequential data, as in the case of 3D meshes, as well as in capturing the local context, we perform positional encoding by means the Laplacian eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, replacing the traditional sinusoidal positional encodings, and by introducing clustering-based features into the self-attention and cross-attention operators. Experimental results, carried out on three sets of the Shape COSEG Dataset, on the human segmentation dataset proposed in Maron et al., 2017 and on the ShapeNet benchmark, show how the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation of 3D meshes.

- **Summary**: Geometric navigation is nowadays a well-established field of robotics and the research focus is shifting towards higher-level scene understanding, such as Semantic Mapping. When a robot needs to interact with its environment, it must be able to comprehend the contextual information of its surroundings. This work focuses on classifying and localising objects within a map, which is under construction (SLAM) or already built. To further explore this direction, we propose a framework that can autonomously detect and localize predefined objects in a known environment using a multi-modal sensor fusion approach (combining RGB and depth data from an RGB-D camera and a lidar). The framework consists of three key elements: understanding the environment through RGB data, estimating depth through multi-modal sensor fusion, and managing artifacts (i.e., filtering and stabilizing measurements). The experiments show that the proposed framework can accurately detect 98% of the objects in the real sample environment, without post-processing, while 85% and 80% of the objects were mapped using the single RGBD camera or RGB + lidar setup respectively. The comparison with single-sensor (camera or lidar) experiments is performed to show that sensor fusion allows the robot to accurately detect near and far obstacles, which would have been noisy or imprecise in a purely visual or laser-based approach.

- **Summary**: According to the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification scheme for gliomas, glioma segmentation is a very important basis for diagnosis and genotype prediction. In general, 3D multimodal brain MRI is an effective diagnostic tool. In the past decade, there has been an increase in the use of machine learning, particularly deep learning, for medical images processing. Thanks to the development of foundation models, models pre-trained with large-scale datasets have achieved better results on a variety of tasks. However, for medical images with small dataset sizes, deep learning methods struggle to achieve better results on real-world image datasets. In this paper, we propose a cross-modality attention adapter based on multimodal fusion to fine-tune the foundation model to accomplish the task of glioma segmentation in multimodal MRI brain images with better results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via our private glioma data set from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (FHZU) in Zhengzhou, China. Our proposed method is superior to current state-of-the-art methods with a Dice of 88.38% and Hausdorff distance of 10.64, thereby exhibiting a 4% increase in Dice to segment the glioma region for glioma treatment.

- **Summary**: Instruction finetuning is a popular paradigm to align large language models (LLM) with human intent. Despite its popularity, this idea is less explored in improving the LLMs to align existing foundation models with scientific disciplines, concepts and goals. In this work, we present SciTune as a tuning framework to improve the ability of LLMs to follow scientific multimodal instructions. To test our methodology, we use a human-generated scientific instruction tuning dataset and train a large multimodal model LLaMA-SciTune that connects a vision encoder and LLM for science-focused visual and language understanding. In comparison to the models that are finetuned with machine generated data only, LLaMA-SciTune surpasses human performance on average and in many sub-categories on the ScienceQA benchmark.

- **Summary**: The combination of audio and vision has long been a topic of interest in the multi-modal community. Recently, a new audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task has been introduced, aiming to locate and segment the sounding objects in a given video. This task demands audio-driven pixel-level scene understanding for the first time, posing significant challenges. In this paper, we propose AVSegFormer, a novel framework for AVS tasks that leverages the transformer architecture. Specifically, we introduce audio queries and learnable queries into the transformer decoder, enabling the network to selectively attend to interested visual features. Besides, we present an audio-visual mixer, which can dynamically adjust visual features by amplifying relevant and suppressing irrelevant spatial channels. Additionally, we devise an intermediate mask loss to enhance the supervision of the decoder, encouraging the network to produce more accurate intermediate predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVSegFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on the AVS benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/vvvb-github/AVSegFormer.

- **Summary**: Generative latent diffusion models have been established as state-of-the-art in data generation. One promising application is generation of realistic synthetic medical imaging data for open data sharing without compromising patient privacy. Despite the promise, the capacity of such models to memorize sensitive patient training data and synthesize samples showing high resemblance to training data samples is relatively unexplored. Here, we assess the memorization capacity of 3D latent diffusion models on photon-counting coronary computed tomography angiography and knee magnetic resonance imaging datasets. To detect potential memorization of training samples, we utilize self-supervised models based on contrastive learning. Our results suggest that such latent diffusion models indeed memorize training data, and there is a dire need for devising strategies to mitigate memorization.

- **Summary**: Industrial revolutions have historically disrupted manufacturing by introducing automation into production. Increasing automation reshapes the role of the human worker. Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence open new frontiers of human-machine collaboration. Such collaboration can be realized considering two sub-fields of artificial intelligence: active learning and explainable artificial intelligence. Active learning aims to devise strategies that help obtain data that allows machine learning algorithms to learn better. On the other hand, explainable artificial intelligence aims to make the machine learning models intelligible to the human person. The present work first describes Industry 5.0, human-machine collaboration, and state-of-the-art regarding quality inspection, emphasizing visual inspection. Then it outlines how human-machine collaboration could be realized and enhanced in visual inspection. Finally, some of the results obtained in the EU H2020 STAR project regarding visual inspection are shared, considering artificial intelligence, human digital twins, and cybersecurity.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces SAMAug, a novel visual point augmentation method for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that enhances interactive image segmentation performance. SAMAug generates augmented point prompts to provide more information to SAM. From the initial point prompt, SAM produces the initial mask, which is then fed into our proposed SAMAug to generate augmented point prompts. By incorporating these extra points, SAM can generate augmented segmentation masks based on the augmented point prompts and the initial prompt, resulting in improved segmentation performance. We evaluate four point augmentation techniques: random selection, maximum difference entropy, maximum distance, and a saliency model. Experiments on the COCO, Fundus, and Chest X-ray datasets demonstrate that SAMAug can boost SAM's segmentation results, especially using the maximum distance and saliency model methods. SAMAug underscores the potential of visual prompt engineering to advance interactive computer vision models.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has established itself as a powerful zero-shot image segmentation model, employing interactive prompts such as points to generate masks. This paper presents SAM-PT, a method extending SAM's capability to tracking and segmenting anything in dynamic videos. SAM-PT leverages robust and sparse point selection and propagation techniques for mask generation, demonstrating that a SAM-based segmentation tracker can yield strong zero-shot performance across popular video object segmentation benchmarks, including DAVIS, YouTube-VOS, and MOSE. Compared to traditional object-centric mask propagation strategies, we uniquely use point propagation to exploit local structure information that is agnostic to object semantics. We highlight the merits of point-based tracking through direct evaluation on the zero-shot open-world Unidentified Video Objects (UVO) benchmark. To further enhance our approach, we utilize K-Medoids clustering for point initialization and track both positive and negative points to clearly distinguish the target object. We also employ multiple mask decoding passes for mask refinement and devise a point re-initialization strategy to improve tracking accuracy. Our code integrates different point trackers and video segmentation benchmarks and will be released at https://github.com/SysCV/sam-pt.

- **Summary**: Neural material representations are becoming a popular way to represent materials for rendering. They are more expressive than analytic models and occupy less memory than tabulated BTFs. However, existing neural materials are immutable, meaning that their output for a certain query of UVs, camera, and light vector is fixed once they are trained. While this is practical when there is no need to edit the material, it can become very limiting when the fragment of the material used for training is too small or not tileable, which frequently happens when the material has been captured with a gonioreflectometer. In this paper, we propose a novel neural material representation which jointly tackles the problems of BTF compression, tiling, and extrapolation. At test time, our method uses a guidance image as input to condition the neural BTF to the structural features of this input image. Then, the neural BTF can be queried as a regular BTF using UVs, camera, and light vectors. Every component in our framework is purposefully designed to maximize BTF encoding quality at minimal parameter count and computational complexity, achieving competitive compression rates compared with previous work. We demonstrate the results of our method on a variety of synthetic and captured materials, showing its generality and capacity to learn to represent many optical properties.

- **Summary**: Learning-based approaches to monocular motion capture have recently shown promising results by learning to regress in a data-driven manner. However, due to the challenges in data collection and network designs, it remains challenging for existing solutions to achieve real-time full-body capture while being accurate in world space. In this work, we contribute a sequential proxy-to-motion learning scheme together with a proxy dataset of 2D skeleton sequences and 3D rotational motions in world space. Such proxy data enables us to build a learning-based network with accurate full-body supervision while also mitigating the generalization issues. For more accurate and physically plausible predictions, a contact-aware neural motion descent module is proposed in our network so that it can be aware of foot-ground contact and motion misalignment with the proxy observations. Additionally, we share the body-hand context information in our network for more compatible wrist poses recovery with the full-body model. With the proposed learning-based solution, we demonstrate the first real-time monocular full-body capture system with plausible foot-ground contact in world space.

- **Summary**: We propose a new method, Patch-CNN, for diffusion tensor (DT) estimation from only six-direction diffusion weighted images (DWI). Deep learning-based methods have been recently proposed for dMRI parameter estimation, using either voxel-wise fully-connected neural networks (FCN) or image-wise convolutional neural networks (CNN). In the acute clinical context -- where pressure of time limits the number of imaged directions to a minimum -- existing approaches either require an infeasible number of training images volumes (image-wise CNNs), or do not estimate the fibre orientations (voxel-wise FCNs) required for tractogram estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Patch-CNN, a neural network with a minimal (non-voxel-wise) convolutional kernel (3$\times$3$\times$3). Compared with voxel-wise FCNs, this has the advantage of allowing the network to leverage local anatomical information. Compared with image-wise CNNs, the minimal kernel vastly reduces training data demand. Evaluated against both conventional model fitting and a voxel-wise FCN, Patch-CNN, trained with a single subject is shown to improve the estimation of both scalar dMRI parameters and fibre orientation from six-direction DWIs. The improved fibre orientation estimation is shown to produce improved tractogram.

- **Summary**: Although deep neural networks endow the downsampled superpoints with discriminative feature representations, directly matching them is usually not used alone in state-of-the-art methods, mainly for two reasons. First, the correspondences are inevitably noisy, so RANSAC-like refinement is usually adopted. Such ad hoc postprocessing, however, is slow and not differentiable, which can not be jointly optimized with feature learning. Second, superpoints are sparse and thus more RANSAC iterations are needed. Existing approaches use the coarse-to-fine strategy to propagate the superpoints correspondences to the point level, which are not discriminative enough and further necessitates the postprocessing refinement. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach to extract correspondences by directly matching superpoints using a global softmax layer in an end-to-end manner, which are used to determine the rigid transformation between the source and target point cloud. Compared with methods that directly predict corresponding points, by leveraging the rich information from the superpoints matchings, we can obtain more accurate estimation of the transformation and effectively filter out outliers without any postprocessing refinement. As a result, our approach is not only fast, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging ModelNet and 3DMatch benchmarks. Our code and model weights will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Accurate estimation of building heights is essential for urban planning, infrastructure management, and environmental analysis. In this study, we propose a supervised Multimodal Building Height Regression Network (MBHR-Net) for estimating building heights at 10m spatial resolution using Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite time series. S1 provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data that offers valuable information on building structures, while S2 provides multispectral data that is sensitive to different land cover types, vegetation phenology, and building shadows. Our MBHR-Net aims to extract meaningful features from the S1 and S2 images to learn complex spatio-temporal relationships between image patterns and building heights. The model is trained and tested in 10 cities in the Netherlands. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Intersection over Union (IOU), and R-squared (R2) score metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The preliminary results (3.73m RMSE, 0.95 IoU, 0.61 R2) demonstrate the effectiveness of our deep learning model in accurately estimating building heights, showcasing its potential for urban planning, environmental impact analysis, and other related applications.

- **Summary**: Monitoring cow body weight is crucial to support farm management decisions due to its direct relationship with the growth, nutritional status, and health of dairy cows. Cow body weight is a repeated trait, however, the majority of previous body weight prediction research only used data collected at a single point in time. Furthermore, the utility of deep learning-based segmentation for body weight prediction using videos remains unanswered. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to predict cow body weight from repeatedly measured video data, to compare the performance of the thresholding and Mask R-CNN deep learning approaches, to evaluate the predictive ability of body weight regression models, and to promote open science in the animal science community by releasing the source code for video-based body weight prediction. A total of 40,405 depth images and depth map files were obtained from 10 lactating Holstein cows and 2 non-lactating Jersey cows. Three approaches were investigated to segment the cow's body from the background, including single thresholding, adaptive thresholding, and Mask R-CNN. Four image-derived biometric features, such as dorsal length, abdominal width, height, and volume, were estimated from the segmented images. On average, the Mask-RCNN approach combined with a linear mixed model resulted in the best prediction coefficient of determination and mean absolute percentage error of 0.98 and 2.03%, respectively, in the forecasting cross-validation. The Mask-RCNN approach was also the best in the leave-three-cows-out cross-validation. The prediction coefficients of determination and mean absolute percentage error of the Mask-RCNN coupled with the linear mixed model were 0.90 and 4.70%, respectively. Our results suggest that deep learning-based segmentation improves the prediction performance of cow body weight from longitudinal depth video data.

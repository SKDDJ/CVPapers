- **Summary**: Predicting human motion plays a crucial role in ensuring a safe and effective human-robot close collaboration in intelligent remanufacturing systems of the future. Existing works can be categorized into two groups: those focusing on accuracy, predicting a single future motion, and those generating diverse predictions based on observations. The former group fails to address the uncertainty and multi-modal nature of human motion, while the latter group often produces motion sequences that deviate too far from the ground truth or become unrealistic within historical contexts. To tackle these issues, we propose TransFusion, an innovative and practical diffusion-based model for 3D human motion prediction which can generate samples that are more likely to happen while maintaining a certain level of diversity. Our model leverages Transformer as the backbone with long skip connections between shallow and deep layers. Additionally, we employ the discrete cosine transform to model motion sequences in the frequency space, thereby improving performance. In contrast to prior diffusion-based models that utilize extra modules like cross-attention and adaptive layer normalization to condition the prediction on past observed motion, we treat all inputs, including conditions, as tokens to create a more lightweight model compared to existing approaches. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of our human motion prediction model.

- **Summary**: We introduce Augmented Math, a machine learning-based approach to authoring AR explorable explanations by augmenting static math textbooks without programming. To augment a static document, our system first extracts mathematical formulas and figures from a given document using optical character recognition (OCR) and computer vision. By binding and manipulating these extracted contents, the user can see the interactive animation overlaid onto the document through mobile AR interfaces. This empowers non-technical users, such as teachers or students, to transform existing math textbooks and handouts into on-demand and personalized explorable explanations. To design our system, we first analyzed existing explorable math explanations to identify common design strategies. Based on the findings, we developed a set of augmentation techniques that can be automatically generated based on the extracted content, which are 1) dynamic values, 2) interactive figures, 3) relationship highlights, 4) concrete examples, and 5) step-by-step hints. To evaluate our system, we conduct two user studies: preliminary user testing and expert interviews. The study results confirm that our system allows more engaging experiences for learning math concepts.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal fusion has shown initial promising results for object detection of autonomous driving perception. However, many existing fusion schemes do not consider the quality of each fusion input and may suffer from adverse conditions on one or more sensors. While predictive uncertainty has been applied to characterize single-modal object detection performance at run time, incorporating uncertainties into the multi-modal fusion still lacks effective solutions due primarily to the uncertainty's cross-modal incomparability and distinct sensitivities to various adverse conditions. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Uncertainty-Encoded Mixture-of-Experts (UMoE) that explicitly incorporates single-modal uncertainties into LiDAR-camera fusion. UMoE uses individual expert network to process each sensor's detection result together with encoded uncertainty. Then, the expert networks' outputs are analyzed by a gating network to determine the fusion weights. The proposed UMoE module can be integrated into any proposal fusion pipeline. Evaluation shows that UMoE achieves a maximum of 10.67%, 3.17%, and 5.40% performance gain compared with the state-of-the-art proposal-level multi-modal object detectors under extreme weather, adversarial, and blinding attack scenarios.

- **Summary**: Based on powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), recent generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained prominence as a pivotal research area, exhibiting remarkable capability for both comprehension and generation. In this work, we address the evaluation of generative comprehension in MLLMs as a preliminary step towards a comprehensive assessment of generative models, by introducing a benchmark named SEED-Bench. SEED-Bench consists of 19K multiple choice questions with accurate human annotations (x 6 larger than existing benchmarks), which spans 12 evaluation dimensions including the comprehension of both the image and video modality. We develop an advanced pipeline for generating multiple-choice questions that target specific evaluation dimensions, integrating both automatic filtering and manual verification processes. Multiple-choice questions with groundtruth options derived from human annotation enables an objective and efficient assessment of model performance, eliminating the need for human or GPT intervention during evaluation. We further evaluate the performance of 18 models across all 12 dimensions, covering both the spatial and temporal understanding. By revealing the limitations of existing MLLMs through evaluation results, we aim for SEED-Bench to provide insights for motivating future research. We will launch and consistently maintain a leaderboard to provide a platform for the community to assess and investigate model capability.

- **Summary**: Deep models have achieved significant process on single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks, in particular large models with large kernel ($3\times3$ or more). However, the heavy computational footprint of such models prevents their deployment in real-time, resource-constrained environments. Conversely, $1\times1$ convolutions bring substantial computational efficiency, but struggle with aggregating local spatial representations, an essential capability to SISR models. In response to this dichotomy, we propose to harmonize the merits of both $3\times3$ and $1\times1$ kernels, and exploit a great potential for lightweight SISR tasks. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective fully $1\times1$ convolutional network, named Shift-Conv-based Network (SCNet). By incorporating a parameter-free spatial-shift operation, it equips the fully $1\times1$ convolutional network with powerful representation capability while impressive computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCNets, despite its fully $1\times1$ convolutional structure, consistently matches or even surpasses the performance of existing lightweight SR models that employ regular convolutions.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have gained prominence as a powerful paradigm in scene reconstruction and computer graphics, demonstrating remarkable results. By utilizing neural networks to parameterize data through implicit continuous functions, INRs offer several benefits. Recognizing the potential of INRs beyond these domains, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of INR models in the field of medical imaging. In medical settings, numerous challenging and ill-posed problems exist, making INRs an attractive solution. The survey explores the application of INRs in various medical imaging tasks, such as image reconstruction, segmentation, registration, novel view synthesis, and compression. It discusses the advantages and limitations of INRs, highlighting their resolution-agnostic nature, memory efficiency, ability to avoid locality biases, and differentiability, enabling adaptation to different tasks. Furthermore, the survey addresses the challenges and considerations specific to medical imaging data, such as data availability, computational complexity, and dynamic clinical scene analysis. It also identifies future research directions and opportunities, including integration with multi-modal imaging, real-time and interactive systems, and domain adaptation for clinical decision support. To facilitate further exploration and implementation of INRs in medical image analysis, we have provided a compilation of cited studies along with their available open-source implementations on \href{https://github.com/mindflow-institue/Awesome-Implicit-Neural-Representations-in-Medical-imaging}. Finally, we aim to consistently incorporate the most recent and relevant papers regularly.

- **Summary**: Medical image synthesis is a challenging task due to the scarcity of paired data. Several methods have applied CycleGAN to leverage unpaired data, but they often generate inaccurate mappings that shift the anatomy. This problem is further exacerbated when the images from the source and target modalities are heavily misaligned. Recently, current methods have aimed to address this issue by incorporating a supplementary segmentation network. Unfortunately, this strategy requires costly and time-consuming pixel-level annotations. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes MaskGAN, a novel and cost-effective framework that enforces structural consistency by utilizing automatically extracted coarse masks. Our approach employs a mask generator to outline anatomical structures and a content generator to synthesize CT contents that align with these structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskGAN outperforms state-of-the-art synthesis methods on a challenging pediatric dataset, where MR and CT scans are heavily misaligned due to rapid growth in children. Specifically, MaskGAN excels in preserving anatomical structures without the need for expert annotations. The code for this paper can be found at https://github.com/HieuPhan33/MaskGAN.

- **Summary**: Video frame interpolation has been actively studied with the development of convolutional neural networks. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of kernel weight sharing in convolution, the interpolated frame generated by it may lose details. In contrast, the attention mechanism in Transformer can better distinguish the contribution of each pixel, and it can also capture long-range pixel dependencies, which provides great potential for video interpolation. Nevertheless, the original Transformer is commonly used for 2D images; how to develop a Transformer-based framework with consideration of temporal self-attention for video frame interpolation remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose Video Frame Interpolation Flow Transformer to incorporate motion dynamics from optical flows into the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we design a Flow Transformer Block that calculates the temporal self-attention in a matched local area with the guidance of flow, making our framework suitable for interpolating frames with large motion while maintaining reasonably low complexity. In addition, we construct a multi-scale architecture to account for multi-scale motion, further improving the overall performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method can generate interpolated frames with better visual quality than state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: GAN inversion aims at inverting given images into corresponding latent codes for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), especially StyleGAN where exists a disentangled latent space that allows attribute-based image manipulation at latent level. As most inversion methods build upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we transfer a hierarchical vision Transformer backbone innovatively to predict $\mathcal{W^+}$ latent codes at token level. We further apply a Style-driven Multi-scale Adaptive Refinement Transformer (SMART) in $\mathcal{F}$ space to refine the intermediate style features of the generator. By treating style features as queries to retrieve lost identity information from the encoder's feature maps, SMART can not only produce high-quality inverted images but also surprisingly adapt to editing tasks. We then prove that StylePrompter lies in a more disentangled $\mathcal{W^+}$ and show the controllability of SMART. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that StylePrompter can achieve desirable performance in balancing reconstruction quality and editability, and is "smart" enough to fit into most edits, outperforming other $\mathcal{F}$-involved inversion methods.

- **Summary**: 2D forward-looking sonar is a crucial sensor for underwater robotic perception. A well-known problem in this field is estimating missing information in the elevation direction during sonar imaging. There are demands to estimate 3D information per image for 3D mapping and robot navigation during fly-through missions. Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated their strengths, but there are still drawbacks. Supervised learning methods have achieved high-quality results but may require further efforts to acquire 3D ground-truth labels. The existing self-supervised method requires pretraining using synthetic images with 3D supervision. This study aims to realize stable self-supervised learning of elevation angle estimation without pretraining using synthetic images. Failures during self-supervised learning may be caused by motion degeneracy problems. We first analyze the motion field of 2D forward-looking sonar, which is related to the main supervision signal. We utilize a modern learning framework and prove that if the training dataset is built with effective motions, the network can be trained in a self-supervised manner without the knowledge of synthetic data. Both simulation and real experiments validate the proposed method.

- **Summary**: The aim of blind super-resolution (SR) in computer vision is to improve the resolution of an image without prior knowledge of the degradation process that caused the image to be low-resolution. The State of the Art (SOTA) model Real-ESRGAN has advanced perceptual loss and produced visually compelling outcomes using more complex degradation models to simulate real-world degradations. However, there is still room to improve the super-resolved quality of Real-ESRGAN by implementing recent techniques. This research paper introduces StarSRGAN, a novel GAN model designed for blind super-resolution tasks that utilize 5 various architectures. Our model provides new SOTA performance with roughly 10% better on the MANIQA and AHIQ measures, as demonstrated by experimental comparisons with Real-ESRGAN. In addition, as a compact version, StarSRGAN Lite provides approximately 7.5 times faster reconstruction speed (real-time upsampling from 540p to 4K) but can still keep nearly 90% of image quality, thereby facilitating the development of a real-time SR experience for future research. Our codes are released at https://github.com/kynthesis/StarSRGAN.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present InvVis, a new approach for invertible visualization, which is reconstructing or further modifying a visualization from an image. InvVis allows the embedding of a significant amount of data, such as chart data, chart information, source code, etc., into visualization images. The encoded image is perceptually indistinguishable from the original one. We propose a new method to efficiently express chart data in the form of images, enabling large-capacity data embedding. We also outline a model based on the invertible neural network to achieve high-quality data concealing and revealing. We explore and implement a variety of application scenarios of InvVis. Additionally, we conduct a series of evaluation experiments to assess our method from multiple perspectives, including data embedding quality, data restoration accuracy, data encoding capacity, etc. The result of our experiments demonstrates the great potential of InvVis in invertible visualization.

- **Summary**: Accurate and up-to-date information on building characteristics is essential for vulnerability assessment; however, the high costs and long timeframes associated with conducting traditional field surveys can be an obstacle to obtaining critical exposure datasets needed for disaster risk management. In this work, we leverage deep learning techniques for the automated classification of roof characteristics from very high-resolution orthophotos and airborne LiDAR data obtained in Dominica following Hurricane Maria in 2017. We demonstrate that the fusion of multimodal earth observation data performs better than using any single data source alone. Using our proposed methods, we achieve F1 scores of 0.93 and 0.92 for roof type and roof material classification, respectively. This work is intended to help governments produce more timely building information to improve resilience and disaster response in the Caribbean.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study Text-to-3D content generation leveraging 2D diffusion priors to enhance the quality and detail of the generated 3D models. Recent progress (Magic3D) in text-to-3D has shown that employing high-resolution (e.g., 512 x 512) renderings can lead to the production of high-quality 3D models using latent diffusion priors. To enable rendering at even higher resolutions, which has the potential to further augment the quality and detail of the models, we propose a novel approach that combines multiple noise estimation processes with a pretrained 2D diffusion prior. Distinct from the Bar-Tal et al.s' study which binds multiple denoised results to generate images from texts, our approach integrates the computation of scoring distillation losses such as SDS loss and VSD loss which are essential techniques for the 3D content generation with 2D diffusion priors. We experimentally evaluated the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can generate high-quality details compared to the baselines.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made the ambitious quest for generalist agents significantly far from being a fantasy. A key hurdle for building such general models is the diversity and heterogeneity of tasks and modalities. A promising solution is unification, allowing the support of a myriad of tasks and modalities within one unified framework. While few large models (e.g., Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), trained on massive datasets, can support more than two modalities, current small to mid-scale unified models are still limited to 2 modalities, usually image-text or video-text. The question that we ask is: is it possible to build efficiently a unified model that can support all modalities? To answer this, we propose UnIVAL, a step further towards this ambitious goal. Without relying on fancy datasets sizes or models with billions of parameters, the ~ 0.25B parameter UnIVAL model goes beyond two modalities and unifies text, images, video, and audio into a single model. Our model is efficiently pretrained on many tasks, based on task balancing and multimodal curriculum learning. UnIVAL shows competitive performance to existing state-of-the-art approaches, across image and video-text tasks. The feature representations learned from image and video-text modalities, allows the model to achieve competitive performance when finetuned on audio-text tasks, despite not being pretrained on audio. Thanks to the unified model, we propose a novel study on multimodal model merging via weight interpolation of models trained on different multimodal tasks, showing their benefits in particular for out-of-distribution generalization. Finally, we motivate unification by showing the synergy between tasks. The model weights and code are released here: https://github.com/mshukor/UnIVAL.

- **Summary**: Gastrointestinal mucosal changes can cause cancers after some years and early diagnosing them can be very useful to prevent cancers and early treatment. In this article, 8 classes of mucosal changes and anatomical landmarks including Polyps, Ulcerative Colitis, Esophagitis, Normal Z-Line, Normal Pylorus, Normal Cecum, Dyed Lifted Polyps, and Dyed Lifted Margin were predicted by deep learning. We used neural networks in this article. It is a black box artificial intelligence algorithm that works like a human neural system. In this article, Transfer Learning (TL) based on the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which is one of the well-known types of neural networks in image processing is used. We compared some famous CNN architecture including VGG, Inception, Xception, and ResNet. Our best model got 93% accuracy in test images. At last, we used our model in some real endoscopy and colonoscopy movies to classify problems.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with zero-padding in feature extraction and learning. After verifying the roles of zero-padding in enabling translation-equivalence, and pooling in its translation-invariance driven nature, we show that with similar number of free parameters, any deep fully connected networks (DFCNs) can be represented by DCNNs with zero-padding. This demonstrates that DCNNs with zero-padding is essentially better than DFCNs in feature extraction. Consequently, we derive universal consistency of DCNNs with zero-padding and show its translation-invariance in the learning process. All our theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments including both toy simulations and real-data running.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has proven to be very effective in transferring knowledge obtained from a source domain with labeled data to a target domain with unlabeled data. Owing to the lack of labeled data in the target domain and the possible presence of unknown classes, open-set domain adaptation (ODA) has emerged as a potential solution to identify these classes during the training phase. Although existing ODA approaches aim to solve the distribution shifts between the source and target domains, most methods fine-tuned ImageNet pre-trained models on the source domain with the adaptation on the target domain. Recent visual-language foundation models (VLFM), such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP), are robust to many distribution shifts and, therefore, should substantially improve the performance of ODA. In this work, we explore generic ways to adopt CLIP, a popular VLFM, for ODA. We investigate the performance of zero-shot prediction using CLIP, and then propose an entropy optimization strategy to assist the ODA models with the outputs of CLIP. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the ODA problem.

- **Summary**: In 3D shape reconstruction based on template mesh deformation, a regularization, such as smoothness energy, is employed to guide the reconstruction into a desirable direction. In this paper, we highlight an often overlooked property in the regularization: the vertex density in the mesh. Without careful control on the density, the reconstruction may suffer from under-sampling of vertices near shape details. We propose a novel mesh density adaptation method to resolve the under-sampling problem. Our mesh density adaptation energy increases the density of vertices near complex structures via deformation to help reconstruction of shape details. We demonstrate the usability and performance of mesh density adaptation with two tasks, inverse rendering and non-rigid surface registration. Our method produces more accurate reconstruction results compared to the cases without mesh density adaptation.

- **Summary**: As a crucial extension of entity alignment (EA), multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify identical entities across disparate knowledge graphs (KGs) by exploiting associated visual information. However, existing MMEA approaches primarily concentrate on the fusion paradigm of multi-modal entity features, while neglecting the challenges presented by the pervasive phenomenon of missing and intrinsic ambiguity of visual images. In this paper, we present a further analysis of visual modality incompleteness, benchmarking latest MMEA models on our proposed dataset MMEA-UMVM, where the types of alignment KGs covering bilingual and monolingual, with standard (non-iterative) and iterative training paradigms to evaluate the model performance. Our research indicates that, in the face of modality incompleteness, models succumb to overfitting the modality noise, and exhibit performance oscillations or declines at high rates of missing modality. This proves that the inclusion of additional multi-modal data can sometimes adversely affect EA. To address these challenges, we introduce UMAEA , a robust multi-modal entity alignment approach designed to tackle uncertainly missing and ambiguous visual modalities. It consistently achieves SOTA performance across all 97 benchmark splits, significantly surpassing existing baselines with limited parameters and time consumption, while effectively alleviating the identified limitations of other models. Our code and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/zjukg/UMAEA.

- **Summary**: Bias field, which is caused by imperfect MR devices or imaged objects, introduces intensity inhomogeneity into MR images and degrades the performance of MR image analysis methods. Many retrospective algorithms were developed to facilitate the bias correction, to which the deep learning-based methods outperformed. However, in the training phase, the supervised deep learning-based methods heavily rely on the synthesized bias field. As the formation of the bias field is extremely complex, it is difficult to mimic the true physical property of MR images by synthesized data. While bias field correction and image segmentation are strongly related, the segmentation map is precisely obtained by decoupling the bias field from the original MR image, and the bias value is indicated by the segmentation map in reverse. Thus, we proposed novel unsupervised decomposition networks that are trained only with biased data to obtain the bias-free MR images. Networks are made up of: a segmentation part to predict the probability of every pixel belonging to each class, and an estimation part to calculate the bias field, which are optimized alternately. Furthermore, loss functions based on the combination of fuzzy clustering and the multiplicative bias field are also devised. The proposed loss functions introduce the smoothness of bias field and construct the soft relationships among different classes under intra-consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate bias fields and produce better bias correction results.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation plays a critical role in clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, accurate segmentation of medical images is challenging due to several factors, such as the lack of high-quality annotation, imaging noise, and anatomical differences across patients. In addition, there is still a considerable gap in performance between the existing label-efficient methods and fully-supervised methods. To address the above challenges, we propose ScribbleVC, a novel framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation that leverages vision and class embeddings via the multimodal information enhancement mechanism. In addition, ScribbleVC uniformly utilizes the CNN features and Transformer features to achieve better visual feature extraction. The proposed method combines a scribble-based approach with a segmentation network and a class-embedding module to produce accurate segmentation masks. We evaluate ScribbleVC on three benchmark datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. The datasets and code are released on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the style of an artwork to a photograph while maintaining its original overall content. Many prior works focus on designing various transfer modules to transfer the style statistics to the content image. Although effective, ignoring the clear disentanglement of the content features and the style features from the first beginning, they have difficulty in balancing between content preservation and style transferring. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel information disentanglement method, named InfoStyler, to capture the minimal sufficient information for both content and style representations from the pre-trained encoding network. InfoStyler formulates the disentanglement representation learning as an information compression problem by eliminating style statistics from the content image and removing the content structure from the style image. Besides, to further facilitate disentanglement learning, a cross-domain Information Bottleneck (IB) learning strategy is proposed by reconstructing the content and style domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our InfoStyler can synthesize high-quality stylized images while balancing content structure preservation and style pattern richness.

- **Summary**: We propose an efficient deep learning method for single image defocus deblurring (SIDD) by further exploring inverse kernel properties. Although the current inverse kernel method, i.e., kernel-sharing parallel atrous convolution (KPAC), can address spatially varying defocus blurs, it has difficulty in handling large blurs of this kind. To tackle this issue, we propose a Residual and Recursive Kernel-sharing Atrous Convolution (R$^2$KAC). R$^2$KAC builds on a significant observation of inverse kernels, that is, successive use of inverse-kernel-based deconvolutions with fixed size helps remove unexpected large blurs but produces ringing artifacts. Specifically, on top of kernel-sharing atrous convolutions used to simulate multi-scale inverse kernels, R$^2$KAC applies atrous convolutions recursively to simulate a large inverse kernel. Specifically, on top of kernel-sharing atrous convolutions, R$^2$KAC stacks atrous convolutions recursively to simulate a large inverse kernel. To further alleviate the contingent effect of recursive stacking, i.e., ringing artifacts, we add identity shortcuts between atrous convolutions to simulate residual deconvolutions. Lastly, a scale recurrent module is embedded in the R$^2$KAC network, leading to SR-R$^2$KAC, so that multi-scale information from coarse to fine is exploited to progressively remove the spatially varying defocus blurs. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.



### Count, Decode and Fetch: A New Approach to Handwritten Chinese Character Error Correction

- **Summary**: Recently, handwritten Chinese character error correction has been greatly improved by employing encoder-decoder methods to decompose a Chinese character into an ideographic description sequence (IDS). However, existing methods implicitly capture and encode linguistic information inherent in IDS sequences, leading to a tendency to generate IDS sequences that match seen characters. This poses a challenge when dealing with an unseen misspelled character, as the decoder may generate an IDS sequence that matches a seen character instead. Therefore, we introduce Count, Decode and Fetch (CDF), a novel approach that exhibits better generalization towards unseen misspelled characters. CDF is mainly composed of three parts: the counter, the decoder, and the fetcher. In the first stage, the counter predicts the number of each radical class without the symbol-level position annotations. In the second stage, the decoder employs the counting information and generates the IDS sequence step by step. Moreover, by updating the counting information at each time step, the decoder becomes aware of the existence of each radical. With the decomposed IDS sequence, we can determine whether the given character is misspelled. If it is misspelled, the fetcher under the transductive transfer learning strategy predicts the ideal character that the user originally intended to write. We integrate our method into existing encoder-decoder models and significantly enhance their performance.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation typically necessitates a large and precisely annotated dataset. However, obtaining pixel-wise annotation is a labor-intensive task that requires significant effort from domain experts, making it challenging to obtain in practical clinical scenarios. In such situations, reducing the amount of annotation required is a more practical approach. One feasible direction is sparse annotation, which involves annotating only a few slices, and has several advantages over traditional weak annotation methods such as bounding boxes and scribbles, as it preserves exact boundaries. However, learning from sparse annotation is challenging due to the scarcity of supervision signals. To address this issue, we propose a framework that can robustly learn from sparse annotation using the cross-teaching of both 3D and 2D networks. Considering the characteristic of these networks, we develop two pseudo label selection strategies, which are hard-soft confidence threshold and consistent label fusion. Our experimental results on the MMWHS dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) semi-supervised segmentation methods. Moreover, our approach achieves results that are comparable to the fully-supervised upper bound result.

- **Summary**: Automatic analysis of colonoscopy images has been an active field of research motivated by the importance of early detection of precancerous polyps. However, detecting polyps during the live examination can be challenging due to various factors such as variation of skills and experience among the endoscopists, lack of attentiveness, and fatigue leading to a high polyp miss-rate. Deep learning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge as it can assist endoscopists in detecting and classifying overlooked polyps and abnormalities in real time. In addition to the algorithm's accuracy, transparency and interpretability are crucial to explaining the whys and hows of the algorithm's prediction. Further, most algorithms are developed in private data, closed source, or proprietary software, and methods lack reproducibility. Therefore, to promote the development of efficient and transparent methods, we have organized the "Medico automatic polyp segmentation (Medico 2020)" and "MedAI: Transparency in Medical Image Segmentation (MedAI 2021)" competitions. We present a comprehensive summary and analyze each contribution, highlight the strength of the best-performing methods, and discuss the possibility of clinical translations of such methods into the clinic. For the transparency task, a multi-disciplinary team, including expert gastroenterologists, accessed each submission and evaluated the team based on open-source practices, failure case analysis, ablation studies, usability and understandability of evaluations to gain a deeper understanding of the models' credibility for clinical deployment. Through the comprehensive analysis of the challenge, we not only highlight the advancements in polyp and surgical instrument segmentation but also encourage qualitative evaluation for building more transparent and understandable AI-based colonoscopy systems.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks are used for generating the data using a generator and a discriminator, GANs usually produce high-quality images, but training GANs in an adversarial setting is a difficult task. GANs require high computation power and hyper-parameter regularization for converging. Projected GANs tackle the training difficulty of GANs by using transfer learning to project the generated and real samples into a pre-trained feature space. Projected GANs improve the training time and convergence but produce artifacts in the generated images which reduce the quality of the generated samples, we propose an optimized architecture called Stylized Projected GANs which integrates the mapping network of the Style GANs with Skip Layer Excitation of Fast GAN. The integrated modules are incorporated within the generator architecture of the Fast GAN to mitigate the problem of artifacts in the generated images.

- **Summary**: Plastic has imbibed itself as an indispensable part of our day to day activities, becoming a source of problems due to its non-biodegradable nature and cheaper production prices. With these problems, comes the challenge of mitigating and responding to the aftereffects of disposal or the lack of proper disposal which leads to waste concentrating in locations and disturbing ecosystems for both plants and animals. As plastic debris levels continue to rise with the accumulation of waste in garbage patches in landfills and more hazardously in natural water bodies, swift action is necessary to plug or cease this flow. While manual sorting operations and detection can offer a solution, they can be augmented using highly advanced computer imagery linked with robotic appendages for removing wastes. The primary application of focus in this report are the much-discussed Computer Vision and Open Vision which have gained novelty for their light dependence on internet and ability to relay information in remote areas. These applications can be applied to the creation of edge-based mobility devices that can as a counter to the growing problem of plastic debris in oceans and rivers, demanding little connectivity and still offering the same results with reasonably timed maintenance. The principal findings of this project cover the various methods that were tested and deployed to detect waste in images, as well as comparing them against different waste types. The project has been able to produce workable models that can perform on time detection of sampled images using an augmented CNN approach. Latter portions of the project have also achieved a better interpretation of the necessary preprocessing steps required to arrive at the best accuracies, including the best hardware for expanding waste detection studies to larger environments.

- **Summary**: Video-based scene graph generation (VidSGG) is an approach that aims to represent video content in a dynamic graph by identifying visual entities and their relationships. Due to the inherently biased distribution and missing annotations in the training data, current VidSGG methods have been found to perform poorly on less-represented predicates. In this paper, we propose an explicit solution to address this under-explored issue by supplementing missing predicates that should be appear in the ground-truth annotations. Dubbed Trico, our method seeks to supplement the missing predicates by exploring three complementary spatio-temporal correlations. Guided by these correlations, the missing labels can be effectively supplemented thus achieving an unbiased predicate predictions. We validate the effectiveness of Trico on the most widely used VidSGG datasets, i.e., VidVRD and VidOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance achieved by Trico, particularly on those tail predicates.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is classically used to improve the overall performance of deep learning models. It is, however, challenging in the case of medical applications, and in particular for multiparametric datasets. For example, traditional geometric transformations used in several applications to generate synthetic images can modify in a non-realistic manner the patients' anatomy. Therefore, dedicated image generation techniques are necessary in the medical field to, for example, mimic a given pathology realistically. This paper introduces a new data augmentation architecture that generates synthetic multiparametric (T1 arterial, T1 portal, and T2) magnetic resonance images (MRI) of massive macrotrabecular subtype hepatocellular carcinoma with their corresponding tumor masks through a generative deep learning approach. The proposed architecture creates liver tumor masks and abdominal edges used as input in a Pix2Pix network for synthetic data creation. The method's efficiency is demonstrated by training it on a limited multiparametric dataset of MRI triplets from $89$ patients with liver lesions to generate $1,000$ synthetic triplets and their corresponding liver tumor masks. The resulting Frechet Inception Distance score was $86.55$. The proposed approach was among the winners of the 2021 data augmentation challenge organized by the French Society of Radiology.

- **Summary**: Markerless motion capture (MMC) is revolutionizing gait analysis in clinical settings by making it more accessible, raising the question of how to extract the most clinically meaningful information from gait data. In multiple fields ranging from image processing to natural language processing, self-supervised learning (SSL) from large amounts of unannotated data produces very effective representations for downstream tasks. However, there has only been limited use of SSL to learn effective representations of gait and movement, and it has not been applied to gait analysis with MMC. One SSL objective that has not been applied to gait is contrastive learning, which finds representations that place similar samples closer together in the learned space. If the learned similarity metric captures clinically meaningful differences, this could produce a useful representation for many downstream clinical tasks. Contrastive learning can also be combined with causal masking to predict future timesteps, which is an appealing SSL objective given the dynamical nature of gait. We applied these techniques to gait analyses performed with MMC in a rehabilitation hospital from a diverse clinical population. We find that contrastive learning on unannotated gait data learns a representation that captures clinically meaningful information. We probe this learned representation using the framework of biomarkers and show it holds promise as both a diagnostic and response biomarker, by showing it can accurately classify diagnosis from gait and is responsive to inpatient therapy, respectively. We ultimately hope these learned representations will enable predictive and prognostic gait-based biomarkers that can facilitate precision rehabilitation through greater use of MMC to quantify movement in rehabilitation.

- **Summary**: We propose Automatic Feature Explanation using Contrasting Concepts (FALCON), an interpretability framework to explain features of image representations. For a target feature, FALCON captions its highly activating cropped images using a large captioning dataset (like LAION-400m) and a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. Each word among the captions is scored and ranked leading to a small number of shared, human-understandable concepts that closely describe the target feature. FALCON also applies contrastive interpretation using lowly activating (counterfactual) images, to eliminate spurious concepts. Although many existing approaches interpret features independently, we observe in state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised models, that less than 20% of the representation space can be explained by individual features. We show that features in larger spaces become more interpretable when studied in groups and can be explained with high-order scoring concepts through FALCON. We discuss how extracted concepts can be used to explain and debug failures in downstream tasks. Finally, we present a technique to transfer concepts from one (explainable) representation space to another unseen representation space by learning a simple linear transformation.

- **Summary**: Explainable Deep Learning has gained significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in domains such as medical imaging, where accurate and interpretable machine learning models are crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Grad-CAM is a baseline that highlights the most critical regions of an image used in a deep learning model's decision-making process, increasing interpretability and trust in the results. It is applied in many computer vision (CV) tasks such as classification and explanation. This study explores the principles of Explainable Deep Learning and its relevance to medical imaging, discusses various explainability techniques and their limitations, and examines medical imaging applications of Grad-CAM. The findings highlight the potential of Explainable Deep Learning and Grad-CAM in improving the accuracy and interpretability of deep learning models in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) enables the development of machine learning models on datasets distributed across data centers such as hospitals and clinical research laboratories. However, recent research has found that current FL algorithms face a trade-off between local and global performance when confronted with distribution shifts. Specifically, personalized FL methods have a tendency to overfit to local data, leading to a sharp valley in the local model and inhibiting its ability to generalize to out-of-distribution data. In this paper, we propose a novel federated model soup method (i.e., selective interpolation of model parameters) to optimize the trade-off between local and global performance. Specifically, during the federated training phase, each client maintains its own global model pool by monitoring the performance of the interpolated model between the local and global models. This allows us to alleviate overfitting and seek flat minima, which can significantly improve the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our method on retinal and pathological image classification tasks, and our proposed method achieves significant improvements for out-of-distribution generalization.

- **Summary**: Interactive segmentation entails a human marking an image to guide how a model either creates or edits a segmentation. Our work addresses limitations of existing methods: they either only support one gesture type for marking an image (e.g., either clicks or scribbles) or require knowledge of the gesture type being employed, and require specifying whether marked regions should be included versus excluded in the final segmentation. We instead propose a simplified interactive segmentation task where a user only must mark an image, where the input can be of any gesture type without specifying the gesture type. We support this new task by introducing the first interactive segmentation dataset with multiple gesture types as well as a new evaluation metric capable of holistically evaluating interactive segmentation algorithms. We then analyze numerous interactive segmentation algorithms, including ones adapted for our novel task. While we observe promising performance overall, we also highlight areas for future improvement. To facilitate further extensions of this work, we publicly share our new dataset at https://github.com/joshmyersdean/dig.

- **Summary**: Training and deploying the large language models requires a large mount of computational resource because the language models contain billions of parameters and the text has thousands of tokens. Another problem is that the large language models are static. They are fixed after the training process. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose to train and deploy the dynamic large language model on blockchains, which have high computation performance and are distributed across a network of computers. A blockchain is a secure, decentralized, and transparent system that allows for the creation of a tamper-proof ledger for transactions without the need for intermediaries. The dynamic large language models can continuously learn from the user input after the training process. Our method provides a new way to develop the large language models and also sheds a light on the next generation artificial intelligence systems.

- **Summary**: Mixed-Precision Quantization~(MQ) can achieve a competitive accuracy-complexity trade-off for models. Conventional training-based search methods require time-consuming candidate training to search optimized per-layer bit-width configurations in MQ. Recently, some training-free approaches have presented various MQ proxies and significantly improve search efficiency. However, the correlation between these proxies and quantization accuracy is poorly understood. To address the gap, we first build the MQ-Bench-101, which involves different bit configurations and quantization results. Then, we observe that the existing training-free proxies perform weak correlations on the MQ-Bench-101. To efficiently seek superior proxies, we develop an automatic search of proxies framework for MQ via evolving algorithms. In particular, we devise an elaborate search space involving the existing proxies and perform an evolution search to discover the best correlated MQ proxy. We proposed a diversity-prompting selection strategy and compatibility screening protocol to avoid premature convergence and improve search efficiency. In this way, our Evolving proxies for Mixed-precision Quantization~(EMQ) framework allows the auto-generation of proxies without heavy tuning and expert knowledge. Extensive experiments on ImageNet with various ResNet and MobileNet families demonstrate that our EMQ obtains superior performance than state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods at a significantly reduced cost. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: Temporal video grounding (TVG) aims to retrieve the time interval of a language query from an untrimmed video. A significant challenge in TVG is the low "Semantic Noise Ratio (SNR)", which results in worse performance with lower SNR. Prior works have addressed this challenge using sophisticated techniques. In this paper, we propose a no-frills TVG model that consists of two core modules, namely multi-scale neighboring attention and zoom-in boundary detection. The multi-scale neighboring attention restricts each video token to only aggregate visual contexts from its neighbor, enabling the extraction of the most distinguishing information with multi-scale feature hierarchies from high-ratio noises. The zoom-in boundary detection then focuses on local-wise discrimination of the selected top candidates for fine-grained grounding adjustment. With an end-to-end training strategy, our model achieves competitive performance on different TVG benchmarks, while also having the advantage of faster inference speed and lighter model parameters, thanks to its lightweight architecture.

- **Summary**: As a distributed machine learning technique, federated learning (FL) requires clients to collaboratively train a shared model with an edge server without leaking their local data. However, the heterogeneous data distribution among clients often leads to a decrease in model performance. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a prototype-based regularization strategy to address the heterogeneity in the data distribution. Specifically, the regularization process involves the server aggregating local prototypes from distributed clients to generate a global prototype, which is then sent back to the individual clients to guide their local training. The experimental results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that our proposal achieves improvements of 3.3% and 8.9% in average test accuracy, respectively, compared to the most popular baseline FedAvg. Furthermore, our approach has a fast convergence rate in heterogeneous settings.

- **Summary**: Traditional computer vision models often necessitate extensive data acquisition, annotation, and validation. These models frequently struggle in real-world applications, resulting in high false positive and negative rates, and exhibit poor adaptability to new scenarios, often requiring costly retraining. To address these issues, we present Ethosight, a flexible and adaptable zero-shot video analytics system. Ethosight begins from a clean slate based on user-defined video analytics, specified through natural language or keywords, and leverages joint embedding models and reasoning mechanisms informed by ontologies such as WordNet and ConceptNet. Ethosight operates effectively on low-cost edge devices and supports enhanced runtime adaptation, thereby offering a new approach to continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting. We provide empirical validation of Ethosight's promising effectiveness across diverse and complex use cases, while highlighting areas for further improvement. A significant contribution of this work is the release of all source code and datasets to enable full reproducibility and to foster further innovation in both the research and commercial domains.

- **Summary**: Have you ever imagined how it would look if we placed new objects into paintings? For example, what would it look like if we placed a basketball into Claude Monet's ``Water Lilies, Evening Effect''? We propose Reference-based Painterly Inpainting, a novel task that crosses the wild reference domain gap and implants novel objects into artworks. Although previous works have examined reference-based inpainting, they are not designed for large domain discrepancies between the target and the reference, such as inpainting an artistic image using a photorealistic reference. This paper proposes a novel diffusion framework, dubbed RefPaint, to ``inpaint more wildly'' by taking such references with large domain gaps. Built with an image-conditioned diffusion model, we introduce a ladder-side branch and a masked fusion mechanism to work with the inpainting mask. By decomposing the CLIP image embeddings at inference time, one can manipulate the strength of semantic and style information with ease. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed RefPaint framework produces significantly better results than existing methods. Our method enables creative painterly image inpainting with reference objects that would otherwise be difficult to achieve. Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/RefPaint/

- **Summary**: Event-based cameras have become increasingly popular for tracking fast-moving objects due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for tracking event blobs using raw events asynchronously in real time. We introduce the concept of an event blob as a spatio-temporal likelihood of event occurrence where the conditional spatial likelihood is blob-like. Many real-world objects generate event blob data, for example, flickering LEDs such as car headlights or any small foreground object moving against a static or slowly varying background. The proposed algorithm uses a nearest neighbour classifier with a dynamic threshold criteria for data association coupled with a Kalman filter to track the event blob state. Our algorithm achieves highly accurate tracking and event blob shape estimation even under challenging lighting conditions and high-speed motions. The microsecond time resolution achieved means that the filter output can be used to derive secondary information such as time-to-contact or range estimation, that will enable applications to real-world problems such as collision avoidance in autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: To address 3D object retrieval, substantial efforts have been made to generate highly discriminative descriptors of 3D objects represented by a single modality, e.g., voxels, point clouds or multi-view images. It is promising to leverage the complementary information from multi-modality representations of 3D objects to further improve retrieval performance. However, multi-modality 3D object retrieval is rarely developed and analyzed on large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose self-and-cross attention based aggregation of point cloud and multi-view images (SCA-PVNet) for 3D object retrieval. With deep features extracted from point clouds and multi-view images, we design two types of feature aggregation modules, namely the In-Modality Aggregation Module (IMAM) and the Cross-Modality Aggregation Module (CMAM), for effective feature fusion. IMAM leverages a self-attention mechanism to aggregate multi-view features while CMAM exploits a cross-attention mechanism to interact point cloud features with multi-view features. The final descriptor of a 3D object for object retrieval can be obtained via concatenating the aggregated features from both modules. Extensive experiments and analysis are conducted on three datasets, ranging from small to large scale, to show the superiority of the proposed SCA-PVNet over the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Domain generalization (DG) seeks to learn robust models that generalize well under unknown distribution shifts. As a critical aspect of DG, optimizer selection has not been explored in depth. Currently, most DG methods follow the widely used benchmark, DomainBed, and utilize Adam as the default optimizer for all datasets. However, we reveal that Adam is not necessarily the optimal choice for the majority of current DG methods and datasets. Based on the perspective of loss landscape flatness, we propose a novel approach, Flatness-Aware Minimization for Domain Generalization (FAD), which can efficiently optimize both zeroth-order and first-order flatness simultaneously for DG. We provide theoretical analyses of the FAD's out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization error and convergence. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FAD on various DG datasets. Additionally, we confirm that FAD is capable of discovering flatter optima in comparison to other zeroth-order and first-order flatness-aware optimization methods.

- **Summary**: Image distortion by atmospheric turbulence is a stochastic degradation, which is a critical problem in long-range optical imaging systems. A number of research has been conducted during the past decades, including model-based and emerging deep-learning solutions with the help of synthetic data. Although fast and physics-grounded simulation tools have been introduced to help the deep-learning models adapt to real-world turbulence conditions recently, the training of such models only relies on the synthetic data and ground truth pairs. This paper proposes the Physics-integrated Restoration Network (PiRN) to bring the physics-based simulator directly into the training process to help the network to disentangle the stochasticity from the degradation and the underlying image. Furthermore, to overcome the ``average effect" introduced by deterministic models and the domain gap between the synthetic and real-world degradation, we further introduce PiRN with Stochastic Refinement (PiRN-SR) to boost its perceptual quality. Overall, our PiRN and PiRN-SR improve the generalization to real-world unknown turbulence conditions and provide a state-of-the-art restoration in both pixel-wise accuracy and perceptual quality.

- **Summary**: Building outline extracted from high-resolution aerial images can be used in various application fields such as change detection and disaster assessment. However, traditional CNN model cannot recognize contours very precisely from original images. In this paper, we proposed a CNN and Transformer based model together with active contour model to deal with this problem. We also designed a triple-branch decoder structure to handle different features generated by encoder. Experiment results show that our model outperforms other baseline model on two datasets, achieving 91.1% mIoU on Vaihingen and 83.8% on Bing huts.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) has drawn increasing attention owing to its potential use in large-scale industrial applications. Existing federated learning works mainly focus on model homogeneous settings. However, practical federated learning typically faces the heterogeneity of data distributions, model architectures, network environments, and hardware devices among participant clients. Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) is much more challenging, and corresponding solutions are diverse and complex. Therefore, a systematic survey on this topic about the research challenges and state-of-the-art is essential. In this survey, we firstly summarize the various research challenges in HFL from five aspects: statistical heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, communication heterogeneity, device heterogeneity, and additional challenges. In addition, recent advances in HFL are reviewed and a new taxonomy of existing HFL methods is proposed with an in-depth analysis of their pros and cons. We classify existing methods from three different levels according to the HFL procedure: data-level, model-level, and server-level. Finally, several critical and promising future research directions in HFL are discussed, which may facilitate further developments in this field. A periodically updated collection on HFL is available at https://github.com/marswhu/HFL_Survey.

- **Summary**: In recent years, tensor networks have emerged as powerful tools for solving large-scale optimization problems. One of the most promising tensor networks is the tensor ring (TR) decomposition, which achieves circular dimensional permutation invariance in the model through the utilization of the trace operation and equitable treatment of the latent cores. On the other hand, more recently, quaternions have gained significant attention and have been widely utilized in color image processing tasks due to their effectiveness in encoding color pixels. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the quaternion tensor ring (QTR) decomposition, which inherits the powerful and generalized representation abilities of the TR decomposition while leveraging the advantages of quaternions for color pixel representation. In addition to providing the definition of QTR decomposition and an algorithm for learning the QTR format, this paper also proposes a low-rank quaternion tensor completion (LRQTC) model and its algorithm for color image inpainting based on the QTR decomposition. Finally, extensive experiments on color image inpainting demonstrate that the proposed QTLRC method is highly competitive.

- **Summary**: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match a specific polyp in a large gallery with different cameras and views, which plays a key role for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in the computer-aided diagnosis. However, traditional methods mainly focus on the visual representation learning, while neglect to explore the potential of semantic features during training, which may easily leads to poor generalization capability when adapted the pretrained model into the new scenarios. To relieve this dilemma, we propose a simple but effective training method named VT-ReID, which can remarkably enrich the representation of polyp videos with the interchange of high-level semantic information. Moreover, we elaborately design a novel clustering mechanism to introduce prior knowledge from textual data, which leverages contrastive learning to promote better separation from abundant unlabeled text data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ the visual-text feature with clustering mechanism for the colonoscopic polyp re-identification.

- **Summary**: This article presents the methods used to parallelize a new computer vision application. The system is able to automatically detect meteor from non-stabilized cameras and noisy video sequences. The application is designed to be embedded in weather balloons or for airborne observation campaigns. Thus, the final target is a low power system-on-chip (< 10 Watts) while the software needs to compute a stream of frames in real-time (> 25 frames per second). For this, first the application is split in a tasks graph, then different parallelization techniques are applied. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of the parallelization methods. For instance, on the Raspberry Pi 4 and on a HD video sequence, the processing chain reaches 42 frames per second while it only consumes 6 Watts.

- **Summary**: A reliable and comprehensive evaluation metric that aligns with manual preference assessments is crucial for conversational head video synthesis methods development. Existing quantitative evaluations often fail to capture the full complexity of human preference, as they only consider limited evaluation dimensions. Qualitative evaluations and user studies offer a solution but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. This limitation hinders the advancement of conversational head generation algorithms and systems. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based evaluation metric named Preference Score (PS) for fitting human preference according to the quantitative evaluations across different dimensions. PS can serve as a quantitative evaluation without the need for human annotation. Experimental results validate the superiority of Preference Score in aligning with human perception, and also demonstrate robustness and generalizability to unseen data, making it a valuable tool for advancing conversation head generation. We expect this metric could facilitate new advances in conversational head generation. Project Page: https://https://github.com/dc3ea9f/PreferenceScore.

- **Summary**: Neural network quantization aims to accelerate and trim full-precision neural network models by using low bit approximations. Methods adopting the quantization aware training (QAT) paradigm have recently seen a rapid growth, but are often conceptually complicated. This paper proposes a novel and highly effective QAT method, quantized feature distillation (QFD). QFD first trains a quantized (or binarized) representation as the teacher, then quantize the network using knowledge distillation (KD). Quantitative results show that QFD is more flexible and effective (i.e., quantization friendly) than previous quantization methods. QFD surpasses existing methods by a noticeable margin on not only image classification but also object detection, albeit being much simpler. Furthermore, QFD quantizes ViT and Swin-Transformer on MS-COCO detection and segmentation, which verifies its potential in real world deployment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that vision transformers have been quantized in object detection and image segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: The widespread use of face retouching filters on short-video platforms has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital appearances and the impact of deceptive advertising. To address these issues, there is a pressing need to develop advanced face retouching techniques. However, the lack of large-scale and fine-grained face retouching datasets has been a major obstacle to progress in this field. In this paper, we introduce RetouchingFFHQ, a large-scale and fine-grained face retouching dataset that contains over half a million conditionally-retouched images. RetouchingFFHQ stands out from previous datasets due to its large scale, high quality, fine-grainedness, and customization. By including four typical types of face retouching operations and different retouching levels, we extend the binary face retouching detection into a fine-grained, multi-retouching type, and multi-retouching level estimation problem. Additionally, we propose a Multi-granularity Attention Module (MAM) as a plugin for CNN backbones for enhanced cross-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments using different baselines as well as our proposed method on RetouchingFFHQ show decent performance on face retouching detection. With the proposed new dataset, we believe there is great potential for future work to tackle the challenging problem of real-world fine-grained face retouching detection.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a promising approach for synthesizing novel views, given a set of images and the corresponding camera poses of a scene. However, images photographed from a low-light scene can hardly be used to train a NeRF model to produce high-quality results, due to their low pixel intensities, heavy noise, and color distortion. Combining existing low-light image enhancement methods with NeRF methods also does not work well due to the view inconsistency caused by the individual 2D enhancement process. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Low-Light NeRF (or LLNeRF), to enhance the scene representation and synthesize normal-light novel views directly from sRGB low-light images in an unsupervised manner. The core of our approach is a decomposition of radiance field learning, which allows us to enhance the illumination, reduce noise and correct the distorted colors jointly with the NeRF optimization process. Our method is able to produce novel view images with proper lighting and vivid colors and details, given a collection of camera-finished low dynamic range (8-bits/channel) images from a low-light scene. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing low-light enhancement methods and NeRF methods.

- **Summary**: As the physical size of recent CMOS image sensors (CIS) gets smaller, the latest mobile cameras are adopting unique non-Bayer color filter array (CFA) patterns (e.g., Quad, Nona, QxQ), which consist of homogeneous color units with adjacent pixels. These non-Bayer sensors are superior to conventional Bayer CFA thanks to their changeable pixel-bin sizes for different light conditions but may introduce visual artifacts during demosaicing due to their inherent pixel pattern structures and sensor hardware characteristics. Previous demosaicing methods have primarily focused on Bayer CFA, necessitating distinct reconstruction methods for non-Bayer patterned CIS with various CFA modes under different lighting conditions. In this work, we propose an efficient unified demosaicing method that can be applied to both conventional Bayer RAW and various non-Bayer CFAs' RAW data in different operation modes. Our Knowledge Learning-based demosaicing model for Adaptive Patterns, namely KLAP, utilizes CFA-adaptive filters for only 1% key filters in the network for each CFA, but still manages to effectively demosaic all the CFAs, yielding comparable performance to the large-scale models. Furthermore, by employing meta-learning during inference (KLAP-M), our model is able to eliminate unknown sensor-generic artifacts in real RAW data, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic images and real sensor RAW. Our KLAP and KLAP-M methods achieved state-of-the-art demosaicing performance in both synthetic and real RAW data of Bayer and non-Bayer CFAs.

- **Summary**: We wish to define the limits of a classical classification model based on deep learning when applied to abstract images, which do not represent visually identifiable objects.QR codes (Quick Response codes) fall into this category of abstract images: one bit corresponding to one encoded character, QR codes were not designed to be decoded manually. To understand the limitations of a deep learning-based model for abstract image classification, we train an image classification model on QR codes generated from information obtained when reading a health pass. We compare a classification model with a classical (deterministic) decoding method in the presence of noise. This study allows us to conclude that a model based on deep learning can be relevant for the understanding of abstract images.

- **Summary**: Camouflaged object detection (COD), aiming to segment camouflaged objects which exhibit similar patterns with the background, is a challenging task. Most existing works are dedicated to establishing specialized modules to identify camouflaged objects with complete and fine details, while the boundary can not be well located for the lack of object-related semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel ``pre-train, adapt and detect" paradigm to detect camouflaged objects. By introducing a large pre-trained model, abundant knowledge learned from massive multi-modal data can be directly transferred to COD. A lightweight parallel adapter is inserted to adjust the features suitable for the downstream COD task. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art COD models by large margins. Moreover, we design a multi-task learning scheme for tuning the adapter to exploit the shareable knowledge across different semantic classes. Comprehensive experimental results showed that the generalization ability of our model can be substantially improved with multi-task adapter initialization on source tasks and multi-task adaptation on target tasks.

- **Summary**: Recently, denoising methods based on supervised learning have exhibited promising performance. However, their reliance on external datasets containing noisy-clean image pairs restricts their applicability. To address this limitation, researchers have focused on training denoising networks using solely a set of noisy inputs. To improve the feasibility of denoising procedures, in this study, we proposed a single-image self-supervised learning method in which only the noisy input image is used for network training. Gated convolution was used for feature extraction and no-reference image quality assessment was used for guiding the training process. Moreover, the proposed method sampled instances from the input image dataset using Bernoulli sampling with a certain dropout rate for training. The corresponding result was produced by averaging the generated predictions from various instances of the trained network with dropouts. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art denoising performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. This highlights the effectiveness and practicality of our method as a potential solution for various noise removal tasks.

- **Summary**: Improving the feature representation ability is the foundation of many whole slide pathological image (WSIs) tasks. Recent works have achieved great success in pathological-specific self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most of them only focus on learning patch-level representations, thus there is still a gap between pretext and slide-level downstream tasks, e.g., subtyping, grading and staging. Aiming towards slide-level representations, we propose Slide-Level Prototypical Distillation (SLPD) to explore intra- and inter-slide semantic structures for context modeling on WSIs. Specifically, we iteratively perform intra-slide clustering for the regions (4096x4096 patches) within each WSI to yield the prototypes and encourage the region representations to be closer to the assigned prototypes. By representing each slide with its prototypes, we further select similar slides by the set distance of prototypes and assign the regions by cross-slide prototypes for distillation. SLPD achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple slide-level benchmarks and demonstrates that representation learning of semantic structures of slides can make a suitable proxy task for WSI analysis. Code will be available at https://github.com/Carboxy/SLPD.

- **Summary**: The widespread use of mobile devices for various digital services has created a need for reliable and real-time person authentication. In this context, facial recognition technologies have emerged as a dependable method for verifying users due to the prevalence of cameras in mobile devices and their integration into everyday applications. The rapid advancement of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has led to numerous face verification architectures. However, these models are often large and impractical for mobile applications, reaching sizes of hundreds of megabytes with millions of parameters. We address this issue by developing SqueezerFaceNet, a light face recognition network which less than 1M parameters. This is achieved by applying a network pruning method based on Taylor scores, where filters with small importance scores are removed iteratively. Starting from an already small network (of 1.24M) based on SqueezeNet, we show that it can be further reduced (up to 40%) without an appreciable loss in performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate network pruning methods for the task of face recognition.

- **Summary**: Retinal image matching plays a crucial role in monitoring disease progression and treatment response. However, datasets with matched keypoints between temporally separated pairs of images are not available in abundance to train transformer-based model. We propose a novel approach based on reverse knowledge distillation to train large models with limited data while preventing overfitting. Firstly, we propose architectural modifications to a CNN-based semi-supervised method called SuperRetina that help us improve its results on a publicly available dataset. Then, we train a computationally heavier model based on a vision transformer encoder using the lighter CNN-based model, which is counter-intuitive in the field knowledge-distillation research where training lighter models based on heavier ones is the norm. Surprisingly, such reverse knowledge distillation improves generalization even further. Our experiments suggest that high-dimensional fitting in representation space may prevent overfitting unlike training directly to match the final output. We also provide a public dataset with annotations for retinal image keypoint detection and matching to help the research community develop algorithms for retinal image applications.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a common task in autonomous driving to understand the surrounding environment. Driveable Area Segmentation and Lane Detection are particularly important for safe and efficient navigation on the road. However, original semantic segmentation models are computationally expensive and require high-end hardware, which is not feasible for embedded systems in autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a lightweight model for the driveable area and lane line segmentation. TwinLiteNet is designed cheaply but achieves accurate and efficient segmentation results. We evaluate TwinLiteNet on the BDD100K dataset and compare it with modern models. Experimental results show that our TwinLiteNet performs similarly to existing approaches, requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Specifically, TwinLiteNet achieves a mIoU score of 91.3% for the Drivable Area task and 31.08% IoU for the Lane Detection task with only 0.4 million parameters and achieves 415 FPS on GPU RTX A5000. Furthermore, TwinLiteNet can run in real-time on embedded devices with limited computing power, especially since it achieves 60FPS on Jetson Xavier NX, making it an ideal solution for self-driving vehicles.

- **Summary**: Existing customization methods require access to multiple reference examples to align pre-trained diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) with user-provided concepts. This paper aims to address the challenge of DPM customization when the only available supervision is a differentiable metric defined on the generated contents. Since the sampling procedure of DPMs involves recursive calls to the denoising UNet, na\"ive gradient backpropagation requires storing the intermediate states of all iterations, resulting in extremely high memory consumption. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel method AdjointDPM, which first generates new samples from diffusion models by solving the corresponding probability-flow ODEs. It then uses the adjoint sensitivity method to backpropagate the gradients of the loss to the models' parameters (including conditioning signals, network weights, and initial noises) by solving another augmented ODE. To reduce numerical errors in both the forward generation and gradient backpropagation processes, we further reparameterize the probability-flow ODE and augmented ODE as simple non-stiff ODEs using exponential integration. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AdjointDPM on three interesting tasks: converting visual effects into identification text embeddings, finetuning DPMs for specific types of stylization, and optimizing initial noise to generate adversarial samples for security auditing.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SS-MDE) has the potential to scale to vast quantities of data. Unfortunately, existing approaches limit themselves to the automotive domain, resulting in models incapable of generalizing to complex environments such as natural or indoor settings.   To address this, we propose a large-scale SlowTV dataset curated from YouTube, containing an order of magnitude more data than existing automotive datasets. SlowTV contains 1.7M images from a rich diversity of environments, such as worldwide seasonal hiking, scenic driving and scuba diving. Using this dataset, we train an SS-MDE model that provides zero-shot generalization to a large collection of indoor/outdoor datasets. The resulting model outperforms all existing SSL approaches and closes the gap on supervised SoTA, despite using a more efficient architecture.   We additionally introduce a collection of best-practices to further maximize performance and zero-shot generalization. This includes 1) aspect ratio augmentation, 2) camera intrinsic estimation, 3) support frame randomization and 4) flexible motion estimation.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained classification is challenging due to the difficulty of finding discriminatory features. This problem is exacerbated when applied to identifying species within the same taxonomical class. This is because species are often sharing morphological characteristics that make them difficult to differentiate. We consider the taxonomical class of Insecta. The identification of insects is essential in biodiversity monitoring as they are one of the inhabitants at the base of many ecosystems. Citizen science is doing brilliant work of collecting images of insects in the wild giving the possibility to experts to create improved distribution maps in all countries. We have billions of images that need to be automatically classified and deep neural network algorithms are one of the main techniques explored for fine-grained tasks. At the SOTA, the field of deep learning algorithms is extremely fruitful, so how to identify the algorithm to use? We focus on Odonata and Coleoptera orders, and we propose an initial comparative study to analyse the two best-known layer structures for computer vision: transformer and convolutional layers. We compare the performance of T2TViT, a fully transformer-base, EfficientNet, a fully convolutional-base, and ViTAE, a hybrid. We analyse the performance of the three models in identical conditions evaluating the performance per species, per morph together with sex, the inference time, and the overall performance with unbalanced datasets of images from smartphones. Although we observe high performances with all three families of models, our analysis shows that the hybrid model outperforms the fully convolutional-base and fully transformer-base models on accuracy performance and the fully transformer-base model outperforms the others on inference speed and, these prove the transformer to be robust to the shortage of samples and to be faster at inference time.

- **Summary**: Active learning algorithms have become increasingly popular for training models with limited data. However, selecting data for annotation remains a challenging problem due to the limited information available on unseen data. To address this issue, we propose EdgeAL, which utilizes the edge information of unseen images as {\it a priori} information for measuring uncertainty. The uncertainty is quantified by analyzing the divergence and entropy in model predictions across edges. This measure is then used to select superpixels for annotation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EdgeAL on multi-class Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) segmentation tasks, where we achieved a 99% dice score while reducing the annotation label cost to 12%, 2.3%, and 3%, respectively, on three publicly available datasets (Duke, AROI, and UMN).

- **Summary**: One-class classification (OCC) aims to train a classifier only with the target class data and attracts great attention for its strong applicability in real-world application. Despite a lot of advances have been made in OCC, it still lacks the effective OCC loss functions for deep learning. In this paper, a novel logarithmic barrier function based OCC loss (LBL) that assigns large gradients to the margin samples and thus derives more compact hypersphere, is first proposed by approximating the OCC objective smoothly. But the optimization of LBL may be instability especially when samples lie on the boundary leading to the infinity loss. To address this issue, then, a unilateral relaxation Sigmoid function is introduced into LBL and a novel OCC loss named LBLSig is proposed. The LBLSig can be seen as the fusion of the mean square error (MSE) and the cross entropy (CE) and the optimization of LBLSig is smoother owing to the unilateral relaxation Sigmoid function. The effectiveness of the proposed LBL and LBLSig is experimentally demonstrated in comparisons with several state-of-the-art OCC algorithms on different network structures.

- **Summary**: Existing action recognition methods are typically actor-specific due to the intrinsic topological and apparent differences among the actors. This requires actor-specific pose estimation (e.g., humans vs. animals), leading to cumbersome model design complexity and high maintenance costs. Moreover, they often focus on learning the visual modality alone and single-label classification whilst neglecting other available information sources (e.g., class name text) and the concurrent occurrence of multiple actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach called 'actor-agnostic multi-modal multi-label action recognition,' which offers a unified solution for various types of actors, including humans and animals. We further formulate a novel Multi-modal Semantic Query Network (MSQNet) model in a transformer-based object detection framework (e.g., DETR), characterized by leveraging visual and textual modalities to represent the action classes better. The elimination of actor-specific model designs is a key advantage, as it removes the need for actor pose estimation altogether. Extensive experiments on five publicly available benchmarks show that our MSQNet consistently outperforms the prior arts of actor-specific alternatives on human and animal single- and multi-label action recognition tasks by up to 50%. Code will be released at https://github.com/mondalanindya/MSQNet.

- **Summary**: Working memory (WM), a fundamental cognitive process facilitating the temporary storage, integration, manipulation, and retrieval of information, plays a vital role in reasoning and decision-making tasks. Robust benchmark datasets that capture the multifaceted nature of WM are crucial for the effective development and evaluation of AI WM models. Here, we introduce a comprehensive Working Memory (WorM) benchmark dataset for this purpose. WorM comprises 10 tasks and a total of 1 million trials, assessing 4 functionalities, 3 domains, and 11 behavioral and neural characteristics of WM. We jointly trained and tested state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks and transformers on all these tasks. We also include human behavioral benchmarks as an upper bound for comparison. Our results suggest that AI models replicate some characteristics of WM in the brain, most notably primacy and recency effects, and neural clusters and correlates specialized for different domains and functionalities of WM. In the experiments, we also reveal some limitations in existing models to approximate human behavior. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for communities in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and AI, offering a standardized framework to compare and enhance WM models, investigate WM's neural underpinnings, and develop WM models with human-like capabilities.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have achieved great success in the past few years. However, most current methods still require intensive resources due to ray marching-based rendering. To construct urban-level radiance fields efficiently, we design Deformable Neural Mesh Primitive~(DNMP), and propose to parameterize the entire scene with such primitives. The DNMP is a flexible and compact neural variant of classic mesh representation, which enjoys both the efficiency of rasterization-based rendering and the powerful neural representation capability for photo-realistic image synthesis. Specifically, a DNMP consists of a set of connected deformable mesh vertices with paired vertex features to parameterize the geometry and radiance information of a local area. To constrain the degree of freedom for optimization and lower the storage budgets, we enforce the shape of each primitive to be decoded from a relatively low-dimensional latent space. The rendering colors are decoded from the vertex features (interpolated with rasterization) by a view-dependent MLP. The DNMP provides a new paradigm for urban-level scene representation with appealing properties: $(1)$ High-quality rendering. Our method achieves leading performance for novel view synthesis in urban scenarios. $(2)$ Low computational costs. Our representation enables fast rendering (2.07ms/1k pixels) and low peak memory usage (110MB/1k pixels). We also present a lightweight version that can run 33$\times$ faster than vanilla NeRFs, and comparable to the highly-optimized Instant-NGP (0.61 vs 0.71ms/1k pixels).

- **Summary**: Vision transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of computer vision tasks over the last years. However, their high computational costs remain a significant barrier to their practical deployment. In particular, the complexity of transformer models is quadratic with respect to the number of input tokens. Therefore techniques that reduce the number of input tokens that need to be processed have been proposed. This paper introduces Learned Thresholds token Merging and Pruning (LTMP), a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both token merging and token pruning. LTMP uses learned threshold masking modules that dynamically determine which tokens to merge and which to prune. We demonstrate our approach with extensive experiments on vision transformers on the ImageNet classification task. Our results demonstrate that LTMP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across reduction rates while requiring only a single fine-tuning epoch, which is an order of magnitude faster than previous methods.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot point cloud segmentation aims to make deep models capable of recognizing novel objects in point cloud that are unseen in the training phase. Recent trends favor the pipeline which transfers knowledge from seen classes with labels to unseen classes without labels. They typically align visual features with semantic features obtained from word embedding by the supervision of seen classes' annotations. However, point cloud contains limited information to fully match with semantic features. In fact, the rich appearance information of images is a natural complement to the textureless point cloud, which is not well explored in previous literature. Motivated by this, we propose a novel multi-modal zero-shot learning method to better utilize the complementary information of point clouds and images for more accurate visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments are performed in two popular benchmarks, i.e., SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and our method outperforms current SOTA methods with 52% and 49% improvement on average for unseen class mIoU, respectively.

- **Summary**: The 4D Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is a promising technology for vehicle sensing due to its cost-effectiveness and operability in adverse weather conditions. However, the adoption of this technology has been hindered by sparsity and noise issues in radar point cloud data. This paper introduces spatial multi-representation fusion (SMURF), a novel approach to 3D object detection using a single 4D imaging radar. SMURF leverages multiple representations of radar detection points, including pillarization and density features of a multi-dimensional Gaussian mixture distribution through kernel density estimation (KDE). KDE effectively mitigates measurement inaccuracy caused by limited angular resolution and multi-path propagation of radar signals. Additionally, KDE helps alleviate point cloud sparsity by capturing density features. Experimental evaluations on View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of SMURF, outperforming recently proposed 4D imaging radar-based single-representation models. Moreover, while using 4D imaging radar only, SMURF still achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art 4D imaging radar and camera fusion-based method, with an increase of 1.22% in the mean average precision on bird's-eye view of TJ4DRadSet dataset and 1.32% in the 3D mean average precision on the entire annotated area of VoD dataset. Our proposed method demonstrates impressive inference time and addresses the challenges of real-time detection, with the inference time no more than 0.05 seconds for most scans on both datasets. This research highlights the benefits of 4D mmWave radar and is a strong benchmark for subsequent works regarding 3D object detection with 4D imaging radar.

- **Summary**: Source-free domain adaptation has become popular because of its practical usefulness and no need to access source data. However, the adaptation process still takes a considerable amount of time and is predominantly based on optimization that relies on back-propagation. In this work we present a simple feed-forward approach that challenges the need for back-propagation based adaptation. Our approach is based on computing prototypes of classes under the domain shift using a pre-trained model. It achieves strong improvements in accuracy compared to the pre-trained model and requires only a small fraction of time of existing domain adaptation methods.

- **Summary**: To be successful, Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents must be able to ground instructions to actions based on their surroundings. In this work, we develop a methodology to study agent behavior on a skill-specific basis -- examining how well existing agents ground instructions about stopping, turning, and moving towards specified objects or rooms. Our approach is based on generating skill-specific interventions and measuring changes in agent predictions. We present a detailed case study analyzing the behavior of a recent agent and then compare multiple agents in terms of skill-specific competency scores. This analysis suggests that biases from training have lasting effects on agent behavior and that existing models are able to ground simple referring expressions. Our comparisons between models show that skill-specific scores correlate with improvements in overall VLN task performance.

- **Summary**: Few-shot anomaly detection (AD) is an emerging sub-field of general AD, and tries to distinguish between normal and anomalous data using only few selected samples. While newly proposed few-shot AD methods do compare against pre-existing algorithms developed for the full-shot domain as baselines, they do not dedicatedly optimize them for the few-shot setting. It thus remains unclear if the performance of such pre-existing algorithms can be further improved. We address said question in this work. Specifically, we present a study on the AD/anomaly segmentation (AS) performance of PatchCore, the current state-of-the-art full-shot AD/AS algorithm, in both the few-shot and the many-shot settings. We hypothesize that further performance improvements can be realized by (I) optimizing its various hyperparameters, and by (II) transferring techniques known to improve few-shot supervised learning to the AD domain. Exhaustive experiments on the public VisA and MVTec AD datasets reveal that (I) significant performance improvements can be realized by optimizing hyperparameters such as the underlying feature extractor, and that (II) image-level augmentations can, but are not guaranteed, to improve performance. Based on these findings, we achieve a new state of the art in few-shot AD on VisA, further demonstrating the merit of adapting pre-existing AD/AS methods to the few-shot setting. Last, we identify the investigation of feature extractors with a strong inductive bias as a potential future research direction for (few-shot) AD/AS.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present our method for neural face reenactment, called HyperReenact, that aims to generate realistic talking head images of a source identity, driven by a target facial pose. Existing state-of-the-art face reenactment methods train controllable generative models that learn to synthesize realistic facial images, yet producing reenacted faces that are prone to significant visual artifacts, especially under the challenging condition of extreme head pose changes, or requiring expensive few-shot fine-tuning to better preserve the source identity characteristics. We propose to address these limitations by leveraging the photorealistic generation ability and the disentangled properties of a pretrained StyleGAN2 generator, by first inverting the real images into its latent space and then using a hypernetwork to perform: (i) refinement of the source identity characteristics and (ii) facial pose re-targeting, eliminating this way the dependence on external editing methods that typically produce artifacts. Our method operates under the one-shot setting (i.e., using a single source frame) and allows for cross-subject reenactment, without requiring any subject-specific fine-tuning. We compare our method both quantitatively and qualitatively against several state-of-the-art techniques on the standard benchmarks of VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2, demonstrating the superiority of our approach in producing artifact-free images, exhibiting remarkable robustness even under extreme head pose changes. We make the code and the pretrained models publicly available at: https://github.com/StelaBou/HyperReenact .

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. Despite years of development in this field, it still remains challenging to design a unified network for processing various modalities ($\textit{e.g.}$ natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, audio, video, time series, tabular data) due to the inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose a framework, named Meta-Transformer, that leverages a $\textbf{frozen}$ encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data. In Meta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into a shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to extract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main components: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific heads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on different benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks including fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical application (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph, tabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for developing unified multimodal intelligence with transformers. Code will be available at https://github.com/invictus717/MetaTransformer

- **Summary**: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) play an increasingly important role in the application fields of medical, education, advertising, tourism, etc. Assessing the quality of ODVs is significant for service-providers to improve the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). However, most existing quality assessment studies for ODVs only focus on the visual distortions of videos, while ignoring that the overall QoE also depends on the accompanying audio signals. In this paper, we first establish a large-scale audio-visual quality assessment dataset for omnidirectional videos, which includes 375 distorted omnidirectional audio-visual (A/V) sequences generated from 15 high-quality pristine omnidirectional A/V contents, and the corresponding perceptual audio-visual quality scores. Then, we design three baseline methods for full-reference omnidirectional audio-visual quality assessment (OAVQA), which combine existing state-of-the-art single-mode audio and video QA models via multimodal fusion strategies. We validate the effectiveness of the A/V multimodal fusion method for OAVQA on our dataset, which provides a new benchmark for omnidirectional QoE evaluation. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/iamazxl/OAVQA.

- **Summary**: To better care for the elderly and disabled, it is essential for service robots to have an effective fusion method of object detection and grasp estimation. However, limited research has been observed on the combination of object detection and grasp estimation. To overcome this technical difficulty, a novel integrated method of detection-grasping for specific object based on the box coordinate matching is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the SOLOv2 instance segmentation model is improved by adding channel attention module (CAM) and spatial attention module (SAM). Then, the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and CAM are added to the generative residual convolutional neural network (GR-CNN) model to optimize grasp estimation. Furthermore, a detection-grasping integrated algorithm based on box coordinate matching (DG-BCM) is proposed to obtain the fusion model of object detection and grasp estimation. For verification, experiments on object detection and grasp estimation are conducted separately to verify the superiority of improved models. Additionally, grasping tasks for several specific objects are implemented on a simulation platform, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of DG-BCM algorithm proposed in this paper.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated an astonishing capacity to generate high-quality images. However, researchers mainly studied the way of synthesizing images with only text prompts. While some works have explored using other modalities as conditions, considerable paired data, e.g., box/mask-image pairs, and fine-tuning time are required for nurturing models. As such paired data is time-consuming and labor-intensive to acquire and restricted to a closed set, this potentially becomes the bottleneck for applications in an open world. This paper focuses on the simplest form of user-provided conditions, e.g., box or scribble. To mitigate the aforementioned problem, we propose a training-free method to control objects and contexts in the synthesized images adhering to the given spatial conditions. Specifically, three spatial constraints, i.e., Inner-Box, Outer-Box, and Corner Constraints, are designed and seamlessly integrated into the denoising step of diffusion models, requiring no additional training and massive annotated layout data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed constraints can control what and where to present in the images while retaining the ability of Diffusion models to synthesize with high fidelity and diverse concept coverage.

- **Summary**: Incremental semantic segmentation aims to continually learn the segmentation of new coming classes without accessing the training data of previously learned classes. However, most current methods fail to address catastrophic forgetting and background shift since they 1) treat all previous classes equally without considering different forgetting paces caused by imbalanced gradient back-propagation; 2) lack strong semantic guidance between classes. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a Gradient-Semantic Compensation (GSC) model, which surmounts incremental semantic segmentation from both gradient and semantic perspectives. Specifically, to address catastrophic forgetting from the gradient aspect, we develop a step-aware gradient compensation that can balance forgetting paces of previously seen classes via re-weighting gradient backpropagation. Meanwhile, we propose a soft-sharp semantic relation distillation to distill consistent inter-class semantic relations via soft labels for alleviating catastrophic forgetting from the semantic aspect. In addition, we develop a prototypical pseudo re-labeling that provides strong semantic guidance to mitigate background shift. It produces high-quality pseudo labels for old classes in the background by measuring distances between pixels and class-wise prototypes. Extensive experiments on three public datasets, i.e., Pascal VOC 2012, ADE20K, and Cityscapes, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GSC model.

- **Summary**: Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and early screening is critical for improving survival outcomes. In clinical practice, the contextual structure of nodules and the accumulated experience of radiologists are the two core elements related to the accuracy of identification of benign and malignant nodules. Contextual information provides comprehensive information about nodules such as location, shape, and peripheral vessels, and experienced radiologists can search for clues from previous cases as a reference to enrich the basis of decision-making. In this paper, we propose a radiologist-inspired method to simulate the diagnostic process of radiologists, which is composed of context parsing and prototype recalling modules. The context parsing module first segments the context structure of nodules and then aggregates contextual information for a more comprehensive understanding of the nodule. The prototype recalling module utilizes prototype-based learning to condense previously learned cases as prototypes for comparative analysis, which is updated online in a momentum way during training. Building on the two modules, our method leverages both the intrinsic characteristics of the nodules and the external knowledge accumulated from other nodules to achieve a sound diagnosis. To meet the needs of both low-dose and noncontrast screening, we collect a large-scale dataset of 12,852 and 4,029 nodules from low-dose and noncontrast CTs respectively, each with pathology- or follow-up-confirmed labels. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method achieves advanced screening performance on both low-dose and noncontrast scenarios.

- **Summary**: Performance of a pre-trained semantic segmentation model is likely to substantially decrease on data from a new domain. We show a pre-trained model can be adapted to unlabelled target domain data by calculating soft-label prototypes under the domain shift and making predictions according to the prototype closest to the vector with predicted class probabilities. The proposed adaptation procedure is fast, comes almost for free in terms of computational resources and leads to considerable performance improvements. We demonstrate the benefits of such label calibration on the highly-practical synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation problem.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a deep learning architecture for nowcasting of precipitation almost globally every 30 min with a 4-hour lead time. The architecture fuses a U-Net and a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and is trained using data from the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and a few key precipitation drivers from the Global Forecast System (GFS). The impacts of different training loss functions, including the mean-squared error (regression) and the focal-loss (classification), on the quality of precipitation nowcasts are studied. The results indicate that the regression network performs well in capturing light precipitation (below 1.6 mm/hr), but the classification network can outperform the regression network for nowcasting of precipitation extremes (>8 mm/hr), in terms of the critical success index (CSI).. Using the Wasserstein distance, it is shown that the predicted precipitation by the classification network has a closer class probability distribution to the IMERG than the regression network. It is uncovered that the inclusion of the physical variables can improve precipitation nowcasting, especially at longer lead times in both networks. Taking IMERG as a relative reference, a multi-scale analysis in terms of fractions skill score (FSS), shows that the nowcasting machine remains skillful (FSS > 0.5) at the resolution of 10 km compared to 50 km for GFS. For precipitation rates greater than 4~mm/hr, only the classification network remains FSS-skillful on scales greater than 50 km within a 2-hour lead time.

- **Summary**: Continual learning algorithms which keep the parameters of new tasks close to that of previous tasks, are popular in preventing catastrophic forgetting in sequential task learning settings. However, 1) the performance for the new continual learner will be degraded without distinguishing the contributions of previously learned tasks; 2) the computational cost will be greatly increased with the number of tasks, since most existing algorithms need to regularize all previous tasks when learning new tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose a self-paced Weight Consolidation (spWC) framework to attain robust continual learning via evaluating the discriminative contributions of previous tasks. To be specific, we develop a self-paced regularization to reflect the priorities of past tasks via measuring difficulty based on key performance indicator (i.e., accuracy). When encountering a new task, all previous tasks are sorted from "difficult" to "easy" based on the priorities. Then the parameters of the new continual learner will be learned via selectively maintaining the knowledge amongst more difficult past tasks, which could well overcome catastrophic forgetting with less computational cost. We adopt an alternative convex search to iteratively update the model parameters and priority weights in the bi-convex formulation. The proposed spWC framework is plug-and-play, which is applicable to most continual learning algorithms (e.g., EWC, MAS and RCIL) in different directions (e.g., classification and segmentation). Experimental results on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively improve performance when compared with other popular continual learning algorithms.

- **Summary**: Weakly-supervised change detection (WSCD) aims to detect pixel-level changes with only image-level annotations. Owing to its label efficiency, WSCD is drawing increasing attention recently. However, current WSCD methods often encounter the challenge of change missing and fabricating, i.e., the inconsistency between image-level annotations and pixel-level predictions. Specifically, change missing refer to the situation that the WSCD model fails to predict any changed pixels, even though the image-level label indicates changed, and vice versa for change fabricating. To address this challenge, in this work, we leverage global-scale and local-scale priors in WSCD and propose two components: a Dilated Prior (DP) decoder and a Label Gated (LG) constraint. The DP decoder decodes samples with the changed image-level label, skips samples with the unchanged label, and replaces them with an all-unchanged pixel-level label. The LG constraint is derived from the correspondence between changed representations and image-level labels, penalizing the model when it mispredicts the change status. Additionally, we develop TransWCD, a simple yet powerful transformer-based model, showcasing the potential of weakly-supervised learning in change detection. By integrating the DP decoder and LG constraint into TransWCD, we form TransWCD-DL. Our proposed TransWCD and TransWCD-DL achieve significant +6.33% and +9.55% F1 score improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on the WHU-CD dataset, respectively. Some performance metrics even exceed several fully-supervised change detection (FSCD) competitors. Code will be available at https://github.com/zhenghuizhao/TransWCD.

- **Summary**: The great advancements of generative adversarial networks and face recognition models in computer vision have made it possible to swap identities on images from single sources. Although a lot of studies seems to have proposed almost satisfactory solutions, we notice previous methods still suffer from an identity-attribute entanglement that causes undesired attributes swapping because widely used identity encoders, eg, ArcFace, have some crucial attribute biases owing to their pretraining on face recognition tasks. To address this issue, we design BlendFace, a novel identity encoder for face-swapping. The key idea behind BlendFace is training face recognition models on blended images whose attributes are replaced with those of another mitigates inter-personal biases such as hairsyles. BlendFace feeds disentangled identity features into generators and guides generators properly as an identity loss function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlendFace improves the identity-attribute disentanglement in face-swapping models, maintaining a comparable quantitative performance to previous methods.

- **Summary**: Emerging large-scale text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion (SD), have exhibited overwhelming results with high fidelity. Despite the magnificent progress, current state-of-the-art models still struggle to generate images fully adhering to the input prompt. Prior work, Attend & Excite, has introduced the concept of Generative Semantic Nursing (GSN), aiming to optimize cross-attention during inference time to better incorporate the semantics. It demonstrates promising results in generating simple prompts, e.g., ``a cat and a dog''. However, its efficacy declines when dealing with more complex prompts, and it does not explicitly address the problem of improper attribute binding. To address the challenges posed by complex prompts or scenarios involving multiple entities and to achieve improved attribute binding, we propose Divide & Bind. We introduce two novel loss objectives for GSN: a novel attendance loss and a binding loss. Our approach stands out in its ability to faithfully synthesize desired objects with improved attribute alignment from complex prompts and exhibits superior performance across multiple evaluation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Captions are crucial for understanding scientific visualizations and documents. Existing captioning methods for scientific figures rely on figure-caption pairs extracted from documents for training, many of which fall short with respect to metrics like helpfulness, explainability, and visual-descriptiveness [15] leading to generated captions being misaligned with reader preferences. To enable the generation of high-quality figure captions, we introduce FigCaps-HF a new framework for figure-caption generation that can incorporate domain expert feedback in generating captions optimized for reader preferences. Our framework comprises of 1) an automatic method for evaluating quality of figure-caption pairs, 2) a novel reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) method to optimize a generative figure-to-caption model for reader preferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our simple learning framework by improving performance over standard fine-tuning across different types of models. In particular, when using BLIP as the base model, our RLHF framework achieves a mean gain of 35.7%, 16.9%, and 9% in ROUGE, BLEU, and Meteor, respectively. Finally, we release a large-scale benchmark dataset with human feedback on figure-caption pairs to enable further evaluation and development of RLHF techniques for this problem.

- **Summary**: Having efficient testing strategies is a core challenge that needs to be overcome for the release of automated driving. This necessitates clear requirements as well as suitable methods for testing. In this work, the requirements for perception modules are considered with respect to relevance. The concept of relevance currently remains insufficiently defined and specified. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to overcome this challenge by exemplary application to collision safety in the highway domain. Using this general system and use case specification, a corresponding concept for relevance is derived. Irrelevant objects are thus defined as objects which do not limit the set of safe actions available to the ego vehicle under consideration of all uncertainties. As an initial step, the use case is decomposed into functional scenarios with respect to collision relevance. For each functional scenario, possible actions of both the ego vehicle and any other dynamic object are formalized as equations. This set of possible actions is constrained by traffic rules, yielding relevance criteria. As a result, we present a conservative estimation which dynamic objects are relevant for perception and need to be considered for a complete evaluation. The estimation provides requirements which are applicable for offline testing and validation of perception components. A visualization is presented for examples from the highD dataset, showing the plausibility of the results. Finally, a possibility for a future validation of the presented relevance concept is outlined.

- **Summary**: With the growth of 3D sensing technology, deep learning system for 3D point clouds has become increasingly important, especially in applications like autonomous vehicles where safety is a primary concern. However, there are also growing concerns about the reliability of these systems when they encounter noisy point clouds, whether occurring naturally or introduced with malicious intent. This paper highlights the challenges of point cloud classification posed by various forms of noise, from simple background noise to malicious backdoor attacks that can intentionally skew model predictions. While there's an urgent need for optimized point cloud denoising, current point outlier removal approaches, an essential step for denoising, rely heavily on handcrafted strategies and are not adapted for higher-level tasks, such as classification. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative point outlier cleansing method that harnesses the power of downstream classification models. By employing gradient-based attribution analysis, we define a novel concept: point risk. Drawing inspiration from tail risk minimization in finance, we recast the outlier removal process as an optimization problem, named PointCVaR. Extensive experiments show that our proposed technique not only robustly filters diverse point cloud outliers but also consistently and significantly enhances existing robust methods for point cloud classification.

- **Summary**: Human motion generation aims to generate natural human pose sequences and shows immense potential for real-world applications. Substantial progress has been made recently in motion data collection technologies and generation methods, laying the foundation for increasing interest in human motion generation. Most research within this field focuses on generating human motions based on conditional signals, such as text, audio, and scene contexts. While significant advancements have been made in recent years, the task continues to pose challenges due to the intricate nature of human motion and its implicit relationship with conditional signals. In this survey, we present a comprehensive literature review of human motion generation, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind in this field. We begin by introducing the background of human motion and generative models, followed by an examination of representative methods for three mainstream sub-tasks: text-conditioned, audio-conditioned, and scene-conditioned human motion generation. Additionally, we provide an overview of common datasets and evaluation metrics. Lastly, we discuss open problems and outline potential future research directions. We hope that this survey could provide the community with a comprehensive glimpse of this rapidly evolving field and inspire novel ideas that address the outstanding challenges.

- **Summary**: Digital dentistry has made significant advancements in recent years, yet numerous challenges remain to be addressed. In this study, we release a new extensive dataset of tooth meshes to encourage further research. Additionally, we propose Variational FoldingNet (VF-Net), which extends FoldingNet to enable probabilistic learning of point cloud representations. A key challenge in existing latent variable models for point clouds is the lack of a 1-to-1 mapping between input points and output points. Instead, they must rely on optimizing Chamfer distances, a metric that does not have a normalized distributional counterpart, preventing its usage in probabilistic models. We demonstrate that explicit minimization of Chamfer distances can be replaced by a suitable encoder, which allows us to increase computational efficiency while simplifying the probabilistic extension. Our experimental findings present empirical evidence demonstrating the superior performance of VF-Net over existing models in terms of dental scan reconstruction and extrapolation. Additionally, our investigation highlights the robustness of VF-Net's latent representations. These results underscore the promising prospects of VF-Net as an effective and reliable method for point cloud reconstruction and analysis.

- **Summary**: Limited by expensive pixel-level labels, polyp segmentation models are plagued by data shortage and suffer from impaired generalization. In contrast, polyp bounding box annotations are much cheaper and more accessible. Thus, to reduce labeling cost, we propose to learn a weakly supervised polyp segmentation model (i.e., WeakPolyp) completely based on bounding box annotations. However, coarse bounding boxes contain too much noise. To avoid interference, we introduce the mask-to-box (M2B) transformation. By supervising the outer box mask of the prediction instead of the prediction itself, M2B greatly mitigates the mismatch between the coarse label and the precise prediction. But, M2B only provides sparse supervision, leading to non-unique predictions. Therefore, we further propose a scale consistency (SC) loss for dense supervision. By explicitly aligning predictions across the same image at different scales, the SC loss largely reduces the variation of predictions. Note that our WeakPolyp is a plug-and-play model, which can be easily ported to other appealing backbones. Besides, the proposed modules are only used during training, bringing no computation cost to inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed WeakPolyp, which surprisingly achieves a comparable performance with a fully supervised model, requiring no mask annotations at all.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in image generation, slow sampling remains a persistent issue. To accelerate the sampling process, prior studies have reformulated diffusion sampling as an ODE/SDE and introduced higher-order numerical methods. However, these methods often produce divergence artifacts, especially with a low number of sampling steps, which limits the achievable acceleration. In this paper, we investigate the potential causes of these artifacts and suggest that the small stability regions of these methods could be the principal cause. To address this issue, we propose two novel techniques. The first technique involves the incorporation of Heavy Ball (HB) momentum, a well-known technique for improving optimization, into existing diffusion numerical methods to expand their stability regions. We also prove that the resulting methods have first-order convergence. The second technique, called Generalized Heavy Ball (GHVB), constructs a new high-order method that offers a variable trade-off between accuracy and artifact suppression. Experimental results show that our techniques are highly effective in reducing artifacts and improving image quality, surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion solvers on both pixel-based and latent-based diffusion models for low-step sampling. Our research provides novel insights into the design of numerical methods for future diffusion work.

- **Summary**: Despite the rapid progress in self-supervised learning (SSL), end-to-end fine-tuning still remains the dominant fine-tuning strategy for medical imaging analysis. However, it remains unclear whether this approach is truly optimal for effectively utilizing the pre-trained knowledge, especially considering the diverse categories of SSL that capture different types of features. In this paper, we first establish strong contrastive and restorative SSL baselines that outperform SOTA methods across four diverse downstream tasks. Building upon these strong baselines, we conduct an extensive fine-tuning analysis across multiple pre-training and fine-tuning datasets, as well as various fine-tuning dataset sizes. Contrary to the conventional wisdom of fine-tuning only the last few layers of a pre-trained network, we show that fine-tuning intermediate layers is more effective, with fine-tuning the second quarter (25-50%) of the network being optimal for contrastive SSL whereas fine-tuning the third quarter (50-75%) of the network being optimal for restorative SSL. Compared to the de-facto standard of end-to-end fine-tuning, our best fine-tuning strategy, which fine-tunes a shallower network consisting of the first three quarters (0-75%) of the pre-trained network, yields improvements of as much as 5.48%. Additionally, using these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method to leverage the complementary strengths of multiple SSL models, resulting in enhancements of up to 3.57% compared to using the best model alone. Hence, our fine-tuning strategies not only enhance the performance of individual SSL models, but also enable effective utilization of the complementary strengths offered by multiple SSL models, leading to significant improvements in self-supervised medical imaging analysis.

- **Summary**: Recent contrastive language image pre-training has led to learning highly transferable and robust image representations. However, adapting these models to video domains with minimal supervision remains an open problem. We explore a simple step in that direction, using language tied self-supervised learning to adapt an image CLIP model to the video domain. A backbone modified for temporal modeling is trained under self-distillation settings with train objectives operating in an action concept space. Feature vectors of various action concepts extracted from a language encoder using relevant textual prompts construct this space. We introduce two train objectives, concept distillation and concept alignment, that retain generality of original representations while enforcing relations between actions and their attributes. Our approach improves zero-shot and linear probing performance on three action recognition benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Intrinsic decomposition is to infer the albedo and shading from the image. Since it is a heavily ill-posed problem, previous methods rely on prior assumptions from 2D images, however, the exploration of the data representation itself is limited. The point cloud is known as a rich format of scene representation, which naturally aligns the geometric information and the color information of an image. Our proposed method, Point Intrinsic Net, in short, PoInt-Net, jointly predicts the albedo, light source direction, and shading, using point cloud representation. Experiments reveal the benefits of PoInt-Net, in terms of accuracy, it outperforms 2D representation approaches on multiple metrics across datasets; in terms of efficiency, it trains on small-scale point clouds and performs stably on any-scale point clouds; in terms of robustness, it only trains on single object level dataset, and demonstrates reasonable generalization ability for unseen objects and scenes.

- **Summary**: Medical segmentation models are evaluated empirically. As such an evaluation is based on a limited set of example images, it is unavoidably noisy. Beyond a mean performance measure, reporting confidence intervals is thus crucial. However, this is rarely done in medical image segmentation. The width of the confidence interval depends on the test set size and on the spread of the performance measure (its standard-deviation across of the test set). For classification, many test images are needed to avoid wide confidence intervals. Segmentation, however, has not been studied, and it differs by the amount of information brought by a given test image. In this paper, we study the typical confidence intervals in medical image segmentation. We carry experiments on 3D image segmentation using the standard nnU-net framework, two datasets from the Medical Decathlon challenge and two performance measures: the Dice accuracy and the Hausdorff distance. We show that the parametric confidence intervals are reasonable approximations of the bootstrap estimates for varying test set sizes and spread of the performance metric. Importantly, we show that the test size needed to achieve a given precision is often much lower than for classification tasks. Typically, a 1% wide confidence interval requires about 100-200 test samples when the spread is low (standard-deviation around 3%). More difficult segmentation tasks may lead to higher spreads and require over 1000 samples.

- **Summary**: Global single-valued biomarkers of cardiac function typically used in clinical practice, such as ejection fraction, provide limited insight on the true 3D cardiac deformation process and hence, limit the understanding of both healthy and pathological cardiac mechanics. In this work, we propose the Point Cloud Deformation Network (PCD-Net) as a novel geometric deep learning approach to model 3D cardiac contraction and relaxation between the extreme ends of the cardiac cycle. It employs the recent advances in point cloud-based deep learning into an encoder-decoder structure, in order to enable efficient multi-scale feature learning directly on multi-class 3D point cloud representations of the cardiac anatomy. We evaluate our approach on a large dataset of over 10,000 cases from the UK Biobank study and find average Chamfer distances between the predicted and ground truth anatomies below the pixel resolution of the underlying image acquisition. Furthermore, we observe similar clinical metrics between predicted and ground truth populations and show that the PCD-Net can successfully capture subpopulation-specific differences between normal subjects and myocardial infarction (MI) patients. We then demonstrate that the learned 3D deformation patterns outperform multiple clinical benchmarks by 13% and 7% in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the tasks of prevalent MI detection and incident MI prediction and by 7% in terms of Harrell's concordance index for MI survival analysis.

- **Summary**: Modern approaches for vision-centric environment perception for autonomous navigation make extensive use of self-supervised monocular depth estimation algorithms that output disparity maps. However, when this disparity map is projected onto 3D space, the errors in disparity are magnified, resulting in a depth estimation error that increases quadratically as the distance from the camera increases. Though Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) can solve this issue, it is expensive and not feasible for many applications. To address the challenge of accurate ranging with low-cost sensors, we propose, OCTraN, a transformer architecture that uses iterative-attention to convert 2D image features into 3D occupancy features and makes use of convolution and transpose convolution to efficiently operate on spatial information. We also develop a self-supervised training pipeline to generalize the model to any scene by eliminating the need for LiDAR ground truth by substituting it with pseudo-ground truth labels obtained from boosted monocular depth estimation.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of various computer vision applications. However, discovering novel categories in an incremental learning scenario remains a challenging problem due to the lack of prior knowledge about the number and nature of new categories. Existing methods for novel category discovery are limited by their reliance on labeled datasets and prior knowledge about the number of novel categories and the proportion of novel samples in the batch. To address the limitations and more accurately reflect real-world scenarios, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised class incremental learning approach for discovering novel categories on unlabeled sets without prior knowledge. The proposed method fine-tunes the feature extractor and proxy anchors on labeled sets, then splits samples into old and novel categories and clusters on the unlabeled dataset. Furthermore, the proxy anchors-based exemplar generates representative category vectors to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained datasets under real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving requires accurate local scene understanding information. To this end, autonomous agents deploy object detection and online BEV lane graph extraction methods as a part of their perception stack. In this work, we propose an architecture and loss formulation to improve the accuracy of local lane graph estimates by using 3D object detection outputs. The proposed method learns to assign the objects to centerlines by considering the centerlines as cluster centers and the objects as data points to be assigned a probability distribution over the cluster centers. This training scheme ensures direct supervision on the relationship between lanes and objects, thus leading to better performance. The proposed method improves lane graph estimation substantially over state-of-the-art methods. The extensive ablations show that our method can achieve significant performance improvements by using the outputs of existing 3D object detection methods. Since our method uses the detection outputs rather than detection method intermediate representations, a single model of our method can use any detection method at test time.

- **Summary**: Current object detection models have achieved good results on many benchmark datasets, detecting objects in dark conditions remains a large challenge. To address this issue, we propose a pyramid enhanced network (PENet) and joint it with YOLOv3 to build a dark object detection framework named PE-YOLO. Firstly, PENet decomposes the image into four components of different resolutions using the Laplacian pyramid. Specifically we propose a detail processing module (DPM) to enhance the detail of images, which consists of context branch and edge branch. In addition, we propose a low-frequency enhancement filter (LEF) to capture low-frequency semantics and prevent high-frequency noise. PE-YOLO adopts an end-to-end joint training approach and only uses normal detection loss to simplify the training process. We conduct experiments on the low-light object detection dataset ExDark to demonstrate the effectiveness of ours. The results indicate that compared with other dark detectors and low-light enhancement models, PE-YOLO achieves the advanced results, achieving 78.0% in mAP and 53.6 in FPS, respectively, which can adapt to object detection under different low-light conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/XiangchenYin/PE-YOLO.

- **Summary**: In CMF surgery, the planning of bony movement to achieve a desired facial outcome is a challenging task. Current bone driven approaches focus on normalizing the bone with the expectation that the facial appearance will be corrected accordingly. However, due to the complex non-linear relationship between bony structure and facial soft-tissue, such bone-driven methods are insufficient to correct facial deformities. Despite efforts to simulate facial changes resulting from bony movement, surgical planning still relies on iterative revisions and educated guesses. To address these issues, we propose a soft-tissue driven framework that can automatically create and verify surgical plans. Our framework consists of a bony planner network that estimates the bony movements required to achieve the desired facial outcome and a facial simulator network that can simulate the possible facial changes resulting from the estimated bony movement plans. By combining these two models, we can verify and determine the final bony movement required for planning. The proposed framework was evaluated using a clinical dataset, and our experimental results demonstrate that the soft-tissue driven approach greatly improves the accuracy and efficacy of surgical planning when compared to the conventional bone-driven approach.

- **Summary**: Endoscopic surgery is currently an important treatment method in the field of spinal surgery and avoiding damage to the spinal nerves through video guidance is a key challenge. This paper presents the first real-time segmentation method for spinal nerves in endoscopic surgery, which provides crucial navigational information for surgeons. A finely annotated segmentation dataset of approximately 10,000 consec-utive frames recorded during surgery is constructed for the first time for this field, addressing the problem of semantic segmentation. Based on this dataset, we propose FUnet (Frame-Unet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance by utilizing inter-frame information and self-attention mechanisms. We also conduct extended exper-iments on a similar polyp endoscopy video dataset and show that the model has good generalization ability with advantageous performance.

- **Summary**: U-Net, known for its simple yet efficient architecture, is widely utilized for image processing tasks and is particularly suitable for deployment on neuromorphic chips. This paper introduces the novel concept of Spiking-UNet for image processing, which combines the power of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with the U-Net architecture. To achieve an efficient Spiking-UNet, we face two primary challenges: ensuring high-fidelity information propagation through the network via spikes and formulating an effective training strategy. To address the issue of information loss, we introduce multi-threshold spiking neurons, which improve the efficiency of information transmission within the Spiking-UNet. For the training strategy, we adopt a conversion and fine-tuning pipeline that leverage pre-trained U-Net models. During the conversion process, significant variability in data distribution across different parts is observed when utilizing skip connections. Therefore, we propose a connection-wise normalization method to prevent inaccurate firing rates. Furthermore, we adopt a flow-based training method to fine-tune the converted models, reducing time steps while preserving performance. Experimental results show that, on image segmentation and denoising, our Spiking-UNet achieves comparable performance to its non-spiking counterpart, surpassing existing SNN methods. Compared with the converted Spiking-UNet without fine-tuning, our Spiking-UNet reduces inference time by approximately 90\%. This research broadens the application scope of SNNs in image processing and is expected to inspire further exploration in the field of neuromorphic engineering. The code for our Spiking-UNet implementation is available at https://github.com/SNNresearch/Spiking-UNet.

- **Summary**: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has stimulated a wide range of medical image-based diagnosis and treatment in fields such as cardiology and ophthalmology. Such applications can be further facilitated by deep learning-based super-resolution technology, which improves the capability of resolving morphological structures. However, existing deep learning-based method only focuses on spatial distribution and disregard frequency fidelity in image reconstruction, leading to a frequency bias. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frequency-aware super-resolution framework that integrates three critical frequency-based modules (i.e., frequency transformation, frequency skip connection, and frequency alignment) and frequency-based loss function into a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We conducted a large-scale quantitative study from an existing coronary OCT dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over existing deep learning frameworks. In addition, we confirmed the generalizability of our framework by applying it to fish corneal images and rat retinal images, demonstrating its capability to super-resolve morphological details in eye imaging.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing accurate 3D scenes from images is a long-standing vision task. Due to the ill-posedness of the single-image reconstruction problem, most well-established methods are built upon multi-view geometry. State-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular metric depth estimation methods can only handle a single camera model and are unable to perform mixed-data training due to the metric ambiguity. Meanwhile, SOTA monocular methods trained on large mixed datasets achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. In this work, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view metric depth model lies in the combination of large-scale data training and resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problems and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. Equipped with our module, monocular models can be stably trained with over 8 million images with thousands of camera models, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Experiments demonstrate SOTA performance of our method on 7 zero-shot benchmarks. Notably, our method won the championship in the 2nd Monocular Depth Estimation Challenge. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology. The potential benefits extend to downstream tasks, which can be significantly improved by simply plugging in our model. For example, our model relieves the scale drift issues of monocular-SLAM (Fig. 1), leading to high-quality metric scale dense mapping. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/Metric3D.

- **Summary**: Large-scale text-to-image models pre-trained on massive text-image pairs show excellent performance in image synthesis recently. However, image can provide more intuitive visual concepts than plain text. People may ask: how can we integrate the desired visual concept into an existing image, such as our portrait? Current methods are inadequate in meeting this demand as they lack the ability to preserve content or translate visual concepts effectively. Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework named visual concept translator (VCT) with the ability to preserve content in the source image and translate the visual concepts guided by a single reference image. The proposed VCT contains a content-concept inversion (CCI) process to extract contents and concepts, and a content-concept fusion (CCF) process to gather the extracted information to obtain the target image. Given only one reference image, the proposed VCT can complete a wide range of general image-to-image translation tasks with excellent results. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/CrystalNeuro/visual-concept-translator.

- **Summary**: Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common causes of death in the world. Image-based biomarkers commonly used in the clinic, such as ejection fraction, fail to capture more complex patterns in the heart's 3D anatomy and thus limit diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we present the multi-objective point cloud autoencoder as a novel geometric deep learning approach for explainable infarction prediction, based on multi-class 3D point cloud representations of cardiac anatomy and function. Its architecture consists of multiple task-specific branches connected by a low-dimensional latent space to allow for effective multi-objective learning of both reconstruction and MI prediction, while capturing pathology-specific 3D shape information in an interpretable latent space. Furthermore, its hierarchical branch design with point cloud-based deep learning operations enables efficient multi-scale feature learning directly on high-resolution anatomy point clouds. In our experiments on a large UK Biobank dataset, the multi-objective point cloud autoencoder is able to accurately reconstruct multi-temporal 3D shapes with Chamfer distances between predicted and input anatomies below the underlying images' pixel resolution. Our method outperforms multiple machine learning and deep learning benchmarks for the task of incident MI prediction by 19% in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. In addition, its task-specific compact latent space exhibits easily separable control and MI clusters with clinically plausible associations between subject encodings and corresponding 3D shapes, thus demonstrating the explainability of the prediction.

- **Summary**: Object localization in general environments is a fundamental part of vision systems. While dominating on the COCO benchmark, recent Transformer-based detection methods are not competitive in diverse domains. Moreover, these methods still struggle to very accurately estimate the object bounding boxes in complex environments.   We introduce Cascade-DETR for high-quality universal object detection. We jointly tackle the generalization to diverse domains and localization accuracy by proposing the Cascade Attention layer, which explicitly integrates object-centric information into the detection decoder by limiting the attention to the previous box prediction. To further enhance accuracy, we also revisit the scoring of queries. Instead of relying on classification scores, we predict the expected IoU of the query, leading to substantially more well-calibrated confidences. Lastly, we introduce a universal object detection benchmark, UDB10, that contains 10 datasets from diverse domains. While also advancing the state-of-the-art on COCO, Cascade-DETR substantially improves DETR-based detectors on all datasets in UDB10, even by over 10 mAP in some cases. The improvements under stringent quality requirements are even more pronounced. Our code and models will be released at https://github.com/SysCV/cascade-detr.

- **Summary**: Existing high-resolution satellite image forgery localization methods rely on patch-based or downsampling-based training. Both of these training methods have major drawbacks, such as inaccurate boundaries between pristine and forged regions, the generation of unwanted artifacts, etc. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, inspired by the high-resolution image segmentation literature, we propose a novel model called HRFNet to enable satellite image forgery localization effectively. Specifically, equipped with shallow and deep branches, our model can successfully integrate RGB and resampling features in both global and local manners to localize forgery more accurately. We perform various experiments to demonstrate that our method achieves the best performance, while the memory requirement and processing speed are not compromised compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: In this endeavor, we developed a comprehensive system that processes integrated visual features derived from video frames captured by a regular camera, along with depth details obtained from a point cloud scanner. This system is designed to anticipate driving actions, encompassing both vehicle speed and steering angle. To ensure its reliability, we conducted assessments where we juxtaposed the projected outcomes with the established norms adhered to by skilled real-world drivers. Our evaluation outcomes indicate that the forecasts achieve a noteworthy level of accuracy in a minimum of half the test scenarios (ranging around 50-80%, contingent on the specific model). Notably, the utilization of amalgamated features yielded superior performance in comparison to using video frames in isolation, as demonstrated by most of the cases.

- **Summary**: On-screen game footage contains rich contextual information that players process when playing and experiencing a game. Learning pixel representations of games can benefit artificial intelligence across several downstream tasks including game-playing agents, procedural content generation, and player modelling. The generalizability of these methods, however, remains a challenge, as learned representations should ideally be shared across games with similar game mechanics. This could allow, for instance, game-playing agents trained on one game to perform well in similar games with no re-training. This paper explores how generalizable pre-trained computer vision encoders can be for such tasks, by decomposing the latent space into content embeddings and style embeddings. The goal is to minimize the domain gap between games of the same genre when it comes to game content critical for downstream tasks, and ignore differences in graphical style. We employ a pre-trained Vision Transformer encoder and a decomposition technique based on game genres to obtain separate content and style embeddings. Our findings show that the decomposed embeddings achieve style invariance across multiple games while still maintaining strong content extraction capabilities. We argue that the proposed decomposition of content and style offers better generalization capacities across game environments independently of the downstream task.

- **Summary**: Existing image editing tools, while powerful, typically disregard the underlying 3D geometry from which the image is projected. As a result, edits made using these tools may become detached from the geometry and lighting conditions that are at the foundation of the image formation process. In this work, we formulate the newt ask of language-guided 3D-aware editing, where objects in an image should be edited according to a language instruction in context of the underlying 3D scene. To promote progress towards this goal, we release OBJECT: a dataset consisting of 400K editing examples created from procedurally generated 3D scenes. Each example consists of an input image, editing instruction in language, and the edited image. We also introduce 3DIT : single and multi-task models for four editing tasks. Our models show impressive abilities to understand the 3D composition of entire scenes, factoring in surrounding objects, surfaces, lighting conditions, shadows, and physically-plausible object configurations. Surprisingly, training on only synthetic scenes from OBJECT, editing capabilities of 3DIT generalize to real-world images.

- **Summary**: Human mesh reconstruction from a single image is challenging in the presence of occlusion, which can be caused by self, objects, or other humans. Existing methods either fail to separate human features accurately or lack proper supervision for feature completion. In this paper, we propose Dense Inpainting Human Mesh Recovery (DIMR), a two-stage method that leverages dense correspondence maps to handle occlusion. Our method utilizes a dense correspondence map to separate visible human features and completes human features on a structured UV map dense human with an attention-based feature completion module. We also design a feature inpainting training procedure that guides the network to learn from unoccluded features. We evaluate our method on several datasets and demonstrate its superior performance under heavily occluded scenarios compared to other methods. Extensive experiments show that our method obviously outperforms prior SOTA methods on heavily occluded images and achieves comparable results on the standard benchmarks (3DPW).

- **Summary**: The paradigm of large-scale pre-training followed by downstream fine-tuning has been widely employed in various object detection algorithms. In this paper, we reveal discrepancies in data, model, and task between the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure in existing practices, which implicitly limit the detector's performance, generalization ability, and convergence speed. To this end, we propose AlignDet, a unified pre-training framework that can be adapted to various existing detectors to alleviate the discrepancies. AlignDet decouples the pre-training process into two stages, i.e., image-domain and box-domain pre-training. The image-domain pre-training optimizes the detection backbone to capture holistic visual abstraction, and box-domain pre-training learns instance-level semantics and task-aware concepts to initialize the parts out of the backbone. By incorporating the self-supervised pre-trained backbones, we can pre-train all modules for various detectors in an unsupervised paradigm. As depicted in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignDet can achieve significant improvements across diverse protocols, such as detection algorithm, model backbone, data setting, and training schedule. For example, AlignDet improves FCOS by 5.3 mAP, RetinaNet by 2.1 mAP, Faster R-CNN by 3.3 mAP, and DETR by 2.3 mAP under fewer epochs.

- **Summary**: Automated surgical step recognition is an important task that can significantly improve patient safety and decision-making during surgeries. Existing state-of-the-art methods for surgical step recognition either rely on separate, multi-stage modeling of spatial and temporal information or operate on short-range temporal resolution when learned jointly. However, the benefits of joint modeling of spatio-temporal features and long-range information are not taken in account. In this paper, we propose a vision transformer-based approach to jointly learn spatio-temporal features directly from sequence of frame-level patches. Our method incorporates a gated-temporal attention mechanism that intelligently combines short-term and long-term spatio-temporal feature representations. We extensively evaluate our approach on two cataract surgery video datasets, namely Cataract-101 and D99, and demonstrate superior performance compared to various state-of-the-art methods. These results validate the suitability of our proposed approach for automated surgical step recognition. Our code is released at: https://github.com/nisargshah1999/GLSFormer

- **Summary**: In this perspective paper, we argue that the dominant paradigm in anomaly detection cannot scale indefinitely and will eventually hit fundamental limits. This is due to the a no free lunch principle for anomaly detection. These limitations can be overcome when there are strong tasks priors, as is the case for many industrial tasks. When such priors do not exists, the task is much harder for anomaly detection. We pose two such tasks as grand challenges for anomaly detection: i) scientific discovery by anomaly detection ii) a "mini-grand" challenge of detecting the most anomalous image in the ImageNet dataset. We believe new anomaly detection tools and ideas would need to be developed to overcome these challenges.

- **Summary**: Learning accurate and parsimonious point cloud representations of scene surfaces from scratch remains a challenge in 3D representation learning. Existing point-based methods often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem or require a large number of points to accurately model scene geometry and texture. To address these limitations, we propose Proximity Attention Point Rendering (PAPR), a novel method that consists of a point-based scene representation and a differentiable renderer. Our scene representation uses a point cloud where each point is characterized by its spatial position, foreground score, and view-independent feature vector. The renderer selects the relevant points for each ray and produces accurate colours using their associated features. PAPR effectively learns point cloud positions to represent the correct scene geometry, even when the initialization drastically differs from the target geometry. Notably, our method captures fine texture details while using only a parsimonious set of points. We also demonstrate four practical applications of our method: geometry editing, object manipulation, texture transfer, and exposure control. More results and code are available on our project website at https://zvict.github.io/papr/.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) in images is a fundamental computer vision problem by deep learning neural network to identify images deviating significantly from normality. The deep features extracted from pretrained models have been proved to be essential for AD based on multivariate Gaussian distribution analysis. However, since models are usually pretrained on a large dataset for classification tasks such as ImageNet, they might produce lots of redundant features for AD, which increases computational cost and degrades the performance. We aim to do the dimension reduction of Negated Principal Component Analysis (NPCA) for these features. So we proposed some heuristic to choose hyperparameter of NPCA algorithm for getting as fewer components of features as possible while ensuring a good performance.

- **Summary**: In this study, we investigate the task of data pre-selection, which aims to select instances for labeling from an unlabeled dataset through a single pass, thereby optimizing performance for undefined downstream tasks with a limited annotation budget. Previous approaches to data pre-selection relied solely on visual features extracted from foundation models, such as CLIP and BLIP-2, but largely ignored the powerfulness of text features. In this work, we argue that, with proper design, the joint feature space of both vision and text can yield a better representation for data pre-selection. To this end, we introduce UP-DP, a simple yet effective unsupervised prompt learning approach that adapts vision-language models, like BLIP-2, for data pre-selection. Specifically, with the BLIP-2 parameters frozen, we train text prompts to extract the joint features with improved representation, ensuring a diverse cluster structure that covers the entire dataset. We extensively compare our method with the state-of-the-art using seven benchmark datasets in different settings, achieving up to a performance gain of 20%. Interestingly, the prompts learned from one dataset demonstrate significant generalizability and can be applied directly to enhance the feature extraction of BLIP-2 from other datasets. To the best of our knowledge, UP-DP is the first work to incorporate unsupervised prompt learning in a vision-language model for data pre-selection.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has shown excellent performance in analysing medical images. However, datasets are difficult to obtain due privacy issues, standardization problems, and lack of annotations. We address these problems by producing realistic synthetic images using a combination of 3D technologies and generative adversarial networks. We propose CUT-seg, a joint training where a segmentation model and a generative model are jointly trained to produce realistic images while learning to segment polyps. We take advantage of recent one-sided translation models because they use significantly less memory, allowing us to add a segmentation model in the training loop. CUT-seg performs better, is computationally less expensive, and requires less real images than other memory-intensive image translation approaches that require two stage training. Promising results are achieved on five real polyp segmentation datasets using only one real image and zero real annotations. As a part of this study we release Synth-Colon, an entirely synthetic dataset that includes 20000 realistic colon images and additional details about depth and 3D geometry: https://enric1994.github.io/synth-colon

- **Summary**: The ability to envision future states is crucial to informed decision making while interacting with dynamic environments. With cameras providing a prevalent and information rich sensing modality, the problem of predicting future states from image sequences has garnered a lot of attention. Current state of the art methods typically train large parametric models for their predictions. Though often able to predict with accuracy, these models rely on the availability of large training datasets to converge to useful solutions. In this paper we focus on the problem of predicting future images of an image sequence from very little training data. To approach this problem, we use non-parametric models to take a probabilistic approach to image prediction. We generate probability distributions over sequentially predicted images and propagate uncertainty through time to generate a confidence metric for our predictions. Gaussian Processes are used for their data efficiency and ability to readily incorporate new training data online. We showcase our method by successfully predicting future frames of a smooth fluid simulation environment.

- **Summary**: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. While colonoscopy is an effective screening technique, navigating an endoscope through the colon to detect polyps is challenging. A 3D map of the observed surfaces could enhance the identification of unscreened colon tissue and serve as a training platform. However, reconstructing the colon from video footage remains unsolved due to numerous factors such as self-occlusion, reflective surfaces, lack of texture, and tissue deformation that limit feature-based methods. Learning-based approaches hold promise as robust alternatives, but necessitate extensive datasets. By establishing a benchmark, the 2022 EndoVis sub-challenge SimCol3D aimed to facilitate data-driven depth and pose prediction during colonoscopy. The challenge was hosted as part of MICCAI 2022 in Singapore. Six teams from around the world and representatives from academia and industry participated in the three sub-challenges: synthetic depth prediction, synthetic pose prediction, and real pose prediction. This paper describes the challenge, the submitted methods, and their results. We show that depth prediction in virtual colonoscopy is robustly solvable, while pose estimation remains an open research question.

- **Summary**: Holistic 3D human-scene reconstruction is a crucial and emerging research area in robot perception. A key challenge in holistic 3D human-scene reconstruction is to generate a physically plausible 3D scene from a single monocular RGB image. The existing research mainly proposes optimization-based approaches for reconstructing the scene from a sequence of RGB frames with explicitly defined physical laws and constraints between different scene elements (humans and objects). However, it is hard to explicitly define and model every physical law in every scenario. This paper proposes using an implicit feature representation of the scene elements to distinguish a physically plausible alignment of humans and objects from an implausible one. We propose using a graph-based holistic representation with an encoded physical representation of the scene to analyze the human-object and object-object interactions within the scene. Using this graphical representation, we adversarially train our model to learn the feasible alignments of the scene elements from the training data itself without explicitly defining the laws and constraints between them. Unlike the existing inference-time optimization-based approaches, we use this adversarially trained model to produce a per-frame 3D reconstruction of the scene that abides by the physical laws and constraints. Our learning-based method achieves comparable 3D reconstruction quality to existing optimization-based holistic human-scene reconstruction methods and does not need inference time optimization. This makes it better suited when compared to existing methods, for potential use in robotic applications, such as robot navigation, etc.

- **Summary**: Vehicle light detection, association, and localization are required for important downstream safe autonomous driving tasks, such as predicting a vehicle's light state to determine if the vehicle is making a lane change or turning. Currently, many vehicle light detectors use single-stage detectors which predict bounding boxes to identify a vehicle light, in a manner decoupled from vehicle instances. In this paper, we present a method for detecting a vehicle light given an upstream vehicle detection and approximation of a visible light's center. Our method predicts four approximate corners associated with each vehicle light. We experiment with CNN architectures, data augmentation, and contextual preprocessing methods designed to reduce surrounding-vehicle confusion. We achieve an average distance error from the ground truth corner of 4.77 pixels, about 16.33% of the size of the vehicle light on average. We train and evaluate our model on the LISA Lights Dataset, allowing us to thoroughly evaluate our vehicle light corner detection model on a large variety of vehicle light shapes and lighting conditions. We propose that this model can be integrated into a pipeline with vehicle detection and vehicle light center detection to make a fully-formed vehicle light detection network, valuable to identifying trajectory-informative signals in driving scenes.

- **Summary**: Identifying traffic accidents in driving videos is crucial to ensuring the safety of autonomous driving and driver assistance systems. To address the potential danger caused by the long-tailed distribution of driving events, existing traffic accident detection (TAD) methods mainly rely on unsupervised learning. However, TAD is still challenging due to the rapid movement of cameras and dynamic scenes in driving scenarios. Existing unsupervised TAD methods mainly rely on a single pretext task, i.e., an appearance-based or future object localization task, to detect accidents. However, appearance-based approaches are easily disturbed by the rapid movement of the camera and changes in illumination, which significantly reduce the performance of traffic accident detection. Methods based on future object localization may fail to capture appearance changes in video frames, making it difficult to detect ego-involved accidents (e.g., out of control of the ego-vehicle). In this paper, we propose a novel memory-augmented multi-task collaborative framework (MAMTCF) for unsupervised traffic accident detection in driving videos. Different from previous approaches, our method can more accurately detect both ego-involved and non-ego accidents by simultaneously modeling appearance changes and object motions in video frames through the collaboration of optical flow reconstruction and future object localization tasks. Further, we introduce a memory-augmented motion representation mechanism to fully explore the interrelation between different types of motion representations and exploit the high-level features of normal traffic patterns stored in memory to augment motion representations, thus enlarging the difference from anomalies. Experimental results on recently published large-scale dataset demonstrate that our method achieves better performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition holds the promise of robustly identifying subjects based on their walking patterns instead of color information. While previous approaches have performed well for curated indoor scenes, they have significantly impeded applicability in unconstrained situations, e.g. outdoor, long distance scenes. We propose an end-to-end GAit DEtection and Recognition (GADER) algorithm for human authentication in challenging outdoor scenarios. Specifically, GADER leverages a Double Helical Signature to detect the fragment of human movement and incorporates a novel gait recognition method, which learns representations by distilling from an auxiliary RGB recognition model. At inference time, GADER only uses the silhouette modality but benefits from a more robust representation. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the State-of-The-Arts for gait recognition and verification, with a significant 20.6% improvement on unconstrained, long distance scenes.

- **Summary**: This study introduces a novel reconstruction method for dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), focusing on effectively reducing metal-induced artifacts commonly encountered in the presence of prevalent metallic implants. Despite significant progress in metal artifact reduction techniques, challenges persist owing to the intricate physical interactions between polychromatic X-ray beams and metal objects, which are further compounded by the additional effects associated with metal-tooth interactions and factors specific to the dental CBCT data environment. To overcome these limitations, we propose an implicit neural network that generates two distinct and informative tomographic images. One image represents the monochromatic attenuation distribution at a specific energy level, whereas the other captures the nonlinear beam-hardening factor resulting from the polychromatic nature of X-ray beams. In contrast to existing CT reconstruction techniques, the proposed method relies exclusively on the Beer--Lambert law, effectively preventing the generation of metal-induced artifacts during the backprojection process commonly implemented in conventional methods. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces metal artifacts while providing high-quality image reconstructions, thus emphasizing the significance of the second image in capturing the nonlinear beam-hardening factor.

- **Summary**: The UNet architecture, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has demonstrated its remarkable performance in medical image analysis. However, it faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to the limited receptive fields and inherent bias of convolutional operations. Recently, numerous transformer-based techniques have been incorporated into the UNet architecture to overcome this limitation by effectively capturing global feature correlations. However, the integration of the Transformer modules may result in the loss of local contextual information during the global feature fusion process. To overcome these challenges, we propose a 2D medical image segmentation model called Multi-scale Cross Perceptron Attention Network (MCPA). The MCPA consists of three main components: an encoder, a decoder, and a Cross Perceptron. The Cross Perceptron first captures the local correlations using multiple Multi-scale Cross Perceptron modules, facilitating the fusion of features across scales. The resulting multi-scale feature vectors are then spatially unfolded, concatenated, and fed through a Global Perceptron module to model global dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a Progressive Dual-branch Structure to address the semantic segmentation of the image involving finer tissue structures. This structure gradually shifts the segmentation focus of MCPA network training from large-scale structural features to more sophisticated pixel-level features. We evaluate our proposed MCPA model on several publicly available medical image datasets from different tasks and devices, including the open large-scale dataset of CT (Synapse), MRI (ACDC), fundus camera (DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, HRF), and OCTA (ROSE). The experimental results show that our MCPA model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/simonustc/MCPA-for-2D-Medical-Image-Segmentation.

- **Summary**: The purpose of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to continuously track and identify objects detected in videos. Currently, most methods for multi-object tracking model the motion information and combine it with appearance information to determine and track objects. In this paper, unfalsified control is employed to address the ID-switch problem in multi-object tracking. We establish sequences of appearance information variations for the trajectories during the tracking process and design a detection and rectification module specifically for ID-switch detection and recovery. We also propose a simple and effective strategy to address the issue of ambiguous matching of appearance information during the data association process. Experimental results on publicly available MOT datasets demonstrate that the tracker exhibits excellent effectiveness and robustness in handling tracking errors caused by occlusions and rapid movements.



### FakeTracer: Proactively Defending Against Face-swap DeepFakes via Implanting Traces in Training

- **Summary**: Face-swap DeepFake is an emerging AI-based face forgery technique that can replace the original face in a video with a generated face of the target identity while retaining consistent facial attributes such as expression and orientation. Due to the high privacy of faces, the misuse of this technique can raise severe social concerns, drawing tremendous attention to defend against DeepFakes recently. In this paper, we describe a new proactive defense method called FakeTracer to expose face-swap DeepFakes via implanting traces in training. Compared to general face-synthesis DeepFake, the face-swap DeepFake is more complex as it involves identity change, is subjected to the encoding-decoding process, and is trained unsupervised, increasing the difficulty of implanting traces into the training phase. To effectively defend against face-swap DeepFake, we design two types of traces, sustainable trace (STrace) and erasable trace (ETrace), to be added to training faces. During the training, these manipulated faces affect the learning of the face-swap DeepFake model, enabling it to generate faces that only contain sustainable traces. In light of these two traces, our method can effectively expose DeepFakes by identifying them. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Celeb-DF dataset, compared with recent passive and proactive defense methods, and are studied thoroughly regarding various factors, corroborating the efficacy of our method on defending against face-swap DeepFake.

- **Summary**: The presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) on pancreatic pathological images is an important prognostic indicator of pancreatic tumors. Therefore, TLSs detection on pancreatic pathological images plays a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment for patients with pancreatic tumors. However, fully supervised detection algorithms based on deep learning usually require a large number of manual annotations, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we aim to detect the TLSs in a manner of few-shot learning by proposing a weakly supervised segmentation network. We firstly obtain the lymphocyte density maps by combining a pretrained model for nuclei segmentation and a domain adversarial network for lymphocyte nuclei recognition. Then, we establish a cross-scale attention guidance mechanism by jointly learning the coarse-scale features from the original histopathology images and fine-scale features from our designed lymphocyte density attention. A noise-sensitive constraint is introduced by an embedding signed distance function loss in the training procedure to reduce tiny prediction errors. Experimental results on two collected datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation-based algorithms in terms of TLSs detection accuracy. Additionally, we apply our method to study the congruent relationship between the density of TLSs and peripancreatic vascular invasion and obtain some clinically statistical results.

- **Summary**: Point cloud analysis (such as 3D segmentation and detection) is a challenging task, because of not only the irregular geometries of many millions of unordered points, but also the great variations caused by depth, viewpoint, occlusion, etc. Current studies put much focus on the adaption of neural networks to the complex geometries of point clouds, but are blind to a fundamental question: how to learn an appropriate point embedding space that is aware of both discriminative semantics and challenging variations? As a response, we propose a clustering based supervised learning scheme for point cloud analysis. Unlike current de-facto, scene-wise training paradigm, our algorithm conducts within-class clustering on the point embedding space for automatically discovering subclass patterns which are latent yet representative across scenes. The mined patterns are, in turn, used to repaint the embedding space, so as to respect the underlying distribution of the entire training dataset and improve the robustness to the variations. Our algorithm is principled and readily pluggable to modern point cloud segmentation networks during training, without extra overhead during testing. With various 3D network architectures (i.e., voxel-based, point-based, Transformer-based, automatically searched), our algorithm shows notable improvements on famous point cloud segmentation datasets (i.e.,2.0-2.6% on single-scan and 2.0-2.2% multi-scan of SemanticKITTI, 1.8-1.9% on S3DIS, in terms of mIoU). Our algorithm also demonstrates utility in 3D detection, showing 2.0-3.4% mAP gains on KITTI.

- **Summary**: Recent label mix-based augmentation methods have shown their effectiveness in generalization despite their simplicity, and their favorable effects are often attributed to semantic-level augmentation. However, we found that they are vulnerable to highly skewed class distribution, because scarce data classes are rarely sampled for inter-class perturbation. We propose TextManiA, a text-driven manifold augmentation method that semantically enriches visual feature spaces, regardless of data distribution. TextManiA augments visual data with intra-class semantic perturbation by exploiting easy-to-understand visually mimetic words, i.e., attributes. To this end, we bridge between the text representation and a target visual feature space, and propose an efficient vector augmentation. To empirically support the validity of our design, we devise two visualization-based analyses and show the plausibility of the bridge between two different modality spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that TextManiA is powerful in scarce samples with class imbalance as well as even distribution. We also show compatibility with the label mix-based approaches in evenly distributed scarce data.

- **Summary**: Classifying and segmenting patterns from a limited number of examples is a significant challenge in remote sensing and earth observation due to the difficulty in acquiring accurately labeled data in large quantities. Previous studies have shown that meta-learning, which involves episodic training on query and support sets, is a promising approach. However, there has been little attention paid to direct fine-tuning techniques. This paper repurposes contrastive learning as a pre-training method for few-shot learning for classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce a generator-based contrastive learning framework (GenCo) that pre-trains backbones and simultaneously explores variants of feature samples. In fine-tuning, the auxiliary generator can be used to enrich limited labeled data samples in feature space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving few-shot learning performance on two key remote sensing datasets: Agriculture-Vision and EuroSAT. Empirically, our approach outperforms purely supervised training on the nearly 95,000 images in Agriculture-Vision for both classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Similarly, the proposed few-shot method achieves better results on the land-cover classification task on EuroSAT compared to the results obtained from fully supervised model training on the dataset.

- **Summary**: Occlusion is a common problem with biometric recognition in the wild. The generalization ability of CNNs greatly decreases due to the adverse effects of various occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel unified framework integrating the merits of both CNNs and graph models to overcome occlusion problems in biometric recognition, called multiscale dynamic graph representation (MS-DGR). More specifically, a group of deep features reflected on certain subregions is recrafted into a feature graph (FG). Each node inside the FG is deemed to characterize a specific local region of the input sample, and the edges imply the co-occurrence of non-occluded regions. By analyzing the similarities of the node representations and measuring the topological structures stored in the adjacent matrix, the proposed framework leverages dynamic graph matching to judiciously discard the nodes corresponding to the occluded parts. The multiscale strategy is further incorporated to attain more diverse nodes representing regions of various sizes. Furthermore, the proposed framework exhibits a more illustrative and reasonable inference by showing the paired nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which boosts the accuracy in both natural and occlusion-simulated cases by a large margin compared with that of baseline methods.

- **Summary**: We present NeRF-Det, a novel method for indoor 3D detection with posed RGB images as input. Unlike existing indoor 3D detection methods that struggle to model scene geometry, our method makes novel use of NeRF in an end-to-end manner to explicitly estimate 3D geometry, thereby improving 3D detection performance. Specifically, to avoid the significant extra latency associated with per-scene optimization of NeRF, we introduce sufficient geometry priors to enhance the generalizability of NeRF-MLP. Furthermore, we subtly connect the detection and NeRF branches through a shared MLP, enabling an efficient adaptation of NeRF to detection and yielding geometry-aware volumetric representations for 3D detection. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts by 3.9 mAP and 3.1 mAP on the ScanNet and ARKITScenes benchmarks, respectively. We provide extensive analysis to shed light on how NeRF-Det works. As a result of our joint-training design, NeRF-Det is able to generalize well to unseen scenes for object detection, view synthesis, and depth estimation tasks without requiring per-scene optimization.

- **Summary**: It has long been an ill-posed problem to predict absolute depth maps from single images in real (unseen) indoor scenes. We observe that it is essentially due to not only the scale-ambiguous problem but also the focal-ambiguous problem that decreases the generalization ability of monocular depth estimation. That is, images may be captured by cameras of different focal lengths in scenes of different scales. In this paper, we develop a focal-and-scale depth estimation model to well learn absolute depth maps from single images in unseen indoor scenes. First, a relative depth estimation network is adopted to learn relative depths from single images with diverse scales/semantics. Second, multi-scale features are generated by mapping a single focal length value to focal length features and concatenating them with intermediate features of different scales in relative depth estimation. Finally, relative depths and multi-scale features are jointly fed into an absolute depth estimation network. In addition, a new pipeline is developed to augment the diversity of focal lengths of public datasets, which are often captured with cameras of the same or similar focal lengths. Our model is trained on augmented NYUDv2 and tested on three unseen datasets. Our model considerably improves the generalization ability of depth estimation by 41%/13% (RMSE) with/without data augmentation compared with five recent SOTAs and well alleviates the deformation problem in 3D reconstruction. Notably, our model well maintains the accuracy of depth estimation on original NYUDv2.

- **Summary**: 360{\deg} images can provide an omnidirectional field of view which is important for stable and long-term scene perception. In this paper, we explore 360{\deg} images for visual object tracking and perceive new challenges caused by large distortion, stitching artifacts, and other unique attributes of 360{\deg} images. To alleviate these problems, we take advantage of novel representations of target localization, i.e., bounding field-of-view, and then introduce a general 360 tracking framework that can adopt typical trackers for omnidirectional tracking. More importantly, we propose a new large-scale omnidirectional tracking benchmark dataset, 360VOT, in order to facilitate future research. 360VOT contains 120 sequences with up to 113K high-resolution frames in equirectangular projection. The tracking targets cover 32 categories in diverse scenarios. Moreover, we provide 4 types of unbiased ground truth, including (rotated) bounding boxes and (rotated) bounding field-of-views, as well as new metrics tailored for 360{\deg} images which allow for the accurate evaluation of omnidirectional tracking performance. Finally, we extensively evaluated 20 state-of-the-art visual trackers and provided a new baseline for future comparisons. Homepage: https://360vot.hkustvgd.com

- **Summary**: With advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), it is now possible to produce realistic-looking automated reports for preliminary reads of radiology images. This can expedite clinical workflows, improve accuracy and reduce overall costs. However, it is also well-known that such models often hallucinate, leading to false findings in the generated reports. In this paper, we propose a new method of fact-checking of AI-generated reports using their associated images. Specifically, the developed examiner differentiates real and fake sentences in reports by learning the association between an image and sentences describing real or potentially fake findings. To train such an examiner, we first created a new dataset of fake reports by perturbing the findings in the original ground truth radiology reports associated with images. Text encodings of real and fake sentences drawn from these reports are then paired with image encodings to learn the mapping to real/fake labels. The utility of such an examiner is demonstrated for verifying automatically generated reports by detecting and removing fake sentences. Future generative AI approaches can use the resulting tool to validate their reports leading to a more responsible use of AI in expediting clinical workflows.

- **Summary**: Facial expression is related to facial muscle contractions and different muscle movements correspond to different emotional states. For micro-expression recognition, the muscle movements are usually subtle, which has a negative impact on the performance of current facial emotion recognition algorithms. Most existing methods use self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between tokens in a sequence, but they do not take into account the inherent spatial relationships between facial landmarks. This can result in sub-optimal performance on micro-expression recognition tasks.Therefore, learning to recognize facial muscle movements is a key challenge in the area of micro-expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Transformer Network (HTNet) to identify critical areas of facial muscle movement. HTNet includes two major components: a transformer layer that leverages the local temporal features and an aggregation layer that extracts local and global semantical facial features. Specifically, HTNet divides the face into four different facial areas: left lip area, left eye area, right eye area and right lip area. The transformer layer is used to focus on representing local minor muscle movement with local self-attention in each area. The aggregation layer is used to learn the interactions between eye areas and lip areas. The experiments on four publicly available micro-expression datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Due to the absence of fine structure and texture information, existing fusion-based few-shot image generation methods suffer from unsatisfactory generation quality and diversity. To address this problem, we propose a novel feature Equalization fusion Generative Adversarial Network (EqGAN) for few-shot image generation. Unlike existing fusion strategies that rely on either deep features or local representations, we design two separate branches to fuse structures and textures by disentangling encoded features into shallow and deep contents. To refine image contents at all feature levels, we equalize the fused structure and texture semantics at different scales and supplement the decoder with richer information by skip connections. Since the fused structures and textures may be inconsistent with each other, we devise a consistent equalization loss between the equalized features and the intermediate output of the decoder to further align the semantics. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that, EqGAN not only significantly improves generation performance with FID score (by up to 32.7%) and LPIPS score (by up to 4.19%), but also outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of accuracy (by up to 1.97%) for downstream classification tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) in wavelet space, instead of pixel space, for visual synthesis. Considering the wavelet transform represents the image in spatial and frequency domains, we carefully design a novel architecture SFUNet to effectively capture the correlation for both domains. Specifically, in the standard denoising U-Net for pixel data, we supplement the 2D convolutions and spatial-only attention layers with our spatial frequency-aware convolution and attention modules to jointly model the complementary information from spatial and frequency domains in wavelet data. Our new architecture can be used as a drop-in replacement to the pixel-based network and is compatible with the vanilla DDPM training process. By explicitly modeling the wavelet signals, we find our model is able to generate images with higher quality on CIFAR-10, FFHQ, LSUN-Bedroom, and LSUN-Church datasets, than the pixel-based counterpart.

- **Summary**: Current deep learning methods for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) typically rely on pixel-wise mapping learned from paired data. However, these methods often overlook the importance of considering degradation representations, which can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a degradation-aware learning scheme for LLIE using diffusion models, which effectively integrates degradation and image priors into the diffusion process, resulting in improved image enhancement. Our proposed degradation-aware learning scheme is based on the understanding that degradation representations play a crucial role in accurately modeling and capturing the specific degradation patterns present in low-light images. To this end, First, a joint learning framework for both image generation and image enhancement is presented to learn the degradation representations. Second, to leverage the learned degradation representations, we develop a Low-Light Diffusion model (LLDiffusion) with a well-designed dynamic diffusion module. This module takes into account both the color map and the latent degradation representations to guide the diffusion process. By incorporating these conditioning factors, the proposed LLDiffusion can effectively enhance low-light images, considering both the inherent degradation patterns and the desired color fidelity. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method on several well-known benchmark datasets, including synthetic and real-world unpaired datasets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that our LLDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art LLIE methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Physical adversarial attacks have put a severe threat to DNN-based object detectors. To enhance security, a combination of visible and infrared sensors is deployed in various scenarios, which has proven effective in disabling existing single-modal physical attacks. To further demonstrate the potential risks in such cases, we design a unified adversarial patch that can perform cross-modal physical attacks, achieving evasion in both modalities simultaneously with a single patch. Given the different imaging mechanisms of visible and infrared sensors, our work manipulates patches' shape features, which can be captured in different modalities when they undergo changes. To deal with challenges, we propose a novel boundary-limited shape optimization approach that aims to achieve compact and smooth shapes for the adversarial patch, making it easy to implement in the physical world. And a score-aware iterative evaluation method is also introduced to balance the fooling degree between visible and infrared detectors during optimization, which guides the adversarial patch to iteratively reduce the predicted scores of the multi-modal sensors. Furthermore, we propose an Affine-Transformation-based enhancement strategy that makes the learnable shape robust to various angles, thus mitigating the issue of shape deformation caused by different shooting angles in the real world. Our method is evaluated against several state-of-the-art object detectors, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of over 80%. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in physical-world scenarios under various settings, including different angles, distances, postures, and scenes for both visible and infrared sensors.

- **Summary**: The increasing frequency of catastrophic natural events, such as wildfires, calls for the development of rapid and automated wildfire detection systems. In this paper, we propose a wildfire identification solution to improve the accuracy of automated satellite-based hotspot detection systems by leveraging multiple information sources. We cross-reference the thermal anomalies detected by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) hotspot services with the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) database to construct a large-scale hotspot dataset for wildfire-related studies in Europe. Then, we propose a novel multimodal supervised machine learning approach to disambiguate hotspot detections, distinguishing between wildfires and other events. Our methodology includes the use of multimodal data sources, such as the ERSI annual Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and the Copernicus Sentinel-3 data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of wildfire identification.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection consists in identifying anomalous regions in images leveraging only models trained on images of healthy anatomy. An established approach is to tokenize images and model the distribution of tokens with Auto-Regressive (AR) models. AR models are used to 1) identify anomalous tokens and 2) in-paint anomalous representations with in-distribution tokens. However, AR models are slow at inference time and prone to error accumulation issues which negatively affect OOD detection performance. Our novel method, MIM-OOD, overcomes both speed and error accumulation issues by replacing the AR model with two task-specific networks: 1) a transformer optimized to identify anomalous tokens and 2) a transformer optimized to in-paint anomalous tokens using masked image modelling (MIM). Our experiments with brain MRI anomalies show that MIM-OOD substantially outperforms AR models (DICE 0.458 vs 0.301) while achieving a nearly 25x speedup (9.5s vs 244s).

- **Summary**: Thanks to High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging methods, the scope of photography has seen profound changes recently. To be more specific, such methods try to reconstruct the lost luminosity of the real world caused by the limitation of regular cameras from the Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images. Additionally, although the State-Of-The-Art methods in this topic perform well, they mainly concentrate on combining different exposures and have less attention to extracting the informative parts of the images. Thus, this paper aims to introduce a new model capable of incorporating information from the most visible areas of each image extracted by a visual attention module (VAM), which is a result of a segmentation strategy. In particular, the model, based on a deep learning architecture, utilizes the extracted areas to produce the final HDR image. The results demonstrate that our method outperformed most of the State-Of-The-Art algorithms.

- **Summary**: The success of automated medical image analysis depends on large-scale and expert-annotated training sets. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been raised as a promising approach to alleviate the burden of labeled data collection. However, they generally operate under the closed-set adaptation setting assuming an identical label set between the source and target domains, which is over-restrictive in clinical practice where new classes commonly exist across datasets due to taxonomic inconsistency. While several methods have been presented to tackle both domain shifts and incoherent label sets, none of them take into account the common characteristics of the two issues and consider the learning dynamics along network training. In this work, we propose optimization trajectory distillation, a unified approach to address the two technical challenges from a new perspective. It exploits the low-rank nature of gradient space and devises a dual-stream distillation algorithm to regularize the learning dynamics of insufficiently annotated domain and classes with the external guidance obtained from reliable sources. Our approach resolves the issue of inadequate navigation along network optimization, which is the major obstacle in the taxonomy adaptive cross-domain adaptation scenario. We evaluate the proposed method extensively on several tasks towards various endpoints with clinical and open-world significance. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and improvements over previous methods.

- **Summary**: Formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) is a pre-training method that relies on synthetic images generated from mathematical formulae such as fractals. Prior work on FDSL has shown that pre-training vision transformers on such synthetic datasets can yield competitive accuracy on a wide range of downstream tasks. These synthetic images are categorized according to the parameters in the mathematical formula that generate them. In the present work, we hypothesize that the process for generating different instances for the same category in FDSL, can be viewed as a form of data augmentation. We validate this hypothesis by replacing the instances with data augmentation, which means we only need a single image per category. Our experiments shows that this one-instance fractal database (OFDB) performs better than the original dataset where instances were explicitly generated. We further scale up OFDB to 21,000 categories and show that it matches, or even surpasses, the model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k in ImageNet-1k fine-tuning. The number of images in OFDB is 21k, whereas ImageNet-21k has 14M. This opens new possibilities for pre-training vision transformers with much smaller datasets.

- **Summary**: Gait, the manner of walking, has been proven to be a reliable biometric with uses in surveillance, marketing and security. A promising new direction for the field is training gait recognition systems without explicit human annotations, through self-supervised learning approaches. Such methods are heavily reliant on strong augmentations for the same walking sequence to induce more data variability and to simulate additional walking variations. Current data augmentation schemes are heuristic and cannot provide the necessary data variation as they are only able to provide simple temporal and spatial distortions. In this work, we propose GaitMorph, a novel method to modify the walking variation for an input gait sequence. Our method entails the training of a high-compression model for gait skeleton sequences that leverages unlabelled data to construct a discrete and interpretable latent space, which preserves identity-related features. Furthermore, we propose a method based on optimal transport theory to learn latent transport maps on the discrete codebook that morph gait sequences between variations. We perform extensive experiments and show that our method is suitable to synthesize additional views for an input sequence.

- **Summary**: Automatic vertebra localization and identification in CT scans is important for numerous clinical applications. Much progress has been made on this topic, but it mostly targets positional localization of vertebrae, ignoring their orientation. Additionally, most methods employ heuristics in their pipeline that can be sensitive in real clinical images which tend to contain abnormalities. We introduce a simple pipeline that employs a standard prediction with a U-Net, followed by a single graph neural network to associate and classify vertebrae with full orientation. To test our method, we introduce a new vertebra dataset that also contains pedicle detections that are associated with vertebra bodies, creating a more challenging landmark prediction, association and classification task. Our method is able to accurately associate the correct body and pedicle landmarks, ignore false positives and classify vertebrae in a simple, fully trainable pipeline avoiding application-specific heuristics. We show our method outperforms traditional approaches such as Hungarian Matching and Hidden Markov Models. We also show competitive performance on the standard VerSe challenge body identification task.

- **Summary**: Single-frame infrared small target detection is considered to be a challenging task, due to the extreme imbalance between target and background, bounding box regression is extremely sensitive to infrared small targets, and small target information is easy to lose in the high-level semantic layer. In this paper, we propose an enhancing feature learning network (EFLNet) based on YOLOv7 framework to solve these problems. First, we notice that there is an extremely imbalance between the target and the background in the infrared image, which makes the model pay more attention to the background features, resulting in missed detection. To address this problem, we propose a new adaptive threshold focal loss function that adjusts the loss weight automatically, compelling the model to allocate greater attention to target features. Second, we introduce the normalized Gaussian Wasserstein distance to alleviate the difficulty of model convergence caused by the extreme sensitivity of the bounding box regression to infrared small targets. Finally, we incorporate a dynamic head mechanism into the network to enable adaptive learning of the relative importance of each semantic layer. Experimental results demonstrate our method can achieve better performance in the detection performance of infrared small targets compared to state-of-the-art deep-learning based methods.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces vox2vec - a contrastive method for self-supervised learning (SSL) of voxel-level representations. vox2vec representations are modeled by a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN): a voxel representation is a concatenation of the corresponding feature vectors from different pyramid levels. The FPN is pre-trained to produce similar representations for the same voxel in different augmented contexts and distinctive representations for different voxels. This results in unified multi-scale representations that capture both global semantics (e.g., body part) and local semantics (e.g., different small organs or healthy versus tumor tissue). We use vox2vec to pre-train a FPN on more than 6500 publicly available computed tomography images. We evaluate the pre-trained representations by attaching simple heads on top of them and training the resulting models for 22 segmentation tasks. We show that vox2vec outperforms existing medical imaging SSL techniques in three evaluation setups: linear and non-linear probing and end-to-end fine-tuning. Moreover, a non-linear head trained on top of the frozen vox2vec representations achieves competitive performance with the FPN trained from scratch while having 50 times fewer trainable parameters.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion aims to recover the complete shape based on a partial observation. Existing methods require either complete point clouds or multiple partial observations of the same object for learning. In contrast to previous approaches, we present Partial2Complete (P2C), the first self-supervised framework that completes point cloud objects using training samples consisting of only a single incomplete point cloud per object. Specifically, our framework groups incomplete point clouds into local patches as input and predicts masked patches by learning prior information from different partial objects. We also propose Region-Aware Chamfer Distance to regularize shape mismatch without limiting completion capability, and devise the Normal Consistency Constraint to incorporate a local planarity assumption, encouraging the recovered shape surface to be continuous and complete. In this way, P2C no longer needs multiple observations or complete point clouds as ground truth. Instead, structural cues are learned from a category-specific dataset to complete partial point clouds of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic ShapeNet data and real-world ScanNet data, showing that P2C produces comparable results to methods trained with complete shapes, and outperforms methods learned with multiple partial observations.

- **Summary**: To ensure the reliable use of classification systems in medical applications, it is crucial to prevent silent failures. This can be achieved by either designing classifiers that are robust enough to avoid failures in the first place, or by detecting remaining failures using confidence scoring functions (CSFs). A predominant source of failures in image classification is distribution shifts between training data and deployment data. To understand the current state of silent failure prevention in medical imaging, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis comparing various CSFs in four biomedical tasks and a diverse range of distribution shifts. Based on the result that none of the benchmarked CSFs can reliably prevent silent failures, we conclude that a deeper understanding of the root causes of failures in the data is required. To facilitate this, we introduce SF-Visuals, an interactive analysis tool that uses latent space clustering to visualize shifts and failures. On the basis of various examples, we demonstrate how this tool can help researchers gain insight into the requirements for safe application of classification systems in the medical domain. The open-source benchmark and tool are at: https://github.com/IML-DKFZ/sf-visuals.

- **Summary**: While the design of blind image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms has improved significantly, the distribution shift between the training and testing scenarios often leads to a poor performance of these methods at inference time. This motivates the study of test time adaptation (TTA) techniques to improve their performance at inference time. Existing auxiliary tasks and loss functions used for TTA may not be relevant for quality-aware adaptation of the pre-trained model. In this work, we introduce two novel quality-relevant auxiliary tasks at the batch and sample levels to enable TTA for blind IQA. In particular, we introduce a group contrastive loss at the batch level and a relative rank loss at the sample level to make the model quality aware and adapt to the target data. Our experiments reveal that even using a small batch of images from the test distribution helps achieve significant improvement in performance by updating the batch normalization statistics of the source model.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in the fields of AI and cognitive sciences opens up new challenges that were previously inaccessible to study. One of such modern tasks is recovering lost data of one modality by using the data from another one. A similar effect (called the McGurk Effect) has been found in the functioning of the human brain. Observing this effect, one modality of information interferes with another, changing its perception. In this paper, we propose a way to simulate such an effect and use it to reconstruct lost data modalities by combining Variational Auto-Encoders, Self-Organizing Maps, and Hebb connections in a unified ReD-SOM (Reentering Deep Self-organizing Map) model. We are inspired by human's capability to use different zones of the brain in different modalities, in case of having a lack of information in one of the modalities. This new approach not only improves the analysis of ambiguous data but also restores the intended signal! The results obtained on the multimodal dataset demonstrate an increase of quality of the signal reconstruction. The effect is remarkable both visually and quantitatively, specifically in presence of a significant degree of signal's distortion.

- **Summary**: Semantic inpainting or image completion alludes to the task of inferring arbitrary large missing regions in images based on image semantics. Since the prediction of image pixels requires an indication of high-level context, this makes it significantly tougher than image completion, which is often more concerned with correcting data corruption and removing entire objects from the input image. On the other hand, image enhancement attempts to eliminate unwanted noise and blur from the image, along with sustaining most of the image details. Efficient image completion and enhancement model should be able to recover the corrupted and masked regions in images and then refine the image further to increase the quality of the output image. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), have turned out to be helpful in picture completion tasks. In this chapter, we will discuss the underlying GAN architecture and how they can be used used for image completion tasks.

- **Summary**: Training an image captioner without annotated image-sentence pairs has gained traction in recent years. Previous approaches can be categorized into two strategies: crawling sentences from mismatching corpora and aligning them with the given images as pseudo annotations, or pre-training the captioner using external image-text pairs. However, the aligning setting seems to reach its performance limit due to the quality problem of pairs, and pre-training requires significant computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a new strategy ``LPM + retrieval-augmented learning" where the prior knowledge from large pre-trained models (LPMs) is leveraged as supervision, and a retrieval process is integrated to further reinforce its effectiveness. Specifically, we introduce Retrieval-augmented Pseudo Sentence Generation (RaPSG), which adopts an efficient approach to retrieve highly relevant short region descriptions from the mismatching corpora and use them to generate a variety of pseudo sentences with distinct representations as well as high quality via LPMs. In addition, a fluency filter and a CLIP-guided training objective are further introduced to facilitate model optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA pre-training model (Flamingo3B) by achieving a CIDEr score of 78.1 (+5.1) while utilizing only 0.3% of its trainable parameters (1.3B VS 33M). Importantly, our approach eliminates the need of computationally expensive pre-training processes on external datasets (e.g., the requirement of 312M image-text pairs for Flamingo3B). We further show that with a simple extension, the generated pseudo sentences can be deployed as weak supervision to boost the 1% semi-supervised image caption benchmark up to 93.4 CIDEr score (+8.9) which showcases the versatility and effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task due to its cross-domain nature, involving the translation of visual-gestural language to text. Many previous methods employ an intermediate representation, i.e., gloss sequences, to facilitate SLT, thus transforming it into a two-stage task of sign language recognition (SLR) followed by sign language translation (SLT). However, the scarcity of gloss-annotated sign language data, combined with the information bottleneck in the mid-level gloss representation, has hindered the further development of the SLT task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Gloss-Free SLT based on Visual-Language Pretraining (GFSLT-VLP), which improves SLT by inheriting language-oriented prior knowledge from pre-trained models, without any gloss annotation assistance. Our approach involves two stages: (i) integrating Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) with masked self-supervised learning to create pre-tasks that bridge the semantic gap between visual and textual representations and restore masked sentences, and (ii) constructing an end-to-end architecture with an encoder-decoder-like structure that inherits the parameters of the pre-trained Visual Encoder and Text Decoder from the first stage. The seamless combination of these novel designs forms a robust sign language representation and significantly improves gloss-free sign language translation. In particular, we have achieved unprecedented improvements in terms of BLEU-4 score on the PHOENIX14T dataset (>+5) and the CSL-Daily dataset (>+3) compared to state-of-the-art gloss-free SLT methods. Furthermore, our approach also achieves competitive results on the PHOENIX14T dataset when compared with most of the gloss-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoubenjia/GFSLT-VLP.

- **Summary**: 3D-aware face generators are typically trained on 2D real-life face image datasets that primarily consist of near-frontal face data, and as such, they are unable to construct one-quarter headshot 3D portraits with complete head, neck, and shoulder geometry. Two reasons account for this issue: First, existing facial recognition methods struggle with extracting facial data captured from large camera angles or back views. Second, it is challenging to learn a distribution of 3D portraits covering the one-quarter headshot region from single-view data due to significant geometric deformation caused by diverse body poses. To this end, we first create the dataset 360{\deg}-Portrait-HQ (360{\deg}PHQ for short) which consists of high-quality single-view real portraits annotated with a variety of camera parameters (the yaw angles span the entire 360{\deg} range) and body poses. We then propose 3DPortraitGAN, the first 3D-aware one-quarter headshot portrait generator that learns a canonical 3D avatar distribution from the 360{\deg}PHQ dataset with body pose self-learning. Our model can generate view-consistent portrait images from all camera angles with a canonical one-quarter headshot 3D representation. Our experiments show that the proposed framework can accurately predict portrait body poses and generate view-consistent, realistic portrait images with complete geometry from all camera angles.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-generated point clouds are crucial for perceiving outdoor environments. The segmentation of point clouds is also essential for many applications. Previous research has focused on using self-attention and convolution (local attention) mechanisms individually in semantic segmentation architectures. However, there is limited work on combining the learned representations of these attention mechanisms to improve performance. Additionally, existing research that combines convolution with self-attention relies on global attention, which is not practical for processing large point clouds. To address these challenges, this study proposes a new architecture, pCTFusion, which combines kernel-based convolutions and self-attention mechanisms for better feature learning and capturing local and global dependencies in segmentation. The proposed architecture employs two types of self-attention mechanisms, local and global, based on the hierarchical positions of the encoder blocks. Furthermore, the existing loss functions do not consider the semantic and position-wise importance of the points, resulting in reduced accuracy, particularly at sharp class boundaries. To overcome this, the study models a novel attention-based loss function called Pointwise Geometric Anisotropy (PGA), which assigns weights based on the semantic distribution of points in a neighborhood. The proposed architecture is evaluated on SemanticKITTI outdoor dataset and showed a 5-7% improvement in performance compared to the state-of-the-art architectures. The results are particularly encouraging for minor classes, often misclassified due to class imbalance, lack of space, and neighbor-aware feature encoding. These developed methods can be leveraged for the segmentation of complex datasets and can drive real-world applications of LiDAR point cloud.

- **Summary**: Knowledge amalgamation (KA) aims to learn a compact student model to handle the joint objective from multiple teacher models that are are specialized for their own tasks respectively. Current methods focus on coarsely aligning teachers and students in the common representation space, making it difficult for the student to learn the proper decision boundaries from a set of heterogeneous teachers. Besides, the KL divergence in previous works only minimizes the probability distribution difference between teachers and the student, ignoring the intrinsic characteristics of teachers. Therefore, we propose a novel Contrastive Knowledge Amalgamation (CKA) framework, which introduces contrastive losses and an alignment loss to achieve intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation.Contrastive losses intra- and inter- models are designed to widen the distance between representations of different classes. The alignment loss is introduced to minimize the sample-level distribution differences of teacher-student models in the common representation space.Furthermore, the student learns heterogeneous unsupervised classification tasks through soft targets efficiently and flexibly in the task-level amalgamation. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the generalization capability of CKA in the amalgamation of specific task as well as multiple tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies provide a further insight into our CKA.

- **Summary**: Depth-aware panoptic segmentation is an emerging topic in computer vision which combines semantic and geometric understanding for more robust scene interpretation. Recent works pursue unified frameworks to tackle this challenge but mostly still treat it as two individual learning tasks, which limits their potential for exploring cross-domain information. We propose a deeply unified framework for depth-aware panoptic segmentation, which performs joint segmentation and depth estimation both in a per-segment manner with identical object queries. To narrow the gap between the two tasks, we further design a geometric query enhancement method, which is able to integrate scene geometry into object queries using latent representations. In addition, we propose a bi-directional guidance learning approach to facilitate cross-task feature learning by taking advantage of their mutual relations. Our method sets the new state of the art for depth-aware panoptic segmentation on both Cityscapes-DVPS and SemKITTI-DVPS datasets. Moreover, our guidance learning approach is shown to deliver performance improvement even under incomplete supervision labels.

- **Summary**: Seeing is believing, however, the underlying mechanism of how human visual perceptions are intertwined with our cognitions is still a mystery. Thanks to the recent advances in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, we have been able to record the visually evoked brain activities and mimic the visual perception ability through computational approaches. In this paper, we pay attention to visual stimuli reconstruction by reconstructing the observed images based on portably accessible brain signals, i.e., electroencephalography (EEG) data. Since EEG signals are dynamic in the time-series format and are notorious to be noisy, processing and extracting useful information requires more dedicated efforts; In this paper, we propose a comprehensive pipeline, named NeuroImagen, for reconstructing visual stimuli images from EEG signals. Specifically, we incorporate a novel multi-level perceptual information decoding to draw multi-grained outputs from the given EEG data. A latent diffusion model will then leverage the extracted information to reconstruct the high-resolution visual stimuli images. The experimental results have illustrated the effectiveness of image reconstruction and superior quantitative performance of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Residual connections have been proposed as architecture-based inductive bias to mitigate the problem of exploding and vanishing gradients and increase task performance in both feed-forward and recurrent networks (RNNs) when trained with the backpropagation algorithm. Yet, little is known about how residual connections in RNNs influence their dynamics and fading memory properties. Here, we introduce weakly coupled residual recurrent networks (WCRNNs) in which residual connections result in well-defined Lyapunov exponents and allow for studying properties of fading memory. We investigate how the residual connections of WCRNNs influence their performance, network dynamics, and memory properties on a set of benchmark tasks. We show that several distinct forms of residual connections yield effective inductive biases that result in increased network expressivity. In particular, residual connections that (i) result in network dynamics at the proximity of the edge of chaos, (ii) allow networks to capitalize on characteristic spectral properties of the data, and (iii) result in heterogeneous memory properties are shown to increase practical expressivity. In addition, we demonstrate how our results can be extended to non-linear residuals and introduce a weakly coupled residual initialization scheme that can be used for Elman RNNs

- **Summary**: Background and objective: The usage of machine learning in medical diagnosis and treatment has witnessed significant growth in recent years through the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems that are often relying on annotated medical radiology images. However, the availability of large annotated image datasets remains a major obstacle since the process of annotation is time-consuming and costly. This paper explores how to automatically annotate a database of medical radiology images with regard to their semantic similarity.   Material and methods: An automated, unsupervised approach is used to construct a large annotated dataset of medical radiology images originating from Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Croatia, utilising multimodal sources, including images, DICOM metadata, and narrative diagnoses. Several appropriate feature extractors are tested for each of the data sources, and their utility is evaluated using k-means and k-medoids clustering on a representative data subset.   Results: The optimal feature extractors are then integrated into a multimodal representation, which is then clustered to create an automated pipeline for labelling a precursor dataset of 1,337,926 medical images into 50 clusters of visually similar images. The quality of the clusters is assessed by examining their homogeneity and mutual information, taking into account the anatomical region and modality representation.   Conclusion: The results suggest that fusing the embeddings of all three data sources together works best for the task of unsupervised clustering of large-scale medical data, resulting in the most concise clusters. Hence, this work is the first step towards building a much larger and more fine-grained annotated dataset of medical radiology images.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained classification is a particular case of a classification problem, aiming to classify objects that share the visual appearance and can only be distinguished by subtle differences. Fine-grained classification models are often deployed to determine animal species or individuals in automated animal monitoring systems. Precise visual explanations of the model's decision are crucial to analyze systematic errors. Attention- or gradient-based methods are commonly used to identify regions in the image that contribute the most to the classification decision. These methods deliver either too coarse or too noisy explanations, unsuitable for identifying subtle visual differences reliably. However, perturbation-based methods can precisely identify pixels causally responsible for the classification result. Fill-in of the dropout (FIDO) algorithm is one of those methods. It utilizes the concrete dropout (CD) to sample a set of attribution masks and updates the sampling parameters based on the output of the classification model. A known problem of the algorithm is a high variance in the gradient estimates, which the authors have mitigated until now by mini-batch updates of the sampling parameters. This paper presents a solution to circumvent these computational instabilities by simplifying the CD sampling and reducing reliance on large mini-batch sizes. First, it allows estimating the parameters with smaller mini-batch sizes without losing the quality of the estimates but with a reduced computational effort. Furthermore, our solution produces finer and more coherent attribution masks. Finally, we use the resulting attribution masks to improve the classification performance of a trained model without additional fine-tuning of the model.

- **Summary**: Purpose:Chest X-ray (CXR) is an essential tool and one of the most prescribed imaging to detect pulmonary abnormalities, with a yearly estimate of over 2 billion imaging performed worldwide. However, the accurate and timely diagnosis of TB remains an unmet goal. The prevalence of TB is highest in low-middle-income countries, and the requirement of a portable, automated, and reliable solution is required. In this study, we compared the performance of DL-based devices on digital and analog CXR. The evaluated DL-based device can be used in resource-constraint settings. Methods: A total of 10,000 CXR DICOMs(.dcm) and printed photos of the films acquired with three different cellular phones - Samsung S8, iPhone 8, and iPhone XS along with their radiological report were retrospectively collected from various sites across India from April 2020 to March 2021. Results: 10,000 chest X-rays were utilized to evaluate the DL-based device in identifying radiological signs of TB. The AUC of qXR for detecting signs of tuberculosis on the original DICOMs dataset was 0.928 with a sensitivity of 0.841 at a specificity of 0.806. At an optimal threshold, the difference in the AUC of three cellular smartphones with the original DICOMs is 0.024 (2.55%), 0.048 (5.10%), and 0.038 (1.91%). The minimum difference demonstrates the robustness of the DL-based device in identifying radiological signs of TB in both digital and analog CXR.

- **Summary**: Advanced image tampering techniques are increasingly challenging the trustworthiness of multimedia, leading to the development of Image Manipulation Localization (IML). But what makes a good IML model? The answer lies in the way to capture artifacts. Exploiting artifacts requires the model to extract non-semantic discrepancies between manipulated and authentic regions, necessitating explicit comparisons between the two areas. With the self-attention mechanism, naturally, the Transformer should be a better candidate to capture artifacts. However, due to limited datasets, there is currently no pure ViT-based approach for IML to serve as a benchmark, and CNNs dominate the entire task. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from weak long-range and non-semantic modeling. To bridge this gap, based on the fact that artifacts are sensitive to image resolution, amplified under multi-scale features, and massive at the manipulation border, we formulate the answer to the former question as building a ViT with high-resolution capacity, multi-scale feature extraction capability, and manipulation edge supervision that could converge with a small amount of data. We term this simple but effective ViT paradigm IML-ViT, which has significant potential to become a new benchmark for IML. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets verified our model outperforms the state-of-the-art manipulation localization methods.Code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/SunnyHaze/IML-ViT}.

- **Summary**: This work presents a new unsupervised framework for training deep learning models for super-resolution of Sentinel-2 images by fusion of its 10-m and 20-m bands. The proposed scheme avoids the resolution downgrade process needed to generate training data in the supervised case. On the other hand, a proper loss that accounts for cycle-consistency between the network prediction and the input components to be fused is proposed. Despite its unsupervised nature, in our preliminary experiments the proposed scheme has shown promising results in comparison to the supervised approach. Besides, by construction of the proposed loss, the resulting trained network can be ascribed to the class of multi-resolution analysis methods.

- **Summary**: Training an effective video action recognition model poses significant computational challenges, particularly under limited resource budgets. Current methods primarily aim to either reduce model size or utilize pre-trained models, limiting their adaptability to various backbone architectures. This paper investigates the issue of over-sampled frames, a prevalent problem in many approaches yet it has received relatively little attention. Despite the use of fewer frames being a potential solution, this approach often results in a substantial decline in performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to restore the intermediate features for two sparsely sampled and adjacent video frames. This feature restoration technique brings a negligible increase in computational requirements compared to resource-intensive image encoders, such as ViT. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets, including Kinetics-400, ActivityNet, UCF-101, and HMDB-51. With the integration of our method, the efficiency of three commonly used baselines has been improved by over 50%, with a mere 0.5% reduction in recognition accuracy. In addition, our method also surprisingly helps improve the generalization ability of the models under zero-shot settings.

- **Summary**: This study explores the application of self-supervised learning (SSL) for improved target recognition in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery. The unique challenges of underwater environments make traditional computer vision techniques, which rely heavily on optical camera imagery, less effective. SAS, with its ability to generate high-resolution imagery, emerges as a preferred choice for underwater imaging. However, the voluminous high-resolution SAS data presents a significant challenge for labeling; a crucial step for training deep neural networks (DNNs).   SSL, which enables models to learn features in data without the need for labels, is proposed as a potential solution to the data labeling challenge in SAS. The study evaluates the performance of two prominent SSL algorithms, MoCov2 and BYOL, against the well-regarded supervised learning model, ResNet18, for binary image classification tasks. The findings suggest that while both SSL models can outperform a fully supervised model with access to a small number of labels in a few-shot scenario, they do not exceed it when all the labels are used.   The results underscore the potential of SSL as a viable alternative to traditional supervised learning, capable of maintaining task performance while reducing the time and costs associated with data labeling. The study also contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of SSL in remote sensing and could stimulate further research in this area.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) is crucial for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to make informed decisions and respond proactively in critical road scenarios. Promising results of 3D HPE have been gained in several domains such as human-computer interaction, robotics, sports and medical analytics, often based on data collected in well-controlled laboratory environments. Nevertheless, the transfer of 3D HPE methods to AVs has received limited research attention, due to the challenges posed by obtaining accurate 3D pose annotations and the limited suitability of data from other domains.   We present a simple yet efficient weakly supervised approach for 3D HPE in the AV context by employing a high-level sensor fusion between camera and LiDAR data. The weakly supervised setting enables training on the target datasets without any 2D/3D keypoint labels by using an off-the-shelf 2D joint extractor and pseudo labels generated from LiDAR to image projections. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art results by up to $\sim$ 13% on the Waymo Open Dataset in the weakly supervised setting and achieves state-of-the-art results in the supervised setting.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning is popular method because of its ability to learn features in images without using its labels and is able to overcome limited labeled datasets used in supervised learning. Self-supervised learning works by using a pretext task which will be trained on the model before being applied to a specific task. There are some examples of pretext tasks used in self-supervised learning in the field of image recognition, namely rotation prediction, solving jigsaw puzzles, and predicting relative positions on image. Previous studies have only used one type of transformation as a pretext task. This raises the question of how it affects if more than one pretext task is used and to use a gating network to combine all pretext tasks. Therefore, we propose the Gated Self-Supervised Learning method to improve image classification which use more than one transformation as pretext task and uses the Mixture of Expert architecture as a gating network in combining each pretext task so that the model automatically can study and focus more on the most useful augmentations for classification. We test performance of the proposed method in several scenarios, namely CIFAR imbalance dataset classification, adversarial perturbations, Tiny-Imagenet dataset classification, and semi-supervised learning. Moreover, there are Grad-CAM and T-SNE analysis that are used to see the proposed method for identifying important features that influence image classification and representing data for each class and separating different classes properly.

- **Summary**: The recent surge of foundation models in computer vision and natural language processing opens up perspectives in utilizing multi-modal clinical data to train large models with strong generalizability. Yet pathological image datasets often lack biomedical text annotation and enrichment. Guiding data-efficient image diagnosis from the use of biomedical text knowledge becomes a substantial interest. In this paper, we propose to Connect Image and Text Embeddings (CITE) to enhance pathological image classification. CITE injects text insights gained from language models pre-trained with a broad range of biomedical texts, leading to adapt foundation models towards pathological image understanding. Through extensive experiments on the PatchGastric stomach tumor pathological image dataset, we demonstrate that CITE achieves leading performance compared with various baselines especially when training data is scarce. CITE offers insights into leveraging in-domain text knowledge to reinforce data-efficient pathological image classification. Code is available at https://github.com/Yunkun-Zhang/CITE.

- **Summary**: Human tissue and its constituent cells form a microenvironment that is fundamentally three-dimensional (3D). However, the standard-of-care in pathologic diagnosis involves selecting a few two-dimensional (2D) sections for microscopic evaluation, risking sampling bias and misdiagnosis. Diverse methods for capturing 3D tissue morphologies have been developed, but they have yet had little translation to clinical practice; manual and computational evaluations of such large 3D data have so far been impractical and/or unable to provide patient-level clinical insights. Here we present Modality-Agnostic Multiple instance learning for volumetric Block Analysis (MAMBA), a deep-learning-based platform for processing 3D tissue images from diverse imaging modalities and predicting patient outcomes. Archived prostate cancer specimens were imaged with open-top light-sheet microscopy or microcomputed tomography and the resulting 3D datasets were used to train risk-stratification networks based on 5-year biochemical recurrence outcomes via MAMBA. With the 3D block-based approach, MAMBA achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 and 0.74, superior to 2D traditional single-slice-based prognostication (AUC of 0.79 and 0.57), suggesting superior prognostication with 3D morphological features. Further analyses reveal that the incorporation of greater tissue volume improves prognostic performance and mitigates risk prediction variability from sampling bias, suggesting the value of capturing larger extents of heterogeneous 3D morphology. With the rapid growth and adoption of 3D spatial biology and pathology techniques by researchers and clinicians, MAMBA provides a general and efficient framework for 3D weakly supervised learning for clinical decision support and can help to reveal novel 3D morphological biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic response.

- **Summary**: The distribution of illustrations on social media, such as Twitter and Pixiv has increased with the growing popularity of animation, games, and animated movies. The "atmosphere" of illustrations plays an important role in user preferences. Classifying illustrations by atmosphere can be helpful for recommendations and searches. However, assigning clear labels to the elusive "atmosphere" and conventional supervised classification is not always practical. Furthermore, even images with similar colors, edges, and low-level features may not have similar atmospheres, making classification based on low-level features challenging. In this paper, this problem is solved using both supervised and unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels. The feature vectors are obtained using the supervised method with pseudo-labels that contribute to an ambiguous atmosphere. Further, clustering is performed based on these feature vectors. Experimental analyses show that our method outperforms conventional methods in human-like clustering on datasets manually classified by humans.

- **Summary**: Visual AI systems are vulnerable to natural and synthetic physical corruption in the real-world. Such corruption often arises unexpectedly and alters the model's performance. In recent years, the primary focus has been on adversarial attacks. However, natural corruptions (e.g., snow, fog, dust) are an omnipresent threat to visual AI systems and should be considered equally important. Many existing works propose interesting solutions to train robust models against natural corruption. These works either leverage image augmentations, which come with the additional cost of model training, or place suspicious patches in the scene to design unadversarial examples. In this work, we propose the idea of naturalistic support artifacts (NSA) for robust prediction. The NSAs are shown to be beneficial in scenarios where model parameters are inaccessible and adding artifacts in the scene is feasible. The NSAs are natural looking objects generated through artifact training using DC-GAN to have high visual fidelity in the scene. We test against natural corruptions on the Imagenette dataset and observe the improvement in prediction confidence score by four times. We also demonstrate NSA's capability to increase adversarial accuracy by 8\% on average. Lastly, we qualitatively analyze NSAs using saliency maps to understand how they help improve prediction confidence.

- **Summary**: The demand for efficient 3D model generation techniques has grown exponentially, as manual creation of 3D models is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. While generative models have shown potential in creating 3D textured shapes from 2D images, their applicability in 3D industries is limited due to the lack of a well-defined camera distribution in real-world scenarios, resulting in low-quality shapes. To overcome this limitation, we propose GET3D--, the first method that directly generates textured 3D shapes from 2D images with unknown pose and scale. GET3D-- comprises a 3D shape generator and a learnable camera sampler that captures the 6D external changes on the camera. In addition, We propose a novel training schedule to stably optimize both the shape generator and camera sampler in a unified framework. By controlling external variations using the learnable camera sampler, our method can generate aligned shapes with clear textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of GET3D--, which precisely fits the 6D camera pose distribution and generates high-quality shapes on both synthetic and realistic unconstrained datasets.

- **Summary**: In the medical field, federated learning commonly deals with highly imbalanced datasets, including skin lesions and gastrointestinal images. Existing federated methods under highly imbalanced datasets primarily focus on optimizing a global model without incorporating the intra-class variations that can arise in medical imaging due to different populations, findings, and scanners. In this paper, we study the inter-client intra-class variations with publicly available self-supervised auxiliary networks. Specifically, we find that employing a shared auxiliary pre-trained model, like MoCo-V2, locally on every client yields consistent divergence measurements. Based on these findings, we derive a dynamic balanced model aggregation via self-supervised priors (MAS) to guide the global model optimization. Fed-MAS can be utilized with different local learning methods for effective model aggregation toward a highly robust and unbiased global model.

- **Summary**: With the overwhelming trend of mask image modeling led by MAE, generative pre-training has shown a remarkable potential to boost the performance of fundamental models in 2D vision. However, in 3D vision, the over-reliance on Transformer-based backbones and the unordered nature of point clouds have restricted the further development of generative pre-training. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D-to-2D generative pre-training method that is adaptable to any point cloud model. We propose to generate view images from different instructed poses via the cross-attention mechanism as the pre-training scheme. Generating view images has more precise supervision than its point cloud counterpart, thus assisting 3D backbones to have a finer comprehension of the geometrical structure and stereoscopic relations of the point cloud. Experimental results have proved the superiority of our proposed 3D-to-2D generative pre-training over previous pre-training methods. Our method is also effective in boosting the performance of architecture-oriented approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning on ScanObjectNN classification and ShapeNetPart segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Simulating camera sensors is a crucial task in autonomous driving. Although neural radiance fields are exceptional at synthesizing photorealistic views in driving simulations, they still fail to generate extrapolated views. This paper proposes to incorporate map priors into neural radiance fields to synthesize out-of-trajectory driving views with semantic road consistency. The key insight is that map information can be utilized as a prior to guiding the training of the radiance fields with uncertainty. Specifically, we utilize the coarse ground surface as uncertain information to supervise the density field and warp depth with uncertainty from unknown camera poses to ensure multi-view consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can produce semantic consistency in deviated views for vehicle camera simulation.

- **Summary**: Since the advent of Neural Radiance Fields, novel view synthesis has received tremendous attention. The existing approach for the generalization of radiance field reconstruction primarily constructs an encoding volume from nearby source images as additional inputs. However, these approaches cannot efficiently encode the geometric information of real scenes with various scale objects/structures. In this work, we propose constructing multi-scale encoding volumes and providing multi-scale geometry information to NeRF models. To make the constructed volumes as close as possible to the surfaces of objects in the scene and the rendered depth more accurate, we propose to perform depth prediction and radiance field reconstruction simultaneously. The predicted depth map will be used to supervise the rendered depth, narrow the depth range, and guide points sampling. Finally, the geometric information contained in point volume features may be inaccurate due to occlusion, lighting, etc. To this end, we propose enhancing the point volume feature from depth-guided neighbor feature fusion. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both novel view synthesis and dense geometry modeling without per-scene optimization.

- **Summary**: With the increased deployment of machine learning models in various real-world applications, researchers and practitioners alike have emphasized the need for explanations of model behaviour. To this end, two broad strategies have been outlined in prior literature to explain models. Post hoc explanation methods explain the behaviour of complex black-box models by highlighting features that are critical to model predictions; however, prior work has shown that these explanations may not be faithful, and even more concerning is our inability to verify them. Specifically, it is nontrivial to evaluate if a given attribution is correct with respect to the underlying model. Inherently interpretable models, on the other hand, circumvent these issues by explicitly encoding explanations into model architecture, meaning their explanations are naturally faithful and verifiable, but they often exhibit poor predictive performance due to their limited expressive power. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between the aforementioned strategies by proposing Verifiability Tuning (VerT), a method that transforms black-box models into models that naturally yield faithful and verifiable feature attributions. We begin by introducing a formal theoretical framework to understand verifiability and show that attributions produced by standard models cannot be verified. We then leverage this framework to propose a method to build verifiable models and feature attributions out of fully trained black-box models. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that VerT produces models that (1) yield explanations that are correct and verifiable and (2) are faithful to the original black-box models they are meant to explain.

- **Summary**: Google's Bard has emerged as a formidable competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT in the field of conversational AI. Notably, Bard has recently been updated to handle visual inputs alongside text prompts during conversations. Given Bard's impressive track record in handling textual inputs, we explore its capabilities in understanding and interpreting visual data (images) conditioned by text questions. This exploration holds the potential to unveil new insights and challenges for Bard and other forthcoming multi-modal Generative models, especially in addressing complex computer vision problems that demand accurate visual and language understanding. Specifically, in this study, we focus on 15 diverse task scenarios encompassing regular, camouflaged, medical, under-water and remote sensing data to comprehensively evaluate Bard's performance. Our primary finding indicates that Bard still struggles in these vision scenarios, highlighting the significant gap in vision-based understanding that needs to be bridged in future developments. We expect that this empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, leading to enhanced capabilities in comprehending and interpreting fine-grained visual data.

- **Summary**: Deepfake detection methods have shown promising results in recognizing forgeries within a given dataset, where training and testing take place on the in-distribution dataset. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when presented with unseen samples. As a result, a reliable deepfake detection system must remain impartial to forgery types, appearance, and quality for guaranteed generalizable detection performance. Despite various attempts to enhance cross-dataset generalization, the problem remains challenging, particularly when testing against common post-processing perturbations, such as video compression or blur. Hence, this study introduces a deepfake detection framework, leveraging a self-supervised pre-training model that delivers exceptional generalization ability, withstanding common corruptions and enabling feature explainability. The framework comprises three key components: a feature extractor based on vision Transformer architecture that is pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning methodology, a graph convolution network coupled with a Transformer discriminator, and a graph Transformer relevancy map that provides a better understanding of manipulated regions and further explains the model's decision. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework, several challenging experiments are conducted, including in-data distribution performance, cross-dataset, cross-manipulation generalization, and robustness against common post-production perturbations. The results achieved demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed deepfake detection framework, surpassing the current state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Inspired by deep convolution segmentation algorithms, scene text detectors break the performance ceiling of datasets steadily. However, these methods often encounter threshold selection bottlenecks and have poor performance on text instances with extreme aspect ratios. In this paper, we propose to automatically learn the discriminate segmentation threshold, which distinguishes text pixels from background pixels for segmentation-based scene text detectors and then further reduces the time-consuming manual parameter adjustment. Besides, we design a Global-information Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (GE-FPN) for capturing text instances with macro size and extreme aspect ratios. Following the GE-FPN, we introduce a cascade optimization structure to further refine the text instances. Finally, together with the proposed threshold learning strategy and text detection structure, we design an Adaptive Segmentation Network (ASNet) for scene text detection. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed ASNet can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on four text detection benchmarks, i.e., ICDAR 2015, MSRA-TD500, ICDAR 2017 MLT and CTW1500. The ablation experiments also verify the effectiveness of our contributions.

- **Summary**: Recent inversion methods have shown that real images can be inverted into StyleGAN's latent space and numerous edits can be achieved on those images thanks to the semantically rich feature representations of well-trained GAN models. However, extensive research has also shown that image inversion is challenging due to the trade-off between high-fidelity reconstruction and editability. In this paper, we tackle an even more difficult task, inverting erased images into GAN's latent space for realistic inpaintings and editings. Furthermore, by augmenting inverted latent codes with different latent samples, we achieve diverse inpaintings. Specifically, we propose to learn an encoder and mixing network to combine encoded features from erased images with StyleGAN's mapped features from random samples. To encourage the mixing network to utilize both inputs, we train the networks with generated data via a novel set-up. We also utilize higher-rate features to prevent color inconsistencies between the inpainted and unerased parts. We run extensive experiments and compare our method with state-of-the-art inversion and inpainting methods. Qualitative metrics and visual comparisons show significant improvements.

- **Summary**: Scenarios in which restrictions in data transfer and storage limit the possibility to compose a single dataset -- also exploiting different data sources -- to perform a batch-based training procedure, make the development of robust models particularly challenging. We hypothesize that the recent Continual Learning (CL) paradigm may represent an effective solution to enable incremental training, even through multiple sites. Indeed, a basic assumption of CL is that once a model has been trained, old data can no longer be used in successive training iterations and in principle can be deleted. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the performance of different Continual Learning methods in this scenario, simulating a learning model that is updated every time a new chunk of data, even of variable size, is available. Experimental results reveal that a particular CL method, namely Learning without Forgetting (LwF), is one of the best-performing algorithms. Then, we investigate its usage and parametrization in Morphing Attack Detection and Object Classification tasks, specifically with respect to the amount of new training data that became available.

- **Summary**: The gradual nature of a diffusion process that synthesizes samples in small increments constitutes a key ingredient of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which have presented unprecedented quality in image synthesis and been recently explored in the motion domain. In this work, we propose to adapt the gradual diffusion concept (operating along a diffusion time-axis) into the temporal-axis of the motion sequence. Our key idea is to extend the DDPM framework to support temporally varying denoising, thereby entangling the two axes. Using our special formulation, we iteratively denoise a motion buffer that contains a set of increasingly-noised poses, which auto-regressively produces an arbitrarily long stream of frames. With a stationary diffusion time-axis, in each diffusion step we increment only the temporal-axis of the motion such that the framework produces a new, clean frame which is removed from the beginning of the buffer, followed by a newly drawn noise vector that is appended to it. This new mechanism paves the way towards a new framework for long-term motion synthesis with applications to character animation and other domains.

- **Summary**: Handwriting recognition is a challenging and critical problem in the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning, with applications spanning a wide range of domains. In this paper, we focus on the specific issue of recognizing offline Arabic handwritten text. Existing approaches typically utilize a combination of convolutional neural networks for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for temporal modeling, with connectionist temporal classification used for text generation. However, these methods suffer from a lack of parallelization due to the sequential nature of recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, these models cannot account for linguistic rules, necessitating the use of an external language model in the post-processing stage to boost accuracy. To overcome these issues, we introduce two alternative architectures, namely the Transformer Transducer and the standard sequence-to-sequence Transformer, and compare their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. Our approach can model language dependencies and relies only on the attention mechanism, thereby making it more parallelizable and less complex. We employ pre-trained Transformers for both image understanding and language modeling. Our evaluation on the Arabic KHATT dataset demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches for recognizing offline Arabic handwritten text.

- **Summary**: Prompt tuning and adapter tuning have shown great potential in transferring pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. In this work, we design a new type of tuning method, termed as regularized mask tuning, which masks the network parameters through a learnable selection. Inspired by neural pathways, we argue that the knowledge required by a downstream task already exists in the pre-trained weights but just gets concealed in the upstream pre-training stage. To bring the useful knowledge back into light, we first identify a set of parameters that are important to a given downstream task, then attach a binary mask to each parameter, and finally optimize these masks on the downstream data with the parameters frozen. When updating the mask, we introduce a novel gradient dropout strategy to regularize the parameter selection, in order to prevent the model from forgetting old knowledge and overfitting the downstream data. Experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method over previous alternatives. It is noteworthy that we manage to deliver 18.73% performance improvement compared to the zero-shot CLIP via masking an average of only 2.56% parameters. Furthermore, our method is synergistic with most existing parameter-efficient tuning methods and can boost the performance on top of them.

- **Summary**: Inferring the depth of transparent or mirror (ToM) surfaces represents a hard challenge for either sensors, algorithms, or deep networks. We propose a simple pipeline for learning to estimate depth properly for such surfaces with neural networks, without requiring any ground-truth annotation. We unveil how to obtain reliable pseudo labels by in-painting ToM objects in images and processing them with a monocular depth estimation model. These labels can be used to fine-tune existing monocular or stereo networks, to let them learn how to deal with ToM surfaces. Experimental results on the Booster dataset show the dramatic improvements enabled by our remarkably simple proposal.

- **Summary**: We introduce PointOdyssey, a large-scale synthetic dataset, and data generation framework, for the training and evaluation of long-term fine-grained tracking algorithms. Our goal is to advance the state-of-the-art by placing emphasis on long videos with naturalistic motion. Toward the goal of naturalism, we animate deformable characters using real-world motion capture data, we build 3D scenes to match the motion capture environments, and we render camera viewpoints using trajectories mined via structure-from-motion on real videos. We create combinatorial diversity by randomizing character appearance, motion profiles, materials, lighting, 3D assets, and atmospheric effects. Our dataset currently includes 104 videos, averaging 2,000 frames long, with orders of magnitude more correspondence annotations than prior work. We show that existing methods can be trained from scratch in our dataset and outperform the published variants. Finally, we introduce modifications to the PIPs point tracking method, greatly widening its temporal receptive field, which improves its performance on PointOdyssey as well as on two real-world benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised and language-supervised image models contain rich knowledge of the world that is important for generalization. Many robotic tasks, however, require a detailed understanding of 3D geometry, which is often lacking in 2D image features. This work bridges this 2D-to-3D gap for robotic manipulation by leveraging distilled feature fields to combine accurate 3D geometry with rich semantics from 2D foundation models. We present a few-shot learning method for 6-DOF grasping and placing that harnesses these strong spatial and semantic priors to achieve in-the-wild generalization to unseen objects. Using features distilled from a vision-language model, CLIP, we present a way to designate novel objects for manipulation via free-text natural language, and demonstrate its ability to generalize to unseen expressions and novel categories of objects.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, autonomous cars can drive smoothly in ordinary cases, and it is widely recognized that realistic sensor simulation will play a critical role in solving remaining corner cases by simulating them. To this end, we propose an autonomous driving simulator based upon neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Compared with existing works, ours has three notable features: (1) Instance-aware. Our simulator models the foreground instances and background environments separately with independent networks so that the static (e.g., size and appearance) and dynamic (e.g., trajectory) properties of instances can be controlled separately. (2) Modular. Our simulator allows flexible switching between different modern NeRF-related backbones, sampling strategies, input modalities, etc. We expect this modular design to boost academic progress and industrial deployment of NeRF-based autonomous driving simulation. (3) Realistic. Our simulator set new state-of-the-art photo-realism results given the best module selection. Our simulator will be open-sourced while most of our counterparts are not.

- **Summary**: Accurate depth estimation under out-of-distribution (OoD) scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions, sensor failure, and noise contamination, is desirable for safety-critical applications. Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design. We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond. The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website.

- **Summary**: The goal of Online Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation is to handle unforeseeable domain changes that occur during deployment, like sudden weather events. However, the high computational costs associated with brute-force adaptation make this paradigm unfeasible for real-world applications. In this paper we propose HAMLET, a Hardware-Aware Modular Least Expensive Training framework for real-time domain adaptation. Our approach includes a hardware-aware back-propagation orchestration agent (HAMT) and a dedicated domain-shift detector that enables active control over when and how the model is adapted (LT). Thanks to these advancements, our approach is capable of performing semantic segmentation while simultaneously adapting at more than 29FPS on a single consumer-grade GPU. Our framework's encouraging accuracy and speed trade-off is demonstrated on OnDA and SHIFT benchmarks through experimental results.

- **Summary**: Acoustic matching aims to re-synthesize an audio clip to sound as if it were recorded in a target acoustic environment. Existing methods assume access to paired training data, where the audio is observed in both source and target environments, but this limits the diversity of training data or requires the use of simulated data or heuristics to create paired samples. We propose a self-supervised approach to visual acoustic matching where training samples include only the target scene image and audio -- without acoustically mismatched source audio for reference. Our approach jointly learns to disentangle room acoustics and re-synthesize audio into the target environment, via a conditional GAN framework and a novel metric that quantifies the level of residual acoustic information in the de-biased audio. Training with either in-the-wild web data or simulated data, we demonstrate it outperforms the state-of-the-art on multiple challenging datasets and a wide variety of real-world audio and environments.

- **Summary**: Change detection based on remote sensing images has been a prominent area of interest in the field of remote sensing. Deep networks have demonstrated significant success in detecting changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images and have found applications in various fields. Given the degradation of natural environments and the frequent occurrence of natural disasters, accurately and swiftly identifying damaged buildings in disaster-stricken areas through remote sensing images holds immense significance. This paper aims to investigate change detection specifically for natural disasters. Considering that existing public datasets used in change detection research are registered, which does not align with the practical scenario where bi-temporal images are not matched, this paper introduces an unregistered end-to-end change detection synthetic dataset called xBD-E2ECD. Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end change detection network named E2ECDNet, which takes an unregistered bi-temporal image pair as input and simultaneously generates the flow field prediction result and the change detection prediction result. It is worth noting that our E2ECDNet also supports change detection for registered image pairs, as registration can be seen as a special case of non-registration. Additionally, this paper redefines the criteria for correctly predicting a positive case and introduces neighborhood-based change detection evaluation metrics. The experimental results have demonstrated significant improvements.

- **Summary**: With the popularity of implicit neural representations, or neural radiance fields (NeRF), there is a pressing need for editing methods to interact with the implicit 3D models for tasks like post-processing reconstructed scenes and 3D content creation. While previous works have explored NeRF editing from various perspectives, they are restricted in editing flexibility, quality, and speed, failing to offer direct editing response and instant preview. The key challenge is to conceive a locally editable neural representation that can directly reflect the editing instructions and update instantly. To bridge the gap, we propose a new interactive editing method and system for implicit representations, called Seal-3D, which allows users to edit NeRF models in a pixel-level and free manner with a wide range of NeRF-like backbone and preview the editing effects instantly. To achieve the effects, the challenges are addressed by our proposed proxy function mapping the editing instructions to the original space of NeRF models in the teacher model and a two-stage training strategy for the student model with local pretraining and global finetuning. A NeRF editing system is built to showcase various editing types. Our system can achieve compelling editing effects with an interactive speed of about 1 second.

- **Summary**: Vector Quantisation (VQ) is experiencing a comeback in machine learning, where it is increasingly used in representation learning. However, optimizing the codevectors in existing VQ-VAE is not entirely trivial. A problem is codebook collapse, where only a small subset of codevectors receive gradients useful for their optimisation, whereas a majority of them simply ``dies off'' and is never updated or used. This limits the effectiveness of VQ for learning larger codebooks in complex computer vision tasks that require high-capacity representations. In this paper, we present a simple alternative method for online codebook learning, Clustering VQ-VAE (CVQ-VAE). Our approach selects encoded features as anchors to update the ``dead'' codevectors, while optimising the codebooks which are alive via the original loss. This strategy brings unused codevectors closer in distribution to the encoded features, increasing the likelihood of being chosen and optimized. We extensively validate the generalization capability of our quantiser on various datasets, tasks (e.g. reconstruction and generation), and architectures (e.g. VQ-VAE, VQGAN, LDM). Our CVQ-VAE can be easily integrated into the existing models with just a few lines of code.

- **Summary**: Dropout as a regularization technique is widely used in fully connected layers while is less effective in convolutional layers. Therefore more structured forms of dropout have been proposed to regularize convolutional networks. The disadvantage of these methods is that the randomness introduced causes inconsistency between training and inference. In this paper, we apply a mutual learning training strategy for convolutional layer regularization, namely R-Block, which forces two outputs of the generated difference maximizing sub models to be consistent with each other. Concretely, R-Block minimizes the losses between the output distributions of two sub models with different drop regions for each sample in the training dataset. We design two approaches to construct such sub models. Our experiments demonstrate that R-Block achieves better performance than other existing structured dropout variants. We also demonstrate that our approaches to construct sub models outperforms others.

- **Summary**: Similarity metrics have played a significant role in computer vision to capture the underlying semantics of images. In recent years, advanced similarity metrics, such as the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), have emerged. These metrics leverage deep features extracted from trained neural networks and have demonstrated a remarkable ability to closely align with human perception when evaluating relative image similarity. However, it is now well-known that neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, i.e., small perturbations invisible to humans crafted to deliberately mislead the model. Consequently, the LPIPS metric is also sensitive to such adversarial examples. This susceptibility introduces significant security concerns, especially considering the widespread adoption of LPIPS in large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose the Robust Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (R-LPIPS) metric, a new metric that leverages adversarially trained deep features. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of R-LPIPS compared to the classical LPIPS metric. The code is available at https://github.com/SaraGhazanfari/R-LPIPS.

- **Summary**: Rotational invariance is a popular inductive bias used by many fields in machine learning, such as computer vision and machine learning for quantum chemistry. Rotation-invariant machine learning methods set the state of the art for many tasks, including molecular property prediction and 3D shape classification. These methods generally either rely on task-specific rotation-invariant features, or they use general-purpose deep neural networks which are complicated to design and train. However, it is unclear whether the success of these methods is primarily due to the rotation invariance or the deep neural networks. To address this question, we suggest a simple and general-purpose method for learning rotation-invariant functions of three-dimensional point cloud data using a random features approach. Specifically, we extend the random features method of Rahimi & Recht 2007 by deriving a version that is invariant to three-dimensional rotations and showing that it is fast to evaluate on point cloud data. We show through experiments that our method matches or outperforms the performance of general-purpose rotation-invariant neural networks on standard molecular property prediction benchmark datasets QM7 and QM9. We also show that our method is general-purpose and provides a rotation-invariant baseline on the ModelNet40 shape classification task. Finally, we show that our method has an order of magnitude smaller prediction latency than competing kernel methods.

- **Summary**: The popularity of text-based CAPTCHA as a security mechanism to protect websites from automated bots has prompted researches in CAPTCHA solvers, with the aim of understanding its failure cases and subsequently making CAPTCHAs more secure. Recently proposed solvers, built on advances in deep learning, are able to crack even the very challenging CAPTCHAs with high accuracy. However, these solvers often perform poorly on out-of-distribution samples that contain visual features different from those in the training set. Furthermore, they lack the ability to detect and avoid such samples, making them susceptible to being locked out by defense systems after a certain number of failed attempts. In this paper, we propose EnSolver, a novel CAPTCHA solver that utilizes deep ensemble uncertainty estimation to detect and skip out-of-distribution CAPTCHAs, making it harder to be detected. We demonstrate the use of our solver with object detection models and show empirically that it performs well on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, achieving up to 98.1% accuracy when detecting out-of-distribution data and up to 93% success rate when solving in-distribution CAPTCHAs.

- **Summary**: Medicine, by its nature, is a multifaceted domain that requires the synthesis of information across various modalities. Medical generative vision-language models (VLMs) make a first step in this direction and promise many exciting clinical applications. However, existing models typically have to be fine-tuned on sizeable down-stream datasets, which poses a significant limitation as in many medical applications data is scarce, necessitating models that are capable of learning from few examples in real-time. Here we propose Med-Flamingo, a multimodal few-shot learner adapted to the medical domain. Based on OpenFlamingo-9B, we continue pre-training on paired and interleaved medical image-text data from publications and textbooks. Med-Flamingo unlocks few-shot generative medical visual question answering (VQA) abilities, which we evaluate on several datasets including a novel challenging open-ended VQA dataset of visual USMLE-style problems. Furthermore, we conduct the first human evaluation for generative medical VQA where physicians review the problems and blinded generations in an interactive app. Med-Flamingo improves performance in generative medical VQA by up to 20\% in clinician's rating and firstly enables multimodal medical few-shot adaptations, such as rationale generation. We release our model, code, and evaluation app under https://github.com/snap-stanford/med-flamingo.

- **Summary**: Traffic light detection is a challenging problem in the context of self-driving cars and driver assistance systems. While most existing systems produce good results on large traffic lights, detecting small and tiny ones is often overlooked. A key problem here is the inherent downsampling in CNNs, leading to low-resolution features for detection. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new traffic light detection system, comprising a novel traffic light proposal generator that utilizes findings from general object proposal generation, fine-grained multi-scale features, and attention for efficient processing. Moreover, we design a new detection head for classifying and refining our proposals. We evaluate our system on three challenging, publicly available datasets and compare it against six methods. The results show substantial improvements of at least $12.6\%$ on small and tiny traffic lights, as well as strong results across all sizes of traffic lights.

- **Summary**: Brain extraction, registration and segmentation are indispensable preprocessing steps in neuroimaging studies. The aim is to extract the brain from raw imaging scans (i.e., extraction step), align it with a target brain image (i.e., registration step) and label the anatomical brain regions (i.e., segmentation step). Conventional studies typically focus on developing separate methods for the extraction, registration and segmentation tasks in a supervised setting. The performance of these methods is largely contingent on the quantity of training samples and the extent of visual inspections carried out by experts for error correction. Nevertheless, collecting voxel-level labels and performing manual quality control on high-dimensional neuroimages (e.g., 3D MRI) are expensive and time-consuming in many medical studies. In this paper, we study the problem of one-shot joint extraction, registration and segmentation in neuroimaging data, which exploits only one labeled template image (a.k.a. atlas) and a few unlabeled raw images for training. We propose a unified end-to-end framework, called JERS, to jointly optimize the extraction, registration and segmentation tasks, allowing feedback among them. Specifically, we use a group of extraction, registration and segmentation modules to learn the extraction mask, transformation and segmentation mask, where modules are interconnected and mutually reinforced by self-supervision. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method performs exceptionally in the extraction, registration and segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: In a joint vision-language space, a text feature (e.g., from "a photo of a dog") could effectively represent its relevant image features (e.g., from dog photos). Also, a recent study has demonstrated the cross-modal transferability phenomenon of this joint space. From these observations, we propose PromptStyler which simulates various distribution shifts in the joint space by synthesizing diverse styles via prompts without using any images to deal with source-free domain generalization. The proposed method learns to generate a variety of style features (from "a S* style of a") via learnable style word vectors for pseudo-words S*. To ensure that learned styles do not distort content information, we force style-content features (from "a S* style of a [class]") to be located nearby their corresponding content features (from "[class]") in the joint vision-language space. After learning style word vectors, we train a linear classifier using synthesized style-content features. PromptStyler achieves the state of the art on PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DomainNet, even though it does not require any images for training.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative AI have brought incredible breakthroughs in several areas, including medical imaging. These generative models have tremendous potential not only to help safely share medical data via synthetic datasets but also to perform an array of diverse applications, such as anomaly detection, image-to-image translation, denoising, and MRI reconstruction. However, due to the complexity of these models, their implementation and reproducibility can be difficult. This complexity can hinder progress, act as a use barrier, and dissuade the comparison of new methods with existing works. In this study, we present MONAI Generative Models, a freely available open-source platform that allows researchers and developers to easily train, evaluate, and deploy generative models and related applications. Our platform reproduces state-of-art studies in a standardised way involving different architectures (such as diffusion models, autoregressive transformers, and GANs), and provides pre-trained models for the community. We have implemented these models in a generalisable fashion, illustrating that their results can be extended to 2D or 3D scenarios, including medical images with different modalities (like CT, MRI, and X-Ray data) and from different anatomical areas. Finally, we adopt a modular and extensible approach, ensuring long-term maintainability and the extension of current applications for future features.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in surgical computer vision applications have been driven by fully-supervised methods, primarily using only visual data. These methods rely on manually annotated surgical videos to predict a fixed set of object categories, limiting their generalizability to unseen surgical procedures and downstream tasks. In this work, we put forward the idea that the surgical video lectures available through open surgical e-learning platforms can provide effective supervisory signals for multi-modal representation learning without relying on manual annotations. We address the surgery-specific linguistic challenges present in surgical video lectures by employing multiple complementary automatic speech recognition systems to generate text transcriptions. We then present a novel method, SurgVLP - Surgical Vision Language Pre-training, for multi-modal representation learning. SurgVLP constructs a new contrastive learning objective to align video clip embeddings with the corresponding multiple text embeddings by bringing them together within a joint latent space. To effectively show the representation capability of the learned joint latent space, we introduce several vision-and-language tasks for surgery, such as text-based video retrieval, temporal activity grounding, and video captioning, as benchmarks for evaluation. We further demonstrate that without using any labeled ground truth, our approach can be employed for traditional vision-only surgical downstream tasks, such as surgical tool, phase, and triplet recognition.

- **Summary**: Recommender Systems have become crucial in the modern world, commonly guiding users towards relevant content or products, and having a large influence over the decisions of users and citizens. However, ensuring transparency and user trust in these systems remains a challenge; personalized explanations have emerged as a solution, offering justifications for recommendations. Among the existing approaches for generating personalized explanations, using visual content created by the users is one particularly promising option, showing a potential to maximize transparency and user trust. Existing models for explaining recommendations in this context face limitations: sustainability has been a critical concern, as they often require substantial computational resources, leading to significant carbon emissions comparable to the Recommender Systems where they would be integrated. Moreover, most models employ surrogate learning goals that do not align with the objective of ranking the most effective personalized explanations for a given recommendation, leading to a suboptimal learning process and larger model sizes. To address these limitations, we present BRIE, a novel model designed to tackle the existing challenges by adopting a more adequate learning goal based on Bayesian Pairwise Ranking, enabling it to achieve consistently superior performance than state-of-the-art models in six real-world datasets, while exhibiting remarkable efficiency, emitting up to 75% less CO${_2}$ during training and inference with a model up to 64 times smaller than previous approaches.

- **Summary**: Images captured in dusty environments suffering from poor visibility and quality. Enhancement of these images such as sand dust images plays a critical role in various atmospheric optics applications. In this work, proposed a new model based on Color Correction and new membership function to enhance san dust images. The proposed model consists of three phases: correction of color shift, removal of haze, and enhancement of contrast and brightness. The color shift is corrected using a new membership function to adjust the values of U and V in the YUV color space. The Adaptive Dark Channel Prior (A-DCP) is used for haze removal. The stretching contrast and improving image brightness are based on Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). The proposed model tests and evaluates through many real sand dust images. The experimental results show that the proposed solution is outperformed the current studies in terms of effectively removing the red and yellow cast and provides high quality and quantity dust images.

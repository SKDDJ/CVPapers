- **Summary**: In this work, a denoising Cycle-GAN (Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network) is implemented to yield high-field, high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images from simulated low-field, low resolution, low SNR MRI images. Resampling and additive Rician noise were used to simulate low-field MRI. Images were utilized to train a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) and a Cycle-GAN, with paired and unpaired cases. Both networks were evaluated using SSIM and PSNR image quality metrics. This work demonstrates the use of a generative deep learning model that can outperform classical DAEs to improve low-field MRI images and does not require image pairs.

- **Summary**: 3D human pose estimation has been researched for decades with promising fruits. 3D human pose lifting is one of the promising research directions toward the task where both estimated pose and ground truth pose data are used for training. Existing pose lifting works mainly focus on improving the performance of estimated pose, but they usually underperform when testing on the ground truth pose data. We observe that the performance of the estimated pose can be easily improved by preparing good quality 2D pose, such as fine-tuning the 2D pose or using advanced 2D pose detectors. As such, we concentrate on improving the 3D human pose lifting via ground truth data for the future improvement of more quality estimated pose data. Towards this goal, a simple yet effective model called Global-local Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (GLA-GCN) is proposed in this work. Our GLA-GCN globally models the spatiotemporal structure via a graph representation and backtraces local joint features for 3D human pose estimation via individually connected layers. To validate our model design, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets: Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP. Experimental results show that our GLA-GCN implemented with ground truth 2D poses significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., up to around 3%, 17%, and 14% error reductions on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP, respectively).

- **Summary**: Occupancy prediction tasks focus on the inference of both geometry and semantic labels for each voxel, which is an important perception mission. However, it is still a semantic segmentation task without distinguishing various instances. Further, although some existing works, such as Open-Vocabulary Occupancy (OVO), have already solved the problem of open vocabulary detection, visual grounding in occupancy has not been solved to the best of our knowledge. To tackle the above two limitations, this paper proposes Occupancy Grounding (OG), a novel method that equips vanilla occupancy instance segmentation ability and could operate visual grounding in a voxel manner with the help of grounded-SAM. Keys to our approach are (1) affinity field prediction for instance clustering and (2) association strategy for aligning 2D instance masks and 3D occupancy instances. Extensive experiments have been conducted whose visualization results and analysis are shown below. Our code will be publicly released soon.

  ICIP) 2023
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a conceptually simple and thus fast multi-object tracking (MOT) model that does not require any attached modules, such as the Kalman filter, Hungarian algorithm, transformer blocks, or graph networks. Conventional MOT models are built upon the multi-step modules listed above, and thus the computational cost is high. Our proposed end-to-end MOT model, \textit{TicrossNet}, is composed of a base detector and a cross-attention module only. As a result, the overhead of tracking does not increase significantly even when the number of instances ($N_t$) increases. We show that TicrossNet runs \textit{in real-time}; specifically, it achieves 32.6 FPS on MOT17 and 31.0 FPS on MOT20 (Tesla V100), which includes as many as $>$100 instances per frame. We also demonstrate that TicrossNet is robust to $N_t$; thus, it does not have to change the size of the base detector, depending on $N_t$, as is often done by other models for real-time processing.

- **Summary**: Mitosis detection is one of the fundamental tasks in computational pathology, which is extremely challenging due to the heterogeneity of mitotic cell. Most of the current studies solve the heterogeneity in the technical aspect by increasing the model complexity. However, lacking consideration of the biological knowledge and the complex model design may lead to the overfitting problem while limited the generalizability of the detection model. In this paper, we systematically study the morphological appearances in different mitotic phases as well as the ambiguous non-mitotic cells and identify that balancing the data and feature diversity can achieve better generalizability. Based on this observation, we propose a novel generalizable framework (MitDet) for mitosis detection. The data diversity is considered by the proposed diversity-guided sample balancing (DGSB). And the feature diversity is preserved by inter- and intra- class feature diversity-preserved module (InCDP). Stain enhancement (SE) module is introduced to enhance the domain-relevant diversity of both data and features simultaneously. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms all the SOTA approaches in several popular mitosis detection datasets in both internal and external test sets using minimal annotation efforts with point annotations only. Comprehensive ablation studies have also proven the effectiveness of the rethinking of data and feature diversity balancing. By analyzing the results quantitatively and qualitatively, we believe that our proposed model not only achieves SOTA performance but also might inspire the future studies in new perspectives.

### FreeSeed: Frequency-band-aware and Self-guided Network for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction

- **Summary**: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a promising solution for expediting the scanning process and mitigating radiation exposure to patients, the reconstructed images, however, contain severe streak artifacts, compromising subsequent screening and diagnosis. Recently, deep learning-based image post-processing methods along with their dual-domain counterparts have shown promising results. However, existing methods usually produce over-smoothed images with loss of details due to (1) the difficulty in accurately modeling the artifact patterns in the image domain, and (2) the equal treatment of each pixel in the loss function. To address these issues, we concentrate on the image post-processing and propose a simple yet effective FREquency-band-awarE and SElf-guidED network, termed FreeSeed, which can effectively remove artifact and recover missing detail from the contaminated sparse-view CT images. Specifically, we first propose a frequency-band-aware artifact modeling network (FreeNet), which learns artifact-related frequency-band attention in Fourier domain for better modeling the globally distributed streak artifact on the sparse-view CT images. We then introduce a self-guided artifact refinement network (SeedNet), which leverages the predicted artifact to assist FreeNet in continuing to refine the severely corrupted details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FreeSeed and its dual-domain counterpart over the state-of-the-art sparse-view CT reconstruction methods.

- **Summary**: The recent neural surface reconstruction by volume rendering approaches have made much progress by achieving impressive surface reconstruction quality, but are still limited to dense and highly accurate posed views. To overcome such drawbacks, this paper pays special attention on the consistent surface reconstruction from sparse views with noisy camera poses. Unlike previous approaches, the key difference of this paper is to exploit the multi-view constraints directly from the explicit geometry of the neural surface, which can be used as effective regularization to jointly learn the neural surface and refine the camera poses. To build effective multi-view constraints, we introduce a fast differentiable on-surface intersection to generate on-surface points, and propose view-consistent losses based on such differentiable points to regularize the neural surface learning. Based on this point, we propose a jointly learning strategy for neural surface and camera poses, named SC-NeuS, to perform geometry-consistent surface reconstruction in an end-to-end manner. With extensive evaluation on public datasets, our SC-NeuS can achieve consistently better surface reconstruction results with fine-grained details than previous state-of-the-art neural surface reconstruction approaches, especially from sparse and noisy camera views.

- **Summary**: It is necessary to analyze the whole-body kinematics (including joint locations and joint angles) to assess risks of fatal and musculoskeletal injuries in occupational tasks. Human pose estimation has gotten more attention in recent years as a method to minimize the errors in determining joint locations. However, the joint angles are not often estimated, nor is the quality of joint angle estimation assessed. In this paper, we presented an end-to-end approach on direct joint angle estimation from multi-view images. Our method leveraged the volumetric pose representation and mapped the rotation representation to a continuous space where each rotation was uniquely represented. We also presented a new kinematic dataset in the domain of residential roofing with a data processing pipeline to generate necessary annotations for the supervised training procedure on direct joint angle estimation. We achieved a mean angle error of $7.19^\circ$ on the new Roofing dataset and $8.41^\circ$ on the Human3.6M dataset, paving the way for employment of on-site kinematic analysis using multi-view images.



### Rectifying Noisy Labels with Sequential Prior: Multi-Scale Temporal Feature Affinity Learning for Robust Video Segmentation

- **Summary**: Noisy label problems are inevitably in existence within medical image segmentation causing severe performance degradation. Previous segmentation methods for noisy label problems only utilize a single image while the potential of leveraging the correlation between images has been overlooked. Especially for video segmentation, adjacent frames contain rich contextual information beneficial in cognizing noisy labels. Based on two insights, we propose a Multi-Scale Temporal Feature Affinity Learning (MS-TFAL) framework to resolve noisy-labeled medical video segmentation issues. First, we argue the sequential prior of videos is an effective reference, i.e., pixel-level features from adjacent frames are close in distance for the same class and far in distance otherwise. Therefore, Temporal Feature Affinity Learning (TFAL) is devised to indicate possible noisy labels by evaluating the affinity between pixels in two adjacent frames. We also notice that the noise distribution exhibits considerable variations across video, image, and pixel levels. In this way, we introduce Multi-Scale Supervision (MSS) to supervise the network from three different perspectives by re-weighting and refining the samples. This design enables the network to concentrate on clean samples in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments with both synthetic and real-world label noise demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art robust segmentation approaches.

- **Summary**: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown remarkable results on various image synthesis tasks such as text-to-image generation and image inpainting. However, compared to other generative methods like VAEs and GANs, DPMs lack a low-dimensional, interpretable, and well-decoupled latent code. Recently, diffusion autoencoders (Diff-AE) were proposed to explore the potential of DPMs for representation learning via autoencoding. Diff-AE provides an accessible latent space that exhibits remarkable interpretability, allowing us to manipulate image attributes based on latent codes from the space. However, previous works are not generic as they only operated on a few limited attributes. To further explore the latent space of Diff-AE and achieve a generic editing pipeline, we proposed a module called Group-supervised AutoEncoder(dubbed GAE) for Diff-AE to achieve better disentanglement on the latent code. Our proposed GAE has trained via an attribute-swap strategy to acquire the latent codes for multi-attribute image manipulation based on examples. We empirically demonstrate that our method enables multiple-attributes manipulation and achieves convincing sample quality and attribute alignments, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based approaches for representational decoupling. Code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques often perform poorly in the presence of domain shift, where the test data follows a different distribution than the training data. The most practically desirable approach to address this issue is Single Domain Generalization (S-DG), which aims to train robust models using data from a single source. Prior work on S-DG has primarily focused on using data augmentation techniques to generate diverse training data. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach by investigating the robustness of linear operators, such as convolution and dense layers commonly used in deep learning. We propose a novel operator called XCNorm that computes the normalized cross-correlation between weights and an input feature patch. This approach is invariant to both affine shifts and changes in energy within a local feature patch and eliminates the need for commonly used non-linear activation functions. We show that deep neural networks composed of this operator are robust to common semantic distribution shifts. Furthermore, our empirical results on single-domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed technique performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The virtual viewpoint is perceived as a new technique in virtual navigation, as yet not supported due to the lack of depth information and obscure camera parameters. In this paper, a method for achieving close-up virtual view is proposed and it only uses optical flow to build parallax effects to realize pseudo 3D projection without using depth sensor. We develop a bidirectional optical flow method to obtain any virtual viewpoint by proportional interpolation of optical flow. Moreover, with the ingenious application of the optical-flow-value, we achieve clear and visual-fidelity magnified results through lens stretching in any corner, which overcomes the visual distortion and image blur through viewpoint magnification and transition in Google Street View system.

- **Summary**: The modeling of spatiotemporal brain dynamics from high-dimensional data, such as 4D functional MRI, is a formidable task in neuroscience. To address this challenge, we present SwiFT (Swin 4D fMRI Transformer), a Swin Transformer architecture that can learn brain dynamics directly from 4D functional brain MRI data in a memory and computation-efficient manner. SwiFT achieves this by implementing a 4D window multi-head self-attention mechanism and absolute positional embeddings. We evaluate SwiFT using multiple largest-scale human functional brain imaging datasets in tasks such as predicting sex, age, and cognitive intelligence. Our experimental outcomes reveal that SwiFT consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models. To the best of our knowledge, SwiFT is the first Swin Transformer architecture that can process dimensional spatiotemporal brain functional data in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, due to the end-to-end learning capability, we also show that contrastive loss-based self-supervised pre-training of SwiFT is also feasible for achieving improved performance on a downstream task. We believe that our work holds substantial potential in facilitating scalable learning of functional brain imaging in neuroscience research by reducing the hurdles associated with applying Transformer models to high-dimensional fMRI.

- **Summary**: Contrastive language-image Pre-training (CLIP) [13] can leverage large datasets of unlabeled Image-Text pairs, which have demonstrated impressive performance in various downstream tasks. Given that annotating medical data is time-consuming and laborious, Image-Text Pre-training has promising applications in exploiting large-scale medical image and radiology report datasets. However, medical Image-Text Pre-training faces several challenges, as follows: (1) Due to privacy concerns, the amount of available medical data is relatively small compared to natural data, leading to weaker generalization ability of the model. (2) Medical images are highly similar with only fine-grained differences in subtleties, resulting in a large number of false-negative sample pairs in comparison learning. (3) The hand-crafted Prompt usually differs from the natural medical image report, Subtle changes in wording can lead to significant differences in performance. In this paper, we propose a unified Image-Text-Label contrastive learning framework based on continuous prompts, with three main contributions. First, We unified the data of images, text, and labels, which greatly expanded the training data that the model could utilize. Second, we address the issue of data diversity and the impact of hand-crafted prompts on model performance by introducing continuous implicit prompts. Lastly, we propose a ImageText-Label contrastive Training to mitigate the problem of too many false-negative samples. We demonstrate through sufficient experiments that the Unified Medical Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework exhibits excellent performance on several downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Automated radiology report generation aims to generate radiology reports that contain rich, fine-grained descriptions of radiology imaging. Compared with image captioning in the natural image domain, medical images are very similar to each other, with only minor differences in the occurrence of diseases. Given the importance of these minor differences in the radiology report, it is crucial to encourage the model to focus more on the subtle regions of disease occurrence. Secondly, the problem of visual and textual data biases is serious. Not only do normal cases make up the majority of the dataset, but sentences describing areas with pathological changes also constitute only a small part of the paragraph. Lastly, generating medical image reports involves the challenge of long text generation, which requires more expertise and empirical training in medical knowledge. As a result, the difficulty of generating such reports is increased. To address these challenges, we propose a disease-oriented retrieval framework that utilizes similar reports as prior knowledge references. We design a factual consistency captioning generator to generate more accurate and factually consistent disease descriptions. Our framework can find most similar reports for a given disease from the CXR database by retrieving a disease-oriented mask consisting of the position and morphological characteristics. By referencing the disease-oriented similar report and the visual features, the factual consistency model can generate a more accurate radiology report.

- **Summary**: Aphids are one of the main threats to crops, rural families, and global food security. Chemical pest control is a necessary component of crop production for maximizing yields, however, it is unnecessary to apply the chemical approaches to the entire fields in consideration of the environmental pollution and the cost. Thus, accurately localizing the aphid and estimating the infestation level is crucial to the precise local application of pesticides. Aphid detection is very challenging as each individual aphid is really small and all aphids are crowded together as clusters. In this paper, we propose to estimate the infection level by detecting aphid clusters. We have taken millions of images in the sorghum fields, manually selected 5,447 images that contain aphids, and annotated each aphid cluster in the image. To use these images for machine learning models, we crop the images into patches and created a labeled dataset with over 151,000 image patches. Then, we implement and compare the performance of four state-of-the-art object detection models.

- **Summary**: Emotion recognition is an important research direction in artificial intelligence, helping machines understand and adapt to human emotional states. Multimodal electrophysiological(ME) signals, such as EEG, GSR, respiration(Resp), and temperature(Temp), are effective biomarkers for reflecting changes in human emotions. However, using electrophysiological signals for emotion recognition faces challenges such as data scarcity, inconsistent labeling, and difficulty in cross-individual generalization. To address these issues, we propose ME-MHACL, a self-supervised contrastive learning-based multimodal emotion recognition method that can learn meaningful feature representations from unlabeled electrophysiological signals and use multi-head attention mechanisms for feature fusion to improve recognition performance. Our method includes two stages: first, we use the Meiosis method to group sample and augment unlabeled electrophysiological signals and design a self-supervised contrastive learning task; second, we apply the trained feature extractor to labeled electrophysiological signals and use multi-head attention mechanisms for feature fusion. We conducted experiments on two public datasets, DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI, and our method outperformed existing benchmark methods in emotion recognition tasks and had good cross-individual generalization ability.

- **Summary**: CLIPStyler demonstrated image style transfer with realistic textures using only a style text description (instead of requiring a reference style image). However, the ground semantics of objects in the style transfer output is lost due to style spill-over on salient and background objects (content mismatch) or over-stylization. To solve this, we propose Semantic CLIPStyler (Sem-CS), that performs semantic style transfer. Sem-CS first segments the content image into salient and non-salient objects and then transfers artistic style based on a given style text description. The semantic style transfer is achieved using global foreground loss (for salient objects) and global background loss (for non-salient objects). Our empirical results, including DISTS, NIMA and user study scores, show that our proposed framework yields superior qualitative and quantitative performance.

- **Summary**: Although domestic service robots are expected to assist individuals who require support, they cannot currently interact smoothly with people through natural language. For example, given the instruction "Bring me a bottle from the kitchen," it is difficult for such robots to specify the bottle in an indoor environment. Most conventional models have been trained on real-world datasets that are labor-intensive to collect, and they have not fully leveraged simulation data through a transfer learning framework. In this study, we propose a novel transfer learning approach for multimodal language understanding called Prototypical Contrastive Transfer Learning (PCTL), which uses a new contrastive loss called Dual ProtoNCE. We introduce PCTL to the task of identifying target objects in domestic environments according to free-form natural language instructions. To validate PCTL, we built new real-world and simulation datasets. Our experiment demonstrated that PCTL outperformed existing methods. Specifically, PCTL achieved an accuracy of 78.1%, whereas simple fine-tuning achieved an accuracy of 73.4%.

- **Summary**: We introduce YOGA, a deep learning based yet lightweight object detection model that can operate on low-end edge devices while still achieving competitive accuracy. The YOGA architecture consists of a two-phase feature learning pipeline with a cheap linear transformation, which learns feature maps using only half of the convolution filters required by conventional convolutional neural networks. In addition, it performs multi-scale feature fusion in its neck using an attention mechanism instead of the naive concatenation used by conventional detectors. YOGA is a flexible model that can be easily scaled up or down by several orders of magnitude to fit a broad range of hardware constraints. We evaluate YOGA on COCO-val and COCO-testdev datasets with other over 10 state-of-the-art object detectors. The results show that YOGA strikes the best trade-off between model size and accuracy (up to 22% increase of AP and 23-34% reduction of parameters and FLOPs), making it an ideal choice for deployment in the wild on low-end edge devices. This is further affirmed by our hardware implementation and evaluation on NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

- **Summary**: Language-Guided Robotic Manipulation (LGRM) is a challenging task as it requires a robot to understand human instructions to manipulate everyday objects. Recent approaches in LGRM rely on pre-trained Visual Grounding (VG) models to detect objects without adapting to manipulation environments. This results in a performance drop due to a substantial domain gap between the pre-training and real-world data. A straightforward solution is to collect additional training data, but the cost of human-annotation is extortionate. In this paper, we propose Grounding Vision to Ceaselessly Created Instructions (GVCCI), a lifelong learning framework for LGRM, which continuously learns VG without human supervision. GVCCI iteratively generates synthetic instruction via object detection and trains the VG model with the generated data. We validate our framework in offline and online settings across diverse environments on different VG models. Experimental results show that accumulating synthetic data from GVCCI leads to a steady improvement in VG by up to 56.7% and improves resultant LGRM by up to 29.4%. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis shows that the unadapted VG model often fails to find correct objects due to a strong bias learned from the pre-training data. Finally, we introduce a novel VG dataset for LGRM, consisting of nearly 252k triplets of image-object-instruction from diverse manipulation environments.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are shown to possess a wealth of actionable knowledge that can be extracted for robot manipulation in the form of reasoning and planning. Despite the progress, most still rely on pre-defined motion primitives to carry out the physical interactions with the environment, which remains a major bottleneck. In this work, we aim to synthesize robot trajectories, i.e., a dense sequence of 6-DoF end-effector waypoints, for a large variety of manipulation tasks given an open-set of instructions and an open-set of objects. We achieve this by first observing that LLMs excel at inferring affordances and constraints given a free-form language instruction. More importantly, by leveraging their code-writing capabilities, they can interact with a visual-language model (VLM) to compose 3D value maps to ground the knowledge into the observation space of the agent. The composed value maps are then used in a model-based planning framework to zero-shot synthesize closed-loop robot trajectories with robustness to dynamic perturbations. We further demonstrate how the proposed framework can benefit from online experiences by efficiently learning a dynamics model for scenes that involve contact-rich interactions. We present a large-scale study of the proposed method in both simulated and real-robot environments, showcasing the ability to perform a large variety of everyday manipulation tasks specified in free-form natural language.

- **Summary**: Large-scale image generation models, with impressive quality made possible by the vast amount of data available on the Internet, raise social concerns that these models may generate harmful or copyrighted content. The biases and harmfulness arise throughout the entire training process and are hard to completely remove, which have become significant hurdles to the safe deployment of these models. In this paper, we propose a method called SDD to prevent problematic content generation in text-to-image diffusion models. We self-distill the diffusion model to guide the noise estimate conditioned on the target removal concept to match the unconditional one. Compared to the previous methods, our method eliminates a much greater proportion of harmful content from the generated images without degrading the overall image quality. Furthermore, our method allows the removal of multiple concepts at once, whereas previous works are limited to removing a single concept at a time.

- **Summary**: Transformers have significantly impacted domains like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, where they improve performance compared to other neural networks. This survey explores how transformers are used in reinforcement learning (RL), where they are seen as a promising solution for addressing challenges such as unstable training, credit assignment, lack of interpretability, and partial observability. We begin by providing a brief domain overview of RL, followed by a discussion on the challenges of classical RL algorithms. Next, we delve into the properties of the transformer and its variants and discuss the characteristics that make them well-suited to address the challenges inherent in RL. We examine the application of transformers to various aspects of RL, including representation learning, transition and reward function modeling, and policy optimization. We also discuss recent research that aims to enhance the interpretability and efficiency of transformers in RL, using visualization techniques and efficient training strategies. Often, the transformer architecture must be tailored to the specific needs of a given application. We present a broad overview of how transformers have been adapted for several applications, including robotics, medicine, language modeling, cloud computing, and combinatorial optimization. We conclude by discussing the limitations of using transformers in RL and assess their potential for catalyzing future breakthroughs in this field.

- **Summary**: This paper deploys and explores variants of TinyissimoYOLO, a highly flexible and fully quantized ultra-lightweight object detection network designed for edge systems with a power envelope of a few milliwatts. With experimental measurements, we present a comprehensive characterization of the network's detection performance, exploring the impact of various parameters, including input resolution, number of object classes, and hidden layer adjustments. We deploy variants of TinyissimoYOLO on state-of-the-art ultra-low-power extreme edge platforms, presenting an in-depth a comparison on latency, energy efficiency, and their ability to efficiently parallelize the workload. In particular, the paper presents a comparison between a novel parallel RISC-V processor (GAP9 from Greenwaves) with and without use of its on-chip hardware accelerator, an ARM Cortex-M7 core (STM32H7 from ST Microelectronics), two ARM Cortex-M4 cores (STM32L4 from STM and Apollo4b from Ambiq), and a multi-core platform with a CNN hardware accelerator (Analog Devices MAX78000). Experimental results show that the GAP9's hardware accelerator achieves the lowest inference latency and energy at 2.12ms and 150uJ respectively, which is around 2x faster and 20% more efficient than the next best platform, the MAX78000. The hardware accelerator of GAP9 can even run an increased resolution version of TinyissimoYOLO with 112x112 pixels and 10 detection classes within 3.2ms, consuming 245uJ. To showcase the competitiveness of a versatile general-purpose system we also deployed and profiled a multi-core implementation on GAP9 at different operating points, achieving 11.3ms with the lowest-latency and 490uJ with the most energy-efficient configuration. With this paper, we demonstrate the suitability and flexibility of TinyissimoYOLO on state-of-the-art detection datasets for real-time ultra-low-power edge inference.

- **Summary**: Efficiently selecting an appropriate spike stream data length to extract precise information is the key to the spike vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic timing representation for spike streams. Based on multi-layers architecture, it applies dilated convolutions on temporal dimension to extract features on multi-temporal scales with few parameters. And we design layer attention to dynamically fuse these features. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data. In addition, to verify the robustness, we also build a spike-based synthetic validation dataset for extreme scenarios in autonomous driving, denoted as SSES dataset. It consists of various corner cases. Experiments show that our method can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes. For instance, our method gets $15\%$ and $19\%$ error reduction from the best spike-based work, SCFlow, in $\Delta t=10$ and $\Delta t=20$ respectively which are the same settings as the previous works.

- **Summary**: The pretrain-finetune paradigm usually improves downstream performance over training a model from scratch on the same task, becoming commonplace across many areas of machine learning. While pretraining is empirically observed to be beneficial for a range of tasks, there is not a clear understanding yet of the reasons for this effect. In this work, we examine the relationship between pretrained vision transformers and the corresponding finetuned versions on several benchmark datasets and tasks. We present new metrics that specifically investigate the degree to which invariances learned by a pretrained model are retained or forgotten during finetuning. Using these metrics, we present a suite of empirical findings, including that pretraining induces transferable invariances in shallow layers and that invariances from deeper pretrained layers are compressed towards shallower layers during finetuning. Together, these findings contribute to understanding some of the reasons for the successes of pretrained models and the changes that a pretrained model undergoes when finetuned on a downstream task.

- **Summary**: eXplanation Based Learning (XBL) is a form of Interactive Machine Learning (IML) that provides a model refining approach via user feedback collected on model explanations. Although the interactivity of XBL promotes model transparency, XBL requires a huge amount of user interaction and can become expensive as feedback is in the form of detailed annotation rather than simple category labelling which is more common in IML. This expense is exacerbated in high stakes domains such as medical image classification. To reduce the effort and expense of XBL we introduce a new approach that uses two input instances and their corresponding Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) model explanations as exemplary explanations to implement XBL. Using a medical image classification task, we demonstrate that, using minimal human input, our approach produces improved explanations (+0.02, +3%) and achieves reduced classification performance (-0.04, -4%) when compared against a model trained without interactions.

- **Summary**: Accurately recovering the dense 3D mesh of both hands from monocular images poses considerable challenges due to occlusions and projection ambiguity. Most of the existing methods extract features from color images to estimate the root-aligned hand meshes, which neglect the crucial depth and scale information in the real world. Given the noisy sensor measurements with limited resolution, depth-based methods predict 3D keypoints rather than a dense mesh. These limitations motivate us to take advantage of these two complementary inputs to acquire dense hand meshes on a real-world scale. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for recovering dense meshes for both hands, which employ single-view RGB-D image pairs as input. The primary challenge lies in effectively utilizing two different input modalities to mitigate the blurring effects in RGB images and noises in depth images. Instead of directly treating depth maps as additional channels for RGB images, we encode the depth information into the unordered point cloud to preserve more geometric details. Specifically, our framework employs ResNet50 and PointNet++ to derive features from RGB and point cloud, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a novel pyramid deep fusion network (PDFNet) to aggregate features at different scales, which demonstrates superior efficacy compared to previous fusion strategies. Furthermore, we employ a GCN-based decoder to process the fused features and recover the corresponding 3D pose and dense mesh. Through comprehensive ablation experiments, we have not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed fusion algorithm but also outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches on publicly available datasets. To reproduce the results, we will make our source code and models publicly available at {\url{https://github.com/zijinxuxu/PDFNet}}.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a simplified variation of the PaDiM (Pixel-Wise Anomaly Detection through Instance Modeling) method for anomaly detection in images, fitting a single multivariate Gaussian (MVG) distribution to the feature vectors extracted from a backbone convolutional neural network (CNN) and using their Mahalanobis distance as the anomaly score. We introduce an intermediate step in this framework by applying a whitening transformation to the feature vectors, which enables the generation of heatmaps capable of visually explaining the features learned by the MVG. The proposed technique is evaluated on the MVTec-AD dataset, and the results show the importance of visual model validation, providing insights into issues in this framework that were otherwise invisible. The visualizations generated for this paper are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7937978.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel approach called Operational Support Estimator Networks (OSENs) for the support estimation task. Support Estimation (SE) is defined as finding the locations of non-zero elements in a sparse signal. By its very nature, the mapping between the measurement and sparse signal is a non-linear operation. Traditional support estimators rely on computationally expensive iterative signal recovery techniques to achieve such non-linearity. Contrary to the convolution layers, the proposed OSEN approach consists of operational layers that can learn such complex non-linearities without the need for deep networks. In this way, the performance of the non-iterative support estimation is greatly improved. Moreover, the operational layers comprise so-called generative \textit{super neurons} with non-local kernels. The kernel location for each neuron/feature map is optimized jointly for the SE task during the training. We evaluate the OSENs in three different applications: i. support estimation from Compressive Sensing (CS) measurements, ii. representation-based classification, and iii. learning-aided CS reconstruction where the output of OSENs is used as prior knowledge to the CS algorithm for an enhanced reconstruction. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves computational efficiency and outperforms competing methods, especially at low measurement rates by a significant margin. The software implementation is publicly shared at https://github.com/meteahishali/OSEN.

- **Summary**: Incremental decision making in real-world environments is one of the most challenging tasks in embodied artificial intelligence. One particularly demanding scenario is Vision and Language Navigation~(VLN) which requires visual and natural language understanding as well as spatial and temporal reasoning capabilities. The embodied agent needs to ground its understanding of navigation instructions in observations of a real-world environment like Street View. Despite the impressive results of LLMs in other research areas, it is an ongoing problem of how to best connect them with an interactive visual environment. In this work, we propose VELMA, an embodied LLM agent that uses a verbalization of the trajectory and of visual environment observations as contextual prompt for the next action. Visual information is verbalized by a pipeline that extracts landmarks from the human written navigation instructions and uses CLIP to determine their visibility in the current panorama view. We show that VELMA is able to successfully follow navigation instructions in Street View with only two in-context examples. We further finetune the LLM agent on a few thousand examples and achieve 25%-30% relative improvement in task completion over the previous state-of-the-art for two datasets.

- **Summary**: Motivated by the efficiency investigation of the Tranformer-based transform coding framework, namely SwinT-ChARM, we propose to enhance the latter, as first, with a more straightforward yet effective Tranformer-based channel-wise auto-regressive prior model, resulting in an absolute image compression transformer (ICT). Current methods that still rely on ConvNet-based entropy coding are limited in long-range modeling dependencies due to their local connectivity and an increasing number of architectural biases and priors. On the contrary, the proposed ICT can capture both global and local contexts from the latent representations and better parameterize the distribution of the quantized latents. Further, we leverage a learnable scaling module with a sandwich ConvNeXt-based pre/post-processor to accurately extract more compact latent representation while reconstructing higher-quality images. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets showed that the proposed adaptive image compression transformer (AICT) framework significantly improves the trade-off between coding efficiency and decoder complexity over the versatile video coding (VVC) reference encoder (VTM-18.0) and the neural codec SwinT-ChARM.

- **Summary**: Glass-like objects are widespread in daily life but remain intractable to be segmented for most existing methods. The transparent property makes it difficult to be distinguished from background, while the tiny separation boundary further impedes the acquisition of their exact contour. In this paper, by revealing the key co-evolution demand of semantic and boundary learning, we propose a Selective Mutual Evolution (SME) module to enable the reciprocal feature learning between them. Then to exploit the global shape context, we propose a Structurally Attentive Refinement (SAR) module to conduct a fine-grained feature refinement for those ambiguous points around the boundary. Finally, to further utilize the multi-scale representation, we integrate the above two modules into a cascaded structure and then introduce a Reciprocal Feature Evolution Network (RFENet) for effective glass-like object segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RFENet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular public datasets.

- **Summary**: Over the last few years, neural image compression has gained wide attention from research and industry, yielding promising end-to-end deep neural codecs outperforming their conventional counterparts in rate-distortion performance. Despite significant advancement, current methods, including attention-based transform coding, still need to be improved in reducing the coding rate while preserving the reconstruction fidelity, especially in non-homogeneous textured image areas. Those models also require more parameters and a higher decoding time. To tackle the above challenges, we propose ConvNeXt-ChARM, an efficient ConvNeXt-based transform coding framework, paired with a compute-efficient channel-wise auto-regressive prior to capturing both global and local contexts from the hyper and quantized latent representations. The proposed architecture can be optimized end-to-end to fully exploit the context information and extract compact latent representation while reconstructing higher-quality images. Experimental results on four widely-used datasets showed that ConvNeXt-ChARM brings consistent and significant BD-rate (PSNR) reductions estimated on average to 5.24% and 1.22% over the versatile video coding (VVC) reference encoder (VTM-18.0) and the state-of-the-art learned image compression method SwinT-ChARM, respectively. Moreover, we provide model scaling studies to verify the computational efficiency of our approach and conduct several objective and subjective analyses to bring to the fore the performance gap between the next generation ConvNet, namely ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer.

- **Summary**: Automatic tree density estimation and counting using single aerial and satellite images is a challenging task in photogrammetry and remote sensing, yet has an important role in forest management. In this paper, we propose the first semisupervised transformer-based framework for tree counting which reduces the expensive tree annotations for remote sensing images. Our method, termed as TreeFormer, first develops a pyramid tree representation module based on transformer blocks to extract multi-scale features during the encoding stage. Contextual attention-based feature fusion and tree density regressor modules are further designed to utilize the robust features from the encoder to estimate tree density maps in the decoder. Moreover, we propose a pyramid learning strategy that includes local tree density consistency and local tree count ranking losses to utilize unlabeled images into the training process. Finally, the tree counter token is introduced to regulate the network by computing the global tree counts for both labeled and unlabeled images. Our model was evaluated on two benchmark tree counting datasets, Jiangsu, and Yosemite, as well as a new dataset, KCL-London, created by ourselves. Our TreeFormer outperforms the state of the art semi-supervised methods under the same setting and exceeds the fully-supervised methods using the same number of labeled images.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an innovative approach to student identification during exams and knowledge tests, which overcomes the limitations of the traditional personal information entry method. The proposed method employs a matrix template on the designated section of the exam, where squares containing numbers are selectively blackened. The methodology involves the development of a neural network specifically designed for recognizing students' personal identification numbers. The neural network utilizes a specially adapted U-Net architecture, trained on an extensive dataset comprising images of blackened tables. The network demonstrates proficiency in recognizing the patterns and arrangement of blackened squares, accurately interpreting the information inscribed within them. Additionally, the model exhibits high accuracy in correctly identifying entered student personal numbers and effectively detecting erroneous entries within the table. This approach offers multiple advantages. Firstly, it significantly accelerates the exam marking process by automatically extracting identifying information from the blackened tables, eliminating the need for manual entry and minimizing the potential for errors. Secondly, the method automates the identification process, thereby reducing administrative effort and expediting data processing. The introduction of this innovative identification system represents a notable advancement in the field of exams and knowledge tests, replacing the conventional manual entry of personal data with a streamlined, efficient, and accurate identification process.

- **Summary**: Light field is a type of image data that captures the 3D scene information by recording light rays emitted from a scene at various orientations. It offers a more immersive perception than classic 2D images but at the cost of huge data volume. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the visual characteristics of Sub-Aperture Images (SAIs) of light field and design a compact neural network representation for the light field compression task. The network backbone takes randomly initialized noise as input and is supervised on the SAIs of the target light field. It is composed of two types of complementary kernels: descriptive kernels (descriptors) that store scene description information learned during training, and modulatory kernels (modulators) that control the rendering of different SAIs from the queried perspectives. To further enhance compactness of the network meanwhile retain high quality of the decoded light field, we accordingly introduce modulator allocation and kernel tensor decomposition mechanisms, followed by non-uniform quantization and lossless entropy coding techniques, to finally form an efficient compression pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a significant margin in the light field compression task. Moreover, after aligning descriptors, the modulators learned from one light field can be transferred to new light fields for rendering dense views, indicating a potential solution for view synthesis task.

- **Summary**: In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), projections from many angles are acquired and used for 3D reconstruction. To make CT suitable for in-line quality control, reducing the number of angles while maintaining reconstruction quality is necessary. Sparse-angle tomography is a popular approach for obtaining 3D reconstructions from limited data. To optimize its performance, one can adapt scan angles sequentially to select the most informative angles for each scanned object. Mathematically, this corresponds to solving and optimal experimental design (OED) problem. OED problems are high-dimensional, non-convex, bi-level optimization problems that cannot be solved online, i.e., during the scan. To address these challenges, we pose the OED problem as a partially observable Markov decision process in a Bayesian framework, and solve it through deep reinforcement learning. The approach learns efficient non-greedy policies to solve a given class of OED problems through extensive offline training rather than solving a given OED problem directly via numerical optimization. As such, the trained policy can successfully find the most informative scan angles online. We use a policy training method based on the Actor-Critic approach and evaluate its performance on 2D tomography with synthetic data.

- **Summary**: Inner-city intersections are among the most critical traffic areas for injury and fatal accidents. Automated vehicles struggle with the complex and hectic everyday life within those areas. Sensor-equipped smart infrastructures, which can cooperate with vehicles, can benefit automated traffic by extending the perception capabilities of drivers and vehicle perception systems. Additionally, they offer the opportunity to gather reproducible and precise data of a holistic scene understanding, including context information as a basis for training algorithms for various applications in automated traffic. Therefore, we introduce the Infrastructural Multi-Person Trajectory and Context Dataset (IMPTC). We use an intelligent public inner-city intersection in Germany with visual sensor technology. A multi-view camera and LiDAR system perceives traffic situations and road users' behavior. Additional sensors monitor contextual information like weather, lighting, and traffic light signal status. The data acquisition system focuses on Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) and multi-agent interaction. The resulting dataset consists of eight hours of measurement data. It contains over 2,500 VRU trajectories, including pedestrians, cyclists, e-scooter riders, strollers, and wheelchair users, and over 20,000 vehicle trajectories at different day times, weather conditions, and seasons. In addition, to enable the entire stack of research capabilities, the dataset includes all data, starting from the sensor-, calibration- and detection data until trajectory and context data. The dataset is continuously expanded and is available online for non-commercial research at https://github.com/kav-institute/imptc-dataset.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are expected to be capable of reasoning with commonsense knowledge as human beings. One example is that humans can reason where and when an image is taken based on their knowledge. This makes us wonder if, based on visual cues, Vision-Language Models that are pre-trained with large-scale image-text resources can achieve and even outperform human's capability in reasoning times and location. To address this question, we propose a two-stage \recognition\space and \reasoning\space probing task, applied to discriminative and generative VLMs to uncover whether VLMs can recognize times and location-relevant features and further reason about it. To facilitate the investigation, we introduce WikiTiLo, a well-curated image dataset compromising images with rich socio-cultural cues. In the extensive experimental studies, we find that although VLMs can effectively retain relevant features in visual encoders, they still fail to make perfect reasoning. We will release our dataset and codes to facilitate future studies.

- **Summary**: Complex inner-city junctions are among the most critical traffic areas for injury and fatal accidents. The development of highly automated driving (HAD) systems struggles with the complex and hectic everyday life within those areas. Sensor-equipped smart infrastructures, which can communicate and cooperate with vehicles, are essential to enable a holistic scene understanding to resolve occlusions drivers and vehicle perception systems for themselves can not cover. We introduce an intelligent research infrastructure equipped with visual sensor technology, located at a public inner-city junction in Aschaffenburg, Germany. A multiple-view camera system monitors the traffic situation to perceive road users' behavior. Both motorized and non-motorized traffic is considered. The system is used for research in data generation, evaluating new HAD sensors systems, algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) training strategies using real-, synthetic- and augmented data. In addition, the junction features a highly accurate digital twin. Real-world data can be taken into the digital twin for simulation purposes and synthetic data generation.



### Large Class Separation is not what you need for Relational Reasoning-based OOD Detection

- **Summary**: Standard recognition approaches are unable to deal with novel categories at test time. Their overconfidence on the known classes makes the predictions unreliable for safety-critical applications such as healthcare or autonomous driving. Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods provide a solution by identifying semantic novelty. Most of these methods leverage a learning stage on the known data, which means training (or fine-tuning) a model to capture the concept of normality. This process is clearly sensitive to the amount of available samples and might be computationally expensive for on-board systems. A viable alternative is that of evaluating similarities in the embedding space produced by large pre-trained models without any further learning effort. We focus exactly on such a fine-tuning-free OOD detection setting. This works presents an in-depth analysis of the recently introduced relational reasoning pre-training and investigates the properties of the learned embedding, highlighting the existence of a correlation between the inter-class feature distance and the OOD detection accuracy. As the class separation depends on the chosen pre-training objective, we propose an alternative loss function to control the inter-class margin, and we show its advantage with thorough experiments.

- **Summary**: Automatic examination of thin-prep cytologic test (TCT) slides can assist pathologists in finding cervical abnormality for accurate and efficient cancer screening. Current solutions mostly need to localize suspicious cells and classify abnormality based on local patches, concerning the fact that whole slide images of TCT are extremely large. It thus requires many annotations of normal and abnormal cervical cells, to supervise the training of the patch-level classifier for promising performance. In this paper, we propose CellGAN to synthesize cytopathological images of various cervical cell types for augmenting patch-level cell classification. Built upon a lightweight backbone, CellGAN is equipped with a non-linear class mapping network to effectively incorporate cell type information into image generation. We also propose the Skip-layer Global Context module to model the complex spatial relationship of the cells, and attain high fidelity of the synthesized images through adversarial learning. Our experiments demonstrate that CellGAN can produce visually plausible TCT cytopathological images for different cell types. We also validate the effectiveness of using CellGAN to greatly augment patch-level cell classification performance.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Analysis VAE (CA-VAEs) is a family of Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) that aims at separating the common factors of variation between a background dataset (BG) (i.e., healthy subjects) and a target dataset (TG) (i.e., patients) from the ones that only exist in the target dataset. To do so, these methods separate the latent space into a set of salient features (i.e., proper to the target dataset) and a set of common features (i.e., exist in both datasets). Currently, all models fail to prevent the sharing of information between latent spaces effectively and to capture all salient factors of variation. To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: a disentangling term between common and salient representations and a classification term between background and target samples in the salient space. We show a better performance than previous CA-VAEs methods on three medical applications and a natural images dataset (CelebA). Code and datasets are available on GitHub https://github.com/neurospin-projects/2023_rlouiset_sepvae.

- **Summary**: Image noise is ubiquitous in photography. However, image noise is not compressible nor desirable, thus attempting to convey the noise in compressed image bitstreams yields sub-par results in both rate and distortion. We propose to explicitly learn the image denoising task when training a codec. Therefore, we leverage the Natural Image Noise Dataset, which offers a wide variety of scenes captured with various ISO numbers, leading to different noise levels, including insignificant ones. Given this training set, we supervise the codec with noisy-clean image pairs, and show that a single model trained based on a mixture of images with variable noise levels appears to yield best-in-class results with both noisy and clean images, achieving better rate-distortion than a compression-only model or even than a pair of denoising-then-compression models with almost one order of magnitude fewer GMac operations.

- **Summary**: Gastrointestinal endoscopy is a medical procedure that utilizes a flexible tube equipped with a camera and other instruments to examine the digestive tract. This minimally invasive technique allows for diagnosing and managing various gastrointestinal conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and colon cancer. The early detection and identification of lesions in the upper gastrointestinal tract and the identification of malignant polyps that may pose a risk of cancer development are critical components of gastrointestinal endoscopy's diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Therefore, enhancing the detection rates of gastrointestinal disorders can significantly improve a patient's prognosis by increasing the likelihood of timely medical intervention, which may prolong the patient's lifespan and improve overall health outcomes. This paper presents a novel Transformer-based deep neural network designed to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby enabling accurate identification of both upper gastrointestinal tract lesions and colon polyps. Our approach proposes a unique global context-aware module and leverages the powerful MiT backbone, along with a feature alignment block, to enhance the network's representation capability. This novel design leads to a significant improvement in performance across various endoscopic diagnosis tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Due to its superior efficiency in utilizing annotations and addressing gigapixel-sized images, multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown great promise as a framework for whole slide image (WSI) classification in digital pathology diagnosis. However, existing methods tend to focus on advanced aggregators with different structures, often overlooking the intrinsic features of H\&E pathological slides. To address this limitation, we introduced two pathological priors: nuclear heterogeneity of diseased cells and spatial correlation of pathological tiles. Leveraging the former, we proposed a data augmentation method that utilizes stain separation during extractor training via a contrastive learning strategy to obtain instance-level representations. We then described the spatial relationships between the tiles using an adjacency matrix. By integrating these two views, we designed a multi-instance framework for analyzing H\&E-stained tissue images based on pathological inductive bias, encompassing feature extraction, filtering, and aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Camelyon16 breast dataset and TCGA-NSCLC Lung dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively handle tasks related to cancer detection and differentiation of subtypes, outperforming state-of-the-art medical image classification methods based on MIL. The code will be released later.

- **Summary**: Image synthesis has seen significant advancements with the advent of diffusion-based generative models like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and text-to-image diffusion models. Despite their efficacy, there is a dearth of research dedicated to detecting diffusion-generated images, which could pose potential security and privacy risks. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel detection method called Stepwise Error for Diffusion-generated Image Detection (SeDID). Comprising statistical-based $\text{SeDID}_{\text{Stat}}$ and neural network-based $\text{SeDID}_{\text{NNs}}$, SeDID exploits the unique attributes of diffusion models, namely deterministic reverse and deterministic denoising computation errors. Our evaluations demonstrate SeDID's superior performance over existing methods when applied to diffusion models. Thus, our work makes a pivotal contribution to distinguishing diffusion model-generated images, marking a significant step in the domain of artificial intelligence security.

- **Summary**: The Visual Turing Test is the ultimate goal to evaluate the realism of holographic displays. Previous studies have focused on addressing challenges such as limited \'etendue and image quality over a large focal volume, but they have not investigated the effect of pupil sampling on the viewing experience in full 3D holograms. In this work, we tackle this problem with a novel hologram generation algorithm motivated by matching the projection operators of incoherent Light Field and coherent Wigner Function light transport. To this end, we supervise hologram computation using synthesized photographs, which are rendered on-the-fly using Light Field refocusing from stochastically sampled pupil states during optimization. The proposed method produces holograms with correct parallax and focus cues, which are important for passing the Visual Turing Test. We validate that our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art CGH algorithms that use Light Field and Focal Stack supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm significantly improves the realism of the viewing experience for a variety of different pupil states.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models have recently achieved remarkable progress, exhibiting great perception and reasoning abilities concerning visual information. However, how to effectively evaluate these large vision-language models remains a major obstacle, hindering future model development. Traditional benchmarks like VQAv2 or COCO Caption provide quantitative performance measurements but suffer from a lack of fine-grained ability assessment and non-robust evaluation metrics. Recent subjective benchmarks, such as OwlEval, offer comprehensive evaluations of a model's abilities by incorporating human labor, but they are not scalable and display significant bias. In response to these challenges, we propose MMBench, a novel multi-modality benchmark. MMBench methodically develops a comprehensive evaluation pipeline, primarily comprised of two elements. The first element is a meticulously curated dataset that surpasses existing similar benchmarks in terms of the number and variety of evaluation questions and abilities. The second element introduces a novel CircularEval strategy and incorporates the use of ChatGPT. This implementation is designed to convert free-form predictions into pre-defined choices, thereby facilitating a more robust evaluation of the model's predictions. MMBench is a systematically-designed objective benchmark for robustly evaluating the various abilities of vision-language models. We hope MMBench will assist the research community in better evaluating their models and encourage future advancements in this domain. Project page: https://opencompass.org.cn/mmbench.

- **Summary**: Image smoothing is by reducing pixel-wise gradients to smooth out details. As existing methods always rely on gradients to determine smoothing manners, it is difficult to distinguish structures and details to handle distinctively due to the overlapped ranges of gradients for structures and details. Thus, it is still challenging to achieve high-quality results, especially on preserving weak structures and removing high-contrast details. In this paper, we address this challenge by improving the real-time optimization-based method via iterative least squares (called ILS). We observe that 1) ILS uses gradients as the independent variable in its penalty function for determining smoothing manners, and 2) the framework of ILS can still work for image smoothing when we use some values instead of gradients in the penalty function. Thus, corresponding to the properties of pixels on structures or not, we compute some values to use in the penalty function to determine smoothing manners, and so we can handle structures and details distinctively, no matter whether their gradients are high or low. As a result, we can conveniently remove high-contrast details while preserving weak structures. Moreover, such values can be adjusted to accelerate optimization computation, so that we can use fewer iterations than the original ILS method for efficiency. This also reduces the changes onto structures to help structure preservation. Experimental results show our advantages over existing methods on efficiency and quality.

- **Summary**: The ubiquitous and demonstrably suboptimal choice of resizing images to a fixed resolution before processing them with computer vision models has not yet been successfully challenged. However, models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) offer flexible sequence-based modeling, and hence varying input sequence lengths. We take advantage of this with NaViT (Native Resolution ViT) which uses sequence packing during training to process inputs of arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. Alongside flexible model usage, we demonstrate improved training efficiency for large-scale supervised and contrastive image-text pretraining. NaViT can be efficiently transferred to standard tasks such as image and video classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation and leads to improved results on robustness and fairness benchmarks. At inference time, the input resolution flexibility can be used to smoothly navigate the test-time cost-performance trade-off. We believe that NaViT marks a departure from the standard, CNN-designed, input and modelling pipeline used by most computer vision models, and represents a promising direction for ViTs.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the role of image generative models in facial reenactment has been steadily increasing. Such models are usually subject-agnostic and trained on domain-wide datasets. The appearance of the reenacted individual is learned from a single image, and hence, the entire breadth of the individual's appearance is not entirely captured, leading these methods to resort to unfaithful hallucination. Thanks to recent advancements, it is now possible to train a personalized generative model tailored specifically to a given individual. In this paper, we propose a novel method for facial reenactment using a personalized generator. We train the generator using frames from a short, yet varied, self-scan video captured using a simple commodity camera. Images synthesized by the personalized generator are guaranteed to preserve identity. The premise of our work is that the task of reenactment is thus reduced to accurately mimicking head poses and expressions. To this end, we locate the desired frames in the latent space of the personalized generator using carefully designed latent optimization. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for facial reenactment. Furthermore, we show that since our reenactment takes place in a semantic latent space, it can be semantically edited and stylized in post-processing.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning has become increasingly popular in medical image segmentation due to its ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to extract additional information. However, most existing semi-supervised segmentation methods only focus on extracting information from unlabeled data, disregarding the potential of labeled data to further improve the performance of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel Correlation Aware Mutual Learning (CAML) framework that leverages labeled data to guide the extraction of information from unlabeled data. Our approach is based on a mutual learning strategy that incorporates two modules: the Cross-sample Mutual Attention Module (CMA) and the Omni-Correlation Consistency Module (OCC). The CMA module establishes dense cross-sample correlations among a group of samples, enabling the transfer of label prior knowledge to unlabeled data. The OCC module constructs omni-correlations between the unlabeled and labeled datasets and regularizes dual models by constraining the omni-correlation matrix of each sub-model to be consistent. Experiments on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in medical image segmentation tasks. The codes, pre-trained weights, and data are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Noise injection is a fundamental tool for data augmentation, and yet there is no widely accepted procedure to incorporate it with learning frameworks. This study analyzes the effects of adding or applying different noise models of varying magnitudes to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Noise models that are distributed with different density functions are given common magnitude levels via Structural Similarity (SSIM) metric in order to create an appropriate ground for comparison. The basic results are conforming with the most of the common notions in machine learning, and also introduce some novel heuristics and recommendations on noise injection. The new approaches will provide better understanding on optimal learning procedures for image classification.

- **Summary**: Crystalline defects, such as line-like dislocations, play an important role for the performance and reliability of many metallic devices. Their interaction and evolution still poses a multitude of open questions to materials science and materials physics. In-situ TEM experiments can provide important insights into how dislocations behave and move. During such experiments, the dislocation microstructure is captured in form of videos. The analysis of individual video frames can provide useful insights but is limited by the capabilities of automated identification, digitization, and quantitative extraction of the dislocations as curved objects. The vast amount of data also makes manual annotation very time consuming, thereby limiting the use of Deep Learning-based, automated image analysis and segmentation of the dislocation microstructure. In this work, a parametric model for generating synthetic training data for segmentation of dislocations is developed. Even though domain scientists might dismiss synthetic training images sometimes as too artificial, our findings show that they can result in superior performance, particularly regarding the generalizing of the Deep Learning models with respect to different microstructures and imaging conditions. Additionally, we propose an enhanced deep learning method optimized for segmenting overlapping or intersecting dislocation lines. Upon testing this framework on four distinct real datasets, we find that our synthetic training data are able to yield high-quality results also on real images-even more so if fine-tune on a few real images was done.

- **Summary**: Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) remains an attractive solution for real-time rendering of complex light transport effects such as glossy global illumination. After precomputation, we can relight the scene with new environment maps while changing viewpoint in real-time. However, practical PRT methods are usually limited to low-frequency spherical harmonic lighting. All-frequency techniques using wavelets are promising but have so far had little practical impact. The curse of dimensionality and much higher data requirements have typically limited them to relighting with fixed view or only direct lighting with triple product integrals. In this paper, we demonstrate a hybrid neural-wavelet PRT solution to high-frequency indirect illumination, including glossy reflection, for relighting with changing view. Specifically, we seek to represent the light transport function in the Haar wavelet basis. For global illumination, we learn the wavelet transport using a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) applied to a feature field as a function of spatial location and wavelet index, with reflected direction and material parameters being other MLP inputs. We optimize/learn the feature field (compactly represented by a tensor decomposition) and MLP parameters from multiple images of the scene under different lighting and viewing conditions. We demonstrate real-time (512 x 512 at 24 FPS, 800 x 600 at 13 FPS) precomputed rendering of challenging scenes involving view-dependent reflections and even caustics.

- **Summary**: Despite the stunning ability to generate high-quality images by recent text-to-image models, current approaches often struggle to effectively compose objects with different attributes and relationships into a complex and coherent scene. We propose T2I-CompBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-world compositional text-to-image generation, consisting of 6,000 compositional text prompts from 3 categories (attribute binding, object relationships, and complex compositions) and 6 sub-categories (color binding, shape binding, texture binding, spatial relationships, non-spatial relationships, and complex compositions). We further propose several evaluation metrics specifically designed to evaluate compositional text-to-image generation. We introduce a new approach, Generative mOdel fine-tuning with Reward-driven Sample selection (GORS), to boost the compositional text-to-image generation abilities of pretrained text-to-image models. Extensive experiments and evaluations are conducted to benchmark previous methods on T2I-CompBench, and to validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation metrics and GORS approach.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Event Localization (AVEL) is the task of temporally localizing and classifying \emph{audio-visual events}, i.e., events simultaneously visible and audible in a video. In this paper, we solve AVEL in a weakly-supervised setting, where only video-level event labels (their presence/absence, but not their locations in time) are available as supervision for training. Our idea is to use a base model to estimate labels on the training data at a finer temporal resolution than at the video level and re-train the model with these labels. I.e., we determine the subset of labels for each \emph{slice} of frames in a training video by (i) replacing the frames outside the slice with those from a second video having no overlap in video-level labels, and (ii) feeding this synthetic video into the base model to extract labels for just the slice in question. To handle the out-of-distribution nature of our synthetic videos, we propose an auxiliary objective for the base model that induces more reliable predictions of the localized event labels as desired. Our three-stage pipeline outperforms several existing AVEL methods with no architectural changes and improves performance on a related weakly-supervised task as well.

- **Summary**: A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that allows a person to communicate or control the surroundings without depending on the brain's normal output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles. A lot of successful applications have arisen utilizing the advantages of BCI to assist disabled people with so-called assistive technology. Considering using BCI has fewer limitations and huge potential, this project has been proposed to control the movement of an electronic wheelchair via brain signals. The goal of this project is to help disabled people, especially paralyzed people suffering from motor disabilities, improve their life qualities. In order to realize the project stated above, Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) is involved. It can be easily elicited in the visual cortical with the same frequency as the one is being focused by the subject. There are two important parts in this project. One is to process the EEG signals and another one is to make a visual stimulator using hardware. The EEG signals are processed in Matlab using the algorithm of Butterworth Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) bandpass filter (for preprocessing) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) (for feature extraction). Besides, a harmonics-based classification method is proposed and applied in the classification part. Moreover, the design of the visual stimulator combines LEDs as flickers and LCDs as information displayers on one panel. Microcontrollers are employed to control the SSVEP visual stimuli panel. This project is evaluated by subjects with different races and ages. Experimental results show the system is easy to be operated and it can achieve approximately a minimum 1-second time delay. So it demonstrates that this SSVEP-based BCI-controlled wheelchair has a huge potential to be applied to disabled people in the future.

- **Summary**: Automatic and accurate segmentation of colon polyps is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Advanced deep learning models have shown promising results in polyp segmentation. However, they still have limitations in representing multi-scale features and generalization capability. To address these issues, this paper introduces RaBiT, an encoder-decoder model that incorporates a lightweight Transformer-based architecture in the encoder to model multiple-level global semantic relationships. The decoder consists of several bidirectional feature pyramid layers with reverse attention modules to better fuse feature maps at various levels and incrementally refine polyp boundaries. We also propose ideas to lighten the reverse attention module and make it more suitable for multi-class segmentation. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods across all datasets while maintaining low computational complexity. Moreover, our method demonstrates high generalization capability in cross-dataset experiments, even when the training and test sets have different characteristics.

- **Summary**: Video frame interpolation is an increasingly important research task with several key industrial applications in the video coding, broadcast and production sectors. Recently, transformers have been introduced to the field resulting in substantial performance gains. However, this comes at a cost of greatly increased memory usage, training and inference time. In this paper, a novel method integrating a transformer encoder and convolutional features is proposed. This network reduces the memory burden by close to 50% and runs up to four times faster during inference time compared to existing transformer-based interpolation methods. A dual-encoder architecture is introduced which combines the strength of convolutions in modelling local correlations with those of the transformer for long-range dependencies. Quantitative evaluations are conducted on various benchmarks with complex motion to showcase the robustness of the proposed method, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art interpolation networks.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentations of pathological entities have crucial clinical value in computational pathology workflows. Foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have been recently proposed for universal use in segmentation tasks. SAM shows remarkable promise in instance segmentation on natural images. However, the applicability of SAM to computational pathology tasks is limited due to the following factors: (1) lack of comprehensive pathology datasets used in SAM training and (2) the design of SAM is not inherently optimized for semantic segmentation tasks. In this work, we adapt SAM for semantic segmentation by introducing trainable class prompts, followed by further enhancements through the incorporation of a pathology encoder, specifically a pathology foundation model. Our framework, SAM-Path enhances SAM's ability to conduct semantic segmentation in digital pathology without human input prompts. Through experiments on two public pathology datasets, the BCSS and the CRAG datasets, we demonstrate that the fine-tuning with trainable class prompts outperforms vanilla SAM with manual prompts and post-processing by 27.52% in Dice score and 71.63% in IOU. On these two datasets, the proposed additional pathology foundation model further achieves a relative improvement of 5.07% to 5.12% in Dice score and 4.50% to 8.48% in IOU.

- **Summary**: Understanding the spread of images across the web helps us understand the reuse of scientific visualizations and their relationship with the public. The "Flatten the Curve" graphic was heavily used during the COVID-19 pandemic to convey a complex concept in a simple form. It displays two curves comparing the impact on case loads for medical facilities if the populace either adopts or fails to adopt protective measures during a pandemic. We use five variants of the "Flatten the Curve" image as a case study for viewing the spread of an image online. To evaluate its spread, we leverage three information channels: reverse image search engines, social media, and web archives. Reverse image searches give us a current view into image reuse. Social media helps us understand a variant's popularity over time. Web archives help us see when it was preserved, highlighting a view of popularity for future researchers. Our case study leverages document URLs can be used as a proxy for images when studying the spread of images online.

- **Summary**: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been emerging as a growing public health threat. Early diagnosis of ASD is crucial for timely, effective intervention and treatment. However, conventional diagnosis methods based on communications and behavioral patterns are unreliable for children younger than 2 years of age. Given evidences of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in ASD infants, we resort to a novel deep learning-based method to extract key features from the inherently scarce, class-imbalanced, and heterogeneous structural MR images for early autism diagnosis. Specifically, we propose a Siamese verification framework to extend the scarce data, and an unsupervised compressor to alleviate data imbalance by extracting key features. We also proposed weight constraints to cope with sample heterogeneity by giving different samples different voting weights during validation, and we used Path Signature to unravel meaningful developmental features from the two-time point data longitudinally. Extensive experiments have shown that our method performed well under practical scenarios, transcending existing machine learning methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel Single-class target-specific Adversarial attack called SingleADV. The goal of SingleADV is to generate a universal perturbation that deceives the target model into confusing a specific category of objects with a target category while ensuring highly relevant and accurate interpretations. The universal perturbation is stochastically and iteratively optimized by minimizing the adversarial loss that is designed to consider both the classifier and interpreter costs in targeted and non-targeted categories. In this optimization framework, ruled by the first- and second-moment estimations, the desired loss surface promotes high confidence and interpretation score of adversarial samples. By avoiding unintended misclassification of samples from other categories, SingleADV enables more effective targeted attacks on interpretable deep learning systems in both white-box and black-box scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of SingleADV, we conduct experiments using four different model architectures (ResNet-50, VGG-16, DenseNet-169, and Inception-V3) coupled with three interpretation models (CAM, Grad, and MASK). Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that SingleADV effectively deceives the target deep learning models and their associated interpreters under various conditions and settings. Our experimental results show that the performance of SingleADV is effective, with an average fooling ratio of 0.74 and an adversarial confidence level of 0.78 in generating deceptive adversarial samples. Furthermore, we discuss several countermeasures against SingleADV, including a transfer-based learning approach and existing preprocessing defenses.

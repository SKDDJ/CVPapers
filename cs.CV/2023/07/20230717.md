- **Summary**: Recent image harmonization methods have demonstrated promising results. However, due to their heavy reliance on a large number of composite images, these works are expensive in the training phase and often fail to generalize to unseen images. In this paper, we draw lessons from human behavior and come up with a zero-shot image harmonization method. Specifically, in the harmonization process, a human mainly utilizes his long-term prior on harmonious images and makes a composite image close to that prior. To imitate that, we resort to pretrained generative models for the prior of natural images. For the guidance of the harmonization direction, we propose an Attention-Constraint Text which is optimized to well illustrate the image environments. Some further designs are introduced for preserving the foreground content structure. The resulting framework, highly consistent with human behavior, can achieve harmonious results without burdensome training. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach, and we have also explored some interesting applications.

- **Summary**: We introduce the notion of point affiliation into feature upsampling. By abstracting a feature map into non-overlapped semantic clusters formed by points of identical semantic meaning, feature upsampling can be viewed as point affiliation -- designating a semantic cluster for each upsampled point. In the framework of kernel-based dynamic upsampling, we show that an upsampled point can resort to its low-res decoder neighbors and high-res encoder point to reason the affiliation, conditioned on the mutual similarity between them. We therefore present a generic formulation for generating similarity-aware upsampling kernels and prove that such kernels encourage not only semantic smoothness but also boundary sharpness. This formulation constitutes a novel, lightweight, and universal upsampling solution, Similarity-Aware Point Affiliation (SAPA). We show its working mechanism via our preliminary designs with window-shape kernel. After probing the limitations of the designs on object detection, we reveal additional insights for upsampling, leading to SAPA with the dynamic kernel shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAPA outperforms prior upsamplers and invites consistent performance improvements on a number of dense prediction tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, image matting, and depth estimation.

### Unbiased Image Synthesis via Manifold-Driven Sampling in Diffusion Models

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are a potent class of generative models capable of producing high-quality images. However, they can face challenges related to data bias, favoring specific modes of data, especially when the training data does not accurately represent the true data distribution and exhibits skewed or imbalanced patterns. For instance, the CelebA dataset contains more female images than male images, leading to biased generation results and impacting downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages manifold guidance to mitigate data bias in diffusion models. Our key idea is to estimate the manifold of the training data using an unsupervised approach, and then use it to guide the sampling process of diffusion models. This encourages the generated images to be uniformly distributed on the data manifold without altering the model architecture or necessitating labels or retraining. Theoretical analysis and empirical evidence demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the quality and unbiasedness of image generation compared to standard diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Voxel-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. However, their significant computational and memory costs pose a challenge for their application to resource-constrained vehicles. One reason for this high resource consumption is the presence of a large number of redundant background points in Lidar point clouds, resulting in spatial redundancy in both 3D voxel and dense BEV map representations. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive inference framework called Ada3D, which focuses on exploiting the input-level spatial redundancy. Ada3D adaptively filters the redundant input, guided by a lightweight importance predictor and the unique properties of the Lidar point cloud. Additionally, we utilize the BEV features' intrinsic sparsity by introducing the Sparsity Preserving Batch Normalization. With Ada3D, we achieve 40% reduction for 3D voxels and decrease the density of 2D BEV feature maps from 100% to 20% without sacrificing accuracy. Ada3D reduces the model computational and memory cost by 5x, and achieves 1.52x/1.45x end-to-end GPU latency and 1.5x/4.5x GPU peak memory optimization for the 3D and 2D backbone respectively.

- **Summary**: The stereo event-intensity camera setup is widely applied to leverage the advantages of both event cameras with low latency and intensity cameras that capture accurate brightness and texture information. However, such a setup commonly encounters cross-modality parallax that is difficult to be eliminated solely with stereo rectification especially for real-world scenes with complex motions and varying depths, posing artifacts and distortion for existing Event-based Video Frame Interpolation (E-VFI) approaches. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Stereo Event-based VFI (SE-VFI) network (SEVFI-Net) to generate high-quality intermediate frames and corresponding disparities from misaligned inputs consisting of two consecutive keyframes and event streams emitted between them. Specifically, we propose a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) to alleviate the parallax and achieve spatial alignment in the feature domain. We then exploit the fused features accomplishing accurate optical flow and disparity estimation, and achieving better interpolated results through flow-based and synthesis-based ways. We also build a stereo visual acquisition system composed of an event camera and an RGB-D camera to collect a new Stereo Event-Intensity Dataset (SEID) containing diverse scenes with complex motions and varying depths. Experiments on public real-world stereo datasets, i.e., DSEC and MVSEC, and our SEID dataset demonstrate that our proposed SEVFI-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Radars, due to their robustness to adverse weather conditions and ability to measure object motions, have served in autonomous driving and intelligent agents for years. However, Radar-based perception suffers from its unintuitive sensing data, which lack of semantic and structural information of scenes. To tackle this problem, camera and Radar sensor fusion has been investigated as a trending strategy with low cost, high reliability and strong maintenance. While most recent works explore how to explore Radar point clouds and images, rich contextual information within Radar observation are discarded. In this paper, we propose a hybrid point-wise Radar-Optical fusion approach for object detection in autonomous driving scenarios. The framework benefits from dense contextual information from both the range-doppler spectrum and images which are integrated to learn a multi-modal feature representation. Furthermore, we propose a novel local coordinate formulation, tackling the object detection task in an object-centric coordinate. Extensive results show that with the information gained from optical images, we could achieve leading performance in object detection (97.69\% recall) compared to recent state-of-the-art methods FFT-RadNet (82.86\% recall). Ablation studies verify the key design choices and practicability of our approach given machine generated imperfect detections. The code will be available at https://github.com/LiuLiu-55/ROFusion.

- **Summary**: In recent years, open-vocabulary (OV) dense visual prediction (such as OV object detection, semantic, instance and panoptic segmentations) has attracted increasing research attention. However, most of existing approaches are task-specific and individually tackle each task. In this paper, we propose a Unified Open-Vocabulary Network (UOVN) to jointly address four common dense prediction tasks. Compared with separate models, a unified network is more desirable for diverse industrial applications. Moreover, OV dense prediction training data is relatively less. Separate networks can only leverage task-relevant training data, while a unified approach can integrate diverse training data to boost individual tasks. We address two major challenges in unified OV prediction. Firstly, unlike unified methods for fixed-set predictions, OV networks are usually trained with multi-modal data. Therefore, we propose a multi-modal, multi-scale and multi-task (MMM) decoding mechanism to better leverage multi-modal data. Secondly, because UOVN uses data from different tasks for training, there are significant domain and task gaps. We present a UOVN training mechanism to reduce such gaps. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our UOVN.

- **Summary**: Hand trajectory forecasting from egocentric views is crucial for enabling a prompt understanding of human intentions when interacting with AR/VR systems. However, existing methods handle this problem in a 2D image space which is inadequate for 3D real-world applications. In this paper, we set up an egocentric 3D hand trajectory forecasting task that aims to predict hand trajectories in a 3D space from early observed RGB videos in a first-person view. To fulfill this goal, we propose an uncertainty-aware state space Transformer (USST) that takes the merits of the attention mechanism and aleatoric uncertainty within the framework of the classical state-space model. The model can be further enhanced by the velocity constraint and visual prompt tuning (VPT) on large vision transformers. Moreover, we develop an annotation workflow to collect 3D hand trajectories with high quality. Experimental results on H2O and EgoPAT3D datasets demonstrate the superiority of USST for both 2D and 3D trajectory forecasting. The code and datasets are publicly released: https://github.com/Cogito2012/USST.



### Random Boxes Are Open-world Object Detectors

- **Summary**: We show that classifiers trained with random region proposals achieve state-of-the-art Open-world Object Detection (OWOD): they can not only maintain the accuracy of the known objects (w/ training labels), but also considerably improve the recall of unknown ones (w/o training labels). Specifically, we propose RandBox, a Fast R-CNN based architecture trained on random proposals at each training iteration, surpassing existing Faster R-CNN and Transformer based OWOD. Its effectiveness stems from the following two benefits introduced by randomness. First, as the randomization is independent of the distribution of the limited known objects, the random proposals become the instrumental variable that prevents the training from being confounded by the known objects. Second, the unbiased training encourages more proposal explorations by using our proposed matching score that does not penalize the random proposals whose prediction scores do not match the known objects. On two benchmarks: Pascal-VOC/MS-COCO and LVIS, RandBox significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in all metrics. We also detail the ablations on randomization and loss designs.

- **Summary**: Location determination finds wide applications in daily life. Instead of existing efforts devoted to localizing tourist photos captured by perspective cameras, in this article, we focus on devising person positioning solutions using overhead fisheye cameras. Such solutions are advantageous in large field of view (FOV), low cost, anti-occlusion, and unaggressive work mode (without the necessity of cameras carried by persons). However, related studies are quite scarce, due to the paucity of data. To stimulate research in this exciting area, we present LOAF, the first large-scale overhead fisheye dataset for person detection and localization. LOAF is built with many essential features, e.g., i) the data cover abundant diversities in scenes, human pose, density, and location; ii) it contains currently the largest number of annotated pedestrian, i.e., 457K bounding boxes with groundtruth location information; iii) the body-boxes are labeled as radius-aligned so as to fully address the positioning challenge. To approach localization, we build a fisheye person detection network, which exploits the fisheye distortions by a rotation-equivariant training strategy and predict radius-aligned human boxes end-to-end. Then, the actual locations of the detected persons are calculated by a numerical solution on the fisheye model and camera altitude data. Extensive experiments on LOAF validate the superiority of our fisheye detector w.r.t. previous methods, and show that our whole fisheye positioning solution is able to locate all persons in FOV with an accuracy of 0.5 m, within 0.1 s.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel framework called HST for semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS). HST extracts image and video features using the latest Swin Transformer and Video Swin Transformer to inherit their inductive bias for the spatiotemporal locality, which is essential for temporally coherent VOS. To take full advantage of the image and video features, HST casts image and video features as a query and memory, respectively. By applying efficient memory read operations at multiple scales, HST produces hierarchical features for the precise reconstruction of object masks. HST shows effectiveness and robustness in handling challenging scenarios with occluded and fast-moving objects under cluttered backgrounds. In particular, HST-B outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors on multiple popular benchmarks, i.e., YouTube-VOS (85.0%), DAVIS 2017 (85.9%), and DAVIS 2016 (94.0%).

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative compression methods have demonstrated remarkable progress in enhancing the perceptual quality of compressed data, especially in scenarios with low bitrates. Nevertheless, their efficacy and applicability in achieving extreme compression ratios ($<0.1$ bpp) still remain constrained. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective coding framework by introducing vector quantization (VQ)-based generative models into the image compression domain. The main insight is that the codebook learned by the VQGAN model yields strong expressive capacity, facilitating efficient compression of continuous information in the latent space while maintaining reconstruction quality. Specifically, an image can be represented as VQ-indices by finding the nearest codeword, which can be encoded using lossless compression methods into bitstreams. We then propose clustering a pre-trained large-scale codebook into smaller codebooks using the K-means algorithm. This enables images to be represented as diverse ranges of VQ-indices maps, resulting in variable bitrates and different levels of reconstruction quality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art codecs in terms of perceptual quality-oriented metrics and human perception under extremely low bitrates.

- **Summary**: Liver tumor segmentation and classification are important tasks in computer aided diagnosis. We aim to address three problems: liver tumor screening and preliminary diagnosis in non-contrast computed tomography (CT), and differential diagnosis in dynamic contrast-enhanced CT. A novel framework named Pixel-Lesion-pAtient Network (PLAN) is proposed. It uses a mask transformer to jointly segment and classify each lesion with improved anchor queries and a foreground-enhanced sampling loss. It also has an image-wise classifier to effectively aggregate global information and predict patient-level diagnosis. A large-scale multi-phase dataset is collected containing 939 tumor patients and 810 normal subjects. 4010 tumor instances of eight types are extensively annotated. On the non-contrast tumor screening task, PLAN achieves 95% and 96% in patient-level sensitivity and specificity. On contrast-enhanced CT, our lesion-level detection precision, recall, and classification accuracy are 92%, 89%, and 86%, outperforming widely used CNN and transformers for lesion segmentation. We also conduct a reader study on a holdout set of 250 cases. PLAN is on par with a senior human radiologist, showing the clinical significance of our results.

- **Summary**: How does the brain represent different modes of information? Can we design a system that automatically understands what the user is thinking? Such questions can be answered by studying brain recordings like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As a first step, the neuroscience community has contributed several large cognitive neuroscience datasets related to passive reading/listening/viewing of concept words, narratives, pictures and movies. Encoding and decoding models using these datasets have also been proposed in the past two decades. These models serve as additional tools for basic research in cognitive science and neuroscience. Encoding models aim at generating fMRI brain representations given a stimulus automatically. They have several practical applications in evaluating and diagnosing neurological conditions and thus also help design therapies for brain damage. Decoding models solve the inverse problem of reconstructing the stimuli given the fMRI. They are useful for designing brain-machine or brain-computer interfaces. Inspired by the effectiveness of deep learning models for natural language processing, computer vision, and speech, recently several neural encoding and decoding models have been proposed. In this survey, we will first discuss popular representations of language, vision and speech stimuli, and present a summary of neuroscience datasets. Further, we will review popular deep learning based encoding and decoding architectures and note their benefits and limitations. Finally, we will conclude with a brief summary and discussion about future trends. Given the large amount of recently published work in the `computational cognitive neuroscience' community, we believe that this survey nicely organizes the plethora of work and presents it as a coherent story.

- **Summary**: Traffic sign recognition is an essential component of perception in autonomous vehicles, which is currently performed almost exclusively with deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Several previous works have demonstrated the feasibility of adversarial attacks on traffic sign recognition models. Traffic signs are particularly promising for adversarial attack research due to the ease of performing real-world attacks using printed signs or stickers. In this work, we survey existing works performing either digital or real-world attacks on traffic sign detection and classification models. We provide an overview of the latest advancements and highlight the existing research areas that require further investigation.

- **Summary**: One of the distinct characteristics in radiologists' reading of multiparametric prostate MR scans, using reporting systems such as PI-RADS v2.1, is to score individual types of MR modalities, T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced, and then combine these image-modality-specific scores using standardised decision rules to predict the likelihood of clinically significant cancer. This work aims to demonstrate that it is feasible for low-dimensional parametric models to model such decision rules in the proposed Combiner networks, without compromising the accuracy of predicting radiologic labels: First, it is shown that either a linear mixture model or a nonlinear stacking model is sufficient to model PI-RADS decision rules for localising prostate cancer. Second, parameters of these (generalised) linear models are proposed as hyperparameters, to weigh multiple networks that independently represent individual image modalities in the Combiner network training, as opposed to end-to-end modality ensemble. A HyperCombiner network is developed to train a single image segmentation network that can be conditioned on these hyperparameters during inference, for much improved efficiency. Experimental results based on data from 850 patients, for the application of automating radiologist labelling multi-parametric MR, compare the proposed combiner networks with other commonly-adopted end-to-end networks. Using the added advantages of obtaining and interpreting the modality combining rules, in terms of the linear weights or odds-ratios on individual image modalities, three clinical applications are presented for prostate cancer segmentation, including modality availability assessment, importance quantification and rule discovery.

- **Summary**: Recent work has revealed many intriguing empirical phenomena in neural network training, despite the poorly understood and highly complex loss landscapes and training dynamics. One of these phenomena, Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC), has gained considerable attention due to the intriguing observation that different solutions can be connected by a linear path in the parameter space while maintaining near-constant training and test losses. In this work, we introduce a stronger notion of linear connectivity, Layerwise Linear Feature Connectivity (LLFC), which says that the feature maps of every layer in different trained networks are also linearly connected. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence for LLFC across a wide range of settings, demonstrating that whenever two trained networks satisfy LMC (via either spawning or permutation methods), they also satisfy LLFC in nearly all the layers. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the underlying factors contributing to LLFC, which reveal new insights into the spawning and permutation approaches. The study of LLFC transcends and advances our understanding of LMC by adopting a feature-learning perspective.

- **Summary**: While LiDAR sensors have been succesfully applied to 3D object detection, the affordability of radar and camera sensors has led to a growing interest in fusiong radars and cameras for 3D object detection. However, previous radar-camera fusion models have not been able to fully utilize radar information in that initial 3D proposals were generated based on the camera features only and the instance-level fusion is subsequently conducted. In this paper, we propose radar-camera multi-level fusion (RCM-Fusion), which fuses radar and camera modalities at both the feature-level and instance-level to fully utilize radar information. At the feature-level, we propose a Radar Guided BEV Encoder which utilizes radar Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features to transform image features into precise BEV representations and then adaptively combines the radar and camera BEV features. At the instance-level, we propose a Radar Grid Point Refinement module that reduces localization error by considering the characteristics of the radar point clouds. The experiments conducted on the public nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our proposed RCM-Fusion offers 11.8% performance gain in nuScenes detection score (NDS) over the camera-only baseline model and achieves state-of-the-art performaces among radar-camera fusion methods in the nuScenes 3D object detection benchmark. Code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: In Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD), detecting small objects is extremely difficult. The limited supervision cripples the localization capabilities of the models and a few pixels shift can dramatically reduce the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the ground truth and predicted boxes for small objects. To this end, we propose Scale-adaptive Intersection over Union (SIoU), a novel box similarity measure. SIoU changes with the objects' size, it is more lenient with small object shifts. We conducted a user study and SIoU better aligns than IoU with human judgment. Employing SIoU as an evaluation criterion helps to build more user-oriented models. SIoU can also be used as a loss function to prioritize small objects during training, outperforming existing loss functions. SIoU improves small object detection in the non-few-shot regime, but this setting is unrealistic in the industry as annotated detection datasets are often too expensive to acquire. Hence, our experiments mainly focus on the few-shot regime to demonstrate the superiority and versatility of SIoU loss. SIoU improves significantly FSOD performance on small objects in both natural (Pascal VOC and COCO datasets) and aerial images (DOTA and DIOR). In aerial imagery, small objects are critical and SIoU loss achieves new state-of-the-art FSOD on DOTA and DIOR.

- **Summary**: One-shot Neural architecture search (One-shot NAS) has been proposed as a time-efficient approach to obtain optimal subnet architectures and weights under different complexity cases by training only once. However, the subnet performance obtained by weight sharing is often inferior to the performance achieved by retraining. In this paper, we investigate the performance gap and attribute it to the use of uniform sampling, which is a common approach in supernet training. Uniform sampling concentrates training resources on subnets with intermediate computational resources, which are sampled with high probability. However, subnets with different complexity regions require different optimal training strategies for optimal performance. To address the problem of uniform sampling, we propose ShiftNAS, a method that can adjust the sampling probability based on the complexity of subnets. We achieve this by evaluating the performance variation of subnets with different complexity and designing an architecture generator that can accurately and efficiently provide subnets with the desired complexity. Both the sampling probability and the architecture generator can be trained end-to-end in a gradient-based manner. With ShiftNAS, we can directly obtain the optimal model architecture and parameters for a given computational complexity. We evaluate our approach on multiple visual network models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), and demonstrate that ShiftNAS is model-agnostic. Experimental results on ImageNet show that ShiftNAS can improve the performance of one-shot NAS without additional consumption. Source codes are available at https://github.com/bestfleer/ShiftNAS.

- **Summary**: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health issues, and accurate computer-aided diagnosis methods are of importance for both dermatologists and patients. However, most of the existing methods overlook the essential domain knowledge required for skin disease diagnosis. A novel multi-task model, namely DermImitFormer, is proposed to fill this gap by imitating dermatologists' diagnostic procedures and strategies. Through multi-task learning, the model simultaneously predicts body parts and lesion attributes in addition to the disease itself, enhancing diagnosis accuracy and improving diagnosis interpretability. The designed lesion selection module mimics dermatologists' zoom-in action, effectively highlighting the local lesion features from noisy backgrounds. Additionally, the presented cross-interaction module explicitly models the complicated diagnostic reasoning between body parts, lesion attributes, and diseases. To provide a more robust evaluation of the proposed method, a large-scale clinical image dataset of skin diseases with significantly more cases than existing datasets has been established. Extensive experiments on three different datasets consistently demonstrate the state-of-the-art recognition performance of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Visible-Infrared person Re-IDentification (VI-ReID) is a challenging cross-modality image retrieval task that aims to match pedestrians' images across visible and infrared cameras. To solve the modality gap, existing mainstream methods adopt a learning paradigm converting the image retrieval task into an image classification task with cross-entropy loss and auxiliary metric learning losses. These losses follow the strategy of adjusting the distribution of extracted embeddings to reduce the intra-class distance and increase the inter-class distance. However, such objectives do not precisely correspond to the final test setting of the retrieval task, resulting in a new gap at the optimization level. By rethinking these keys of VI-ReID, we propose a simple and effective method, the Multi-level Cross-modality Joint Alignment (MCJA), bridging both modality and objective-level gap. For the former, we design the Modality Alignment Augmentation, which consists of three novel strategies, the weighted grayscale, cross-channel cutmix, and spectrum jitter augmentation, effectively reducing modality discrepancy in the image space. For the latter, we introduce a new Cross-Modality Retrieval loss. It is the first work to constrain from the perspective of the ranking list, aligning with the goal of the testing stage. Moreover, based on the global feature only, our method exhibits good performance and can serve as a strong baseline method for the VI-ReID community.

- **Summary**: Existing face forgery detection models try to discriminate fake images by detecting only spatial artifacts (e.g., generative artifacts, blending) or mainly temporal artifacts (e.g., flickering, discontinuity). They may experience significant performance degradation when facing out-domain artifacts. In this paper, we propose to capture both spatial and temporal artifacts in one model for face forgery detection. A simple idea is to leverage a spatiotemporal model (3D ConvNet). However, we find that it may easily rely on one type of artifact and ignore the other. To address this issue, we present a novel training strategy called AltFreezing for more general face forgery detection. The AltFreezing aims to encourage the model to detect both spatial and temporal artifacts. It divides the weights of a spatiotemporal network into two groups: spatial-related and temporal-related. Then the two groups of weights are alternately frozen during the training process so that the model can learn spatial and temporal features to distinguish real or fake videos. Furthermore, we introduce various video-level data augmentation methods to improve the generalization capability of the forgery detection model. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization to unseen manipulations and datasets.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Navigation guidance is a key requirement for a multitude of lung interventions using video bronchoscopy. State-of-the-art solutions focus on lung biopsies using electromagnetic tracking and intraoperative image registration w.r.t. preoperative CT scans for guidance. The requirement of patient-specific CT scans hampers the utilisation of navigation guidance for other applications such as intensive care units.   Methods: This paper addresses navigation guidance solely incorporating bronchosopy video data. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches we entirely omit the use of electromagnetic tracking and patient-specific CT scans. Guidance is enabled by means of topological bronchoscope localization w.r.t. an interpatient airway model. Particularly, we take maximally advantage of anatomical constraints of airway trees being sequentially traversed. This is realized by incorporating sequences of CNN-based airway likelihoods into a Hidden Markov Model.   Results: Our approach is evaluated based on multiple experiments inside a lung phantom model. With the consideration of temporal context and use of anatomical knowledge for regularization, we are able to improve the accuracy up to to 0.98 compared to 0.81 (weighted F1: 0.98 compared to 0.81) for a classification based on individual frames.   Conclusion: We combine CNN-based single image classification of airway segments with anatomical constraints and temporal HMM-based inference for the first time. Our approach renders vision-only guidance for bronchoscopy interventions in the absence of electromagnetic tracking and patient-specific CT scans possible.

- **Summary**: Label-noise or curated unlabeled data is used to compensate for the assumption of clean labeled data in training the conditional generative adversarial network; however, satisfying such an extended assumption is occasionally laborious or impractical. As a step towards generative modeling accessible to everyone, we introduce a novel conditional image generation framework that accepts noisy-labeled and uncurated unlabeled data during training: (i) closed-set and open-set label noise in labeled data and (ii) closed-set and open-set unlabeled data. To combat it, we propose soft curriculum learning, which assigns instance-wise weights for adversarial training while assigning new labels for unlabeled data and correcting wrong labels for labeled data. Unlike popular curriculum learning, which uses a threshold to pick the training samples, our soft curriculum controls the effect of each training instance by using the weights predicted by the auxiliary classifier, resulting in the preservation of useful samples while ignoring harmful ones. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms existing semi-supervised and label-noise robust methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative performance. In particular, the proposed approach is able to match the performance of (semi-) supervised GANs even with less than half the labeled data.

- **Summary**: Accurate and robust object detection is critical for autonomous driving. Image-based detectors face difficulties caused by low visibility in adverse weather conditions. Thus, radar-camera fusion is of particular interest but presents challenges in optimally fusing heterogeneous data sources. To approach this issue, we propose two new radar preprocessing techniques to better align radar and camera data. In addition, we introduce a Multi-Task Cross-Modality Attention-Fusion Network (MCAF-Net) for object detection, which includes two new fusion blocks. These allow for exploiting information from the feature maps more comprehensively. The proposed algorithm jointly detects objects and segments free space, which guides the model to focus on the more relevant part of the scene, namely, the occupied space. Our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion-based object detectors in the nuScenes dataset and achieves more robust results in adverse weather conditions and nighttime scenarios.

- **Summary**: Medical vision-language models enable co-learning and integrating features from medical imaging and clinical text. However, these models are not easy to train and the latent representation space can be complex. Here we propose a novel way for pre-training and regularising medical vision-language models. The proposed method, named Medical vision-language pre-training with Frozen language models and Latent spAce Geometry optimization (M-FLAG), leverages a frozen language model for training stability and efficiency and introduces a novel orthogonality loss to harmonize the latent space geometry. We demonstrate the potential of the pre-trained model on three downstream tasks: medical image classification, segmentation, and object detection. Extensive experiments across five public datasets demonstrate that M-FLAG significantly outperforms existing medical vision-language pre-training approaches and reduces the number of parameters by 78\%. Notably, M-FLAG achieves outstanding performance on the segmentation task while using only 1\% of the RSNA dataset, even outperforming ImageNet pre-trained models that have been fine-tuned using 100\% of the data.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the task of 3D shape completion from partial point clouds using deep implicit functions. Existing methods seek to use voxelized basis functions or the ones from a certain family of functions (e.g., Gaussians), which leads to high computational costs or limited shape expressivity. On the contrary, our method employs adaptive local basis functions, which are learned end-to-end and not restricted in certain forms. Based on those basis functions, a local-to-local shape completion framework is presented. Our algorithm learns sparse parameterization with a small number of basis functions while preserving local geometric details during completion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in shape completion, detail preservation, generalization to unseen geometries, and computational cost.

- **Summary**: Conventional Computed Tomography (CT) methods require large numbers of noise-free projections for accurate density reconstructions, limiting their applicability to the more complex class of Cone Beam Geometry CT (CBCT) reconstruction. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to overcome these limitations, with methods based on neural fields (NF) showing strong performance, by approximating the reconstructed density through a continuous-in-space coordinate based neural network. Our focus is on improving such methods, however, unlike previous work, which requires training an NF from scratch for each new set of projections, we instead propose to leverage anatomical consistencies over different scans by training a single conditional NF on a dataset of projections. We propose a novel conditioning method where local modulations are modeled per patient as a field over the input domain through a Neural Modulation Field (NMF). The resulting Conditional Cone Beam Neural Tomography (CondCBNT) shows improved performance for both high and low numbers of available projections on noise-free and noisy data.

- **Summary**: Conditional spatial queries are recently introduced into DEtection TRansformer (DETR) to accelerate convergence. In DAB-DETR, such queries are modulated by the so-called conditional linear projection at each decoder stage, aiming to search for positions of interest such as the four extremities of the box. Each decoder stage progressively updates the box by predicting the anchor box offsets, while in cross-attention only the box center is informed as the reference point. The use of only box center, however, leaves the width and height of the previous box unknown to the current stage, which hinders accurate prediction of offsets. We argue that the explicit use of the entire box information in cross-attention matters. In this work, we propose Box Agent to condense the box into head-specific agent points. By replacing the box center with the agent point as the reference point in each head, the conditional cross-attention can search for positions from a more reasonable starting point by considering the full scope of the previous box, rather than always from the previous box center. This significantly reduces the burden of the conditional linear projection. Experimental results show that the box agent leads to not only faster convergence but also improved detection performance, e.g., our single-scale model achieves $44.2$ AP with ResNet-50 based on DAB-DETR. Our Box Agent requires minor modifications to the code and has negligible computational workload. Code is available at https://github.com/tiny-smart/box-detr.

- **Summary**: Current, self-supervised depth estimation architectures rely on clear and sunny weather scenes to train deep neural networks. However, in many locations, this assumption is too strong. For example in the UK (2021), 149 days consisted of rain. For these architectures to be effective in real-world applications, we must create models that can generalise to all weather conditions, times of the day and image qualities. Using a combination of computer graphics and generative models, one can augment existing sunny-weather data in a variety of ways that simulate adverse weather effects. While it is tempting to use such data augmentations for self-supervised depth, in the past this was shown to degrade performance instead of improving it. In this paper, we put forward a method that uses augmentations to remedy this problem. By exploiting the correspondence between unaugmented and augmented data we introduce a pseudo-supervised loss for both depth and pose estimation. This brings back some of the benefits of supervised learning while still not requiring any labels. We also make a series of practical recommendations which collectively offer a reliable, efficient framework for weather-related augmentation of self-supervised depth from monocular video. We present extensive testing to show that our method, Robust-Depth, achieves SotA performance on the KITTI dataset while significantly surpassing SotA on challenging, adverse condition data such as DrivingStereo, Foggy CityScape and NuScenes-Night.

- **Summary**: We propose a distributed bundle adjustment (DBA) method using the exact Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for super large-scale datasets. Most of the existing methods partition the global map to small ones and conduct bundle adjustment in the submaps. In order to fit the parallel framework, they use approximate solutions instead of the LM algorithm. However, those methods often give sub-optimal results. Different from them, we utilize the exact LM algorithm to conduct global bundle adjustment where the formation of the reduced camera system (RCS) is actually parallelized and executed in a distributed way. To store the large RCS, we compress it with a block-based sparse matrix compression format (BSMC), which fully exploits its block feature. The BSMC format also enables the distributed storage and updating of the global RCS. The proposed method is extensively evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art pipelines using both synthetic and real datasets. Preliminary results demonstrate the efficient memory usage and vast scalability of the proposed method compared with the baselines. For the first time, we conducted parallel bundle adjustment using LM algorithm on a real datasets with 1.18 million images and a synthetic dataset with 10 million images (about 500 times that of the state-of-the-art LM-based BA) on a distributed computing system.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of topological tubular structures, such as blood vessels and roads, is crucial in various fields, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in downstream tasks. However, many factors complicate the task, including thin local structures and variable global morphologies. In this work, we note the specificity of tubular structures and use this knowledge to guide our DSCNet to simultaneously enhance perception in three stages: feature extraction, feature fusion, and loss constraint. First, we propose a dynamic snake convolution to accurately capture the features of tubular structures by adaptively focusing on slender and tortuous local structures. Subsequently, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy to complement the attention to features from multiple perspectives during feature fusion, ensuring the retention of important information from different global morphologies. Finally, a continuity constraint loss function, based on persistent homology, is proposed to constrain the topological continuity of the segmentation better. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets show that our DSCNet provides better accuracy and continuity on the tubular structure segmentation task compared with several methods. Our codes will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to re-assess scene text recognition (STR) from a data-oriented perspective. We begin by revisiting the six commonly used benchmarks in STR and observe a trend of performance saturation, whereby only 2.91% of the benchmark images cannot be accurately recognized by an ensemble of 13 representative models. While these results are impressive and suggest that STR could be considered solved, however, we argue that this is primarily due to the less challenging nature of the common benchmarks, thus concealing the underlying issues that STR faces. To this end, we consolidate a large-scale real STR dataset, namely Union14M, which comprises 4 million labeled images and 10 million unlabeled images, to assess the performance of STR models in more complex real-world scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the 13 models can only achieve an average accuracy of 66.53% on the 4 million labeled images, indicating that STR still faces numerous challenges in the real world. By analyzing the error patterns of the 13 models, we identify seven open challenges in STR and develop a challenge-driven benchmark consisting of eight distinct subsets to facilitate further progress in the field. Our exploration demonstrates that STR is far from being solved and leveraging data may be a promising solution. In this regard, we find that utilizing the 10 million unlabeled images through self-supervised pre-training can significantly improve the robustness of STR model in real-world scenarios and leads to state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Researchers have recently begun exploring the use of StyleGAN-based models for real image editing. One particularly interesting application is using natural language descriptions to guide the editing process. Existing approaches for editing images using language either resort to instance-level latent code optimization or map predefined text prompts to some editing directions in the latent space. However, these approaches have inherent limitations. The former is not very efficient, while the latter often struggles to effectively handle multi-attribute changes. To address these weaknesses, we present CLIPInverter, a new text-driven image editing approach that is able to efficiently and reliably perform multi-attribute changes. The core of our method is the use of novel, lightweight text-conditioned adapter layers integrated into pretrained GAN-inversion networks. We demonstrate that by conditioning the initial inversion step on the CLIP embedding of the target description, we are able to obtain more successful edit directions. Additionally, we use a CLIP-guided refinement step to make corrections in the resulting residual latent codes, which further improves the alignment with the text prompt. Our method outperforms competing approaches in terms of manipulation accuracy and photo-realism on various domains including human faces, cats, and birds, as shown by our qualitative and quantitative results.

- **Summary**: Curating an informative and representative dataset is essential for enhancing the performance of 2D object detectors. We present a novel active learning sampling strategy that addresses both the informativeness and diversity of the selections. Our strategy integrates uncertainty and diversity-based selection principles into a joint selection objective by measuring the collective information score of the selected samples. Specifically, our proposed NORIS algorithm quantifies the impact of training with a sample on the informativeness of other similar samples. By exclusively selecting samples that are simultaneously informative and distant from other highly informative samples, we effectively avoid redundancy while maintaining a high level of informativeness. Moreover, instead of utilizing whole image features to calculate distances between samples, we leverage features extracted from detected object regions within images to define object features. This allows us to construct a dataset encompassing diverse object types, shapes, and angles. Extensive experiments on object detection and image classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy over the state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, our selection strategy achieves a 20% and 30% reduction in labeling costs compared to random selection for PASCAL-VOC and KITTI, respectively.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel semi-supervised active learning (SSAL) framework for monocular 3D object detection with LiDAR guidance (MonoLiG), which leverages all modalities of collected data during model development. We utilize LiDAR to guide the data selection and training of monocular 3D detectors without introducing any overhead in the inference phase. During training, we leverage the LiDAR teacher, monocular student cross-modal framework from semi-supervised learning to distill information from unlabeled data as pseudo-labels. To handle the differences in sensor characteristics, we propose a data noise-based weighting mechanism to reduce the effect of propagating noise from LiDAR modality to monocular. For selecting which samples to label to improve the model performance, we propose a sensor consistency-based selection score that is also coherent with the training objective. Extensive experimental results on KITTI and Waymo datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework. In particular, our selection strategy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art active learning baselines, yielding up to 17% better saving rate in labeling costs. Our training strategy attains the top place in KITTI 3D and birds-eye-view (BEV) monocular object detection official benchmarks by improving the BEV Average Precision (AP) by 2.02.

- **Summary**: Visual Place recognition is commonly addressed as an image retrieval problem. However, retrieval methods are impractical to scale to large datasets, densely sampled from city-wide maps, since their dimension impact negatively on the inference time. Using approximate nearest neighbour search for retrieval helps to mitigate this issue, at the cost of a performance drop. In this paper we investigate whether we can effectively approach this task as a classification problem, thus bypassing the need for a similarity search. We find that existing classification methods for coarse, planet-wide localization are not suitable for the fine-grained and city-wide setting. This is largely due to how the dataset is split into classes, because these methods are designed to handle a sparse distribution of photos and as such do not consider the visual aliasing problem across neighbouring classes that naturally arises in dense scenarios. Thus, we propose a partitioning scheme that enables a fast and accurate inference, preserving a simple learning procedure, and a novel inference pipeline based on an ensemble of novel classifiers that uses the prototypes learned via an angular margin loss. Our method, Divide&Classify (D&C), enjoys the fast inference of classification solutions and an accuracy competitive with retrieval methods on the fine-grained, city-wide setting. Moreover, we show that D&C can be paired with existing retrieval pipelines to speed up computations by over 20 times while increasing their recall, leading to new state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to segment the novel class images with a few annotated samples. In this paper, we propose a dense affinity matching (DAM) framework to exploit the support-query interaction by densely capturing both the pixel-to-pixel and pixel-to-patch relations in each support-query pair with the bidirectional 3D convolutions. Different from the existing methods that remove the support background, we design a hysteretic spatial filtering module (HSFM) to filter the background-related query features and retain the foreground-related query features with the assistance of the support background, which is beneficial for eliminating interference objects in the query background. We comprehensively evaluate our DAM on ten benchmarks under cross-category, cross-dataset, and cross-domain FSS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that DAM performs very competitively under different settings with only 0.68M parameters, especially under cross-domain FSS tasks, showing its effectiveness and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a large model to a small one via task and distillation losses. In this paper, we observe a trade-off between task and distillation losses, i.e., introducing distillation loss limits the convergence of task loss. We believe that the trade-off results from the insufficient optimization of distillation loss. The reason is: The teacher has a lower task loss than the student, and a lower distillation loss drives the student more similar to the teacher, then a better-converged task loss could be obtained. To break the trade-off, we propose the Distillation-Oriented Trainer (DOT). DOT separately considers gradients of task and distillation losses, then applies a larger momentum to distillation loss to accelerate its optimization. We empirically prove that DOT breaks the trade-off, i.e., both losses are sufficiently optimized. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of DOT. Notably, DOT achieves a +2.59% accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1k for the ResNet50-MobileNetV1 pair. Conclusively, DOT greatly benefits the student's optimization properties in terms of loss convergence and model generalization. Code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Conditional diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in image manipulation tasks. The general pipeline involves adding noise to the image and then denoising it. However, this method faces a trade-off problem: adding too much noise affects the fidelity of the image while adding too little affects its editability. This largely limits their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Selective Diffusion Distillation (SDD), that ensures both the fidelity and editability of images. Instead of directly editing images with a diffusion model, we train a feedforward image manipulation network under the guidance of the diffusion model. Besides, we propose an effective indicator to select the semantic-related timestep to obtain the correct semantic guidance from the diffusion model. This approach successfully avoids the dilemma caused by the diffusion process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our framework.

- **Summary**: Lateral ventricular volume (LVV) is an important biomarker for clinical investigation. We present the first transfer learning-based LVV segmentation method for fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. To mitigate covariate shifts between source and target domains, this work proposes an domain adaptation method that optimizes performance on three target datasets. Silver standard (SS) masks were generated from the target domain using a novel conventional image processing ventricular segmentation algorithm and used to supplement the gold standard (GS) data from the source domain, Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN). Four models were tested on held-out test sets from four datasets: 1) SS+GS: trained on target SS masks and fine-tuned on source GS masks, 2) GS+SS: trained on source GS masks and fine-tuned on target SS masks, 3) trained on source GS (GS CAIN Only) and 4) trained on target SS masks (SS Only). The SS+GS model had the best and most consistent performance (mean DSC = 0.89, CoV = 0.05) and showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher DSC compared to the GS-only model on three target domains. Results suggest pre-training with noisy labels from the target domain allows the model to adapt to the dataset-specific characteristics and provides robust parameter initialization while fine-tuning with GS masks allows the model to learn detailed features. This method has wide application to other medical imaging problems where labeled data is scarce, and can be used as a per-dataset calibration method to accelerate wide-scale adoption.

- **Summary**: Undetected partial discharges (PDs) are a safety critical issue in high voltage (HV) gas insulated systems (GIS). While the diagnosis of PDs under AC voltage is well-established, the analysis of PDs under DC voltage remains an active research field. A key focus of these investigations is the classification of different PD sources to enable subsequent sophisticated analysis.   In this paper, we propose and analyze a neural network-based approach for classifying PD signals caused by metallic protrusions and conductive particles on the insulator of HVDC GIS, without relying on pulse sequence analysis features. In contrast to previous approaches, our proposed model can discriminate the studied PD signals obtained at negative and positive potentials, while also generalizing to unseen operating voltage multiples. Additionally, we compare the performance of time- and frequency-domain input signals and explore the impact of different normalization schemes to mitigate the influence of free-space path loss between the sensor and defect location.

- **Summary**: Scattering networks yield powerful and robust hierarchical image descriptors which do not require lengthy training and which work well with very few training data. However, they rely on sampling the scale dimension. Hence, they become sensitive to scale variations and are unable to generalize to unseen scales. In this work, we define an alternative feature representation based on the Riesz transform. We detail and analyze the mathematical foundations behind this representation. In particular, it inherits scale equivariance from the Riesz transform and completely avoids sampling of the scale dimension. Additionally, the number of features in the representation is reduced by a factor four compared to scattering networks. Nevertheless, our representation performs comparably well for texture classification with an interesting addition: scale equivariance. Our method yields superior performance when dealing with scales outside of those covered by the training dataset. The usefulness of the equivariance property is demonstrated on the digit classification task, where accuracy remains stable even for scales four times larger than the one chosen for training. As a second example, we consider classification of textures.

- **Summary**: Transformer and its variants have been widely used for medical image segmentation. However, the large number of parameter and computational load of these models make them unsuitable for mobile health applications. To address this issue, we propose a more efficient approach, the Efficient Group Enhanced UNet (EGE-UNet). We incorporate a Group multi-axis Hadamard Product Attention module (GHPA) and a Group Aggregation Bridge module (GAB) in a lightweight manner. The GHPA groups input features and performs Hadamard Product Attention mechanism (HPA) on different axes to extract pathological information from diverse perspectives. The GAB effectively fuses multi-scale information by grouping low-level features, high-level features, and a mask generated by the decoder at each stage. Comprehensive experiments on the ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets demonstrate that EGE-UNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In short, compared to the TransFuse, our model achieves superior segmentation performance while reducing parameter and computation costs by 494x and 160x, respectively. Moreover, to our best knowledge, this is the first model with a parameter count limited to just 50KB. Our code is available at https://github.com/JCruan519/EGE-UNet.

- **Summary**: Skeleton sequence representation learning has shown great advantages for action recognition due to its promising ability to model human joints and topology. However, the current methods usually require sufficient labeled data for training computationally expensive models, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, these methods ignore how to utilize the fine-grained dependencies among different skeleton joints to pre-train an efficient skeleton sequence learning model that can generalize well across different datasets. In this paper, we propose an efficient skeleton sequence learning framework, named Skeleton Sequence Learning (SSL). To comprehensively capture the human pose and obtain discriminative skeleton sequence representation, we build an asymmetric graph-based encoder-decoder pre-training architecture named SkeletonMAE, which embeds skeleton joint sequence into Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and reconstructs the masked skeleton joints and edges based on the prior human topology knowledge. Then, the pre-trained SkeletonMAE encoder is integrated with the Spatial-Temporal Representation Learning (STRL) module to build the SSL framework. Extensive experimental results show that our SSL generalizes well across different datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods on FineGym, Diving48, NTU 60 and NTU 120 datasets. Additionally, we obtain comparable performance to some fully supervised methods. The code is avaliable at https://github.com/HongYan1123/SkeletonMAE.

- **Summary**: Deep learning algorithms are increasingly employed at the edge. However, edge devices are resource constrained and thus require efficient deployment of deep neural networks. Pruning methods are a key tool for edge deployment as they can improve storage, compute, memory bandwidth, and energy usage. In this paper we propose a novel accurate pruning technique that allows precise control over the output network size. Our method uses an efficient optimal transportation scheme which we make end-to-end differentiable and which automatically tunes the exploration-exploitation behavior of the algorithm to find accurate sparse sub-networks. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous pruning methods on 3 different datasets, using 5 different models, across a wide range of pruning ratios, and with two types of sparsity budgets and pruning granularities.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel network, SVDFormer, to tackle two specific challenges in point cloud completion: understanding faithful global shapes from incomplete point clouds and generating high-accuracy local structures. Current methods either perceive shape patterns using only 3D coordinates or import extra images with well-calibrated intrinsic parameters to guide the geometry estimation of the missing parts. However, these approaches do not always fully leverage the cross-modal self-structures available for accurate and high-quality point cloud completion. To this end, we first design a Self-view Fusion Network that leverages multiple-view depth image information to observe incomplete self-shape and generate a compact global shape. To reveal highly detailed structures, we then introduce a refinement module, called Self-structure Dual-generator, in which we incorporate learned shape priors and geometric self-similarities for producing new points. By perceiving the incompleteness of each point, the dual-path design disentangles refinement strategies conditioned on the structural type of each point. SVDFormer absorbs the wisdom of self-structures, avoiding any additional paired information such as color images with precisely calibrated camera intrinsic parameters. Comprehensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks. Code will be available at https://github.com/czvvd/SVDFormer.

- **Summary**: Distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a double-edged sword for vision transformers (ViTs). It boosts the performance since the image-friendly local-inductive bias of CNN helps ViT learn faster and better, but leading to two problems: (1) Network designs of CNN and ViT are completely different, which leads to different semantic levels of intermediate features, making spatial-wise knowledge transfer methods (e.g., feature mimicking) inefficient. (2) Distilling knowledge from CNN limits the network convergence in the later training period since ViT's capability of integrating global information is suppressed by CNN's local-inductive-bias supervision. To this end, we present Cumulative Spatial Knowledge Distillation (CSKD). CSKD distills spatial-wise knowledge to all patch tokens of ViT from the corresponding spatial responses of CNN, without introducing intermediate features. Furthermore, CSKD exploits a Cumulative Knowledge Fusion (CKF) module, which introduces the global response of CNN and increasingly emphasizes its importance during the training. Applying CKF leverages CNN's local inductive bias in the early training period and gives full play to ViT's global capability in the later one. Extensive experiments and analysis on ImageNet-1k and downstream datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CSKD. Code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health crisis, highlighting the need for rapid and accurate virus detection. This research paper examines transfer learning with vision transformers for COVID-19 detection, known for its excellent performance in image recognition tasks. We leverage the capability of Vision Transformers to capture global context and learn complex patterns from chest X-ray images. In this work, we explored the recent state-of-art transformer models to detect Covid-19 using CXR images such as vision transformer (ViT), Swin-transformer, Max vision transformer (MViT), and Pyramid Vision transformer (PVT). Through the utilization of transfer learning with IMAGENET weights, the models achieved an impressive accuracy range of 98.75% to 99.5%. Our experiments demonstrate that Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance in COVID-19 detection, outperforming traditional methods and even Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The results highlight the potential of Vision Transformers as a powerful tool for COVID-19 detection, with implications for improving the efficiency and accuracy of screening and diagnosis in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) based Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have demonstrated impressive performance in various tasks. However, the lengthy visual token sequences fed into ViT can lead to training inefficiency and ineffectiveness. Existing efforts address the challenge by either bottom-level patch extraction in the ViT backbone or top-level patch abstraction outside, not balancing training efficiency and effectiveness well. Inspired by text summarization in natural language processing, we propose a Bottom-Up Patch Summarization approach named BUS, coordinating bottom-level extraction and top-level abstraction to learn a concise summary of lengthy visual token sequences efficiently. Specifically, We incorporate a Text-Semantics-Aware Patch Selector (TSPS) into the ViT backbone to perform a coarse-grained visual token extraction and then attach a flexible Transformer-based Patch Abstraction Decoder (PAD) upon the backbone for top-level visual abstraction. This bottom-up collaboration enables our BUS to yield high training efficiency while maintaining or even improving effectiveness. We evaluate our approach on various visual-language understanding and generation tasks and show competitive downstream task performance while boosting the training efficiency by 50\%. Additionally, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on many downstream tasks by increasing input image resolution without increasing computational costs over baselines.

- **Summary**: We aim to investigate whether end-to-end learning of visual reasoning can be achieved with general-purpose neural networks, with the help of visual pretraining. A positive result would refute the common belief that explicit visual abstraction (e.g. object detection) is essential for compositional generalization on visual reasoning, and confirm the feasibility of a neural network "generalist" to solve visual recognition and reasoning tasks. We propose a simple and general self-supervised framework which "compresses" each video frame into a small set of tokens with a transformer network, and reconstructs the remaining frames based on the compressed temporal context. To minimize the reconstruction loss, the network must learn a compact representation for each image, as well as capture temporal dynamics and object permanence from temporal context. We perform evaluation on two visual reasoning benchmarks, CATER and ACRE. We observe that pretraining is essential to achieve compositional generalization for end-to-end visual reasoning. Our proposed framework outperforms traditional supervised pretraining, including image classification and explicit object detection, by large margins.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), it has become common practice in many learning tasks to train or fine-tune large models on synthetic data due to the data-scarcity and privacy leakage problems. Albeit promising with unlimited data generation, owing to massive and diverse information conveyed in real images, it is challenging for text-to-image generative models to synthesize informative training data with hand-crafted prompts, which usually leads to inferior generalization performance when training downstream models. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the relationship between the training effect of synthetic data and the synthetic data distribution induced by prompts. Then we correspondingly propose a simple yet effective method that prompts text-to-image generative models to synthesize more informative and diverse training data. Specifically, we caption each real image with the advanced captioning model to obtain informative and faithful prompts that extract class-relevant information and clarify the polysemy of class names. The image captions and class names are concatenated to prompt generative models for training image synthesis. Extensive experiments on ImageNette, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K verify that our method significantly improves the performance of models trained on synthetic training data, i.e., 10% classification accuracy improvements on average.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional networks are ubiquitous in computer vision, due to their excellent performance across different tasks for various domains. Models are, however, often trained in isolation for each task, failing to exploit relatedness between tasks and domains to learn more compact models that generalise better in low-data regimes. Multi-domain learning aims to handle related tasks, such as image classification across multiple domains, simultaneously. Previous work on this problem explored the use of a pre-trained and fixed domain-agnostic base network, in combination with smaller learnable domain-specific adaptation modules. In this paper, we introduce Modulation Adapters, which update the convolutional filter weights of the model in a multiplicative manner for each task. Parameterising these adaptation weights in a factored manner allows us to scale the number of per-task parameters in a flexible manner, and to strike different parameter-accuracy trade-offs. We evaluate our approach on the Visual Decathlon challenge, composed of ten image classification tasks across different domains, and on the ImageNet-to-Sketch benchmark, which consists of six image classification tasks. Our approach yields excellent results, with accuracies that are comparable to or better than those of existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current gold standard for the assessment of cardiac anatomy and function. However, it typically only acquires a set of two-dimensional (2D) slices of the underlying three-dimensional (3D) anatomy of the heart, thus limiting the understanding and analysis of both healthy and pathological cardiac morphology and physiology. In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic surface reconstruction pipeline capable of reconstructing multi-class 3D cardiac anatomy meshes from raw cine MRI acquisitions. Its key component is a multi-class point cloud completion network (PCCN) capable of correcting both the sparsity and misalignment issues of the 3D reconstruction task in a unified model. We first evaluate the PCCN on a large synthetic dataset of biventricular anatomies and observe Chamfer distances between reconstructed and gold standard anatomies below or similar to the underlying image resolution for multiple levels of slice misalignment. Furthermore, we find a reduction in reconstruction error compared to a benchmark 3D U-Net by 32% and 24% in terms of Hausdorff distance and mean surface distance, respectively. We then apply the PCCN as part of our automated reconstruction pipeline to 1000 subjects from the UK Biobank study in a cross-domain transfer setting and demonstrate its ability to reconstruct accurate and topologically plausible biventricular heart meshes with clinical metrics comparable to the previous literature. Finally, we investigate the robustness of our proposed approach and observe its capacity to successfully handle multiple common outlier conditions.

- **Summary**: RGB-T semantic segmentation has been widely adopted to handle hard scenes with poor lighting conditions by fusing different modality features of RGB and thermal images. Existing methods try to find an optimal fusion feature for segmentation, resulting in sensitivity to modality noise, class-imbalance, and modality bias. To overcome the problems, this paper proposes a novel Variational Probabilistic Fusion Network (VPFNet), which regards fusion features as random variables and obtains robust segmentation by averaging segmentation results under multiple samples of fusion features. The random samples generation of fusion features in VPFNet is realized by a novel Variational Feature Fusion Module (VFFM) designed based on variation attention. To further avoid class-imbalance and modality bias, we employ the weighted cross-entropy loss and introduce prior information of illumination and category to control the proposed VFFM. Experimental results on MFNet and PST900 datasets demonstrate that the proposed VPFNet can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Look-up table(LUT)-based methods have shown the great efficacy in single image super-resolution (SR) task. However, previous methods ignore the essential reason of restricted receptive field (RF) size in LUT, which is caused by the interaction of space and channel features in vanilla convolution. They can only increase the RF at the cost of linearly increasing LUT size. To enlarge RF with contained LUT sizes, we propose a novel Reconstructed Convolution(RC) module, which decouples channel-wise and spatial calculation. It can be formulated as $n^2$ 1D LUTs to maintain $n\times n$ receptive field, which is obviously smaller than $n\times n$D LUT formulated before. The LUT generated by our RC module reaches less than 1/10000 storage compared with SR-LUT baseline. The proposed Reconstructed Convolution module based LUT method, termed as RCLUT, can enlarge the RF size by 9 times than the state-of-the-art LUT-based SR method and achieve superior performance on five popular benchmark dataset. Moreover, the efficient and robust RC module can be used as a plugin to improve other LUT-based SR methods. The code is available at https://github.com/liuguandu/RC-LUT.

- **Summary**: The plant community composition is an essential indicator of environmental changes and is, for this reason, usually analyzed in ecological field studies in terms of the so-called plant cover. The manual acquisition of this kind of data is time-consuming, laborious, and prone to human error. Automated camera systems can collect high-resolution images of the surveyed vegetation plots at a high frequency. In combination with subsequent algorithmic analysis, it is possible to objectively extract information on plant community composition quickly and with little human effort. An automated camera system can easily collect the large amounts of image data necessary to train a Deep Learning system for automatic analysis. However, due to the amount of work required to annotate vegetation images with plant cover data, only few labeled samples are available. As automated camera systems can collect many pictures without labels, we introduce an approach to interpolate the sparse labels in the collected vegetation plot time series down to the intermediate dense and unlabeled images to artificially increase our training dataset to seven times its original size. Moreover, we introduce a new method we call Monte-Carlo Cropping. This approach trains on a collection of cropped parts of the training images to deal with high-resolution images efficiently, implicitly augment the training images, and speed up training. We evaluate both approaches on a plant cover dataset containing images of herbaceous plant communities and find that our methods lead to improvements in the species, community, and segmentation metrics investigated.



### On the Fly Neural Style Smoothing for Risk-Averse Domain Generalization

- **Summary**: Achieving high accuracy on data from domains unseen during training is a fundamental challenge in domain generalization (DG). While state-of-the-art DG classifiers have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, they have shown a bias towards domain-dependent information, such as image styles, rather than domain-invariant information, such as image content. This bias renders them unreliable for deployment in risk-sensitive scenarios such as autonomous driving where a misclassification could lead to catastrophic consequences. To enable risk-averse predictions from a DG classifier, we propose a novel inference procedure, Test-Time Neural Style Smoothing (TT-NSS), that uses a "style-smoothed" version of the DG classifier for prediction at test time. Specifically, the style-smoothed classifier classifies a test image as the most probable class predicted by the DG classifier on random re-stylizations of the test image. TT-NSS uses a neural style transfer module to stylize a test image on the fly, requires only black-box access to the DG classifier, and crucially, abstains when predictions of the DG classifier on the stylized test images lack consensus. Additionally, we propose a neural style smoothing (NSS) based training procedure that can be seamlessly integrated with existing DG methods. This procedure enhances prediction consistency, improving the performance of TT-NSS on non-abstained samples. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of TT-NSS and NSS at producing and improving risk-averse predictions on unseen domains from DG classifiers trained with SOTA training methods on various benchmark datasets and their variations.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new vision Transformer, Scale-Aware Modulation Transformer (SMT), that can handle various downstream tasks efficiently by combining the convolutional network and vision Transformer. The proposed Scale-Aware Modulation (SAM) in the SMT includes two primary novel designs. Firstly, we introduce the Multi-Head Mixed Convolution (MHMC) module, which can capture multi-scale features and expand the receptive field. Secondly, we propose the Scale-Aware Aggregation (SAA) module, which is lightweight but effective, enabling information fusion across different heads. By leveraging these two modules, convolutional modulation is further enhanced. Furthermore, in contrast to prior works that utilized modulations throughout all stages to build an attention-free network, we propose an Evolutionary Hybrid Network (EHN), which can effectively simulate the shift from capturing local to global dependencies as the network becomes deeper, resulting in superior performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SMT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across a wide range of visual tasks. Specifically, SMT with 11.5M / 2.4GFLOPs and 32M / 7.7GFLOPs can achieve 82.2% and 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, respectively. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224^2 resolution, it attains 87.1% and 88.1% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224^2 and 384^2, respectively. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, the SMT base trained with 1x and 3x schedule outperforms the Swin Transformer counterpart by 4.2 and 1.3 mAP on COCO, respectively. For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, the SMT base test at single- and multi-scale surpasses Swin by 2.0 and 1.1 mIoU respectively on the ADE20K.

- **Summary**: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable abilities at interacting with humans through language, especially with the usage of instruction-following data. Recent advancements in LLMs, such as MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, and X-LLM, further enlarge their abilities by incorporating multi-modal inputs, including image, video, and speech. Despite their effectiveness at generating precise and detailed language understanding of the given modality signal, these LLMs give up the ability to ground specific parts of inputs, thus only constructing a coarse-grained mapping. However, explicit and informative correspondence between text and other modalities will not only improve the user experience but also help to expand the application scenario of multi-modal LLMs. Therefore, we propose BuboGPT, a multi-modal LLM with visual grounding that can perform cross-modal interaction between vision, audio and language, providing fine-grained understanding of visual objects and other given modalities. As a result, BuboGPT is able to point out the specific location of an object in the image, when it is generating response or description for that object. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) An off-the-shelf visual grounding module based on SAM that extracts entities in a sentence and find corresponding masks in the image. 2) A two-stage training scheme and instruction dataset to endow joint text-image-audio understanding. Our experiments show that BuboGPT achieves impressive multi-modality understanding and visual grounding abilities during the interaction with human. It performs consistently well when provided by arbitrary modality combinations (either aligned or unaligned). Our code, model and dataset are available at https://bubo-gpt.github.io .

- **Summary**: The performance of automated face recognition systems is inevitably impacted by the facial aging process. However, high quality datasets of individuals collected over several years are typically small in scale. In this work, we propose, train, and validate the use of latent text-to-image diffusion models for synthetically aging and de-aging face images. Our models succeed with few-shot training, and have the added benefit of being controllable via intuitive textual prompting. We observe high degrees of visual realism in the generated images while maintaining biometric fidelity measured by commonly used metrics. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (CelebA and AgeDB) and observe significant reduction (~44%) in the False Non-Match Rate compared to existing state-of the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: In this study, we aim to develop a model that comprehends a natural language instruction (e.g., "Go to the living room and get the nearest pillow to the radio art on the wall") and generates a segmentation mask for the target everyday object. The task is challenging because it requires (1) the understanding of the referring expressions for multiple objects in the instruction, (2) the prediction of the target phrase of the sentence among the multiple phrases, and (3) the generation of pixel-wise segmentation masks rather than bounding boxes. Studies have been conducted on languagebased segmentation methods; however, they sometimes mask irrelevant regions for complex sentences. In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Diffusion Segmentation Model (MDSM), which generates a mask in the first stage and refines it in the second stage. We introduce a crossmodal parallel feature extraction mechanism and extend diffusion probabilistic models to handle crossmodal features. To validate our model, we built a new dataset based on the well-known Matterport3D and REVERIE datasets. This dataset consists of instructions with complex referring expressions accompanied by real indoor environmental images that feature various target objects, in addition to pixel-wise segmentation masks. The performance of MDSM surpassed that of the baseline method by a large margin of +10.13 mean IoU.

- **Summary**: Traditional minutiae-based fingerprint representations consist of a variable-length set of minutiae. This necessitates a more complex comparison causing the drawback of high computational cost in one-to-many comparison. Recently, deep neural networks have been proposed to extract fixed-length embeddings from fingerprints. In this paper, we explore to what extent fingerprint texture information contained in such embeddings can be reduced in terms of dimension while preserving high biometric performance. This is of particular interest since it would allow to reduce the number of operations incurred at comparisons. We also study the impact in terms of recognition performance of the fingerprint textural information for two sensor types, i.e. optical and capacitive. Furthermore, the impact of rotation and translation of fingerprint images on the extraction of fingerprint embeddings is analysed. Experimental results conducted on a publicly available database reveal an optimal embedding size of 512 feature elements for the texture-based embedding part of fixed-length fingerprint representations. In addition, differences in performance between sensor types can be perceived.

- **Summary**: Recent video inpainting methods have made remarkable progress by utilizing explicit guidance, such as optical flow, to propagate cross-frame pixels. However, there are cases where cross-frame recurrence of the masked video is not available, resulting in a deficiency. In such situation, instead of borrowing pixels from other frames, the focus of the model shifts towards addressing the inverse problem. In this paper, we introduce a dual-modality-compatible inpainting framework called Deficiency-aware Masked Transformer (DMT), which offers three key advantages. Firstly, we pretrain a image inpainting model DMT_img serve as a prior for distilling the video model DMT_vid, thereby benefiting the hallucination of deficiency cases. Secondly, the self-attention module selectively incorporates spatiotemporal tokens to accelerate inference and remove noise signals. Thirdly, a simple yet effective Receptive Field Contextualizer is integrated into DMT, further improving performance. Extensive experiments conducted on YouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets demonstrate that DMT_vid significantly outperforms previous solutions. The code and video demonstrations can be found at github.com/yeates/DMT.

- **Summary**: We present PolyGNN, a polyhedron-based graph neural network for 3D building reconstruction from point clouds. PolyGNN learns to assemble primitives obtained by polyhedral decomposition via graph node classification, achieving a watertight, compact, and weakly semantic reconstruction. To effectively represent arbitrary-shaped polyhedra in the neural network, we propose three different sampling strategies to select representative points as polyhedron-wise queries, enabling efficient occupancy inference. Furthermore, we incorporate the inter-polyhedron adjacency to enhance the classification of the graph nodes. We also observe that existing city-building models are abstractions of the underlying instances. To address this abstraction gap and provide a fair evaluation of the proposed method, we develop our method on a large-scale synthetic dataset covering 500k+ buildings with well-defined ground truths of polyhedral class labels. We further conduct a transferability analysis across cities and on real-world point clouds. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, particularly its efficiency for large-scale reconstructions. The source code and data of our work are available at https://github.com/chenzhaiyu/polygnn.

- **Summary**: Since their first applications, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have solved problems that have advanced the state-of-the-art in several domains. CNNs represent information using real numbers. Despite encouraging results, theoretical analysis shows that representations such as hyper-complex numbers can achieve richer representational capacities than real numbers, and that Hamilton products can capture intrinsic interchannel relationships. Moreover, in the last few years, experimental research has shown that Quaternion-Valued CNNs (QCNNs) can achieve similar performance with fewer parameters than their real-valued counterparts. This paper condenses research in the development of QCNNs from its very beginnings. We propose a conceptual organization of current trends and analyze the main building blocks used in the design of QCNN models. Based on this conceptual organization, we propose future directions of research.

These solutions should be characterised by high efficiency in recognising obstacles and other environmental elements in different road conditions, real-time capability, and energy efficiency. Achieving such functionality requires an appropriate algorithm and a suitable computing platform. In this paper, we have used the MultiTaskV3 detection-segmentation network as the basis for a perception system that can perform both functionalities within a single architecture. It was appropriately trained, quantised, and implemented on the AMD Xilinx Kria KV260 Vision AI embedded platform. By using this device, it was possible to parallelise and accelerate the computations. Furthermore, the whole system consumes relatively little power compared to a CPU-based implementation (an average of 5 watts, compared to the minimum of 55 watts for weaker CPUs, and the small size (119mm x 140mm x 36mm) of the platform allows it to be used in devices where the amount of space available is limited. It also achieves an accuracy higher than 97% of the mAP (mean average precision) for object detection and above 90% of the mIoU (mean intersection over union) for image segmentation. The article also details the design of the Mecanum wheel vehicle, which was used to test the proposed solution in a mock-up city.

- **Summary**: While recent supervised methods for reference-based object counting continue to improve the performance on benchmark datasets, they have to rely on small datasets due to the cost associated with manually annotating dozens of objects in images. We propose Unsupervised Counter (UnCo), a model that can learn this task without requiring any manual annotations. To this end, we construct "SelfCollages", images with various pasted objects as training samples, that provide a rich learning signal covering arbitrary object types and counts. Our method builds on existing unsupervised representations and segmentation techniques to successfully demonstrate the ability to count objects without manual supervision. Our experiments show that our method not only outperforms simple baselines and generic models such as FasterRCNN, but also matches the performance of supervised counting models in some domains.

- **Summary**: With continuous progression of Moore's Law, integrated circuit (IC) device complexity is also increasing. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image based extensive defect inspection and accurate metrology extraction are two main challenges in advanced node (2 nm and beyond) technology. Deep learning (DL) algorithm based computer vision approaches gained popularity in semiconductor defect inspection over last few years. In this research work, a new semiconductor defect inspection framework "SEMI-DiffusionInst" is investigated and compared to previous frameworks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first demonstration to accurately detect and precisely segment semiconductor defect patterns by using a diffusion model. Different feature extractor networks as backbones and data sampling strategies are investigated towards achieving a balanced trade-off between precision and computing efficiency. Our proposed approach outperforms previous work on overall mAP and performs comparatively better or as per for almost all defect classes (per class APs). The bounding box and segmentation mAPs achieved by the proposed SEMI-DiffusionInst model are improved by 3.83% and 2.10%, respectively. Among individual defect types, precision on line collapse and thin bridge defects are improved approximately 15\% on detection task for both defect types. It has also been shown that by tuning inference hyperparameters, inference time can be improved significantly without compromising model precision. Finally, certain limitations and future work strategy to overcome them are discussed.

- **Summary**: Video depth estimation aims to infer temporally consistent depth. Some methods achieve temporal consistency by finetuning a single-image depth model during test time using geometry and re-projection constraints, which is inefficient and not robust. An alternative approach is to learn how to enforce temporal consistency from data, but this requires well-designed models and sufficient video depth data. To address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play framework called Neural Video Depth Stabilizer (NVDS) that stabilizes inconsistent depth estimations and can be applied to different single-image depth models without extra effort. We also introduce a large-scale dataset, Video Depth in the Wild (VDW), which consists of 14,203 videos with over two million frames, making it the largest natural-scene video depth dataset to our knowledge. We evaluate our method on the VDW dataset as well as two public benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in consistency, accuracy, and efficiency compared to previous approaches. Our work serves as a solid baseline and provides a data foundation for learning-based video depth models. We will release our dataset and code for future research.

- **Summary**: Flow matching is a recent framework to train generative models that exhibits impressive empirical performance while being relatively easier to train compared with diffusion-based models. Despite its advantageous properties, prior methods still face the challenges of expensive computing and a large number of function evaluations of off-the-shelf solvers in the pixel space. Furthermore, although latent-based generative methods have shown great success in recent years, this particular model type remains underexplored in this area. In this work, we propose to apply flow matching in the latent spaces of pretrained autoencoders, which offers improved computational efficiency and scalability for high-resolution image synthesis. This enables flow-matching training on constrained computational resources while maintaining their quality and flexibility. Additionally, our work stands as a pioneering contribution in the integration of various conditions into flow matching for conditional generation tasks, including label-conditioned image generation, image inpainting, and semantic-to-image generation. Through extensive experiments, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in both quantitative and qualitative results on various datasets, such as CelebA-HQ, FFHQ, LSUN Church & Bedroom, and ImageNet. We also provide a theoretical control of the Wasserstein-2 distance between the reconstructed latent flow distribution and true data distribution, showing it is upper-bounded by the latent flow matching objective. Our code will be available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/LFM.git.

- **Summary**: Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) is a challenging task in Scene Graph Generation (SGG) that aims to create a more comprehensive scene graph representation using panoptic segmentation instead of boxes. Compared to SGG, PSG has several challenging problems: pixel-level segment outputs and full relationship exploration (It also considers thing and stuff relation). Thus, current PSG methods have limited performance, which hinders downstream tasks or applications. The goal of this work aims to design a novel and strong baseline for PSG. To achieve that, we first conduct an in-depth analysis to identify the bottleneck of the current PSG models, finding that inter-object pair-wise recall is a crucial factor that was ignored by previous PSG methods. Based on this and the recent query-based frameworks, we present a novel framework: Pair then Relation (Pair-Net), which uses a Pair Proposal Network (PPN) to learn and filter sparse pair-wise relationships between subjects and objects. Moreover, we also observed the sparse nature of object pairs for both Motivated by this, we design a lightweight Matrix Learner within the PPN, which directly learn pair-wised relationships for pair proposal generation. Through extensive ablation and analysis, our approach significantly improves upon leveraging the segmenter solid baseline. Notably, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on the PSG benchmark, with over 10\% absolute gains compared to PSGFormer.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence onboard satellites has the potential to reduce data transmission requirements, enable real-time decision-making and collaboration within constellations. This study deploys a lightweight foundational model called RaVAEn on D-Orbit's ION SCV004 satellite. RaVAEn is a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that generates compressed latent vectors from small image tiles, enabling several downstream tasks. In this work we demonstrate the reliable use of RaVAEn onboard a satellite, achieving an encoding time of 0.110s for tiles of a 4.8x4.8 km$^2$ area. In addition, we showcase fast few-shot training onboard a satellite using the latent representation of data. We compare the deployment of the model on the on-board CPU and on the available Myriad vision processing unit (VPU) accelerator. To our knowledge, this work shows for the first time the deployment of a multi-task model on-board a CubeSat and the on-board training of a machine learning model.

- **Summary**: While many unsupervised learning models focus on one family of tasks, either generative or discriminative, we explore the possibility of a unified representation learner: a model which uses a single pre-training stage to address both families of tasks simultaneously. We identify diffusion models as a prime candidate. Diffusion models have risen to prominence as a state-of-the-art method for image generation, denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, manipulation, etc. Such models involve training a U-Net to iteratively predict and remove noise, and the resulting model can synthesize high fidelity, diverse, novel images. The U-Net architecture, as a convolution-based architecture, generates a diverse set of feature representations in the form of intermediate feature maps. We present our findings that these embeddings are useful beyond the noise prediction task, as they contain discriminative information and can also be leveraged for classification. We explore optimal methods for extracting and using these embeddings for classification tasks, demonstrating promising results on the ImageNet classification task. We find that with careful feature selection and pooling, diffusion models outperform comparable generative-discriminative methods such as BigBiGAN for classification tasks. We investigate diffusion models in the transfer learning regime, examining their performance on several fine-grained visual classification datasets. We compare these embeddings to those generated by competing architectures and pre-trainings for classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Procedural activity understanding requires perceiving human actions in terms of a broader task, where multiple keysteps are performed in sequence across a long video to reach a final goal state -- such as the steps of a recipe or a DIY fix-it task. Prior work largely treats keystep recognition in isolation of this broader structure, or else rigidly confines keysteps to align with a predefined sequential script. We propose discovering a task graph automatically from how-to videos to represent probabilistically how people tend to execute keysteps, and then leverage this graph to regularize keystep recognition in novel videos. On multiple datasets of real-world instructional videos, we show the impact: more reliable zero-shot keystep localization and improved video representation learning, exceeding the state of the art.

- **Summary**: As neural networks grow in size and complexity, inference speeds decline. To combat this, one of the most effective compression techniques -- channel pruning -- removes channels from weights. However, for multi-branch segments of a model, channel removal can introduce inference-time memory copies. In turn, these copies increase inference latency -- so much so that the pruned model can be slower than the unpruned model. As a workaround, pruners conventionally constrain certain channels to be pruned together. This fully eliminates memory copies but, as we show, significantly impairs accuracy. We now have a dilemma: Remove constraints but increase latency, or add constraints and impair accuracy. In response, our insight is to reorder channels at export time, (1) reducing latency by reducing memory copies and (2) improving accuracy by removing constraints. Using this insight, we design a generic algorithm UPSCALE to prune models with any pruning pattern. By removing constraints from existing pruners, we improve ImageNet accuracy for post-training pruned models by 2.1 points on average -- benefiting DenseNet (+16.9), EfficientNetV2 (+7.9), and ResNet (+6.2). Furthermore, by reordering channels, UPSCALE improves inference speeds by up to 2x over a baseline export.

- **Summary**: Low-light conditions not only hamper human visual experience but also degrade the model's performance on downstream vision tasks. While existing works make remarkable progress on day-night domain adaptation, they rely heavily on domain knowledge derived from the task-specific nighttime dataset. This paper challenges a more complicated scenario with border applicability, i.e., zero-shot day-night domain adaptation, which eliminates reliance on any nighttime data. Unlike prior zero-shot adaptation approaches emphasizing either image-level translation or model-level adaptation, we propose a similarity min-max paradigm that considers them under a unified framework. On the image level, we darken images towards minimum feature similarity to enlarge the domain gap. Then on the model level, we maximize the feature similarity between the darkened images and their normal-light counterparts for better model adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the pioneering effort in jointly optimizing both aspects, resulting in a significant improvement of model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness and broad applicability on various nighttime vision tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, visual place recognition, and video action recognition.

- **Summary**: Ocean scientists have been collecting visual data to study marine organisms for decades. These images and videos are extremely valuable both for basic science and environmental monitoring tasks. There are tools for automatically processing these data, but none that are capable of handling the extreme variability in sample populations, image quality, and habitat characteristics that are common in visual sampling of the ocean. Such distribution shifts can occur over very short physical distances and in narrow time windows. Creating models that are able to recognize when an image or video sequence contains a new organism, an unusual collection of animals, or is otherwise out-of-sample is critical to fully leverage visual data in the ocean. The FathomNet2023 competition dataset presents a realistic scenario where the set of animals in the target data differs from the training data. The challenge is both to identify the organisms in a target image and assess whether it is out-of-sample.

- **Summary**: Aphid infestations can cause extensive damage to wheat and sorghum fields and spread plant viruses, resulting in significant yield losses in agriculture. To address this issue, farmers often rely on chemical pesticides, which are inefficiently applied over large areas of fields. As a result, a considerable amount of pesticide is wasted on areas without pests, while inadequate amounts are applied to areas with severe infestations. The paper focuses on the urgent need for an intelligent autonomous system that can locate and spray infestations within complex crop canopies, reducing pesticide use and environmental impact. We have collected and labeled a large aphid image dataset in the field, and propose the use of real-time semantic segmentation models to segment clusters of aphids. A multiscale dataset is generated to allow for learning the clusters at different scales. We compare the segmentation speeds and accuracy of four state-of-the-art real-time semantic segmentation models on the aphid cluster dataset, benchmarking them against nonreal-time models. The study results show the effectiveness of a real-time solution, which can reduce inefficient pesticide use and increase crop yields, paving the way towards an autonomous pest detection system.

- **Summary**: This study investigates the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the enhancement of visualization processes in the agricultural sector, using the advanced AI image generator, DALLE 2, developed by OpenAI. By synergistically utilizing the natural language processing proficiency of chatGPT and the generative prowess of the DALLE 2 model, which employs a Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework, our research offers an innovative method to transform textual descriptors into realistic visual content. Our rigorously assembled datasets include a broad spectrum of agricultural elements such as fruits, plants, and scenarios differentiating crops from weeds, maintained for AI-generated versus original images. The quality and accuracy of the AI-generated images were evaluated via established metrics including mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and feature similarity index (FSIM). The results underline the significant role of the DALLE 2 model in enhancing visualization processes in agriculture, aiding in more informed decision-making, and improving resource distribution. The outcomes of this research highlight the imminent rise of an AI-led transformation in the realm of precision agriculture.

- **Summary**: Many existing FL methods assume clients with fully-labeled data, while in realistic settings, clients have limited labels due to the expensive and laborious process of labeling. Limited labeled local data of the clients often leads to their local model having poor generalization abilities to their larger unlabeled local data, such as having class-distribution mismatch with the unlabeled data. As a result, clients may instead look to benefit from the global model trained across clients to leverage their unlabeled data, but this also becomes difficult due to data heterogeneity across clients. In our work, we propose FedLabel where clients selectively choose the local or global model to pseudo-label their unlabeled data depending on which is more of an expert of the data. We further utilize both the local and global models' knowledge via global-local consistency regularization which minimizes the divergence between the two models' outputs when they have identical pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. Unlike other semi-supervised FL baselines, our method does not require additional experts other than the local or global model, nor require additional parameters to be communicated. We also do not assume any server-labeled data or fully labeled clients. For both cross-device and cross-silo settings, we show that FedLabel outperforms other semi-supervised FL baselines by $8$-$24\%$, and even outperforms standard fully supervised FL baselines ($100\%$ labeled data) with only $5$-$20\%$ of labeled data.

- **Summary**: We present DARTS, a transformer model for reference-based image super-resolution. DARTS learns joint representations of two image distributions to enhance the content of low-resolution input images through matching correspondences learned from high-resolution reference images. Current state-of-the-art techniques in reference-based image super-resolution are based on a multi-network, multi-stage architecture. In this work, we adapt the double attention block from the GAN literature, processing the two visual streams separately and combining self-attention and cross-attention blocks through a gating attention strategy. Our work demonstrates how the attention mechanism can be adapted for the particular requirements of reference-based image super-resolution, significantly simplifying the architecture and training pipeline. We show that our transformer-based model performs competitively with state-of-the-art models, while maintaining a simpler overall architecture and training process. In particular, we obtain state-of-the-art on the SUN80 dataset, with a PSNR/SSIM of 29.83 / .809. These results show that attention alone is sufficient for the RSR task, without multiple purpose-built subnetworks, knowledge distillation, or multi-stage training.

- **Summary**: LiDAR is crucial for robust 3D scene perception in autonomous driving. LiDAR perception has the largest body of literature after camera perception. However, multi-task learning across tasks like detection, segmentation, and motion estimation using LiDAR remains relatively unexplored, especially on automotive-grade embedded platforms. We present a real-time multi-task convolutional neural network for LiDAR-based object detection, semantics, and motion segmentation. The unified architecture comprises a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, enabling joint representation learning. We propose a novel Semantic Weighting and Guidance (SWAG) module to transfer semantic features for improved object detection selectively. Our heterogeneous training scheme combines diverse datasets and exploits complementary cues between tasks. The work provides the first embedded implementation unifying these key perception tasks from LiDAR point clouds achieving 3ms latency on the embedded NVIDIA Xavier platform. We achieve state-of-the-art results for two tasks, semantic and motion segmentation, and close to state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection. By maximizing hardware efficiency and leveraging multi-task synergies, our method delivers an accurate and efficient solution tailored for real-world automated driving deployment.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based applications have seen a lot of success in recent years. Text, audio, image, and video have all been explored with great success using deep learning approaches. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in computer vision, in particular, has yielded reliable results. In order to achieve these results, a large amount of data is required. However, the dataset cannot always be accessible. Moreover, annotating data can be difficult and time-consuming. Self-training is a semi-supervised approach that managed to alleviate this problem and achieve state-of-the-art performances. Theoretical analysis even proved that it may result in a better generalization than a normal classifier. Another problem neural networks can face is the increasing complexity of modern problems, requiring a high computational and storage cost. One way to mitigate this issue, a strategy that has been inspired by human cognition known as modular learning, can be employed. The principle of the approach is to decompose a complex problem into simpler sub-tasks. This approach has several advantages, including faster learning, better generalization, and enables interpretability.   In the first part of this paper, we introduce and evaluate different architectures of modular learning for Dorsal Capsulo-Scapholunate Septum (DCSS) instability classification. Our experiments have shown that modular learning improves performances compared to non-modular systems. Moreover, we found that weighted modular, that is to weight the output using the probabilities from the gating module, achieved an almost perfect classification. In the second part, we present our approach for data labeling and segmentation with self-training applied on shoulder arthroscopy images.

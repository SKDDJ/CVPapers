- **Summary**: Skin lesion segmentation (SLS) plays an important role in skin lesion analysis. Vision transformers (ViTs) are considered an auspicious solution for SLS, but they require more training data compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their inherent parameter-heavy structure and lack of some inductive biases. To alleviate this issue, current approaches fine-tune pre-trained ViT backbones on SLS datasets, aiming to leverage the knowledge learned from a larger set of natural images to lower the amount of skin training data needed. However, fully fine-tuning all parameters of large backbones is computationally expensive and memory intensive. In this paper, we propose AViT, a novel efficient strategy to mitigate ViTs' data-hunger by transferring any pre-trained ViTs to the SLS task. Specifically, we integrate lightweight modules (adapters) within the transformer layers, which modulate the feature representation of a ViT without updating its pre-trained weights. In addition, we employ a shallow CNN as a prompt generator to create a prompt embedding from the input image, which grasps fine-grained information and CNN's inductive biases to guide the segmentation task on small datasets. Our quantitative experiments on 4 skin lesion datasets demonstrate that AViT achieves competitive, and at times superior, performance to SOTA but with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates methods for improving generative data augmentation for deep learning. Generative data augmentation leverages the synthetic samples produced by generative models as an additional dataset for classification with small dataset settings. A key challenge of generative data augmentation is that the synthetic data contain uninformative samples that degrade accuracy. This is because the synthetic samples do not perfectly represent class categories in real data and uniform sampling does not necessarily provide useful samples for tasks. In this paper, we present a novel strategy for generative data augmentation called meta generative regularization (MGR). To avoid the degradation of generative data augmentation, MGR utilizes synthetic samples in the regularization term for feature extractors instead of in the loss function, e.g., cross-entropy. These synthetic samples are dynamically determined to minimize the validation losses through meta-learning. We observed that MGR can avoid the performance degradation of na\"ive generative data augmentation and boost the baselines. Experiments on six datasets showed that MGR is effective particularly when datasets are smaller and stably outperforms baselines.

- **Summary**: We present YOLOBench, a benchmark comprised of 550+ YOLO-based object detection models on 4 different datasets and 4 different embedded hardware platforms (x86 CPU, ARM CPU, Nvidia GPU, NPU). We collect accuracy and latency numbers for a variety of YOLO-based one-stage detectors at different model scales by performing a fair, controlled comparison of these detectors with a fixed training environment (code and training hyperparameters). Pareto-optimality analysis of the collected data reveals that, if modern detection heads and training techniques are incorporated into the learning process, multiple architectures of the YOLO series achieve a good accuracy-latency trade-off, including older models like YOLOv3 and YOLOv4. We also evaluate training-free accuracy estimators used in neural architecture search on YOLOBench and demonstrate that, while most state-of-the-art zero-cost accuracy estimators are outperformed by a simple baseline like MAC count, some of them can be effectively used to predict Pareto-optimal detection models. We showcase that by using a zero-cost proxy to identify a YOLO architecture competitive against a state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model on a Raspberry Pi 4 CPU.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D generation has recently garnered significant attention, fueled by 2D diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs. Existing methods primarily rely on score distillation to leverage the 2D diffusion priors to supervise the generation of 3D models, e.g., NeRF. However, score distillation is prone to suffer the view inconsistency problem, and implicit NeRF modeling can also lead to an arbitrary shape, thus leading to less realistic and uncontrollable 3D generation. In this work, we propose a flexible framework of Points-to-3D to bridge the gap between sparse yet freely available 3D points and realistic shape-controllable 3D generation by distilling the knowledge from both 2D and 3D diffusion models. The core idea of Points-to-3D is to introduce controllable sparse 3D points to guide the text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we use the sparse point cloud generated from the 3D diffusion model, Point-E, as the geometric prior, conditioned on a single reference image. To better utilize the sparse 3D points, we propose an efficient point cloud guidance loss to adaptively drive the NeRF's geometry to align with the shape of the sparse 3D points. In addition to controlling the geometry, we propose to optimize the NeRF for a more view-consistent appearance. To be specific, we perform score distillation to the publicly available 2D image diffusion model ControlNet, conditioned on text as well as depth map of the learned compact geometry. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that Points-to-3D improves view consistency and achieves good shape controllability for text-to-3D generation. Points-to-3D provides users with a new way to improve and control text-to-3D generation.

- **Summary**: The field of trajectory forecasting has grown significantly in recent years, partially owing to the release of numerous large-scale, real-world human trajectory datasets for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and pedestrian motion tracking. While such datasets have been a boon for the community, they each use custom and unique data formats and APIs, making it cumbersome for researchers to train and evaluate methods across multiple datasets. To remedy this, we present trajdata: a unified interface to multiple human trajectory datasets. At its core, trajdata provides a simple, uniform, and efficient representation and API for trajectory and map data. As a demonstration of its capabilities, in this work we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing trajectory datasets, providing users with a rich understanding of the data underpinning much of current pedestrian and AV motion forecasting research, and proposing suggestions for future datasets from these insights. trajdata is permissively licensed (Apache 2.0) and can be accessed online at https://github.com/NVlabs/trajdata

- **Summary**: 3D anomaly detection is an emerging and vital computer vision task in industrial manufacturing (IM). Recently many advanced algorithms have been published, but most of them cannot meet the needs of IM. There are several disadvantages: i) difficult to deploy on production lines since their algorithms heavily rely on large pre-trained models; ii) hugely increase storage overhead due to overuse of memory banks; iii) the inference speed cannot be achieved in real-time. To overcome these issues, we propose an easy and deployment-friendly network (called EasyNet) without using pre-trained models and memory banks: firstly, we design a multi-scale multi-modality feature encoder-decoder to accurately reconstruct the segmentation maps of anomalous regions and encourage the interaction between RGB images and depth images; secondly, we adopt a multi-modality anomaly segmentation network to achieve a precise anomaly map; thirdly, we propose an attention-based information entropy fusion module for feature fusion during inference, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments show that EasyNet achieves an anomaly detection AUROC of 92.6% without using pre-trained models and memory banks. In addition, EasyNet is faster than existing methods, with a high frame rate of 94.55 FPS on a Tesla V100 GPU.



### DFR-Net: Density Feature Refinement Network for Image Dehazing Utilizing Haze Density Difference

- **Summary**: In image dehazing task, haze density is a key feature and affects the performance of dehazing methods. However, some of the existing methods lack a comparative image to measure densities, and others create intermediate results but lack the exploitation of their density differences, which can facilitate perception of density. To address these deficiencies, we propose a density-aware dehazing method named Density Feature Refinement Network (DFR-Net) that extracts haze density features from density differences and leverages density differences to refine density features. In DFR-Net, we first generate a proposal image that has lower overall density than the hazy input, bringing in global density differences. Additionally, the dehazing residual of the proposal image reflects the level of dehazing performance and provides local density differences that indicate localized hard dehazing or high density areas. Subsequently, we introduce a Global Branch (GB) and a Local Branch (LB) to achieve density-awareness. In GB, we use Siamese networks for feature extraction of hazy inputs and proposal images, and we propose a Global Density Feature Refinement (GDFR) module that can refine features by pushing features with different global densities further away. In LB, we explore local density features from the dehazing residuals between hazy inputs and proposal images and introduce an Intermediate Dehazing Residual Feedforward (IDRF) module to update local features and pull them closer to clear image features. Sufficient experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results beyond the state-of-the-art methods on various datasets.

- **Summary**: Multi-agent collaborative perception as a potential application for vehicle-to-everything communication could significantly improve the perception performance of autonomous vehicles over single-agent perception. However, several challenges remain in achieving pragmatic information sharing in this emerging research. In this paper, we propose SCOPE, a novel collaborative perception framework that aggregates the spatio-temporal awareness characteristics across on-road agents in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, SCOPE has three distinct strengths: i) it considers effective semantic cues of the temporal context to enhance current representations of the target agent; ii) it aggregates perceptually critical spatial information from heterogeneous agents and overcomes localization errors via multi-scale feature interactions; iii) it integrates multi-source representations of the target agent based on their complementary contributions by an adaptive fusion paradigm. To thoroughly evaluate SCOPE, we consider both real-world and simulated scenarios of collaborative 3D object detection tasks on three datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach and the necessity of the proposed components.

- **Summary**: Driver distraction has become a significant cause of severe traffic accidents over the past decade. Despite the growing development of vision-driven driver monitoring systems, the lack of comprehensive perception datasets restricts road safety and traffic security. In this paper, we present an AssIstive Driving pErception dataset (AIDE) that considers context information both inside and outside the vehicle in naturalistic scenarios. AIDE facilitates holistic driver monitoring through three distinctive characteristics, including multi-view settings of driver and scene, multi-modal annotations of face, body, posture, and gesture, and four pragmatic task designs for driving understanding. To thoroughly explore AIDE, we provide experimental benchmarks on three kinds of baseline frameworks via extensive methods. Moreover, two fusion strategies are introduced to give new insights into learning effective multi-stream/modal representations. We also systematically investigate the importance and rationality of the key components in AIDE and benchmarks. The project link is https://github.com/ydk122024/AIDE.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) is an important task that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to reduce expenses on labeling training examples. However, the effectiveness of SSS algorithms is limited by the difficulty of fully exploiting the potential of unlabeled data. To address this, we propose a dual-level Siamese structure network (DSSN) for pixel-wise contrastive learning. By aligning positive pairs with a pixel-wise contrastive loss using strong augmented views in both low-level image space and high-level feature space, the proposed DSSN is designed to maximize the utilization of available unlabeled data. Additionally, we introduce a novel class-aware pseudo-label selection strategy for weak-to-strong supervision, which addresses the limitations of most existing methods that do not perform selection or apply a predefined threshold for all classes. Specifically, our strategy selects the top high-confidence prediction of the weak view for each class to generate pseudo labels that supervise the strong augmented views. This strategy is capable of taking into account the class imbalance and improving the performance of long-tailed classes. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on two datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, outperforming other SSS algorithms by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: Cancer grading is an essential task in pathology. The recent developments of artificial neural networks in computational pathology have shown that these methods hold great potential for improving the accuracy and quality of cancer diagnosis. However, the issues with the robustness and reliability of such methods have not been fully resolved yet. Herein, we propose a centroid-aware feature recalibration network that can conduct cancer grading in an accurate and robust manner. The proposed network maps an input pathology image into an embedding space and adjusts it by using centroids embedding vectors of different cancer grades via attention mechanism. Equipped with the recalibrated embedding vector, the proposed network classifiers the input pathology image into a pertinent class label, i.e., cancer grade. We evaluate the proposed network using colorectal cancer datasets that were collected under different environments. The experimental results confirm that the proposed network is able to conduct cancer grading in pathology images with high accuracy regardless of the environmental changes in the datasets.

- **Summary**: Previous works on voice-face matching and voice-guided face synthesis demonstrate strong correlations between voice and face, but mainly rely on coarse semantic cues such as gender, age, and emotion. In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. We propose a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face geometry tractable. Our approach is evaluated on our proposed dataset with ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and we find significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium. Our work offers a new perspective on voice-face correlation and can serve as a good empirical study for anthropometry science.

- **Summary**: This work unveils the enigmatic link between phonemes and facial features. Traditional studies on voice-face correlations typically involve using a long period of voice input, including generating face images from voices and reconstructing 3D face meshes from voices. However, in situations like voice-based crimes, the available voice evidence may be short and limited. Additionally, from a physiological perspective, each segment of speech -- phoneme -- corresponds to different types of airflow and movements in the face. Therefore, it is advantageous to discover the hidden link between phonemes and face attributes. In this paper, we propose an analysis pipeline to help us explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.e., phonemes v.s. facial anthropometric measurements (AM). We build an estimator for each phoneme-AM pair and evaluate the correlation through hypothesis testing. Our results indicate that AMs are more predictable from vowels compared to consonants, particularly with plosives. Additionally, we observe that if a specific AM exhibits more movement during phoneme pronunciation, it is more predictable. Our findings support those in physiology regarding correlation and lay the groundwork for future research on speech-face multimodal learning.

- **Summary**: Multi-agent embodied tasks have recently been studied in complex indoor visual environments. Collaboration among multiple agents can improve work efficiency and has significant practical value. However, most of the existing research focuses on homogeneous multi-agent tasks. Compared with homogeneous agents, heterogeneous agents can leverage their different capabilities to allocate corresponding sub-tasks and cooperate to complete complex tasks. Heterogeneous multi-agent tasks are common in real-world scenarios, and the collaboration strategy among heterogeneous agents is a challenging and important problem to be solved. To study collaboration among heterogeneous agents, we propose the heterogeneous multi-agent tidying-up task, in which multiple heterogeneous agents with different capabilities collaborate with each other to detect misplaced objects and place them in reasonable locations. This is a demanding task since it requires agents to make the best use of their different capabilities to conduct reasonable task planning and complete the whole task. To solve this task, we build a heterogeneous multi-agent tidying-up benchmark dataset in a large number of houses with multiple rooms based on ProcTHOR-10K. We propose the hierarchical decision model based on misplaced object detection, reasonable receptacle prediction, as well as the handshake-based group communication mechanism. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The project's website and videos of experiments can be found at https://hetercol.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Recently, vision transformer based multimodal learning methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of face anti-spoofing (FAS) systems. However, multimodal face data collected from the real world is often imperfect due to missing modalities from various imaging sensors. Recently, flexible-modal FAS~\cite{yu2023flexible} has attracted more attention, which aims to develop a unified multimodal FAS model using complete multimodal face data but is insensitive to test-time missing modalities. In this paper, we tackle one main challenge in flexible-modal FAS, i.e., when missing modality occurs either during training or testing in real-world situations. Inspired by the recent success of the prompt learning in language models, we propose \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompt flexible-modal \textbf{FAS} (VP-FAS), which learns the modal-relevant prompts to adapt the frozen pre-trained foundation model to downstream flexible-modal FAS task. Specifically, both vanilla visual prompts and residual contextual prompts are plugged into multimodal transformers to handle general missing-modality cases, while only requiring less than 4\% learnable parameters compared to training the entire model. Furthermore, missing-modality regularization is proposed to force models to learn consistent multimodal feature embeddings when missing partial modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on two multimodal FAS benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our VP-FAS framework that improves the performance under various missing-modality cases while alleviating the requirement of heavy model re-training.

- **Summary**: Visual object tracking is a fundamental video task in computer vision. Recently, the notably increasing power of perception algorithms allows the unification of single/multiobject and box/mask-based tracking. Among them, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) attracts much attention. In this report, we propose HQTrack, a framework for High Quality Tracking anything in videos. HQTrack mainly consists of a video multi-object segmenter (VMOS) and a mask refiner (MR). Given the object to be tracked in the initial frame of a video, VMOS propagates the object masks to the current frame. The mask results at this stage are not accurate enough since VMOS is trained on several closeset video object segmentation (VOS) datasets, which has limited ability to generalize to complex and corner scenes. To further improve the quality of tracking masks, a pretrained MR model is employed to refine the tracking results. As a compelling testament to the effectiveness of our paradigm, without employing any tricks such as test-time data augmentations and model ensemble, HQTrack ranks the 2nd place in the Visual Object Tracking and Segmentation (VOTS2023) challenge. Code and models are available at https://github.com/jiawen-zhu/HQTrack.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have emerged as a formidable AI tool to generate realistic outputs based on training datasets. However, the challenge of exerting control over the generation process of GANs remains a significant hurdle. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to address this issue by integrating a reinforcement learning (RL) agent with a latent-space GAN (l-GAN), thereby facilitating the generation of desired outputs. More specifically, we have developed an actor-critic RL agent with a meticulously designed reward policy, enabling it to acquire proficiency in navigating the latent space of the l-GAN and generating outputs based on specified tasks. To substantiate the efficacy of our approach, we have conducted a series of experiments employing the MNIST dataset, including arithmetic addition as an illustrative task. The outcomes of these experiments serve to validate our methodology. Our pioneering integration of an RL agent with a GAN model represents a novel advancement, holding great potential for enhancing generative networks in the future.

- **Summary**: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) plays an indispensable role in monitoring and improving the end-users' viewing experience in various real-world video-enabled media applications. As an experimental field, the improvements of BVQA models have been measured primarily on a few human-rated VQA datasets. Thus, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of existing VQA datasets in order to properly evaluate the current progress in BVQA. Towards this goal, we conduct a first-of-its-kind computational analysis of VQA datasets via designing minimalistic BVQA models. By minimalistic, we restrict our family of BVQA models to build only upon basic blocks: a video preprocessor (for aggressive spatiotemporal downsampling), a spatial quality analyzer, an optional temporal quality analyzer, and a quality regressor, all with the simplest possible instantiations. By comparing the quality prediction performance of different model variants on eight VQA datasets with realistic distortions, we find that nearly all datasets suffer from the easy dataset problem of varying severity, some of which even admit blind image quality assessment (BIQA) solutions. We additionally justify our claims by contrasting our model generalizability on these VQA datasets, and by ablating a dizzying set of BVQA design choices related to the basic building blocks. Our results cast doubt on the current progress in BVQA, and meanwhile shed light on good practices of constructing next-generation VQA datasets and models.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). In addition, AEs have adversarial transferability, which means AEs generated for a source model can fool another black-box model (target model) with a non-trivial probability. In previous studies, it was confirmed that the vision transformer (ViT) is more robust against the property of adversarial transferability than convolutional neural network (CNN) models such as ConvMixer, and moreover encrypted ViT is more robust than ViT without any encryption. In this article, we propose a random ensemble of encrypted ViT models to achieve much more robust models. In experiments, the proposed scheme is verified to be more robust against not only black-box attacks but also white-box ones than convention methods.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Obtaining manual annotations to train deep learning (DL) models for auto-segmentation is often time-consuming. Uncertainty-based Bayesian active learning (BAL) is a widely-adopted method to reduce annotation efforts. Based on BAL, this study introduces a hybrid representation-enhanced sampling strategy that integrates density and diversity criteria to save manual annotation costs by efficiently selecting the most informative samples.   Methods: The experiments are performed on two lower extremity (LE) datasets of MRI and CT images by a BAL framework based on Bayesian U-net. Our method selects uncertain samples with high density and diversity for manual revision, optimizing for maximal similarity to unlabeled instances and minimal similarity to existing training data. We assess the accuracy and efficiency using Dice and a proposed metric called reduced annotation cost (RAC), respectively. We further evaluate the impact of various acquisition rules on BAL performance and design an ablation study for effectiveness estimation.   Results: The proposed method showed superiority or non-inferiority to other methods on both datasets across two acquisition rules, and quantitative results reveal the pros and cons of the acquisition rules. Our ablation study in volume-wise acquisition shows that the combination of density and diversity criteria outperforms solely using either of them in musculoskeletal segmentation.   Conclusion: Our sampling method is proven efficient in reducing annotation costs in image segmentation tasks. The combination of the proposed method and our BAL framework provides a semi-automatic way for efficient annotation of medical image datasets.

- **Summary**: Autonomous navigation in off-road conditions requires an accurate estimation of terrain traversability. However, traversability estimation in unstructured environments is subject to high uncertainty due to the variability of numerous factors that influence vehicle-terrain interaction. Consequently, it is challenging to obtain a generalizable model that can accurately predict traversability in a variety of environments. This paper presents METAVerse, a meta-learning framework for learning a global model that accurately and reliably predicts terrain traversability across diverse environments. We train the traversability prediction network to generate a dense and continuous-valued cost map from a sparse LiDAR point cloud, leveraging vehicle-terrain interaction feedback in a self-supervised manner. Meta-learning is utilized to train a global model with driving data collected from multiple environments, effectively minimizing estimation uncertainty. During deployment, online adaptation is performed to rapidly adapt the network to the local environment by exploiting recent interaction experiences. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we collect driving data from various terrains and demonstrate that our method can obtain a global model that minimizes uncertainty. Moreover, by integrating our model with a model predictive controller, we demonstrate that the reduced uncertainty results in safe and stable navigation in unstructured and unknown terrains.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. Based on the statistical correlations uncovered by deep learning-based methods, computer vision has contributed to tremendous growth in areas like autonomous driving and robotics. Despite being the basis of deep learning, such correlation is not stable and is susceptible to uncontrolled factors. In the absence of the guidance of prior knowledge, statistical correlations can easily turn into spurious correlations and cause confounders. As a result, researchers are now trying to enhance deep learning methods with causal theory. Causal theory models the intrinsic causal structure unaffected by data bias and is effective in avoiding spurious correlations. This paper aims to comprehensively review the existing causal methods in typical vision and vision-language tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and image captioning. The advantages of causality and the approaches for building causal paradigms will be summarized. Future roadmaps are also proposed, including facilitating the development of causal theory and its application in other complex scenes and systems.

- **Summary**: Existing Graph Convolutional Networks to achieve human motion prediction largely adopt a one-step scheme, which output the prediction straight from history input, failing to exploit human motion patterns. We observe that human motions have transitional patterns and can be split into snippets representative of each transition. Each snippet can be reconstructed from its starting and ending poses referred to as the transitional poses. We propose a snippet-to-motion multi-stage framework that breaks motion prediction into sub-tasks easier to accomplish. Each sub-task integrates three modules: transitional pose prediction, snippet reconstruction, and snippet-to-motion prediction. Specifically, we propose to first predict only the transitional poses. Then we use them to reconstruct the corresponding snippets, obtaining a close approximation to the true motion sequence. Finally we refine them to produce the final prediction output. To implement the network, we propose a novel unified graph modeling, which allows for direct and effective feature propagation compared to existing approaches which rely on separate space-time modeling. Extensive experiments on Human 3.6M, CMU Mocap and 3DPW datasets verify the effectiveness of our method which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Recent vision transformers, large-kernel CNNs and MLPs have attained remarkable successes in broad vision tasks thanks to their effective information fusion in the global scope. However, their efficient deployments, especially on mobile devices, still suffer from noteworthy challenges due to the heavy computational costs of self-attention mechanisms, large kernels, or fully connected layers. In this work, we apply conventional convolution theorem to deep learning for addressing this and reveal that adaptive frequency filters can serve as efficient global token mixers. With this insight, we propose Adaptive Frequency Filtering (AFF) token mixer. This neural operator transfers a latent representation to the frequency domain via a Fourier transform and performs semantic-adaptive frequency filtering via an elementwise multiplication, which mathematically equals to a token mixing operation in the original latent space with a dynamic convolution kernel as large as the spatial resolution of this latent representation. We take AFF token mixers as primary neural operators to build a lightweight neural network, dubbed AFFNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AFF token mixer and show that AFFNet achieve superior accuracy and efficiency trade-offs compared to other lightweight network designs on broad visual tasks, including visual recognition and dense prediction tasks.

- **Summary**: Compositional neural scene graph studies have shown that radiance fields can be an efficient tool in an editable autonomous driving simulator. However, previous studies learned within a sequence of autonomous driving datasets, resulting in unsatisfactory blurring when rotating the car in the simulator. In this letter, we propose a pipeline for learning unconstrained images and building a dataset from processed images. To meet the requirements of the simulator, which demands that the vehicle maintain clarity when the perspective changes and that the contour remains sharp from the background to avoid artifacts when editing, we design a radiation field of the vehicle, a crucial part of the urban scene foreground. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance compared to baselines. Using the datasets built from in-the-wild images, our method gradually presents a controllable appearance editing function. We will release the dataset and code on https://lty2226262.github.io/car-studio/ to facilitate further research in the field.

- **Summary**: Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (single-HSI-SR) aims to restore a high-resolution hyperspectral image from a low-resolution observation. However, the prevailing CNN-based approaches have shown limitations in building long-range dependencies and capturing interaction information between spectral features. This results in inadequate utilization of spectral information and artifacts after upsampling. To address this issue, we propose ESSAformer, an ESSA attention-embedded Transformer network for single-HSI-SR with an iterative refining structure. Specifically, we first introduce a robust and spectral-friendly similarity metric, \ie, the spectral correlation coefficient of the spectrum (SCC), to replace the original attention matrix and incorporates inductive biases into the model to facilitate training. Built upon it, we further utilize the kernelizable attention technique with theoretical support to form a novel efficient SCC-kernel-based self-attention (ESSA) and reduce attention computation to linear complexity. ESSA enlarges the receptive field for features after upsampling without bringing much computation and allows the model to effectively utilize spatial-spectral information from different scales, resulting in the generation of more natural high-resolution images. Without the need for pretraining on large-scale datasets, our experiments demonstrate ESSA's effectiveness in both visual quality and quantitative results.

- **Summary**: Palmprint recently shows great potential in recognition applications as it is a privacy-friendly and stable biometric. However, the lack of large-scale public palmprint datasets limits further research and development of palmprint recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel realistic pseudo-palmprint generation (RPG) model to synthesize palmprints with massive identities. We first introduce a conditional modulation generator to improve the intra-class diversity. Then an identity-aware loss is proposed to ensure identity consistency against unpaired training. We further improve the B\'ezier palm creases generation strategy to guarantee identity independence. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining significantly boosts the recognition model performance. For example, our model improves the state-of-the-art B\'ezierPalm by more than $5\%$ and $14\%$ in terms of TAR@FAR=1e-6 under the $1:1$ and $1:3$ Open-set protocol. When accessing only $10\%$ of the real training data, our method still outperforms ArcFace with $100\%$ real training data, indicating that we are closer to real-data-free palmprint recognition.

- **Summary**: The precision of unsupervised point cloud registration methods is typically limited by the lack of reliable inlier estimation and self-supervised signal, especially in partially overlapping scenarios. In this paper, we propose an effective inlier estimation method for unsupervised point cloud registration by capturing geometric structure consistency between the source point cloud and its corresponding reference point cloud copy. Specifically, to obtain a high quality reference point cloud copy, an One-Nearest Neighborhood (1-NN) point cloud is generated by input point cloud. This facilitates matching map construction and allows for integrating dual neighborhood matching scores of 1-NN point cloud and input point cloud to improve matching confidence. Benefiting from the high quality reference copy, we argue that the neighborhood graph formed by inlier and its neighborhood should have consistency between source point cloud and its corresponding reference copy. Based on this observation, we construct transformation-invariant geometric structure representations and capture geometric structure consistency to score the inlier confidence for estimated correspondences between source point cloud and its reference copy. This strategy can simultaneously provide the reliable self-supervised signal for model optimization. Finally, we further calculate transformation estimation by the weighted SVD algorithm with the estimated correspondences and corresponding inlier confidence. We train the proposed model in an unsupervised manner, and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Brain encoding models aim to predict brain voxel-wise responses to stimuli images, replicating brain signals captured by neuroimaging techniques. There is a large volume of publicly available data, but training a comprehensive brain encoding model is challenging. The main difficulties stem from a) diversity within individual brain, with functional heterogeneous brain regions; b) diversity of brains from different subjects, due to genetic and developmental differences; c) diversity of imaging modalities and processing pipelines. We use this diversity to our advantage by introducing the All-for-One training recipe, which divides the challenging one-big-model problem into multiple small models, with the small models aggregating the knowledge while preserving the distinction between the different functional regions. Agnostic of the training recipe, we use biological knowledge of the brain, specifically retinotopy, to introduce inductive bias to learn a 3D brain-to-image mapping that ensures a) each neuron knows which image regions and semantic levels to gather information, and b) no neurons are left behind in the model.   We pre-trained a brain encoding model using over one million data points from five public datasets spanning three imaging modalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive brain encoding model to the date. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-trained model as a drop-in replacement for commonly used vision backbone models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of the model to brain decoding. Code and the model checkpoint will be made available.

- **Summary**: Diagnosing rare anemia disorders using microscopic images is challenging for skilled specialists and machine-learning methods alike. Due to thousands of disease-relevant cells in a single blood sample, this constitutes a complex multiple-instance learning (MIL) problem. While the spatial neighborhood of red blood cells is not meaningful per se, the topology, i.e., the geometry of blood samples as a whole, contains informative features to remedy typical MIL issues, such as vanishing gradients and overfitting when training on limited data. We thus develop a topology-based approach that extracts multi-scale topological features from bags of single red blood cell images. The topological features are used to regularize the model, enforcing the preservation of characteristic topological properties of the data. Applied to a dataset of 71 patients suffering from rare anemia disorders with 521 microscopic images of red blood cells, our experiments show that topological regularization is an effective method that leads to more than 3% performance improvements for the automated classification of rare anemia disorders based on single-cell images. This is the first approach that uses topological properties for regularizing the MIL process.

- **Summary**: RANSAC and its variants are widely used for robust estimation, however, they commonly follow a greedy approach to finding the highest scoring model while ignoring other model hypotheses. In contrast, Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) techniques gradually approach the model by iteratively updating the weight of each correspondence based on the residuals from previous iterations. Inspired by these methods, we propose a new RANSAC framework that learns to explore the parameter space by considering the residuals seen so far via a novel attention layer. The attention mechanism operates on a batch of point-to-model residuals, and updates a per-point estimation state to take into account the consensus found through a lightweight one-step transformer. This rich state then guides the minimal sampling between iterations as well as the model refinement. We evaluate the proposed approach on essential and fundamental matrix estimation on a number of indoor and outdoor datasets. It outperforms state-of-the-art estimators by a significant margin adding only a small runtime overhead. Moreover, we demonstrate good generalization properties of our trained model, indicating its effectiveness across different datasets and tasks. The proposed attention mechanism and one-step transformer provide an adaptive behavior that enhances the performance of RANSAC, making it a more effective tool for robust estimation.

- **Summary**: Human-centric scene understanding is significant for real-world applications, but it is extremely challenging due to the existence of diverse human poses and actions, complex human-environment interactions, severe occlusions in crowds, etc. In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-modal dataset for human-centric scene understanding, dubbed HuCenLife, which is collected in diverse daily-life scenarios with rich and fine-grained annotations. Our HuCenLife can benefit many 3D perception tasks, such as segmentation, detection, action recognition, etc., and we also provide benchmarks for these tasks to facilitate related research. In addition, we design novel modules for LiDAR-based segmentation and action recognition, which are more applicable for large-scale human-centric scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Recent studies on face forgery detection have shown satisfactory performance for methods involved in training datasets, but are not ideal enough for unknown domains. This motivates many works to improve the generalization, but forgery-irrelevant information, such as image background and identity, still exists in different domain features and causes unexpected clustering, limiting the generalization. In this paper, we propose a controllable guide-space (GS) method to enhance the discrimination of different forgery domains, so as to increase the forgery relevance of features and thereby improve the generalization. The well-designed guide-space can simultaneously achieve both the proper separation of forgery domains and the large distance between real-forgery domains in an explicit and controllable manner. Moreover, for better discrimination, we use a decoupling module to weaken the interference of forgery-irrelevant correlations between domains. Furthermore, we make adjustments to the decision boundary manifold according to the clustering degree of the same domain features within the neighborhood. Extensive experiments in multiple in-domain and cross-domain settings confirm that our method can achieve state-of-the-art generalization.

- **Summary**: Shape generation is the practice of producing 3D shapes as various representations for 3D content creation. Previous studies on 3D shape generation have focused on shape quality and structure, without or less considering the importance of semantic information. Consequently, such generative models often fail to preserve the semantic consistency of shape structure or enable manipulation of the semantic attributes of shapes during generation. In this paper, we proposed a novel semantic generative model named 3D Semantic Subspace Traverser that utilizes semantic attributes for category-specific 3D shape generation and editing. Our method utilizes implicit functions as the 3D shape representation and combines a novel latent-space GAN with a linear subspace model to discover semantic dimensions in the local latent space of 3D shapes. Each dimension of the subspace corresponds to a particular semantic attribute, and we can edit the attributes of generated shapes by traversing the coefficients of those dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can produce plausible shapes with complex structures and enable the editing of semantic attributes.

- **Summary**: High-accuracy Dichotomous Image Segmentation (DIS) aims to pinpoint category-agnostic foreground objects from natural scenes. The main challenge for DIS involves identifying the highly accurate dominant area while rendering detailed object structure. However, directly using a general encoder-decoder architecture may result in an oversupply of high-level features and neglect the shallow spatial information necessary for partitioning meticulous structures. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel Unite-Divide-Unite Network (UDUN} that restructures and bipartitely arranges complementary features to simultaneously boost the effectiveness of trunk and structure identification. The proposed UDUN proceeds from several strengths. First, a dual-size input feeds into the shared backbone to produce more holistic and detailed features while keeping the model lightweight. Second, a simple Divide-and-Conquer Module (DCM) is proposed to decouple multiscale low- and high-level features into our structure decoder and trunk decoder to obtain structure and trunk information respectively. Moreover, we design a Trunk-Structure Aggregation module (TSA) in our union decoder that performs cascade integration for uniform high-accuracy segmentation. As a result, UDUN performs favorably against state-of-the-art competitors in all six evaluation metrics on overall DIS-TE, i.e., achieving 0.772 weighted F-measure and 977 HCE. Using 1024*1024 input, our model enables real-time inference at 65.3 fps with ResNet-18.

- **Summary**: Despite the presence of the classification task in many different benchmark datasets for perception in the automotive domain, few efforts have been undertaken to define consistent classification requirements. This work addresses the topic by proposing a structured method to generate a classification structure. First, legal categories are identified based on behavioral requirements for the vehicle. This structure is further substantiated by considering the two aspects of collision safety for objects as well as perceptual categories. A classification hierarchy is obtained by applying the method to an exemplary legal text. A comparison of the results with benchmark dataset categories shows limited agreement. This indicates the necessity for explicit consideration of legal requirements regarding perception.

- **Summary**: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, malicious adversaries can be deliberately transferred to attack other black-box models. However, existing work has mainly focused on investigating white-box attacks. In this paper, we present the first study to investigate the adversarial transferability of recent VLP models. We observe that existing methods exhibit much lower transferability, compared to the strong attack performance in white-box settings. The transferability degradation is partly caused by the under-utilization of cross-modal interactions. Particularly, unlike unimodal learning, VLP models rely heavily on cross-modal interactions and the multimodal alignments are many-to-many, e.g., an image can be described in various natural languages. To this end, we propose a highly transferable Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA) that thoroughly leverages modality interactions and incorporates alignment-preserving augmentation with cross-modal guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that SGA could generate adversarial examples that can strongly transfer across different VLP models on multiple downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, SGA significantly enhances the attack success rate for transfer attacks from ALBEF to TCL by a large margin (at least 9.78% and up to 30.21%), compared to the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Image recognition has recently witnessed a paradigm shift, where vision-language models are now used to perform few-shot classification based on textual prompts. Among these, the CLIP model has shown remarkable capabilities for zero-shot transfer by matching an image and a custom textual prompt in its latent space. This has paved the way for several works that focus on engineering or learning textual contexts for maximizing CLIP's classification capabilities. In this paper, we follow this trend by learning an ensemble of prompts for image classification. We show that learning diverse and possibly shorter contexts improves considerably and consistently the results rather than relying on a single trainable prompt. In particular, we report better few-shot capabilities with no additional cost at inference time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on 11 different benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Medical radiography segmentation, and specifically dental radiography, is highly limited by the cost of labeling which requires specific expertise and labor-intensive annotations. In this work, we propose a straightforward pre-training method for semantic segmentation leveraging Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which have shown impressive results for generative modeling. Our straightforward approach achieves remarkable performance in terms of label efficiency and does not require architectural modifications between pre-training and downstream tasks. We propose to first pre-train a Unet by exploiting the DDPM training objective, and then fine-tune the resulting model on a segmentation task. Our experimental results on the segmentation of dental radiographs demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art pre-training methods.

- **Summary**: Relying on large-scale training data with pixel-level labels, previous edge detection methods have achieved high performance. However, it is hard to manually label edges accurately, especially for large datasets, and thus the datasets inevitably contain noisy labels. This label-noise issue has been studied extensively for classification, while still remaining under-explored for edge detection. To address the label-noise issue for edge detection, this paper proposes to learn Pixel-level NoiseTransitions to model the label-corruption process. To achieve it, we develop a novel Pixel-wise Shift Learning (PSL) module to estimate the transition from clean to noisy labels as a displacement field. Exploiting the estimated noise transitions, our model, named PNT-Edge, is able to fit the prediction to clean labels. In addition, a local edge density regularization term is devised to exploit local structure information for better transition learning. This term encourages learning large shifts for the edges with complex local structures. Experiments on SBD and Cityscapes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in relieving the impact of label noise. Codes will be available at github.

- **Summary**: Correlation based stereo matching has achieved outstanding performance, which pursues cost volume between two feature maps. Unfortunately, current methods with a fixed model do not work uniformly well across various datasets, greatly limiting their real-world applicability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a new perspective to dynamically calculate correlation for robust stereo matching. A novel Uncertainty Guided Adaptive Correlation (UGAC) module is introduced to robustly adapt the same model for different scenarios. Specifically, a variance-based uncertainty estimation is employed to adaptively adjust the sampling area during warping operation. Additionally, we improve the traditional non-parametric warping with learnable parameters, such that the position-specific weights can be learned. We show that by empowering the recurrent network with the UGAC module, stereo matching can be exploited more robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance over the ETH3D, KITTI, and Middlebury datasets when employing the same fixed model over these datasets without any retraining procedure. To target real-time applications, we further design a lightweight model based on UGAC, which also outperforms other methods over KITTI benchmarks with only 0.6 M parameters.

- **Summary**: Recently, diffusion models like StableDiffusion have achieved impressive image generation results. However, the generation process of such diffusion models is uncontrollable, which makes it hard to generate videos with continuous and consistent content. In this work, by using the diffusion model with ControlNet, we proposed a new motion-guided video-to-video translation framework called VideoControlNet to generate various videos based on the given prompts and the condition from the input video. Inspired by the video codecs that use motion information for reducing temporal redundancy, our framework uses motion information to prevent the regeneration of the redundant areas for content consistency. Specifically, we generate the first frame (i.e., the I-frame) by using the diffusion model with ControlNet. Then we generate other key frames (i.e., the P-frame) based on the previous I/P-frame by using our newly proposed motion-guided P-frame generation (MgPG) method, in which the P-frames are generated based on the motion information and the occlusion areas are inpainted by using the diffusion model. Finally, the rest frames (i.e., the B-frame) are generated by using our motion-guided B-frame interpolation (MgBI) module. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed VideoControlNet inherits the generation capability of the pre-trained large diffusion model and extends the image diffusion model to the video diffusion model by using motion information.

- **Summary**: Periocular biometrics has been established as an independent modality due to concerns on the performance of iris or face systems in uncontrolled conditions. Periocular refers to the facial region in the eye vicinity, including eyelids, lashes and eyebrows. It is available over a wide range of acquisition distances, representing a trade-off between the whole face (which can be occluded at close distances) and the iris texture (which do not have enough resolution at long distances). Since the periocular region appears in face or iris images, it can be used also in conjunction with these modalities. Features extracted from the periocular region have been also used successfully for gender classification and ethnicity classification, and to study the impact of gender transformation or plastic surgery in the recognition performance. This paper presents a review of the state of the art in periocular biometric research, providing an insight of the most relevant issues and giving a thorough coverage of the existing literature. Future research trends are also briefly discussed.

- **Summary**: Recent work in Machine Learning and Computer Vision has highlighted the presence of various types of systematic flaws inside ground truth object recognition benchmark datasets. Our basic tenet is that these flaws are rooted in the many-to-many mappings which exist between the visual information encoded in images and the intended semantics of the labels annotating them. The net consequence is that the current annotation process is largely under-specified, thus leaving too much freedom to the subjective judgment of annotators. In this paper, we propose vTelos, an integrated Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, and Computer Vision methodology whose main goal is to make explicit the (otherwise implicit) intended annotation semantics, thus minimizing the number and role of subjective choices. A key element of vTelos is the exploitation of the WordNet lexico-semantic hierarchy as the main means for providing the meaning of natural language labels and, as a consequence, for driving the annotation of images based on the objects and the visual properties they depict. The methodology is validated on images populating a subset of the ImageNet hierarchy.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in event camera research emphasize processing data in its original sparse form, which allows the use of its unique features such as high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low latency, and resistance to image blur. One promising approach for analyzing event data is through graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, current research in this domain primarily focuses on optimizing computational costs, neglecting the associated memory costs. In this paper, we consider both factors together in order to achieve satisfying results and relatively low model complexity. For this purpose, we performed a comparative analysis of different graph convolution operations, considering factors such as execution time, the number of trainable model parameters, data format requirements, and training outcomes. Our results show a 450-fold reduction in the number of parameters for the feature extraction module and a 4.5-fold reduction in the size of the data representation while maintaining a classification accuracy of 52.3%, which is 6.3% higher compared to the operation used in state-of-the-art approaches. To further evaluate performance, we implemented the object detection architecture and evaluated its performance on the N-Caltech101 dataset. The results showed an accuracy of 53.7 % mAP@0.5 and reached an execution rate of 82 graphs per second.



### Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality via Shared-Specific Feature Modelling

- **Summary**: The missing modality issue is critical but non-trivial to be solved by multi-modal models. Current methods aiming to handle the missing modality problem in multi-modal tasks, either deal with missing modalities only during evaluation or train separate models to handle specific missing modality settings. In addition, these models are designed for specific tasks, so for example, classification models are not easily adapted to segmentation tasks and vice versa. In this paper, we propose the Shared-Specific Feature Modelling (ShaSpec) method that is considerably simpler and more effective than competing approaches that address the issues above. ShaSpec is designed to take advantage of all available input modalities during training and evaluation by learning shared and specific features to better represent the input data. This is achieved from a strategy that relies on auxiliary tasks based on distribution alignment and domain classification, in addition to a residual feature fusion procedure. Also, the design simplicity of ShaSpec enables its easy adaptation to multiple tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Experiments are conducted on both medical image segmentation and computer vision classification, with results indicating that ShaSpec outperforms competing methods by a large margin. For instance, on BraTS2018, ShaSpec improves the SOTA by more than 3% for enhancing tumour, 5% for tumour core and 3% for whole tumour.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel method for single-view 3D style transfer that generates a unique 3D object with both shape and texture transfer. Our focus lies primarily on birds, a popular subject in 3D reconstruction, for which no existing single-view 3D transfer methods have been developed.The method we propose seeks to generate a 3D mesh shape and texture of a bird from two single-view images. To achieve this, we introduce a novel shape transfer generator that comprises a dual residual gated network (DRGNet), and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). DRGNet extracts the features of source and target images using a shared coordinate gate unit, while the MLP generates spatial coordinates for building a 3D mesh. We also introduce a semantic UV texture transfer module that implements textural style transfer using semantic UV segmentation, which ensures consistency in the semantic meaning of the transferred regions. This module can be widely adapted to many existing approaches. Finally, our method constructs a novel 3D bird using a differentiable renderer. Experimental results on the CUB dataset verify that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-view 3D style transfer task.

- **Summary**: In machine learning, generative modeling aims to learn to generate new data statistically similar to the training data distribution. In this paper, we survey learning generative models under limited data, few shots and zero shot, referred to as Generative Modeling under Data Constraint (GM-DC). This is an important topic when data acquisition is challenging, e.g. healthcare applications. We discuss background, challenges, and propose two taxonomies: one on GM-DC tasks and another on GM-DC approaches. Importantly, we study interactions between different GM-DC tasks and approaches. Furthermore, we highlight research gaps, research trends, and potential avenues for future exploration. Project website: https://gmdc-survey.github.io.

- **Summary**: Visual question answering (VQA) has been intensively studied as a multimodal task that requires effort in bridging vision and language to infer answers correctly. Recent attempts have developed various attention-based modules for solving VQA tasks. However, the performance of model inference is largely bottlenecked by visual processing for semantics understanding. Most existing detection methods rely on bounding boxes, remaining a serious challenge for VQA models to understand the causal nexus of object semantics in images and correctly infer contextual information. To this end, we propose a finer model framework without bounding boxes in this work, termed Looking Out of Instance Semantics (LOIS) to tackle this important issue. LOIS enables more fine-grained feature descriptions to produce visual facts. Furthermore, to overcome the label ambiguity caused by instance masks, two types of relation attention modules: 1) intra-modality and 2) inter-modality, are devised to infer the correct answers from the different multi-view features. Specifically, we implement a mutual relation attention module to model sophisticated and deeper visual semantic relations between instance objects and background information. In addition, our proposed attention model can further analyze salient image regions by focusing on important word-related questions. Experimental results on four benchmark VQA datasets prove that our proposed method has favorable performance in improving visual reasoning capability.

- **Summary**: In this paper we have addressed the implementation of the accumulation and projection of high-resolution event data stream (HD -1280 x 720 pixels) onto the image plane in FPGA devices. The results confirm the feasibility of this approach, but there are a number of challenges, limitations and trade-offs to be considered. The required hardware resources of selected data representations, such as binary frame, event frame, exponentially decaying time surface and event frequency, were compared with those available on several popular platforms from AMD Xilinx. The resulting event frames can be used for typical vision algorithms, such as object classification and detection, using both classical and deep neural network methods.

- **Summary**: DeepLab is a widely used deep neural network for semantic segmentation, whose success is attributed to its parallel architecture called atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP). ASPP uses multiple atrous convolutions with different atrous rates to extract both local and global information. However, fixed values of atrous rates are used for the ASPP module, which restricts the size of its field of view. In principle, atrous rate should be a hyperparameter to change the field of view size according to the target task or dataset. However, the manipulation of atrous rate is not governed by any guidelines. This study proposes practical guidelines for obtaining an optimal atrous rate. First, an effective receptive field for semantic segmentation is introduced to analyze the inner behavior of segmentation networks. We observed that the use of ASPP module yielded a specific pattern in the effective receptive field, which was traced to reveal the module's underlying mechanism. Accordingly, we derive practical guidelines for obtaining the optimal atrous rate, which should be controlled based on the size of input image. Compared to other values, using the optimal atrous rate consistently improved the segmentation results across multiple datasets, including the STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF, Cityscapes, and iSAID datasets.

- **Summary**: Forecasting future trajectories of agents in complex traffic scenes requires reliable and efficient predictions for all agents in the scene. However, existing methods for trajectory prediction are either inefficient or sacrifice accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose ADAPT, a novel approach for jointly predicting the trajectories of all agents in the scene with dynamic weight learning. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both single-agent and multi-agent settings on the Argoverse and Interaction datasets, with a fraction of their computational overhead. We attribute the improvement in our performance: first, to the adaptive head augmenting the model capacity without increasing the model size; second, to our design choices in the endpoint-conditioned prediction, reinforced by gradient stopping. Our analyses show that ADAPT can focus on each agent with adaptive prediction, allowing for accurate predictions efficiently. https://KUIS-AI.github.io/adapt

- **Summary**: Traditional Chinese Painting (TCP) is an invaluable cultural heritage resource and a unique visual art style. In recent years, increasing interest has been placed on digitalizing TCPs to preserve and revive the culture. The resulting digital copies have enabled the advancement of computational methods for structured and systematic understanding of TCPs. To explore this topic, we conducted an in-depth analysis of 92 pieces of literature. We examined the current use of computer technologies on TCPs from three perspectives, based on numerous conversations with specialists. First, in light of the "Six Principles of Painting" theory, we categorized the articles according to their research focus on artistic elements. Second, we created a four-stage framework to illustrate the purposes of TCP applications. Third, we summarized the popular computational techniques applied to TCPs. The framework also provides insights into potential applications and future prospects, with professional opinion.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Recent advances in Surgical Data Science (SDS) have contributed to an increase in video recordings from hospital environments. While methods such as surgical workflow recognition show potential in increasing the quality of patient care, the quantity of video data has surpassed the scale at which images can be manually anonymized. Existing automated 2D anonymization methods under-perform in Operating Rooms (OR), due to occlusions and obstructions. We propose to anonymize multi-view OR recordings using 3D data from multiple camera streams. Methods: RGB and depth images from multiple cameras are fused into a 3D point cloud representation of the scene. We then detect each individual's face in 3D by regressing a parametric human mesh model onto detected 3D human keypoints and aligning the face mesh with the fused 3D point cloud. The mesh model is rendered into every acquired camera view, replacing each individual's face. Results: Our method shows promise in locating faces at a higher rate than existing approaches. DisguisOR produces geometrically consistent anonymizations for each camera view, enabling more realistic anonymization that is less detrimental to downstream tasks. Conclusion: Frequent obstructions and crowding in operating rooms leaves significant room for improvement for off-the-shelf anonymization methods. DisguisOR addresses privacy on a scene level and has the potential to facilitate further research in SDS.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are successfully used in various applications, but show their vulnerability to adversarial examples. With the development of adversarial patches, the feasibility of attacks in physical scenes increases, and the defenses against patch attacks are urgently needed. However, defending such adversarial patch attacks is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we analyse the properties of adversarial patches, and find that: on the one hand, adversarial patches will lead to the appearance or contextual inconsistency in the target objects; on the other hand, the patch region will show abnormal changes on the high-level feature maps of the objects extracted by a backbone network. Considering the above two points, we propose a novel defense method based on a ``localizing and inpainting" mechanism to pre-process the input examples. Specifically, we design an unified framework, where the ``localizing" sub-network utilizes a two-branch structure to represent the above two aspects to accurately detect the adversarial patch region in the image. For the ``inpainting" sub-network, it utilizes the surrounding contextual cues to recover the original content covered by the adversarial patch. The quality of inpainted images is also evaluated by measuring the appearance consistency and the effects of adversarial attacks. These two sub-networks are then jointly trained via an iterative optimization manner. In this way, the ``localizing" and ``inpainting" modules can interact closely with each other, and thus learn a better solution. A series of experiments versus traffic sign classification and detection tasks are conducted to defend against various adversarial patch attacks.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers (ViT) have been of broad interest in recent theoretical and empirical works. They are state-of-the-art thanks to their attention-based approach, which boosts the identification of key features and patterns within images thanks to the capability of avoiding inductive bias, resulting in highly accurate image analysis. Meanwhile, neoteric studies have reported a ``sparse double descent'' phenomenon that can occur in modern deep-learning models, where extremely over-parametrized models can generalize well. This raises practical questions about the optimal size of the model and the quest over finding the best trade-off between sparsity and performance is launched: are Vision Transformers also prone to sparse double descent? Can we find a way to avoid such a phenomenon? Our work tackles the occurrence of sparse double descent on ViTs. Despite some works that have shown that traditional architectures, like Resnet, are condemned to the sparse double descent phenomenon, for ViTs we observe that an optimally-tuned $\ell_2$ regularization relieves such a phenomenon. However, everything comes at a cost: optimal lambda will sacrifice the potential compression of the ViT.

- **Summary**: Visual Saliency refers to the innate human mechanism of focusing on and extracting important features from the observed environment. Recently, there has been a notable surge of interest in the field of automotive research regarding the estimation of visual saliency. While operating a vehicle, drivers naturally direct their attention towards specific objects, employing brain-driven saliency mechanisms that prioritize certain elements over others. In this investigation, we present an intelligent system that combines a drowsiness detection system for drivers with a scene comprehension pipeline based on saliency. To achieve this, we have implemented a specialized 3D deep network for semantic segmentation, which has been pretrained and tailored for processing the frames captured by an automotive-grade external camera. The proposed pipeline was hosted on an embedded platform utilizing the STA1295 core, featuring ARM A7 dual-cores, and embeds an hardware accelerator. Additionally, we employ an innovative biosensor embedded on the car steering wheel to monitor the driver drowsiness, gathering the PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) signal of the driver. A dedicated 1D temporal deep convolutional network has been devised to classify the collected PPG time-series, enabling us to assess the driver level of attentiveness. Ultimately, we compare the determined attention level of the driver with the corresponding saliency-based scene classification to evaluate the overall safety level. The efficacy of the proposed pipeline has been validated through extensive experimental results.



### Artifact Restoration in Histology Images with Diffusion Probabilistic Models

- **Summary**: Histological whole slide images (WSIs) can be usually compromised by artifacts, such as tissue folding and bubbles, which will increase the examination difficulty for both pathologists and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems. Existing approaches to restoring artifact images are confined to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where the restoration process is formulated as an image-to-image transfer. Those methods are prone to suffer from mode collapse and unexpected mistransfer in the stain style, leading to unsatisfied and unrealistic restored images. Innovatively, we make the first attempt at a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for histological artifact restoration, namely ArtiFusion.Specifically, ArtiFusion formulates the artifact region restoration as a gradual denoising process, and its training relies solely on artifact-free images to simplify the training complexity.Furthermore, to capture local-global correlations in the regional artifact restoration, a novel Swin-Transformer denoising architecture is designed, along with a time token scheme. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of ArtiFusion as a pre-processing method for histology analysis, which can successfully preserve the tissue structures and stain style in artifact-free regions during the restoration.

- **Summary**: As the world progresses in technology and health, awareness of disease by revealing asymptomatic signs improves. It is important to detect and treat tumors in early stage as it can be life-threatening. Computer-aided technologies are used to overcome lingering limitations facing disease diagnosis, while brain tumor segmentation remains a difficult process, especially when multi-modality data is involved. This is mainly attributed to ineffective training due to lack of data and corresponding labelling. This work investigates the feasibility of employing deep-fake image generation for effective brain tumor segmentation. To this end, a Generative Adversarial Network was used for image-to-image translation for increasing dataset size, followed by image segmentation using a U-Net-based convolutional neural network trained with deepfake images. Performance of the proposed approach is compared with ground truth of four publicly available datasets. Results show improved performance in terms of image segmentation quality metrics, and could potentially assist when training with limited data.

- **Summary**: The recent video grounding works attempt to introduce vanilla contrastive learning into video grounding. However, we claim that this naive solution is suboptimal. Contrastive learning requires two key properties: (1) \emph{alignment} of features of similar samples, and (2) \emph{uniformity} of the induced distribution of the normalized features on the hypersphere. Due to two annoying issues in video grounding: (1) the co-existence of some visual entities in both ground truth and other moments, \ie semantic overlapping; (2) only a few moments in the video are annotated, \ie sparse annotation dilemma, vanilla contrastive learning is unable to model the correlations between temporally distant moments and learned inconsistent video representations. Both characteristics lead to vanilla contrastive learning being unsuitable for video grounding. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic and Game Localization (G2L), a semantically aligned and uniform video grounding framework via geodesic and game theory. We quantify the correlations among moments leveraging the geodesic distance that guides the model to learn the correct cross-modal representations. Furthermore, from the novel perspective of game theory, we propose semantic Shapley interaction based on geodesic distance sampling to learn fine-grained semantic alignment in similar moments. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Fully-unsupervised Person and Vehicle Re-Identification have received increasing attention due to their broad applicability in surveillance, forensics, event understanding, and smart cities, without requiring any manual annotation. However, most of the prior art has been evaluated in datasets that have just a couple thousand samples. Such small-data setups often allow the use of costly techniques in time and memory footprints, such as Re-Ranking, to improve clustering results. Moreover, some previous work even pre-selects the best clustering hyper-parameters for each dataset, which is unrealistic in a large-scale fully-unsupervised scenario. In this context, this work tackles a more realistic scenario and proposes two strategies to learn from large-scale unlabeled data. The first strategy performs a local neighborhood sampling to reduce the dataset size in each iteration without violating neighborhood relationships. A second strategy leverages a novel Re-Ranking technique, which has a lower time upper bound complexity and reduces the memory complexity from O(n^2) to O(kn) with k << n. To avoid the pre-selection of specific hyper-parameter values for the clustering algorithm, we also present a novel scheduling algorithm that adjusts the density parameter during training, to leverage the diversity of samples and keep the learning robust to noisy labeling. Finally, due to the complementary knowledge learned by different models, we also introduce a co-training strategy that relies upon the permutation of predicted pseudo-labels, among the backbones, with no need for any hyper-parameters or weighting optimization. The proposed methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in well-known benchmarks and in the challenging large-scale Veri-Wild dataset, with a faster and memory-efficient Re-Ranking strategy, and a large-scale, noisy-robust, and ensemble-based learning approach.

- **Summary**: The study and development of innovative solutions for the advanced visualisation, representation and analysis of medical images offer different research directions. Current practice in medical imaging consists in combining real-time US with imaging modalities that allow internal anatomy acquisitions, such as CT, MRI, PET or similar. Application of image-fusion approaches can be found in tracking surgical tools and/or needles, in real-time during interventions. Thus, this work proposes a fusion imaging system for the registration of CT and MRI images with real-time US acquisition leveraging a 3D camera sensor. The main focus of the work is the portability of the system and its applicability to different anatomical districts.

- **Summary**: In latest years, deep learning has gained a leading role in the pansharpening of multiresolution images. Given the lack of ground truth data, most deep learning-based methods carry out supervised training in a reduced-resolution domain. However, models trained on downsized images tend to perform poorly on high-resolution target images. For this reason, several research groups are now turning to unsupervised training in the full-resolution domain, through the definition of appropriate loss functions and training paradigms. In this context, we have recently proposed a full-resolution training framework which can be applied to many existing architectures.   Here, we propose a new deep learning-based pansharpening model that fully exploits the potential of this approach and provides cutting-edge performance. Besides architectural improvements with respect to previous work, such as the use of residual attention modules, the proposed model features a novel loss function that jointly promotes the spectral and spatial quality of the pansharpened data. In addition, thanks to a new fine-tuning strategy, it improves inference-time adaptation to target images. Experiments on a large variety of test images, performed in challenging scenarios, demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably with the state of the art both in terms of numerical results and visual output.

- **Summary**: Text-conditioned image editing has emerged as a powerful tool for editing images. However, in many situations, language can be ambiguous and ineffective in describing specific image edits. When faced with such challenges, visual prompts can be a more informative and intuitive way to convey ideas. We present a method for image editing via visual prompting. Given pairs of example that represent the "before" and "after" images of an edit, our goal is to learn a text-based editing direction that can be used to perform the same edit on new images. We leverage the rich, pretrained editing capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models by inverting visual prompts into editing instructions. Our results show that with just one example pair, we can achieve competitive results compared to state-of-the-art text-conditioned image editing frameworks.

- **Summary**: Neuromorphic visual sensors are artificial retinas that output sequences of asynchronous events when brightness changes occur in the scene. These sensors offer many advantages including very high temporal resolution, no motion blur and smart data compression ideal for real-time processing. In this study, we introduce an event-based dataset on fine-grained manipulation actions and perform an experimental study on the use of transformers for action prediction with events. There is enormous interest in the fields of cognitive robotics and human-robot interaction on understanding and predicting human actions as early as possible. Early prediction allows anticipating complex stages for planning, enabling effective and real-time interaction. Our Transformer network uses events to predict manipulation actions as they occur, using online inference. The model succeeds at predicting actions early on, building up confidence over time and achieving state-of-the-art classification. Moreover, the attention-based transformer architecture allows us to study the role of the spatio-temporal patterns selected by the model. Our experiments show that the Transformer network captures action dynamic features outperforming video-based approaches and succeeding with scenarios where the differences between actions lie in very subtle cues. Finally, we release the new event dataset, which is the first in the literature for manipulation action recognition. Code will be available at https://github.com/DaniDeniz/EventVisionTransformer.

- **Summary**: Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.

- **Summary**: We propose MAMo, a novel memory and attention frame-work for monocular video depth estimation. MAMo can augment and improve any single-image depth estimation networks into video depth estimation models, enabling them to take advantage of the temporal information to predict more accurate depth. In MAMo, we augment model with memory which aids the depth prediction as the model streams through the video. Specifically, the memory stores learned visual and displacement tokens of the previous time instances. This allows the depth network to cross-reference relevant features from the past when predicting depth on the current frame. We introduce a novel scheme to continuously update the memory, optimizing it to keep tokens that correspond with both the past and the present visual information. We adopt attention-based approach to process memory features where we first learn the spatio-temporal relation among the resultant visual and displacement memory tokens using self-attention module. Further, the output features of self-attention are aggregated with the current visual features through cross-attention. The cross-attended features are finally given to a decoder to predict depth on the current frame. Through extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including KITTI, NYU-Depth V2, and DDAD, we show that MAMo consistently improves monocular depth estimation networks and sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy. Notably, our MAMo video depth estimation provides higher accuracy with lower latency, when omparing to SOTA cost-volume-based video depth models.

However, they assume only third-bounce illumination, so they are currently limited to single-corner configurations, and present limited visibility when imaging surfaces at certain orientations. To reason about and tackle these limitations, we make the key observation that planar diffuse surfaces behave specularly at wavelengths used in the computational wave-based NLOS imaging domain. We call such surfaces virtual mirrors. We leverage this observation to expand the capabilities of NLOS imaging using illumination beyond the third bounce, addressing two problems: imaging single-corner objects at limited visibility angles, and imaging objects hidden behind two corners. To image objects at limited visibility angles, we first analyze the reflections of the known illuminated point on surfaces of the scene as an estimator of the position and orientation of objects with limited visibility. We then image those limited visibility objects by computationally building secondary apertures at other surfaces that observe the target object from a direct visibility perspective. Beyond single-corner NLOS imaging, we exploit the specular behavior of virtual mirrors to image objects hidden behind a second corner by imaging the space behind such virtual mirrors, where the mirror image of objects hidden around two corners is formed. No specular surfaces were involved in the making of this paper.

- **Summary**: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common heart valve disease that requires accurate and timely diagnosis for appropriate treatment. Most current automatic AS severity detection methods rely on black-box models with a low level of trustworthiness, which hinders clinical adoption. To address this issue, we propose ProtoASNet, a prototypical network that directly detects AS from B-mode echocardiography videos, while making interpretable predictions based on the similarity between the input and learned spatio-temporal prototypes. This approach provides supporting evidence that is clinically relevant, as the prototypes typically highlight markers such as calcification and restricted movement of aortic valve leaflets. Moreover, ProtoASNet utilizes abstention loss to estimate aleatoric uncertainty by defining a set of prototypes that capture ambiguity and insufficient information in the observed data. This provides a reliable system that can detect and explain when it may fail. We evaluate ProtoASNet on a private dataset and the publicly available TMED-2 dataset, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 80.0% and 79.7%, respectively. Furthermore, ProtoASNet provides interpretability and an uncertainty measure for each prediction, which can improve transparency and facilitate the interactive usage of deep networks to aid clinical decision-making.

- **Summary**: In the past decades, automated high-content microscopy demonstrated its ability to deliver large quantities of image-based data powering the versatility of phenotypic drug screening and systems biology applications. However, as the sizes of image-based datasets grew, it became infeasible for humans to control, avoid and overcome the presence of imaging and sample preparation artefacts in the images. While novel techniques like machine learning and deep learning may address these shortcomings through generative image inpainting, when applied to sensitive research data this may come at the cost of undesired image manipulation. Undesired manipulation may be caused by phenomena such as neural hallucinations, to which some artificial neural networks are prone. To address this, here we evaluate the state-of-the-art inpainting methods for image restoration in a high-content fluorescence microscopy dataset of cultured cells with labelled nuclei. We show that architectures like DeepFill V2 and Edge Connect can faithfully restore microscopy images upon fine-tuning with relatively little data. Our results demonstrate that the area of the region to be restored is of higher importance than shape. Furthermore, to control for the quality of restoration, we propose a novel phenotype-preserving metric design strategy. In this strategy, the size and count of the restored biological phenotypes like cell nuclei are quantified to penalise undesirable manipulation. We argue that the design principles of our approach may also generalise to other applications.

- **Summary**: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) offers immense potential in the field of medical image analysis, enabling accurate object segmentation with limited training data. However, existing FSS techniques heavily rely on annotated semantic classes, rendering them unsuitable for medical images due to the scarcity of annotations. To address this challenge, multiple contributions are proposed: First, inspired by spectral decomposition methods, the problem of image decomposition is reframed as a graph partitioning task. The eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix, derived from the feature affinity matrix of self-supervised networks, are analyzed to estimate the distribution of the objects of interest from the support images. Secondly, we propose a novel self-supervised FSS framework that does not rely on any annotation. Instead, it adaptively estimates the query mask by leveraging the eigenvectors obtained from the support images. This approach eliminates the need for manual annotation, making it particularly suitable for medical images with limited annotated data. Thirdly, to further enhance the decoding of the query image based on the information provided by the support image, we introduce a multi-scale large kernel attention module. By selectively emphasizing relevant features and details, this module improves the segmentation process and contributes to better object delineation. Evaluations on both natural and medical image datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. Moreover, the proposed approach is characterized by its generality and model-agnostic nature, allowing for seamless integration with various deep architectures.

- **Summary**: We release MiDaS v3.1 for monocular depth estimation, offering a variety of new models based on different encoder backbones. This release is motivated by the success of transformers in computer vision, with a large variety of pretrained vision transformers now available. We explore how using the most promising vision transformers as image encoders impacts depth estimation quality and runtime of the MiDaS architecture. Our investigation also includes recent convolutional approaches that achieve comparable quality to vision transformers in image classification tasks. While the previous release MiDaS v3.0 solely leverages the vanilla vision transformer ViT, MiDaS v3.1 offers additional models based on BEiT, Swin, SwinV2, Next-ViT and LeViT. These models offer different performance-runtime tradeoffs. The best model improves the depth estimation quality by 28% while efficient models enable downstream tasks requiring high frame rates. We also describe the general process for integrating new backbones.

- **Summary**: Purpose: This study evaluated the out-of-domain performance and generalization capabilities of automated medical image segmentation models, with a particular focus on adaptation to new image acquisitions and disease type.   Materials: Datasets from both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans of healthy patients and those with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) were used. A total of 400 images (100 non-contrast controls, 100 contrast controls, 100 non-contrast PKD, 100 contrast PKD) were utilized for training/validation of models to segment kidneys, livers, and spleens, and the final models were then tested on 100 non-contrast CT images of patients affected by PKD. Performance was evaluated using Dice, Jaccard, TPR, and Precision.   Results: Models trained on a diverse range of data showed no worse performance than models trained exclusively on in-domain data when tested on in-domain data. For instance, the Dice similarity of the model trained on 25% from each dataset was found to be non-inferior to the model trained purely on in-domain data.   Conclusions: The results indicate that broader training examples significantly enhances model generalization and out-of-domain performance, thereby improving automated segmentation tools' applicability in clinical settings. The study's findings provide a roadmap for future research to adopt a data-centric approach in medical image AI model development.

- **Summary**: Computer vision (CV), a non-intrusive and cost-effective technology, has furthered the development of precision livestock farming by enabling optimized decision-making through timely and individualized animal care. The availability of affordable two- and three-dimensional camera sensors, combined with various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, has provided a valuable opportunity to improve livestock production systems. However, despite the availability of various CV tools in the public domain, applying these tools to animal data can be challenging, often requiring users to have programming and data analysis skills, as well as access to computing resources. Moreover, the rapid expansion of precision livestock farming is creating a growing need to educate and train animal science students in CV. This presents educators with the challenge of efficiently demonstrating the complex algorithms involved in CV. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop ShinyAnimalCV, an open-source cloud-based web application. This application provides a user-friendly interface for performing CV tasks, including object segmentation, detection, three-dimensional surface visualization, and extraction of two- and three-dimensional morphological features. Nine pre-trained CV models using top-view animal data are included in the application. ShinyAnimalCV has been deployed online using cloud computing platforms. The source code of ShinyAnimalCV is available on GitHub, along with detailed documentation on training CV models using custom data and deploying ShinyAnimalCV locally to allow users to fully leverage the capabilities of the application. ShinyAnimalCV can contribute to CV research and teaching in the animal science community.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce a challenging image restoration task, referred to as SuperInpaint, which aims to reconstruct missing regions in low-resolution images and generate completed images with arbitrarily higher resolutions. We have found that this task cannot be effectively addressed by stacking state-of-the-art super-resolution and image inpainting methods as they amplify each other's flaws, leading to noticeable artifacts. To overcome these limitations, we propose the detail-enhanced attentional implicit representation (DEAR) that can achieve SuperInpaint with a single model, resulting in high-quality completed images with arbitrary resolutions. Specifically, we use a deep convolutional network to extract the latent embedding of an input image and then enhance the high-frequency components of the latent embedding via an adaptive high-pass filter. This leads to detail-enhanced semantic embedding. We further feed the semantic embedding into an unmask-attentional module that suppresses embeddings from ineffective masked pixels. Additionally, we extract a pixel-wise importance map that indicates which pixels should be used for image reconstruction. Given the coordinates of a pixel we want to reconstruct, we first collect its neighboring pixels in the input image and extract their detail-enhanced semantic embeddings, unmask-attentional semantic embeddings, importance values, and spatial distances to the desired pixel. Then, we feed all the above terms into an implicit representation and generate the color of the specified pixel. To evaluate our method, we extend three existing datasets for this new task and build 18 meaningful baselines using SOTA inpainting and super-resolution methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing methods by a significant margin on four widely used metrics.

- **Summary**: Interpretable part-prototype models are computer vision models that are explainable by design. The models learn prototypical parts and recognise these components in an image, thereby combining classification and explanation. Despite the recent attention for intrinsically interpretable models, there is no comprehensive overview on evaluating the explanation quality of interpretable part-prototype models. Based on the Co-12 properties for explanation quality as introduced in arXiv:2201.08164 (e.g., correctness, completeness, compactness), we review existing work that evaluates part-prototype models, reveal research gaps and outline future approaches for evaluation of the explanation quality of part-prototype models. This paper, therefore, contributes to the progression and maturity of this relatively new research field on interpretable part-prototype models. We additionally provide a ``Co-12 cheat sheet'' that acts as a concise summary of our findings on evaluating part-prototype models.

- **Summary**: In brain tumor resection, accurate removal of cancerous tissues while preserving eloquent regions is crucial to the safety and outcomes of the treatment. However, intra-operative tissue deformation (called brain shift) can move the surgical target and render the pre-surgical plan invalid. Intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) has been adopted to provide real-time images to track brain shift, and inter-modal (i.e., MRI-iUS) registration is often required to update the pre-surgical plan. Quality control for the registration results during surgery is important to avoid adverse outcomes, but manual verification faces great challenges due to difficult 3D visualization and the low contrast of iUS. Automatic algorithms are urgently needed to address this issue, but the problem was rarely attempted. Therefore, we propose a novel deep learning technique based on 3D focal modulation in conjunction with uncertainty estimation to accurately assess MRI-iUS registration errors for brain tumor surgery. Developed and validated with the public RESECT clinical database, the resulting algorithm can achieve an estimation error of 0.59+-0.57 mm.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the representation of vehicle lights in computer vision and its implications for various tasks in the field of autonomous driving. Different specifications for representing vehicle lights, including bounding boxes, center points, corner points, and segmentation masks, are discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. Three important tasks in autonomous driving that can benefit from vehicle light detection are identified: nighttime vehicle detection, 3D vehicle orientation estimation, and dynamic trajectory cues. Each task may require a different representation of the light. The challenges of collecting and annotating large datasets for training data-driven models are also addressed, leading to introduction of the LISA Vehicle Lights Dataset and associated Light Visibility Model, which provides light annotations specifically designed for downstream applications in vehicle detection, intent and trajectory prediction, and safe path planning. A comparison of existing vehicle light datasets is provided, highlighting the unique features and limitations of each dataset. Overall, this paper provides insights into the representation of vehicle lights and the importance of accurate annotations for training effective detection models in autonomous driving applications.

- **Summary**: Homologous anatomical landmarks between medical scans are instrumental in quantitative assessment of image registration quality in various clinical applications, such as MRI-ultrasound registration for tissue shift correction in ultrasound-guided brain tumor resection. While manually identified landmark pairs between MRI and ultrasound (US) have greatly facilitated the validation of different registration algorithms for the task, the procedure requires significant expertise, labor, and time, and can be prone to inter- and intra-rater inconsistency. So far, many traditional and machine learning approaches have been presented for anatomical landmark detection, but they primarily focus on mono-modal applications. Unfortunately, despite the clinical needs, inter-modal/contrast landmark detection has very rarely been attempted. Therefore, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to detect corresponding landmarks between MRI and intra-operative US scans in neurosurgery. Specifically, two convolutional neural networks were trained jointly to encode image features in MRI and US scans to help match the US image patch that contain the corresponding landmarks in the MRI. We developed and validated the technique using the public RESECT database. With a mean landmark detection accuracy of 5.88+-4.79 mm against 18.78+-4.77 mm with SIFT features, the proposed method offers promising results for MRI-US landmark detection in neurosurgical applications for the first time.

- **Summary**: This paper details the challenges in applying two computer vision systems, an EfficientDET supervised learning model and the unsupervised RX spectral classifier, to 98.9 GB of drone imagery from the Wu-Murad wilderness search and rescue (WSAR) effort in Japan and identifies 3 directions for future research. There have been at least 19 proposed approaches and 3 datasets aimed at locating missing persons in drone imagery, but only 3 approaches (2 unsupervised and 1 of an unknown structure) are referenced in the literature as having been used in an actual WSAR operation. Of these proposed approaches, the EfficientDET architecture and the unsupervised spectral RX classifier were selected as the most appropriate for this setting. The EfficientDET model was applied to the HERIDAL dataset and despite achieving performance that is statistically equivalent to the state-of-the-art, the model fails to translate to the real world in terms of false positives (e.g., identifying tree limbs and rocks as people), and false negatives (e.g., failing to identify members of the search team). The poor results in practice for algorithms that showed good results on datasets suggest 3 areas of future research: more realistic datasets for wilderness SAR, computer vision models that are capable of seamlessly handling the variety of imagery that can be collected during actual WSAR operations, and better alignment on performance measures.

- **Summary**: Significant progress has recently been made in creative applications of large pre-trained models for downstream tasks in 3D vision, such as text-to-shape generation. This motivates our investigation of how these pre-trained models can be used effectively to generate 3D shapes from sketches, which has largely remained an open challenge due to the limited sketch-shape paired datasets and the varying level of abstraction in the sketches. We discover that conditioning a 3D generative model on the features (obtained from a frozen large pre-trained vision model) of synthetic renderings during training enables us to effectively generate 3D shapes from sketches at inference time. This suggests that the large pre-trained vision model features carry semantic signals that are resilient to domain shifts, i.e., allowing us to use only RGB renderings, but generalizing to sketches at inference time. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments investigating different design factors and demonstrate the effectiveness of our straightforward approach for generation of multiple 3D shapes per each input sketch regardless of their level of abstraction without requiring any paired datasets during training.

- **Summary**: We implemented a simple method for early detection in this research. The implemented methods are plotting the given mat files and analyzing scalogram images generated by performing Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) on the samples. Also, finding the mean, standard deviation (STD), and peak-to-peak (P2P) values from each signal also helped detect faulty signs. We have implemented the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method to track the progression.

- **Summary**: Deep learning systems have been proposed to improve the objectivity and efficiency of Ki- 67 PI scoring. The challenge is that while very accurate, deep learning techniques suffer from reduced performance when applied to out-of-domain data. This is a critical challenge for clinical translation, as models are typically trained using data available to the vendor, which is not from the target domain. To address this challenge, this study proposes a domain adaptation pipeline that employs an unsupervised framework to generate silver standard (pseudo) labels in the target domain, which is used to augment the gold standard (GS) source domain data. Five training regimes were tested on two validated Ki-67 scoring architectures (UV-Net and piNET), (1) SS Only: trained on target silver standard (SS) labels, (2) GS Only: trained on source GS labels, (3) Mixed: trained on target SS and source GS labels, (4) GS+SS: trained on source GS labels and fine-tuned on target SS labels, and our proposed method (5) SS+GS: trained on source SS labels and fine-tuned on source GS labels. The SS+GS method yielded significantly (p < 0.05) higher PI accuracy (95.9%) and more consistent results compared to the GS Only model on target data. Analysis of t-SNE plots showed features learned by the SS+GS models are more aligned for source and target data, resulting in improved generalization. The proposed pipeline provides an efficient method for learning the target distribution without manual annotations, which are time-consuming and costly to generate for medical images. This framework can be applied to any target site as a per-laboratory calibration method, for widescale deployment.

- **Summary**: In recent years, work has gone into developing deep interpretable methods for image classification that clearly attributes a model's output to specific features of the data. One such of these methods is the prototypical part network (ProtoPNet), which attempts to classify images based on meaningful parts of the input. While this method results in interpretable classifications, this method often learns to classify from spurious or inconsistent parts of the image. Hoping to remedy this, we take inspiration from the recent developments in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune these prototypes. By collecting human annotations of prototypes quality via a 1-5 scale on the CUB-200-2011 dataset, we construct a reward model that learns to identify non-spurious prototypes. In place of a full RL update, we propose the reweighted, reselected, and retrained prototypical part network (R3-ProtoPNet), which adds an additional three steps to the ProtoPNet training loop. The first two steps are reward-based reweighting and reselection, which align prototypes with human feedback. The final step is retraining to realign the model's features with the updated prototypes. We find that R3-ProtoPNet improves the overall consistency and meaningfulness of the prototypes, but lower the test predictive accuracy when used independently. When multiple R3-ProtoPNets are incorporated into an ensemble, we find an increase in test predictive performance while maintaining interpretability.

  manuscript and try to give a more accurate model
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: StyleGAN can use style to affect facial posture and identity features, and noise to affect hair, wrinkles, skin color and other details. Among these, the outcomes of the picture processing will vary slightly between different versions of styleGAN. As a result, the comparison of performance differences between styleGAN2 and the two modified versions of styleGAN3 will be the main focus of this study. We used the FFHQ dataset as the dataset and FID, EQ-T, and EQ-R were used to be the assessment of the model. In the end, we discovered that Stylegan3 version is a better generative network to improve the equivariance. Our findings have a positive impact on the creation of animation and videos.



### Adversarial Self-Attack Defense and Spatial-Temporal Relation Mining for Visible-Infrared Video Person Re-Identification

- **Summary**: In visible-infrared video person re-identification (re-ID), extracting features not affected by complex scenes (such as modality, camera views, pedestrian pose, background, etc.) changes, and mining and utilizing motion information are the keys to solving cross-modal pedestrian identity matching. To this end, the paper proposes a new visible-infrared video person re-ID method from a novel perspective, i.e., adversarial self-attack defense and spatial-temporal relation mining. In this work, the changes of views, posture, background and modal discrepancy are considered as the main factors that cause the perturbations of person identity features. Such interference information contained in the training samples is used as an adversarial perturbation. It performs adversarial attacks on the re-ID model during the training to make the model more robust to these unfavorable factors. The attack from the adversarial perturbation is introduced by activating the interference information contained in the input samples without generating adversarial samples, and it can be thus called adversarial self-attack. This design allows adversarial attack and defense to be integrated into one framework. This paper further proposes a spatial-temporal information-guided feature representation network to use the information in video sequences. The network cannot only extract the information contained in the video-frame sequences but also use the relation of the local information in space to guide the network to extract more robust features. The proposed method exhibits compelling performance on large-scale cross-modality video datasets. The source code of the proposed method will be released at https://github.com/lhf12278/xxx.

- **Summary**: Egocentric action anticipation is a challenging task that aims to make advanced predictions of future actions from current and historical observations in the first-person view. Most existing methods focus on improving the model architecture and loss function based on the visual input and recurrent neural network to boost the anticipation performance. However, these methods, which merely consider visual information and rely on a single network architecture, gradually reach a performance plateau. In order to fully understand what has been observed and capture the dependencies between current observations and future actions well enough, we propose a novel visual-semantic fusion enhanced and Transformer GRU-based action anticipation framework in this paper. Firstly, high-level semantic information is introduced to improve the performance of action anticipation for the first time. We propose to use the semantic features generated based on the class labels or directly from the visual observations to augment the original visual features. Secondly, an effective visual-semantic fusion module is proposed to make up for the semantic gap and fully utilize the complementarity of different modalities. Thirdly, to take advantage of both the parallel and autoregressive models, we design a Transformer based encoder for long-term sequential modeling and a GRU-based decoder for flexible iteration decoding. Extensive experiments on two large-scale first-person view datasets, i.e., EPIC-Kitchens and EGTEA Gaze+, validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous approaches by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Existing edge-aware camouflaged object detection (COD) methods normally output the edge prediction in the early stage. However, edges are important and fundamental factors in the following segmentation task. Due to the high visual similarity between camouflaged targets and the surroundings, edge prior predicted in early stage usually introduces erroneous foreground-background and contaminates features for segmentation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Edge-aware Mirror Network (EAMNet), which models edge detection and camouflaged object segmentation as a cross refinement process. More specifically, EAMNet has a two-branch architecture, where a segmentation-induced edge aggregation module and an edge-induced integrity aggregation module are designed to cross-guide the segmentation branch and edge detection branch. A guided-residual channel attention module which leverages the residual connection and gated convolution finally better extracts structural details from low-level features. Quantitative and qualitative experiment results show that EAMNet outperforms existing cutting-edge baselines on three widely used COD datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/sdy1999/EAMNet.

- **Summary**: Unconstrained face recognition is an active research area among computer vision and biometric researchers for many years now. Still the problem of face recognition in low quality photos has not been well-studied so far. In this paper, we explore the face recognition performance on low quality photos, and we try to improve the accuracy in dealing with low quality face images. We assemble a large database with low quality photos, and examine the performance of face recognition algorithms for three different quality sets. Using state-of-the-art facial image enhancement approaches, we explore the face recognition performance for the enhanced face images. To perform this without experimental bias, we have developed a new protocol for recognition with low quality face photos and validate the performance experimentally. Our designed protocol for face recognition with low quality face images can be useful to other researchers. Moreover, experiment results show some of the challenging aspects of this problem.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of the infected areas of the lung is essential for quantifying the severity of lung disease like pulmonary infections. Existing medical image segmentation methods are almost uni-modal methods based on image. However, these image-only methods tend to produce inaccurate results unless trained with large amounts of annotated data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a language-driven segmentation method that uses text prompt to improve to the segmentation result. Experiments on the QaTa-COV19 dataset indicate that our method improves the Dice score by 6.09% at least compared to the uni-modal methods. Besides, our extended study reveals the flexibility of multi-modal methods in terms of the information granularity of text and demonstrates that multi-modal methods have a significant advantage over image-only methods in terms of the size of training data required.

- **Summary**: The task of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to accurately segment camouflaged objects that integrated into the environment, which is more challenging than ordinary detection as the texture between the target and background is visually indistinguishable. In this paper, we proposed a novel Feature Grafting and Distractor Aware network (FDNet) to handle the COD task. Specifically, we use CNN and Transformer to encode multi-scale images in parallel. In order to better explore the advantages of the two encoders, we design a cross-attention-based Feature Grafting Module to graft features extracted from Transformer branch into CNN branch, after which the features are aggregated in the Feature Fusion Module. A Distractor Aware Module is designed to explicitly model the two possible distractors in the COD task to refine the coarse camouflage map. We also proposed the largest artificial camouflaged object dataset which contains 2000 images with annotations, named ACOD2K. We conducted extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets and the ACOD2K dataset. The results show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The code and the ACOD2K will be available at https://github.com/syxvision/FDNet.

- **Summary**: Text and signs around roads provide crucial information for drivers, vital for safe navigation and situational awareness. Scene text recognition in motion is a challenging problem, while textual cues typically appear for a short time span, and early detection at a distance is necessary. Systems that exploit such information to assist the driver should not only extract and incorporate visual and textual cues from the video stream but also reason over time. To address this issue, we introduce RoadTextVQA, a new dataset for the task of video question answering (VideoQA) in the context of driver assistance. RoadTextVQA consists of $3,222$ driving videos collected from multiple countries, annotated with $10,500$ questions, all based on text or road signs present in the driving videos. We assess the performance of state-of-the-art video question answering models on our RoadTextVQA dataset, highlighting the significant potential for improvement in this domain and the usefulness of the dataset in advancing research on in-vehicle support systems and text-aware multimodal question answering. The dataset is available at http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/roadtextvqa

- **Summary**: Multilabel representation learning is recognized as a challenging problem that can be associated with either label dependencies between object categories or data-related issues such as the inherent imbalance of positive/negative samples. Recent advances address these challenges from model- and data-centric viewpoints. In model-centric, the label correlation is obtained by an external model designs (e.g., graph CNN) to incorporate an inductive bias for training. However, they fail to design an end-to-end training framework, leading to high computational complexity. On the contrary, in data-centric, the realistic nature of the dataset is considered for improving the classification while ignoring the label dependencies. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end training framework -- dubbed KMCL (Kernel-based Mutlilabel Contrastive Learning) -- to address the shortcomings of both model- and data-centric designs. The KMCL first transforms the embedded features into a mixture of exponential kernels in Gaussian RKHS. It is then followed by encoding an objective loss that is comprised of (a) reconstruction loss to reconstruct kernel representation, (b) asymmetric classification loss to address the inherent imbalance problem, and (c) contrastive loss to capture label correlation. The KMCL models the uncertainty of the feature encoder while maintaining a low computational footprint. Extensive experiments are conducted on image classification tasks to showcase the consistent improvements of KMCL over the SOTA methods. PyTorch implementation is provided in \url{https://github.com/mahdihosseini/KMCL}.

- **Summary**: In city, information about urban objects such as water supply, railway lines, power lines, buildings, roads, etc., is necessary for city planning. In particular, information about the spread of these objects, locations and capacity is needed for the policymakers to make impactful decisions. This thesis aims to segment the building and roads from the aerial image captured by the satellites and UAVs. Many different architectures have been proposed for the semantic segmentation task and UNet being one of them. In this thesis, we propose a novel architecture based on Google's newly proposed EfficientNetV2 as an encoder for feature extraction with UNet decoder for constructing the segmentation map. Using this approach we achieved a benchmark score for the Massachusetts Building and Road dataset with an mIOU of 0.8365 and 0.9153 respectively.

- **Summary**: We propose a geometric deep-learning-based framework, TractGeoNet, for performing regression using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography and associated pointwise tissue microstructure measurements. By employing a point cloud representation, TractGeoNet can directly utilize pointwise tissue microstructure and positional information from all points within a fiber tract. To improve regression performance, we propose a novel loss function, the Paired-Siamese Regression loss, which encourages the model to focus on accurately predicting the relative differences between regression label scores rather than just their absolute values. In addition, we propose a Critical Region Localization algorithm to identify highly predictive anatomical regions within the white matter fiber tracts for the regression task. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by predicting individual performance on two neuropsychological assessments of language using a dataset of 20 association white matter fiber tracts from 806 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The results demonstrate superior prediction performance of TractGeoNet compared to several popular regression models. Of the twenty tracts studied, we find that the left arcuate fasciculus tract is the most highly predictive of the two studied language performance assessments. The localized critical regions are widespread and distributed across both hemispheres and all cerebral lobes, including areas of the brain considered important for language function such as superior and anterior temporal regions, pars opercularis, and precentral gyrus. Overall, TractGeoNet demonstrates the potential of geometric deep learning to enhance the study of the brain's white matter fiber tracts and to relate their structure to human traits such as language performance.

- **Summary**: Humans engage in learning and reviewing processes with curricula when acquiring new skills or knowledge. This human learning behavior has inspired the integration of curricula with replay methods in continual learning agents. The goal is to emulate the human learning process, thereby improving knowledge retention and facilitating learning transfer. Existing replay methods in continual learning agents involve the random selection and ordering of data from previous tasks, which has shown to be effective. However, limited research has explored the integration of different curricula with replay methods to enhance continual learning. Our study takes initial steps in examining the impact of integrating curricula with replay methods on continual learning in three specific aspects: the interleaved frequency of replayed exemplars with training data, the sequence in which exemplars are replayed, and the strategy for selecting exemplars into the replay buffer. These aspects of curricula design align with cognitive psychology principles and leverage the benefits of interleaved practice during replays, easy-to-hard rehearsal, and exemplar selection strategy involving exemplars from a uniform distribution of difficulties. Based on our results, these three curricula effectively mitigated catastrophic forgetting and enhanced positive knowledge transfer, demonstrating the potential of curricula in advancing continual learning methodologies.

- **Summary**: DeepFake based digital facial forgery is threatening public media security, especially when lip manipulation has been used in talking face generation, and the difficulty of fake video detection is further improved. By only changing lip shape to match the given speech, the facial features of identity are hard to be discriminated in such fake talking face videos. Together with the lack of attention on audio stream as the prior knowledge, the detection failure of fake talking face videos also becomes inevitable. It's found that the optical flow of the fake talking face video is disordered especially in the lip region while the optical flow of the real video changes regularly, which means the motion feature from optical flow is useful to capture manipulation cues. In this study, a fake talking face detection network (FTFDNet) is proposed by incorporating visual, audio and motion features using an efficient cross-modal fusion (CMF) module. Furthermore, a novel audio-visual attention mechanism (AVAM) is proposed to discover more informative features, which can be seamlessly integrated into any audio-visual CNN architecture by modularization. With the additional AVAM, the proposed FTFDNet is able to achieve a better detection performance than other state-of-the-art DeepFake video detection methods not only on the established fake talking face detection dataset (FTFDD) but also on the DeepFake video detection datasets (DFDC and DF-TIMIT).

- **Summary**: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computational photography, where achieving high-quality perceptual performance with low distortion is highly demanding. Current methods either struggle with perceptual performance or suffer from significant distortion. Recently, the emerging diffusion model achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, and its denoising mechanism demonstrates great potential for image denoising. However, stimulating diffusion models for image denoising is not straightforward and requires solving several critical problems. On the one hand, the input inconsistency hinders the connection of diffusion models and image denoising. On the other hand, the content inconsistency between the generated image and the desired denoised image introduces additional distortion. To tackle these problems, we present a novel strategy called Diffusion Model for Image Denoising (DMID) by understanding and rethinking the diffusion model from a denoising perspective. Our DMID strategy includes an adaptive embedding method that embeds the noisy image into a pre-trained diffusion model, and an adaptive ensembling method that reduces distortion in the denoised image. Our DMID strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on all distortion-based and perceptual metrics, for both Gaussian and real-world image denoising.

- **Summary**: The display devices like HDR10 televisions are increasingly prevalent in our daily life for visualizing high dynamic range (HDR) images. But the majority of media images on the internet remain in 8-bit standard dynamic range (SDR) format. Therefore, converting SDR images to HDR ones by inverse tone mapping (ITM) is crucial to unlock the full potential of abundant media images. However, existing ITM methods are usually developed with complex network architectures requiring huge computational costs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Improved Residual Network (IRNet) by enhancing the power of popular residual block for efficient ITM. Specifically, we propose a new Improved Residual Block (IRB) to extract and fuse multi-layer features for fine-grained HDR image reconstruction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our IRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ITM and joint SR-ITM tasks. The code, models and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/ThisisVikki/ITM-baseline.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes BPNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework to learn B\'ezier primitive segmentation on 3D point clouds. The existing works treat different primitive types separately, thus limiting them to finite shape categories. To address this issue, we seek a generalized primitive segmentation on point clouds. Taking inspiration from B\'ezier decomposition on NURBS models, we transfer it to guide point cloud segmentation casting off primitive types. A joint optimization framework is proposed to learn B\'ezier primitive segmentation and geometric fitting simultaneously on a cascaded architecture. Specifically, we introduce a soft voting regularizer to improve primitive segmentation and propose an auto-weight embedding module to cluster point features, making the network more robust and generic. We also introduce a reconstruction module where we successfully process multiple CAD models with different primitives simultaneously. We conducted extensive experiments on the synthetic ABC dataset and real-scan datasets to validate and compare our approach with different baseline methods. Experiments show superior performance over previous work in terms of segmentation, with a substantially faster inference speed.

- **Summary**: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is one of the most common types of childhood blood cancer. The quick start of the treatment process is critical to saving the patient's life, and for this reason, early diagnosis of this disease is essential. Examining the blood smear images of these patients is one of the methods used by expert doctors to diagnose this disease. Deep learning-based methods have numerous applications in medical fields, as they have significantly advanced in recent years. ALL diagnosis is not an exception in this field, and several machine learning-based methods for this problem have been proposed. In previous methods, high diagnostic accuracy was reported, but our work showed that this alone is not sufficient, as it can lead to models taking shortcuts and not making meaningful decisions. This issue arises due to the small size of medical training datasets. To address this, we constrained our model to follow a pipeline inspired by experts' work. We also demonstrated that, since a judgement based on only one image is insufficient, redefining the problem as a multiple-instance learning problem is necessary for achieving a practical result. Our model is the first to provide a solution to this problem in a multiple-instance learning setup. We introduced a novel pipeline for diagnosing ALL that approximates the process used by hematologists, is sensitive to disease biomarkers, and achieves an accuracy of 96.15%, an F1-score of 94.24%, a sensitivity of 97.56%, and a specificity of 90.91% on ALL IDB 1. Our method was further evaluated on an out-of-distribution dataset, which posed a challenging test and had acceptable performance. Notably, our model was trained on a relatively small dataset, highlighting the potential for our approach to be applied to other medical datasets with limited data availability.

- **Summary**: Modern diffusion models have set the state-of-the-art in AI image generation. Their success is due, in part, to training on Internet-scale data which often includes copyrighted work. This prompts questions about the extent to which these models learn from, imitate, or copy the work of human artists. This work suggests that tying copyright liability to the capabilities of the model may be useful given the evolving ecosystem of generative models. Specifically, much of the legal analysis of copyright and generative systems focuses on the use of protected data for training. As a result, the connections between data, training, and the system are often obscured. In our approach, we consider simple image classification techniques to measure a model's ability to imitate specific artists. Specifically, we use Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained (CLIP) encoders to classify images in a zero-shot fashion. Our process first prompts a model to imitate a specific artist. Then, we test whether CLIP can be used to reclassify the artist (or the artist's work) from the imitation. If these tests match the imitation back to the original artist, this suggests the model can imitate that artist's expression. Our approach is simple and quantitative. Furthermore, it uses standard techniques and does not require additional training. We demonstrate our approach with an audit of Stable Diffusion's capacity to imitate 70 professional digital artists with copyrighted work online. When Stable Diffusion is prompted to imitate an artist from this set, we find that the artist can be identified from the imitation with an average accuracy of 81.0%. Finally, we also show that a sample of the artist's work can be matched to these imitation images with a high degree of statistical reliability. Overall, these results suggest that Stable Diffusion is broadly successful at imitating individual human artists.

- **Summary**: Despite the impressive performance obtained by recent single-image hand modeling techniques, they lack the capability to capture sufficient details of the 3D hand mesh. This deficiency greatly limits their applications when high-fidelity hand modeling is required, e.g., personalized hand modeling. To address this problem, we design a frequency split network to generate 3D hand mesh using different frequency bands in a coarse-to-fine manner. To capture high-frequency personalized details, we transform the 3D mesh into the frequency domain, and propose a novel frequency decomposition loss to supervise each frequency component. By leveraging such a coarse-to-fine scheme, hand details that correspond to the higher frequency domain can be preserved. In addition, the proposed network is scalable, and can stop the inference at any resolution level to accommodate different hardware with varying computational powers. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of our method in terms of recovering personalized shape details, we introduce a new evaluation metric named Mean Signal-to-Noise Ratio (MSNR) to measure the signal-to-noise ratio of each mesh frequency component. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach generates fine-grained details for high-fidelity 3D hand reconstruction, and our evaluation metric is more effective for measuring mesh details compared with traditional metrics.

- **Summary**: The local explanation provides heatmaps on images to explain how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) derive their output. Due to its visual straightforwardness, the method has been one of the most popular explainable AI (XAI) methods for diagnosing CNNs. Through our formative study (S1), however, we captured ML engineers' ambivalent perspective about the local explanation as a valuable and indispensable envision in building CNNs versus the process that exhausts them due to the heuristic nature of detecting vulnerability. Moreover, steering the CNNs based on the vulnerability learned from the diagnosis seemed highly challenging. To mitigate the gap, we designed DeepFuse, the first interactive design that realizes the direct feedback loop between a user and CNNs in diagnosing and revising CNN's vulnerability using local explanations. DeepFuse helps CNN engineers to systemically search "unreasonable" local explanations and annotate the new boundaries for those identified as unreasonable in a labor-efficient manner. Next, it steers the model based on the given annotation such that the model doesn't introduce similar mistakes. We conducted a two-day study (S2) with 12 experienced CNN engineers. Using DeepFuse, participants made a more accurate and "reasonable" model than the current state-of-the-art. Also, participants found the way DeepFuse guides case-based reasoning can practically improve their current practice. We provide implications for design that explain how future HCI-driven design can move our practice forward to make XAI-driven insights more actionable.



### Calibration-Aware Margin Loss: Pushing the Accuracy-Calibration Consistency Pareto Frontier for Deep Metric Learning

- **Summary**: The ability to use the same distance threshold across different test classes / distributions is highly desired for a frictionless deployment of commercial image retrieval systems. However, state-of-the-art deep metric learning losses often result in highly varied intra-class and inter-class embedding structures, making threshold calibration a non-trivial process in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel metric named Operating-Point-Incosistency-Score (OPIS) that measures the variance in the operating characteristics across different classes in a target calibration range, and demonstrate that high accuracy of a metric learning embedding model does not guarantee calibration consistency for both seen and unseen classes. We find that, in the high-accuracy regime, there exists a Pareto frontier where accuracy improvement comes at the cost of calibration consistency. To address this, we develop a novel regularization, named Calibration-Aware Margin (CAM) loss, to encourage uniformity in the representation structures across classes during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate CAM's effectiveness in improving calibration-consistency while retaining or even enhancing accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art deep metric learning methods.

- **Summary**: Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is an unsupervised learning mechanism for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that has received significant attention from the neuromorphic hardware community. However, scaling such local learning techniques to deeper networks and large-scale tasks has remained elusive. In this work, we investigate a Deep-STDP framework where a convolutional network is trained in tandem with pseudo-labels generated by the STDP clustering process on the network outputs. We achieve $24.56\%$ higher accuracy and $3.5\times$ faster convergence speed at iso-accuracy on a 10-class subset of the Tiny ImageNet dataset in contrast to a $k$-means clustering approach.



### Combining transmission speckle photography and convolutional neural network for determination of fat content in cow's milk -- an exercise in classification of parameters of a complex suspension

- **Summary**: We have combined transmission speckle photography and machine learning for direct classification and recognition of milk fat content classes. Our aim was hinged on the fact that parameters of scattering particles (and the dispersion medium) can be linked to the intensity distribution (speckle) observed when coherent light is transmitted through a scattering medium. For milk, it is primarily the size distribution and concentration of fat globules, which constitutes the total fat content. Consequently, we trained convolutional neural network to recognise and classify laser speckle from different fat content classes (0.5, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.2%). We investigated four exposure-time protocols and obtained the highest performance for shorter exposure times, in which the intensity histograms are kept similar for all images and the most probable intensity in the speckle pattern is close to zero. Our neural network was able to recognize the milk fat content classes unambiguously and we obtained the highest test and independent classification accuracies of 100 and ~99% respectively. It indicates that the parameters of other complex realistic suspensions could be classified with similar methods.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen significant developments in the field of License Plate Recognition (LPR) through the integration of deep learning techniques and the increasing availability of training data. Nevertheless, reconstructing license plates (LPs) from low-resolution (LR) surveillance footage remains challenging. To address this issue, we introduce a Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) approach that integrates attention and transformer modules to enhance the detection of structural and textural features in LR images. Our approach incorporates sub-pixel convolution layers (also known as PixelShuffle) and a loss function that uses an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for feature extraction. We trained the proposed architecture on synthetic images created by applying heavy Gaussian noise to high-resolution LP images from two public datasets, followed by bicubic downsampling. As a result, the generated images have a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of less than 0.10. Our results show that our approach for reconstructing these low-resolution synthesized images outperforms existing ones in both quantitative and qualitative measures.

- **Summary**: Sensor fusion is a crucial augmentation technique for improving the accuracy and reliability of perception systems for automated vehicles under diverse driving conditions. However, adverse weather and low-light conditions remain challenging, where sensor performance degrades significantly, exposing vehicle safety to potential risks. Advanced sensors such as LiDARs can help mitigate the issue but with extremely high marginal costs. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based 3D object detection model "REDFormer" to tackle low visibility conditions, exploiting the power of a more practical and cost-effective solution by leveraging bird's-eye-view camera-radar fusion. Using the nuScenes dataset with multi-radar point clouds, weather information, and time-of-day data, our model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on classification and detection accuracy. Finally, we provide extensive ablation studies of each model component on their contributions to address the above-mentioned challenges. Particularly, it is shown in the experiments that our model achieves a significant performance improvement over the baseline model in low-visibility scenarios, specifically exhibiting a 31.31% increase in rainy scenes and a 46.99% enhancement in nighttime scenes.The source code of this study is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning usually compares one positive anchor sample with lots of negative samples to perform Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Alternatively, non-contrastive learning, as exemplified by methods like BYOL, SimSiam, and Barlow Twins, accomplishes SSL without the explicit use of negative samples. Inspired by the existing analysis for contrastive learning, we provide a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) understanding of many existing non-contrastive learning methods. Subsequently, we propose a novel loss function, Kernel-SSL, which directly optimizes the mean embedding and the covariance operator within the RKHS. In experiments, our method Kernel-SSL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on ImageNet datasets under the linear evaluation settings. Specifically, when performing 100 epochs pre-training, our method outperforms SimCLR by 4.6%.

- **Summary**: Deployment of Transformer models on the edge is increasingly challenging due to the exponentially growing model size and inference cost that scales quadratically with the number of tokens in the input sequence. Token pruning is an emerging solution to address this challenge due to its ease of deployment on various Transformer backbones. However, most token pruning methods require a computationally-expensive fine-tuning process after or during pruning, which is not desirable in many cases. Some recent works explore pruning of off-the-shelf pre-trained Transformers without fine-tuning. However, they only take the importance of tokens into consideration. In this work, we propose Zero-TPrune, the first zero-shot method that considers both the importance and similarity of tokens in performing token pruning. Zero-TPrune leverages the attention graph of pre-trained Transformer models to produce an importance rank for tokens and removes the less informative tokens. The attention matrix can be thought of as an adjacency matrix of a directed graph, to which a graph shift operator can be applied iteratively to obtain the importance score distribution. This distribution guides the partition of tokens into two groups and measures similarity between them. Due to the elimination of the fine-tuning overhead, Zero-TPrune can easily prune large models and perform hyperparameter tuning efficiently. We evaluate the performance of Zero-TPrune on vision tasks by applying it to various vision Transformer backbones. Compared with state-of-the-art pruning methods that require fine-tuning, Zero-TPrune not only eliminates the need for fine-tuning after pruning, but does so with only around 0.3% accuracy loss. Compared with state-of-the-art fine-tuning-free pruning methods, Zero-TPrune reduces accuracy loss by up to 45% on medium-sized models.

- **Summary**: Today ship hull inspection including the examination of the external coating, detection of defects, and other types of external degradation such as corrosion and marine growth is conducted underwater by means of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). The inspection process consists of a manual video analysis which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. To address this, we propose an automatic video analysis system using deep learning and computer vision to improve upon existing methods that only consider spatial information on individual frames in underwater ship hull video inspection. By exploring the benefits of adding temporal information and analyzing frame-based classifiers, we propose a multi-label video classification model that exploits the self-attention mechanism of transformers to capture spatiotemporal attention in consecutive video frames. Our proposed method has demonstrated promising results and can serve as a benchmark for future research and development in underwater video inspection applications.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual learning has been a major pillar of multi-modal machine learning, where the community mostly focused on its modality-aligned setting, i.e., the audio and visual modality are both assumed to signal the prediction target. With the Look, Listen, and Parse dataset (LLP), we investigate the under-explored unaligned setting, where the goal is to recognize audio and visual events in a video with only weak labels observed. Such weak video-level labels only tell what events happen without knowing the modality they are perceived (audio, visual, or both). To enhance learning in this challenging setting, we incorporate large-scale contrastively pre-trained models as the modality teachers. A simple, effective, and generic method, termed Visual-Audio Label Elaboration (VALOR), is innovated to harvest modality labels for the training events. Empirical studies show that the harvested labels significantly improve an attentional baseline by 8.0 in average F-score (Type@AV). Surprisingly, we found that modality-independent teachers outperform their modality-fused counterparts since they are noise-proof from the other potentially unaligned modality. Moreover, our best model achieves the new state-of-the-art on all metrics of LLP by a substantial margin (+5.4 F-score for Type@AV). VALOR is further generalized to Audio-Visual Event Localization and achieves the new state-of-the-art as well. Code is available at: https://github.com/Franklin905/VALOR.

- **Summary**: Adaptation of semantic segmentation networks to different visual conditions from those for which ground-truth annotations are available at training is vital for robust perception in autonomous cars and robots. However, previous work has shown that most feature-level adaptation methods, which employ adversarial training and are validated on synthetic-to-real adaptation, provide marginal gains in normal-to-adverse condition-level adaptation, being outperformed by simple pixel-level adaptation via stylization. Motivated by these findings, we propose to leverage stylization in performing feature-level adaptation by aligning the deep features extracted by the encoder of the network from the original and the stylized view of each input image with a novel feature invariance loss. In this way, we encourage the encoder to extract features that are invariant to the style of the input, allowing the decoder to focus on parsing these features and not on further abstracting from the specific style of the input. We implement our method, named Condition-Invariant Semantic Segmentation (CISS), on the top-performing domain adaptation architecture and demonstrate a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods both on Cityscapes$\to$ACDC and Cityscapes$\to$Dark Zurich adaptation. In particular, CISS is ranked first among all published unsupervised domain adaptation methods on the public ACDC leaderboard. Our method is also shown to generalize well to domains unseen during training, outperforming competing domain adaptation approaches on BDD100K-night and Nighttime Driving.

- **Summary**: Image inverse halftoning is a classic image restoration task, aiming to recover continuous-tone images from halftone images with only bilevel pixels. Because the halftone images lose much of the original image content, inverse halftoning is a classic ill-problem. Although existing inverse halftoning algorithms achieve good performance, their results lose image details and features. Therefore, it is still a challenge to recover high-quality continuous-tone images. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multiscale progressively residual learning network (MSPRL), which has a UNet architecture and takes multiscale input images. To make full use of different input image information, we design a shallow feature extraction module to capture similar features between images of different scales. We systematically study the performance of different methods and compare them with our proposed method. In addition, we employ different training strategies to optimize the model, which is important for optimizing the training process and improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MSPRL model obtains considerable performance gains in detail restoration.

- **Summary**: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is one of the most important retinal imaging technique. However, involuntary motion artifacts still pose a major challenge in OCT imaging that compromises the quality of downstream analysis, such as retinal layer segmentation and OCT Angiography. We propose deep learning based neural networks to correct axial and coronal motion artifacts in OCT based on a single volumetric scan. The proposed method consists of two fully-convolutional neural networks that predict Z and X dimensional displacement maps sequentially in two stages. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can effectively correct motion artifacts and achieve smaller error than other methods. Specifically, the method can recover the overall curvature of the retina, and can be generalized well to various diseases and resolutions.

- **Summary**: Understanding the complexity of human activities solely through an individual's data can be challenging. However, in many situations, surrounding individuals are likely performing similar activities, while existing human activity recognition approaches focus almost exclusively on individual measurements and largely ignore the context of the activity. Consider two activities: attending a small group meeting and working at an office desk. From solely an individual's perspective, it can be difficult to differentiate between these activities as they may appear very similar, even though they are markedly different. Yet, by observing others nearby, it can be possible to distinguish between these activities. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance the prediction accuracy of an individual's activities by incorporating insights from surrounding individuals. We have collected a real-world dataset from 20 participants with over 58 hours of data including activities such as attending lectures, having meetings, working in the office, and eating together. Compared to observing a single person in isolation, our proposed approach significantly improves accuracy. We regard this work as a first step in collaborative activity recognition, opening new possibilities for understanding human activity in group settings.

- **Summary**: In order to mimic the human few-shot learning (FSL) ability better and to make FSL closer to real-world applications, this paper proposes a practical FSL (pFSL) setting. pFSL is based on unsupervised pretrained models (analogous to human prior knowledge) and recognizes many novel classes simultaneously. Compared to traditional FSL, pFSL is simpler in its formulation, easier to evaluate, more challenging and more practical. To cope with the rarity of training examples, this paper proposes IbM2, an instance-based max-margin method not only for the new pFSL setting, but also works well in traditional FSL scenarios. Based on the Gaussian Annulus Theorem, IbM2 converts random noise applied to the instances into a mechanism to achieve maximum margin in the many-way pFSL (or traditional FSL) recognition task. Experiments with various self-supervised pretraining methods and diverse many- or few-way FSL tasks show that IbM2 almost always leads to improvements compared to its respective baseline methods, and in most cases the improvements are significant. With both the new pFSL setting and novel IbM2 method, this paper shows that practical few-shot learning is both viable and promising.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) show great zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we study how to leverage them for zero-shot visual question answering (VQA). Our approach is motivated by a few observations. First, VQA questions often require multiple steps of reasoning, which is still a capability that most PTMs lack. Second, different steps in VQA reasoning chains require different skills such as object detection and relational reasoning, but a single PTM may not possess all these skills. Third, recent work on zero-shot VQA does not explicitly consider multi-step reasoning chains, which makes them less interpretable compared with a decomposition-based approach. We propose a modularized zero-shot network that explicitly decomposes questions into sub reasoning steps and is highly interpretable. We convert sub reasoning tasks to acceptable objectives of PTMs and assign tasks to proper PTMs without any adaptation. Our experiments on two VQA benchmarks under the zero-shot setting demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and better interpretability compared with several baselines.

- **Summary**: Computational Pathology (CPATH) systems have the potential to automate diagnostic tasks. However, the artifacts on the digitized histological glass slides, known as Whole Slide Images (WSIs), may hamper the overall performance of CPATH systems. Deep Learning (DL) models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) may detect and exclude artifacts before running the diagnostic algorithm. A simple way to develop robust and generalized ViTs is to train them on massive datasets. Unfortunately, acquiring large medical datasets is expensive and inconvenient, prompting the need for a generalized artifact detection method for WSIs. In this paper, we present a student-teacher recipe to improve the classification performance of ViT for the air bubbles detection task. ViT, trained under the student-teacher framework, boosts its performance by distilling existing knowledge from the high-capacity teacher model. Our best-performing ViT yields 0.961 and 0.911 F1-score and MCC, respectively, observing a 7% gain in MCC against stand-alone training. The proposed method presents a new perspective of leveraging knowledge distillation over transfer learning to encourage the use of customized transformers for efficient preprocessing pipelines in the CPATH systems.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion task aims to generate a fused image which contains salient features and rich texture details from multi-source images. However, under complex illumination conditions, few algorithms pay attention to the edge information of local regions which is crucial for downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a fusion network based on the local edge enhancement, named LE2Fusion. Specifically, a local edge enhancement (LE2) module is proposed to improve the edge information under complex illumination conditions and preserve the essential features of image. For feature extraction, a multi-scale residual attention (MRA) module is applied to extract rich features. Then, with LE2, a set of enhancement weights are generated which are utilized in feature fusion strategy and used to guide the image reconstruction. To better preserve the local detail information and structure information, the pixel intensity loss function based on the local region is also presented. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits better fusion performance than the state-of-the-art fusion methods on public datasets.

- **Summary**: A concept-based classifier can explain the decision process of a deep learning model by human-understandable concepts in image classification problems. However, sometimes concept-based explanations may cause false positives, which misregards unrelated concepts as important for the prediction task. Our goal is to find the statistically significant concept for classification to prevent misinterpretation. In this study, we propose a method using a deep learning model to learn the image concept and then using the Knockoff samples to select the important concepts for prediction by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) under a certain value. We evaluate the proposed method in our synthetic and real data experiments. Also, it shows that our method can control the FDR properly while selecting highly interpretable concepts to improve the trustworthiness of the model.



### DePF: A Novel Fusion Approach based on Decomposition Pooling for Infrared and Visible Images

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to generate synthetic images simultaneously containing salient features and rich texture details, which can be used to boost downstream tasks. However, existing fusion methods are suffering from the issues of texture loss and edge information deficiency, which result in suboptimal fusion results. Meanwhile, the straight-forward up-sampling operator can not well preserve the source information from multi-scale features. To address these issues, a novel fusion network based on the decomposition pooling (de-pooling) manner is proposed, termed as DePF. Specifically, a de-pooling based encoder is designed to extract multi-scale image and detail features of source images at the same time. In addition, the spatial attention model is used to aggregate these salient features. After that, the fused features will be reconstructed by the decoder, in which the up-sampling operator is replaced by the de-pooling reversed operation. Different from the common max-pooling technique, image features after the de-pooling layer can retain abundant details information, which is benefit to the fusion process. In this case, rich texture information and multi-scale information are maintained during the reconstruction phase. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior fusion performance over the state-of-the-arts on multiple image fusion benchmarks.

- **Summary**: With more and more deep neural networks being deployed as various daily services, their reliability is essential. It's frightening that deep neural networks are vulnerable and sensitive to adversarial attacks, the most common one of which for the services is evasion-based. Recent works usually strengthen the robustness by adversarial training or leveraging the knowledge of an amount of clean data. However, in practical terms, retraining and redeploying the model need a large computational budget, leading to heavy losses to the online service. In addition, when adversarial examples of a certain attack are detected, only limited adversarial examples are available for the service provider, while much clean data may not be accessible. Given the mentioned problems, we propose a new scenario, RaPiD (Rapid Plug-in Defender), which is to rapidly defend against a certain attack for the frozen original service model with limitations of few clean and adversarial examples. Motivated by the generalization and the universal computation ability of pre-trained transformer models, we come up with a new defender method, CeTaD, which stands for Considering Pre-trained Transformers as Defenders. In particular, we evaluate the effectiveness and the transferability of CeTaD in the case of one-shot adversarial examples and explore the impact of different parts of CeTaD as well as training data conditions. CeTaD is flexible, able to be embedded into an arbitrary differentiable model, and suitable for various types of attacks.

- **Summary**: In this technical report, we briefly introduce our solution for the Zero/Few-shot Track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 2023 Challenge. For industrial visual inspection, building a single model that can be rapidly adapted to numerous categories without or with only a few normal reference images is a promising research direction. This is primarily because of the vast variety of the product types. For the zero-shot track, we propose a solution based on the CLIP model by adding extra linear layers. These layers are used to map the image features to the joint embedding space, so that they can compare with the text features to generate the anomaly maps. Besides, when the reference images are available, we utilize multiple memory banks to store their features and compare them with the features of the test images during the testing phase. In this challenge, our method achieved first place in the zero-shot track, especially excelling in segmentation with an impressive F1 score improvement of 0.0489 over the second-ranked participant. Furthermore, in the few-shot track, we secured the fourth position overall, with our classification F1 score of 0.8687 ranking first among all participating teams.

- **Summary**: In order to build self-consistent personalized dialogue agents, previous research has mostly focused on textual persona that delivers personal facts or personalities. However, to fully describe the multi-faceted nature of persona, image modality can help better reveal the speaker's personal characteristics and experiences in episodic memory (Rubin et al., 2003; Conway, 2009). In this work, we extend persona-based dialogue to the multimodal domain and make two main contributions. First, we present the first multimodal persona-based dialogue dataset named MPCHAT, which extends persona with both text and images to contain episodic memories. Second, we empirically show that incorporating multimodal persona, as measured by three proposed multimodal persona-grounded dialogue tasks (i.e., next response prediction, grounding persona prediction, and speaker identification), leads to statistically significant performance improvements across all tasks. Thus, our work highlights that multimodal persona is crucial for improving multimodal dialogue comprehension, and our MPCHAT serves as a high-quality resource for this research.

- **Summary**: We present a neural rendering-based method called NeRO for reconstructing the geometry and the BRDF of reflective objects from multiview images captured in an unknown environment. Multiview reconstruction of reflective objects is extremely challenging because specular reflections are view-dependent and thus violate the multiview consistency, which is the cornerstone for most multiview reconstruction methods. Recent neural rendering techniques can model the interaction between environment lights and the object surfaces to fit the view-dependent reflections, thus making it possible to reconstruct reflective objects from multiview images. However, accurately modeling environment lights in the neural rendering is intractable, especially when the geometry is unknown. Most existing neural rendering methods, which can model environment lights, only consider direct lights and rely on object masks to reconstruct objects with weak specular reflections. Therefore, these methods fail to reconstruct reflective objects, especially when the object mask is not available and the object is illuminated by indirect lights. We propose a two-step approach to tackle this problem. First, by applying the split-sum approximation and the integrated directional encoding to approximate the shading effects of both direct and indirect lights, we are able to accurately reconstruct the geometry of reflective objects without any object masks. Then, with the object geometry fixed, we use more accurate sampling to recover the environment lights and the BRDF of the object. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of accurately reconstructing the geometry and the BRDF of reflective objects from only posed RGB images without knowing the environment lights and the object masks.

- **Summary**: With the widespread use of the internet, it has become increasingly crucial to extract specific information from vast amounts of academic articles efficiently. Data mining techniques are generally employed to solve this issue. However, data mining for academic articles is challenging since it requires automatically extracting specific patterns in complex and unstructured layout documents. Current data mining methods for academic articles employ rule-based(RB) or machine learning(ML) approaches. However, using rule-based methods incurs a high coding cost for complex typesetting articles. On the other hand, simply using machine learning methods requires annotation work for complex content types within the paper, which can be costly. Furthermore, only using machine learning can lead to cases where patterns easily recognized by rule-based methods are mistakenly extracted. To overcome these issues, from the perspective of analyzing the standard layout and typesetting used in the specified publication, we emphasize implementing specific methods for specific characteristics in academic articles. We have developed a novel Text Block Refinement Framework (TBRF), a machine learning and rule-based scheme hybrid. We used the well-known ACL proceeding articles as experimental data for the validation experiment. The experiment shows that our approach achieved over 95% classification accuracy and 90% detection accuracy for tables and figures.

- **Summary**: To efficiently extract textual information from color degraded document images is a significant research area. The prolonged imperfect preservation of ancient documents has led to various types of degradation, such as page staining, paper yellowing, and ink bleeding. These types of degradation badly impact the image processing for features extraction. This paper introduces a novelty method employing generative adversarial networks based on color channel using discrete wavelet transform (CCDWT-GAN). The proposed method involves three stages: image preprocessing, image enhancement, and image binarization. In the initial step, we apply discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to retain the low-low (LL) subband image, thereby enhancing image quality. Subsequently, we divide the original input image into four single-channel colors (red, green, blue, and gray) to separately train adversarial networks. For the extraction of global and local features, we utilize the output image from the image enhancement stage and the entire input image to train adversarial networks independently, and then combine these two results as the final output. To validate the positive impact of the image enhancement and binarization stages on model performance, we conduct an ablation study. This work compares the performance of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on DIBCO and H-DIBCO ((Handwritten) Document Image Binarization Competition) datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that CCDWT-GAN achieves a top two performance on multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, on DIBCO 2013 and 2016 dataset, our method achieves F-measure (FM) values of 95.24 and 91.46, respectively.

- **Summary**: Transfer learning is a promising technique for medical image classification, particularly for long-tailed datasets. However, the scarcity of data in medical imaging domains often leads to overparameterization when fine-tuning large publicly available pre-trained models. Moreover, these large models are ineffective in deployment in clinical settings due to their computational expenses. To address these challenges, we propose FoPro-KD, a novel approach that unleashes the power of frequency patterns learned from frozen publicly available pre-trained models to enhance their transferability and compression. FoPro-KD comprises three modules: Fourier prompt generator (FPG), effective knowledge distillation (EKD), and adversarial knowledge distillation (AKD). The FPG module learns to generate targeted perturbations conditional on a target dataset, exploring the representations of a frozen pre-trained model, trained on natural images. The EKD module exploits these generalizable representations through distillation to a smaller target model, while the AKD module further enhances the distillation process. Through these modules, FoPro-KD achieves significant improvements in performance on long-tailed medical image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of leveraging the learned frequency patterns from pre-trained models to enhance transfer learning and compression of large pre-trained models for feasible deployment.

- **Summary**: Due to the recent success of diffusion models, text-to-image generation is becoming increasingly popular and achieves a wide range of applications. Among them, text-to-image editing, or continuous text-to-image generation, attracts lots of attention and can potentially improve the quality of generated images. It's common to see that users may want to slightly edit the generated image by making minor modifications to their input textual descriptions for several rounds of diffusion inference. However, such an image editing process suffers from the low inference efficiency of many existing diffusion models even using GPU accelerators. To solve this problem, we introduce Fast Image Semantically Edit (FISEdit), a cached-enabled sparse diffusion model inference engine for efficient text-to-image editing. The key intuition behind our approach is to utilize the semantic mapping between the minor modifications on the input text and the affected regions on the output image. For each text editing step, FISEdit can automatically identify the affected image regions and utilize the cached unchanged regions' feature map to accelerate the inference process. Extensive empirical results show that FISEdit can be $3.4\times$ and $4.4\times$ faster than existing methods on NVIDIA TITAN RTX and A100 GPUs respectively, and even generates more satisfactory images.

- **Summary**: Existing works have advanced Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models for video editing in a one-shot learning manner. Despite their low requirements of data and computation, these methods might produce results of unsatisfied consistency with text prompt as well as temporal sequence, limiting their applications in the real world. In this paper, we propose to address the above issues with a novel EI$^2$ model towards \textbf{E}nhancing v\textbf{I}deo \textbf{E}diting cons\textbf{I}stency of TTI-based frameworks. Specifically, we analyze and find that the inconsistent problem is caused by newly added modules into TTI models for learning temporal information. These modules lead to covariate shift in the feature space, which harms the editing capability. Thus, we design EI$^2$ to tackle the above drawbacks with two classical modules: Shift-restricted Temporal Attention Module (STAM) and Fine-coarse Frame Attention Module (FFAM). First, through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that covariate shift is highly related to Layer Normalization, thus STAM employs a \textit{Instance Centering} layer replacing it to preserve the distribution of temporal features. In addition, {STAM} employs an attention layer with normalized mapping to transform temporal features while constraining the variance shift. As the second part, we incorporate {STAM} with a novel {FFAM}, which efficiently leverages fine-coarse spatial information of overall frames to further enhance temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed EI$^2$ model for text-driven video editing.

- **Summary**: We tackle the task of scene flow estimation from point clouds. Given a source and a target point cloud, the objective is to estimate a translation from each point in the source point cloud to the target, resulting in a 3D motion vector field. Previous dominant scene flow estimation methods require complicated coarse-to-fine or recurrent architectures as a multi-stage refinement. In contrast, we propose a significantly simpler single-scale one-shot global matching to address the problem. Our key finding is that reliable feature similarity between point pairs is essential and sufficient to estimate accurate scene flow. To this end, we propose to decompose the feature extraction step via a hybrid local-global-cross transformer architecture which is crucial to accurate and robust feature representations. Extensive experiments show that GMSF sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple scene flow estimation benchmarks. On FlyingThings3D, with the presence of occlusion points, GMSF reduces the outlier percentage from the previous best performance of 27.4% to 11.7%. On KITTI Scene Flow, without any fine-tuning, our proposed method shows state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) are the two critical components of every conversational system that handles the task of understanding the user by capturing the necessary information in the form of slots and generating an appropriate response in accordance with the extracted information. Recently, dialogue systems integrated with complementary information such as images, audio, or video have gained immense popularity. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework with the capability to extract necessary slot values from the utterance and generate a coherent response, thereby assisting the user to achieve their desired goals in a multimodal dialogue system having both textual and visual information. The task of extracting the necessary information is dependent not only on the text but also on the visual cues present in the dialogue. Similarly, for the generation, the previous dialog context comprising multimodal information is significant for providing coherent and informative responses. We employ a multimodal hierarchical encoder using pre-trained DialoGPT and also exploit the knowledge base (Kb) to provide a stronger context for both the tasks. Finally, we design a slot attention mechanism to focus on the necessary information in a given utterance. Lastly, a decoder generates the corresponding response for the given dialogue context and the extracted slot values. Experimental results on the Multimodal Dialogue Dataset (MMD) show that the proposed framework outperforms the baselines approaches in both the tasks.

- **Summary**: Object detection is a critical component of various security-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving and video surveillance. However, existing deep learning-based object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which poses a significant challenge to their reliability and safety. Through experiments, we found that existing works on improving the adversarial robustness of object detectors have given a false sense of security. We argue that using adversarially pre-trained backbone networks is essential for enhancing the adversarial robustness of object detectors. We propose a simple yet effective recipe for fast adversarial fine-tuning on object detectors with adversarially pre-trained backbones. Without any modifications to the structure of object detectors, our recipe achieved significantly better adversarial robustness than previous works. Moreover, we explore the potential of different modern object detectors to improve adversarial robustness using our recipe and demonstrate several interesting findings. Our empirical results set a new milestone and deepen the understanding of adversarially robust object detection. Code and trained checkpoints will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: With the advance of AI, road object detection has been a prominent topic in computer vision, mostly using perspective cameras. Fisheye lens provides omnidirectional wide coverage for using fewer cameras to monitor road intersections, however with view distortions. To our knowledge, there is no existing open dataset prepared for traffic surveillance on fisheye cameras. This paper introduces an open FishEye8K benchmark dataset for road object detection tasks, which comprises 157K bounding boxes across five classes (Pedestrian, Bike, Car, Bus, and Truck). In addition, we present benchmark results of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) models, including variations of YOLOv5, YOLOR, YOLO7, and YOLOv8. The dataset comprises 8,000 images recorded in 22 videos using 18 fisheye cameras for traffic monitoring in Hsinchu, Taiwan, at resolutions of 1080$\times$1080 and 1280$\times$1280. The data annotation and validation process were arduous and time-consuming, due to the ultra-wide panoramic and hemispherical fisheye camera images with large distortion and numerous road participants, particularly people riding scooters. To avoid bias, frames from a particular camera were assigned to either the training or test sets, maintaining a ratio of about 70:30 for both the number of images and bounding boxes in each class. Experimental results show that YOLOv8 and YOLOR outperform on input sizes 640$\times$640 and 1280$\times$1280, respectively. The dataset will be available on GitHub with PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and YOLO annotation formats. The FishEye8K benchmark will provide significant contributions to the fisheye video analytics and smart city applications.

- **Summary**: Anticipating human actions in front of autonomous vehicles is a challenging task. Several papers have recently proposed model architectures to address this problem by combining multiple input features to predict pedestrian crossing actions. This paper focuses specifically on using images of the pedestrian's context as an input feature. We present several spatio-temporal model architectures that utilize standard CNN and Transformer modules to serve as a backbone for pedestrian anticipation. However, the objective of this paper is not to surpass state-of-the-art benchmarks but rather to analyze the positive and negative predictions of these models. Therefore, we provide insights on the explainability of vision-based Transformer models in the context of pedestrian action prediction. We will highlight cases where the model can achieve correct quantitative results but falls short in providing human-like explanations qualitatively, emphasizing the importance of investing in explainability for pedestrian action anticipation problems.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models have achieved tremendous progress far beyond what we ever expected. However, their computational costs and latency are also dramatically growing with rapid development, making model acceleration exceedingly critical for researchers with limited resources and consumers with low-end devices. Although extensively studied for unimodal models, the acceleration for multimodal models, especially the vision-language Transformers, is still relatively under-explored. Accordingly, this paper proposes \textbf{Cross}-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}nsemble of \textbf{T}okens (\textbf{\emph{CrossGET}}) as a universal vison-language Transformer acceleration framework, which adaptively reduces token numbers during inference via cross-modal guidance on-the-fly, leading to significant model acceleration while keeping high performance. Specifically, the proposed \textit{CrossGET} has two key designs:1) \textit{Cross-Guided Matching and Ensemble}. \textit{CrossGET} incorporates cross-modal guided token matching and ensemble to merge tokens effectively, only introducing cross-modal tokens with negligible extra parameters. 2) \textit{Complete-Graph Soft Matching}. In contrast to the previous bipartite soft matching approach, \textit{CrossGET} introduces an efficient and effective complete-graph soft matching policy to achieve more reliable token-matching results. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks, datasets, and model architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed \textit{CrossGET} framework. The code will be at https://github.com/sdc17/CrossGET.

- **Summary**: Despite the recent success of deep learning methods at achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy for medical image segmentation, some major limitations are still restricting their deployment into clinics. One major limitation of deep learning-based segmentation methods is their lack of robustness to variability in the image acquisition protocol and in the imaged anatomy that were not represented or were underrepresented in the training dataset. This suggests adding new manually segmented images to the training dataset to better cover the image variability. However, in most cases, the manual segmentation of medical images requires highly skilled raters and is time-consuming, making this solution prohibitively expensive. Even when manually segmented images from different sources are available, they are rarely annotated for exactly the same regions of interest. This poses an additional challenge for current state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation methods that rely on supervised learning and therefore require all the regions of interest to be segmented for all the images to be used for training. This thesis introduces new mathematical and optimization methods to mitigate those limitations.

- **Summary**: In computer vision, finding correct point correspondence among images plays an important role in many applications, such as image stitching, image retrieval, visual localization, etc. Most of the research works focus on the matching of local feature before a sampling method is employed, such as RANSAC, to verify initial matching results via repeated fitting of certain global transformation among the images. However, incorrect matches may still exist. Thus, a novel sampling scheme, Pentagon-Match (PMatch), is proposed in this work to verify the correctness of initially matched keypoints using pentagons randomly sampled from them. By ensuring shape and location of these pentagons are view-invariant with various evaluations of cross-ratio (CR), incorrect matches of keypoint can be identified easily with homography estimated from correctly matched pentagons. Experimental results show that highly accurate estimation of homography can be obtained efficiently for planar scenes of the HPatches dataset, based on keypoint matching results provided by LoFTR. Besides, accurate outlier identification for the above matching results and possible extension of the approach for multi-plane situation are also demonstrated.

- **Summary**: This paper implements and investigates popular adversarial attacks on the YOLOv5 Object Detection algorithm. The paper explores the vulnerability of the YOLOv5 to adversarial attacks in the context of traffic and road sign detection. The paper investigates the impact of different types of attacks, including the Limited memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (L-BFGS), the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack, the Carlini and Wagner (C&W) attack, the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) attack, the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack, One Pixel Attack, and the Universal Adversarial Perturbations attack on the accuracy of YOLOv5 in detecting traffic and road signs. The results show that YOLOv5 is susceptible to these attacks, with misclassification rates increasing as the magnitude of the perturbations increases. We also explain the results using saliency maps. The findings of this paper have important implications for the safety and reliability of object detection algorithms used in traffic and transportation systems, highlighting the need for more robust and secure models to ensure their effectiveness in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: This paper discusses the challenges of evaluating deblurring-methods quality and proposes a reduced-reference metric based on machine learning. Traditional quality-assessment metrics such as PSNR and SSIM are common for this task, but not only do they correlate poorly with subjective assessments, they also require ground-truth (GT) frames, which can be difficult to obtain in the case of deblurring. To develop and evaluate our metric, we created a new motion-blur dataset using a beam splitter. The setup captured various motion types using a static camera, as most scenes in existing datasets include blur due to camera motion. We also conducted two large subjective comparisons to aid in metric development. Our resulting metric requires no GT frames, and it correlates well with subjective human perception of blur.

- **Summary**: Causal mapping of the functional organisation of the human brain requires evidence of \textit{necessity} available at adequate scale only from pathological lesions of natural origin. This demands inferential models with sufficient flexibility to capture both the observable distribution of pathological damage and the unobserved distribution of the neural substrate. Current model frameworks -- both mass-univariate and multivariate -- either ignore distributed lesion-deficit relations or do not model them explicitly, relying on featurization incidental to a predictive task. Here we initiate the application of deep generative neural network architectures to the task of lesion-deficit inference, formulating it as the estimation of an expressive hierarchical model of the joint lesion and deficit distributions conditioned on a latent neural substrate. We implement such deep lesion deficit inference with variational convolutional volumetric auto-encoders. We introduce a comprehensive framework for lesion-deficit model comparison, incorporating diverse candidate substrates, forms of substrate interactions, sample sizes, noise corruption, and population heterogeneity. Drawing on 5500 volume images of ischaemic stroke, we show that our model outperforms established methods by a substantial margin across all simulation scenarios, including comparatively small-scale and noisy data regimes. Our analysis justifies the widespread adoption of this approach, for which we provide an open source implementation: https://github.com/guilherme-pombo/vae_lesion_deficit

- **Summary**: Interpretation of deep learning remains a very challenging problem. Although the Class Activation Map (CAM) is widely used to interpret deep model predictions by highlighting object location, it fails to provide insight into the salient features used by the model to make decisions. Furthermore, existing evaluation protocols often overlook the correlation between interpretability performance and the model's decision quality, which presents a more fundamental issue. This paper proposes a new two-stage interpretability method called the Decomposition Class Activation Map (Decom-CAM), which offers a feature-level interpretation of the model's prediction. Decom-CAM decomposes intermediate activation maps into orthogonal features using singular value decomposition and generates saliency maps by integrating them. The orthogonality of features enables CAM to capture local features and can be used to pinpoint semantic components such as eyes, noses, and faces in the input image, making it more beneficial for deep model interpretation. To ensure a comprehensive comparison, we introduce a new evaluation protocol by dividing the dataset into subsets based on classification accuracy results and evaluating the interpretability performance on each subset separately. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed Decom-CAM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods significantly by generating more precise saliency maps across all levels of classification accuracy. Combined with our feature-level interpretability approach, this paper could pave the way for a new direction for understanding the decision-making process of deep neural networks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in text-guided image generation. To leverage the knowledge of text-guided image generation models in image editing, current approaches either fine-tune the pretrained models using the input image (e.g., Imagic) or incorporate structure information as additional constraints into the pretrained models (e.g., ControlNet). However, fine-tuning large-scale diffusion models on a single image can lead to severe overfitting issues and lengthy inference time. The information leakage from pretrained models makes it challenging to preserve the text-irrelevant content of the input image while generating new features guided by language descriptions. On the other hand, methods that incorporate structural guidance (e.g., edge maps, semantic maps, keypoints) as additional constraints face limitations in preserving other attributes of the original image, such as colors or textures. A straightforward way to incorporate the original image is to directly use it as an additional control. However, since image editing methods are typically trained on the image reconstruction task, the incorporation can lead to the identical mapping issue, where the model learns to output an image identical to the input, resulting in limited editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a text-to-image editing model with Image Information Removal module (IIR) to selectively erase color-related and texture-related information from the original image, allowing us to better preserve the text-irrelevant content and avoid the identical mapping issue. We evaluate our model on three benchmark datasets: CUB, Outdoor Scenes, and COCO. Our approach achieves the best editability-fidelity trade-off, and our edited images are approximately 35% more preferred by annotators than the prior-arts on COCO.

- **Summary**: Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as Model Collapse and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel Hadamard Transform (HT)-based neural network layer for hybrid quantum-classical computing. It implements the regular convolutional layers in the Hadamard transform domain. The idea is based on the HT convolution theorem which states that the dyadic convolution between two vectors is equivalent to the element-wise multiplication of their HT representation. Computing the HT is simply the application of a Hadamard gate to each qubit individually, so the HT computations of our proposed layer can be implemented on a quantum computer. Compared to the regular Conv2D layer, the proposed HT-perceptron layer is computationally more efficient. Compared to a CNN with the same number of trainable parameters and 99.26\% test accuracy, our HT network reaches 99.31\% test accuracy with 57.1\% MACs reduced in the MNIST dataset; and in our ImageNet-1K experiments, our HT-based ResNet-50 exceeds the accuracy of the baseline ResNet-50 by 0.59\% center-crop top-1 accuracy using 11.5\% fewer parameters with 12.6\% fewer MACs.

- **Summary**: Dense regression is a widely used approach in computer vision for tasks such as image super-resolution, enhancement, depth estimation, etc. However, the high cost of annotation and labeling makes it challenging to achieve accurate results. We propose incorporating active learning into dense regression models to address this problem. Active learning allows models to select the most informative samples for labeling, reducing the overall annotation cost while improving performance. Despite its potential, active learning has not been widely explored in high-dimensional computer vision regression tasks like super-resolution. We address this research gap and propose a new framework called USIM-DAL that leverages the statistical properties of colour images to learn informative priors using probabilistic deep neural networks that model the heteroscedastic predictive distribution allowing uncertainty quantification. Moreover, the aleatoric uncertainty from the network serves as a proxy for error that is used for active learning. Our experiments on a wide variety of datasets spanning applications in natural images (visual genome, BSD100), medical imaging (histopathology slides), and remote sensing (satellite images) demonstrate the efficacy of the newly proposed USIM-DAL and superiority over several dense regression active learning methods.

- **Summary**: The vulnerabilities of fingerprint authentication systems have raised security concerns when adapting them to highly secure access-control applications. Therefore, Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection (FPAD) methods are essential for ensuring reliable fingerprint authentication. Owing to the lack of generation capacity of traditional handcrafted based approaches, deep learning-based FPAD has become mainstream and has achieved remarkable performance in the past decade. Existing reviews have focused more on hand-cratfed rather than deep learning-based methods, which are outdated. To stimulate future research, we will concentrate only on recent deep-learning-based FPAD methods. In this paper, we first briefly introduce the most common Presentation Attack Instruments (PAIs) and publicly available fingerprint Presentation Attack (PA) datasets. We then describe the existing deep-learning FPAD by categorizing them into contact, contactless, and smartphone-based approaches. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing the open challenges at the current stage and emphasizing the potential future perspective.

- **Summary**: Large-scale vision language (VL) models use Transformers to perform cross-modal interactions between the input text and image. These cross-modal interactions are computationally expensive and memory-intensive due to the quadratic complexity of processing the input image and text. We present PuMer: a token reduction framework that uses text-informed Pruning and modality-aware Merging strategies to progressively reduce the tokens of input image and text, improving model inference speed and reducing memory footprint. PuMer learns to keep salient image tokens related to the input text and merges similar textual and visual tokens by adding lightweight token reducer modules at several cross-modal layers in the VL model. Training PuMer is mostly the same as finetuning the original VL model but faster. Our evaluation for two vision language models on four downstream VL tasks shows PuMer increases inference throughput by up to 2x and reduces memory footprint by over 50% while incurring less than a 1% accuracy drop.

- **Summary**: Potatoes are the third-largest food crop globally, but their production frequently encounters difficulties because of aggressive pest infestations. The aim of this study is to investigate the various types and characteristics of these pests and propose an efficient PotatoPestNet AI-based automatic potato pest identification system. To accomplish this, we curated a reliable dataset consisting of eight types of potato pests. We leveraged the power of transfer learning by employing five customized, pre-trained transfer learning models: CMobileNetV2, CNASLargeNet, CXception, CDenseNet201, and CInceptionV3, in proposing a robust PotatoPestNet model to accurately classify potato pests. To improve the models' performance, we applied various augmentation techniques, incorporated a global average pooling layer, and implemented proper regularization methods. To further enhance the performance of the models, we utilized random search (RS) optimization for hyperparameter tuning. This optimization technique played a significant role in fine-tuning the models and achieving improved performance. We evaluated the models both visually and quantitatively, utilizing different evaluation metrics. The robustness of the models in handling imbalanced datasets was assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Among the models, the Customized Tuned Inception V3 (CTInceptionV3) model, optimized through random search, demonstrated outstanding performance. It achieved the highest accuracy (91%), precision (91%), recall (91%), and F1-score (91%), showcasing its superior ability to accurately identify and classify potato pests.

- **Summary**: Image-caption pretraining has been quite successfully used for downstream vision tasks like zero-shot image classification and object detection. However, image-caption pretraining is still a hard problem -- it requires multiple concepts (nouns) from captions to be aligned to several objects in images. To tackle this problem, we go to the roots -- the best learner, children. We take inspiration from cognitive science studies dealing with children's language learning to propose a curriculum learning framework. The learning begins with easy-to-align image caption pairs containing one concept per caption. The difficulty is progressively increased with each new phase by adding one more concept per caption. Correspondingly, the knowledge acquired in each learning phase is utilized in subsequent phases to effectively constrain the learning problem to aligning one new concept-object pair in each phase. We show that this learning strategy improves over vanilla image-caption training in various settings -- pretraining from scratch, using a pretrained image or/and pretrained text encoder, low data regime etc.

- **Summary**: Lung cancer is the leading reason behind cancer-related deaths within the world. Early detection of lung nodules is vital for increasing the survival rate of cancer patients. Traditionally, physicians should manually identify the world suspected of getting carcinoma. When developing these detection systems, the arbitrariness of lung nodules' shape, size, and texture could be a challenge. Many studies showed the applied of computer vision algorithms to accurate diagnosis and classification of lung nodules. A deep learning algorithm called the VGG16 was developed during this paper to help medical professionals diagnose and classify carcinoma nodules. VGG16 can classify medical images of carcinoma in malignant, benign, and healthy patients. This paper showed that nodule detection using this single neural network had 92.08% sensitivity, 91% accuracy, and an AUC of 93%.

- **Summary**: Mesh deformation is a core task for 3D mesh reconstruction, but defining an efficient discrepancy between predicted and target meshes remains an open problem. A prevalent approach in current deep learning is the set-based approach which measures the discrepancy between two surfaces by comparing two randomly sampled point-clouds from the two meshes with Chamfer pseudo-distance. Nevertheless, the set-based approach still has limitations such as lacking a theoretical guarantee for choosing the number of points in sampled point-clouds, and the pseudo-metricity and the quadratic complexity of the Chamfer divergence. To address these issues, we propose a novel metric for learning mesh deformation. The metric is defined by sliced Wasserstein distance on meshes represented as probability measures that generalize the set-based approach. By leveraging probability measure space, we gain flexibility in encoding meshes using diverse forms of probability measures, such as continuous, empirical, and discrete measures via \textit{varifold} representation. After having encoded probability measures, we can compare meshes by using the sliced Wasserstein distance which is an effective optimal transport distance with linear computational complexity and can provide a fast statistical rate for approximating the surface of meshes. Furthermore, we employ a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to deform the input surface into the target shape by modeling the trajectories of the points on the surface. Our experiments on cortical surface reconstruction demonstrate that our approach surpasses other competing methods in multiple datasets and metrics.

- **Summary**: The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) has increased attention to pruning neural networks at initialization. We study this problem in the linear setting. We show that finding a sparse mask at initialization is equivalent to the sketching problem introduced for efficient matrix multiplication. This gives us tools to analyze the LTH problem and gain insights into it. Specifically, using the mask found at initialization, we bound the approximation error of the pruned linear model at the end of training. We theoretically justify previous empirical evidence that the search for sparse networks may be data independent. By using the sketching perspective, we suggest a generic improvement to existing algorithms for pruning at initialization, which we show to be beneficial in the data-independent case.

- **Summary**: When humans perform a task with an articulated object, they interact with the object only in a handful of ways, while the space of all possible interactions is nearly endless. This is because humans have prior knowledge about what interactions are likely to be successful, i.e., to open a new door we first try the handle. While learning such priors without supervision is easy for humans, it is notoriously hard for machines. In this work, we tackle unsupervised learning of priors of useful interactions with articulated objects, which we call interaction modes. In contrast to the prior art, we use no supervision or privileged information; we only assume access to the depth sensor in the simulator to learn the interaction modes. More precisely, we define a successful interaction as the one changing the visual environment substantially and learn a generative model of such interactions, that can be conditioned on the desired goal state of the object. In our experiments, we show that our model covers most of the human interaction modes, outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for affordance learning, and can generalize to objects never seen during training. Additionally, we show promising results in the goal-conditional setup, where our model can be quickly fine-tuned to perform a given task. We show in the experiments that such affordance learning predicts interaction which covers most modes of interaction for the querying articulated object and can be fine-tuned to a goal-conditional model.

- **Summary**: Multi-agent applications have recently gained significant popularity. In many computer vision tasks, a network of agents, such as a team of robots with cameras, could work collaboratively to perceive the environment for efficient and accurate situation awareness. However, these agents often have limited computation, communication, and storage resources. Thus, reducing resource consumption while still providing an accurate perception of the environment becomes an important goal when deploying multi-agent systems. To achieve this goal, we identify and leverage the overlap among different camera views in multi-agent systems for reducing the processing, transmission and storage of redundant/unimportant video frames. Specifically, we have developed two collaborative multi-agent video fast-forwarding frameworks in distributed and centralized settings, respectively. In these frameworks, each individual agent can selectively process or skip video frames at adjustable paces based on multiple strategies via reinforcement learning. Multiple agents then collaboratively sense the environment via either 1) a consensus-based distributed framework called DMVF that periodically updates the fast-forwarding strategies of agents by establishing communication and consensus among connected neighbors, or 2) a centralized framework called MFFNet that utilizes a central controller to decide the fast-forwarding strategies for agents based on collected data. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed frameworks on a real-world surveillance video dataset VideoWeb and a new simulated driving dataset CarlaSim, through extensive simulations and deployment on an embedded platform with TCP communication. We show that compared with other approaches in the literature, our frameworks achieve better coverage of important frames, while significantly reducing the number of frames processed at each agent.

- **Summary**: The interest in dynamic vision sensor (DVS)-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is raising, especially due to the microsecond-level reaction time of the bio-inspired event sensor, which increases robustness and reduces latency of the perception tasks compared to a RGB camera. This work presents ColibriUAV, a UAV platform with both frame-based and event-based cameras interfaces for efficient perception and near-sensor processing. The proposed platform is designed around Kraken, a novel low-power RISC-V System on Chip with two hardware accelerators targeting spiking neural networks and deep ternary neural networks.Kraken is capable of efficiently processing both event data from a DVS camera and frame data from an RGB camera. A key feature of Kraken is its integrated, dedicated interface with a DVS camera. This paper benchmarks the end-to-end latency and power efficiency of the neuromorphic and event-based UAV subsystem, demonstrating state-of-the-art event data with a throughput of 7200 frames of events per second and a power consumption of 10.7 \si{\milli\watt}, which is over 6.6 times faster and a hundred times less power-consuming than the widely-used data reading approach through the USB interface. The overall sensing and processing power consumption is below 50 mW, achieving latency in the milliseconds range, making the platform suitable for low-latency autonomous nano-drones as well.

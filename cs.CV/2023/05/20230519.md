- **Summary**: Egocentric temporal action segmentation in videos is a crucial task in computer vision with applications in various fields such as mixed reality, human behavior analysis, and robotics. Although recent research has utilized advanced visual-language frameworks, transformers remain the backbone of action segmentation models. Therefore, it is necessary to improve transformers to enhance the robustness of action segmentation models. In this work, we propose two novel ideas to enhance the state-of-the-art transformer for action segmentation. First, we introduce a dual dilated attention mechanism to adaptively capture hierarchical representations in both local-to-global and global-to-local contexts. Second, we incorporate cross-connections between the encoder and decoder blocks to prevent the loss of local context by the decoder. We also utilize state-of-the-art visual-language representation learning techniques to extract richer and more compact features for our transformer. Our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA) and HOI4D Office Tools datasets, and we validate our introduced components with ablation studies.

- **Summary**: With the emphasis on healthcare, early childhood education, and fitness, non-invasive measurement and recognition methods have received more attention. Pressure sensing has been extensively studied due to its advantages of simple structure, easy access, visualization application, and harmlessness. This paper introduces a smart pressure e-mat (SPeM) system based on a piezoresistive material Velostat for human monitoring applications, including sleeping postures, sports, and yoga recognition. After a subsystem scans e-mat readings and processes the signal, it generates a pressure image stream. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to fit and train the pressure image stream and recognize the corresponding human behavior. Four sleeping postures and five dynamic activities inspired by Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure (RFA) are used as a preliminary validation of the proposed SPeM system. The SPeM system achieves high accuracies on both applications, which demonstrates the high accuracy and generalization ability of the models. Compared with other pressure sensor-based systems, SPeM possesses more flexible applications and commercial application prospects, with reliable, robust, and repeatable properties.

- **Summary**: Image compression is a fundamental technology for Internet communication engineering. However, a high compression rate with general methods may degrade images, resulting in unreadable texts. In this paper, we propose an image compression method for maintaining text quality. We developed a scene text image quality assessment model to assess text quality in compressed images. The assessment model iteratively searches for the best-compressed image holding high-quality text. Objective and subjective results showed that the proposed method was superior to existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed assessment model outperformed other deep-learning regression models.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a crucial but challenging cross-modal navigation task. One powerful technique to enhance the generalization performance in VLN is the use of an independent speaker model to provide pseudo instructions for data augmentation. However, current speaker models based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) lack the ability to attend to features relevant at different locations and time steps. To address this, we propose a novel progress-aware spatio-temporal transformer speaker (PASTS) model that uses the transformer as the core of the network. PASTS uses a spatio-temporal encoder to fuse panoramic representations and encode intermediate connections through steps. Besides, to avoid the misalignment problem that could result in incorrect supervision, a speaker progress monitor (SPM) is proposed to enable the model to estimate the progress of instruction generation and facilitate more fine-grained caption results. Additionally, a multifeature dropout (MFD) strategy is introduced to alleviate overfitting. The proposed PASTS is flexible to be combined with existing VLN models. The experimental results demonstrate that PASTS outperforms all existing speaker models and successfully improves the performance of previous VLN models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the standard Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Transformers achieve promising performance in document understanding because of their high effectiveness and still suffer from quadratic computational complexity dependency on the sequence length. General efficient transformers are challenging to be directly adapted to model document. They are unable to handle the layout representation in documents, e.g. word, line and paragraph, on different granularity levels and seem hard to achieve a good trade-off between efficiency and performance. To tackle the concerns, we propose Fast-StrucTexT, an efficient multi-modal framework based on the StrucTexT algorithm with an hourglass transformer architecture, for visual document understanding. Specifically, we design a modality-guided dynamic token merging block to make the model learn multi-granularity representation and prunes redundant tokens. Additionally, we present a multi-modal interaction module called Symmetry Cross Attention (SCA) to consider multi-modal fusion and efficiently guide the token mergence. The SCA allows one modality input as query to calculate cross attention with another modality in a dual phase. Extensive experiments on FUNSD, SROIE, and CORD datasets demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance and almost 1.9X faster inference time than the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Humans exhibit complex motions that vary depending on the task that they are performing, the interactions they engage in, as well as subject-specific preferences. Therefore, forecasting future poses based on the history of the previous motions is a challenging task. This paper presents an innovative auxiliary-memory-powered deep neural network framework for the improved modelling of historical knowledge. Specifically, we disentangle subject-specific, task-specific, and other auxiliary information from the observed pose sequences and utilise these factorised features to query the memory. A novel Multi-Head knowledge retrieval scheme leverages these factorised feature embeddings to perform multiple querying operations over the historical observations captured within the auxiliary memory. Moreover, our proposed dynamic masking strategy makes this feature disentanglement process dynamic. Two novel loss functions are introduced to encourage diversity within the auxiliary memory while ensuring the stability of the memory contents, such that it can locate and store salient information that can aid the long-term prediction of future motion, irrespective of data imbalances or the diversity of the input data distribution. With extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmarks, Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap, we demonstrate that these design choices collectively allow the proposed approach to outperform the current state-of-the-art methods by significant margins: $>$ 17\% on the Human3.6M dataset and $>$ 9\% on the CMU-Mocap dataset.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in single image super-resolution (SISR). However, the lack of locality mechanism and high complexity limit their application in the field of super-resolution (SR). To solve these problems, we propose a new method, Efficient Mixed Transformer (EMT) in this study. Specifically, we propose the Mixed Transformer Block (MTB), consisting of multiple consecutive transformer layers, in some of which the Pixel Mixer (PM) is used to replace the Self-Attention (SA). PM can enhance the local knowledge aggregation with pixel shifting operations. At the same time, no additional complexity is introduced as PM has no parameters and floating-point operations. Moreover, we employ striped window for SA (SWSA) to gain an efficient global dependency modelling by utilizing image anisotropy. Experimental results show that EMT outperforms the existing methods on benchmark dataset and achieved state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Real-time semantic segmentation is a challenging task that requires high-accuracy models with low-inference times. Implementing these models on embedded systems is limited by hardware capability and memory usage, which produces bottlenecks. We propose an efficient model for real-time semantic segmentation called JetSeg, consisting of an encoder called JetNet, and an improved RegSeg decoder. The JetNet is designed for GPU-Embedded Systems and includes two main components: a new light-weight efficient block called JetBlock, that reduces the number of parameters minimizing memory usage and inference time without sacrificing accuracy; a new strategy that involves the combination of asymmetric and non-asymmetric convolutions with depthwise-dilated convolutions called JetConv, a channel shuffle operation, light-weight activation functions, and a convenient number of group convolutions for embedded systems, and an innovative loss function named JetLoss, which integrates the Precision, Recall, and IoUB losses to improve semantic segmentation and reduce computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate that JetSeg is much faster on workstation devices and more suitable for Low-Power GPU-Embedded Systems than existing state-of-the-art models for real-time semantic segmentation. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art real-time encoder-decoder models by reducing 46.70M parameters and 5.14% GFLOPs, which makes JetSeg up to 2x faster on the NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU and the Jetson Xavier than other models. The JetSeg code is available at https://github.com/mmontielpz/jetseg.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the challenge of spatio-temporal video prediction, which involves generating future videos based on historical data streams. Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to enhance video prediction, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Furthermore, their high computational demands could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel approach called Physics-assisted Spatio-temporal Network (PastNet) for generating high-quality video predictions. The core of our PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.

- **Summary**: In the last decade, the computer vision field has seen significant progress in multimodal data fusion and learning, where multiple sensors, including depth, infrared, and visual, are used to capture the environment across diverse spectral ranges. Despite these advancements, there has been no systematic and comprehensive evaluation of fusing RGB-D and thermal modalities to date. While autonomous driving using LiDAR, radar, RGB, and other sensors has garnered substantial research interest, along with the fusion of RGB and depth modalities, the integration of thermal cameras and, specifically, the fusion of RGB-D and thermal data, has received comparatively less attention. This might be partly due to the limited number of publicly available datasets for such applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of both, state-of-the-art and traditional methods used in fusing RGB-D and thermal camera data for various applications, such as site inspection, human tracking, fault detection, and others. The reviewed literature has been categorised into technical areas, such as 3D reconstruction, segmentation, object detection, available datasets, and other related topics. Following a brief introduction and an overview of the methodology, the study delves into calibration and registration techniques, then examines thermal visualisation and 3D reconstruction, before discussing the application of classic feature-based techniques as well as modern deep learning approaches. The paper concludes with a discourse on current limitations and potential future research directions. It is hoped that this survey will serve as a valuable reference for researchers looking to familiarise themselves with the latest advancements and contribute to the RGB-DT research field.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision-language models have inspired much research on few-shot learning. However, with only a few training images, there exist two crucial problems: (1) the visual feature distributions are easily distracted by class-irrelevant information in images, and (2) the alignment between the visual and language feature distributions is difficult. To deal with the distraction problem, we propose a Selective Attack module, which consists of trainable adapters that generate spatial attention maps of images to guide the attacks on class-irrelevant image areas. By messing up these areas, the critical features are captured and the visual distributions of image features are calibrated. To better align the visual and language feature distributions that describe the same object class, we propose a cross-modal distribution alignment module, in which we introduce a vision-language prototype for each class to align the distributions, and adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to optimize the prototypes. For efficient computation, the upper bound of EMD is derived. In addition, we propose an augmentation strategy to increase the diversity of the images and the text prompts, which can reduce overfitting to the few-shot training images. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior arts in few-shot learning. The implementation code will be available at https://github.com/bhrqw/SADA.

- **Summary**: Multi-modality image fusion is a technique used to combine information from different sensors or modalities, allowing the fused image to retain complementary features from each modality, such as functional highlights and texture details. However, effectively training such fusion models is difficult due to the lack of ground truth fusion data. To address this issue, we propose the Equivariant Multi-Modality imAge fusion (EMMA) paradigm for end-to-end self-supervised learning. Our approach is based on the prior knowledge that natural images are equivariant to specific transformations. Thus, we introduce a novel training framework that includes a fusion module and a learnable pseudo-sensing module, which allow the network training to follow the principles of physical sensing and imaging process, and meanwhile satisfy the equivariant prior for natural images. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality fusion results for both infrared-visible and medical images, while facilitating downstream multi-modal segmentation and detection tasks. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: There has been a growing interest in using deep learning models for processing long surgical videos, in order to automatically detect clinical/operational activities and extract metrics that can enable workflow efficiency tools and applications. However, training such models require vast amounts of labeled data which is costly and not scalable. Recently, self-supervised learning has been explored in computer vision community to reduce the burden of the annotation cost. Masked autoencoders (MAE) got the attention in self-supervised paradigm for Vision Transformers (ViTs) by predicting the randomly masked regions given the visible patches of an image or a video clip, and have shown superior performance on benchmark datasets. However, the application of MAE in surgical data remains unexplored. In this paper, we first investigate whether MAE can learn transferrable representations in surgical video domain. We propose SurgMAE, which is a novel architecture with a masking strategy based on sampling high spatio-temporal tokens for MAE. We provide an empirical study of SurgMAE on two large scale long surgical video datasets, and find that our method outperforms several baselines in low data regime. We conduct extensive ablation studies to show the efficacy of our approach and also demonstrate it's superior performance on UCF-101 to prove it's generalizability in non-surgical datasets as well.



### ReDirTrans: Latent-to-Latent Translation for Gaze and Head Redirection

- **Summary**: Learning-based gaze estimation methods require large amounts of training data with accurate gaze annotations. Facing such demanding requirements of gaze data collection and annotation, several image synthesis methods were proposed, which successfully redirected gaze directions precisely given the assigned conditions. However, these methods focused on changing gaze directions of the images that only include eyes or restricted ranges of faces with low resolution (less than $128\times128$) to largely reduce interference from other attributes such as hairs, which limits application scenarios. To cope with this limitation, we proposed a portable network, called ReDirTrans, achieving latent-to-latent translation for redirecting gaze directions and head orientations in an interpretable manner. ReDirTrans projects input latent vectors into aimed-attribute embeddings only and redirects these embeddings with assigned pitch and yaw values. Then both the initial and edited embeddings are projected back (deprojected) to the initial latent space as residuals to modify the input latent vectors by subtraction and addition, representing old status removal and new status addition. The projection of aimed attributes only and subtraction-addition operations for status replacement essentially mitigate impacts on other attributes and the distribution of latent vectors. Thus, by combining ReDirTrans with a pretrained fixed e4e-StyleGAN pair, we created ReDirTrans-GAN, which enables accurately redirecting gaze in full-face images with $1024\times1024$ resolution while preserving other attributes such as identity, expression, and hairstyle. Furthermore, we presented improvements for the downstream learning-based gaze estimation task, using redirected samples as dataset augmentation.

- **Summary**: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to retrieve frames from a geotagged database that are located at the same place as the query frame. To improve the robustness of VPR in perceptually aliasing scenarios, sequence-based VPR methods are proposed. These methods are either based on matching between frame sequences or extracting sequence descriptors for direct retrieval. However, the former is usually based on the assumption of constant velocity, which is difficult to hold in practice, and is computationally expensive and subject to sequence length. Although the latter overcomes these problems, existing sequence descriptors are constructed by aggregating features of multiple frames only, without interaction on temporal information, and thus cannot obtain descriptors with spatio-temporal discrimination. In this paper, we propose a sequence descriptor that effectively incorporates spatio-temporal information. Specifically, spatial attention within the same frame is utilized to learn spatial feature patterns, while attention in corresponding local regions of different frames is utilized to learn the persistence or change of features over time. We use a sliding window to control the temporal range of attention and use relative position encoding to construct sequential relationships between different features. This allows our descriptors to capture the intrinsic dynamics in a sequence of frames. Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.



### Overcoming Topology Agnosticism: Enhancing Skeleton-Based Action Recognition through Redefined Skeletal Topology Awareness

- **Summary**: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have long defined the state-of-the-art in skeleton-based action recognition, leveraging their ability to unravel the complex dynamics of human joint topology through the graph's adjacency matrix. However, an inherent flaw has come to light in these cutting-edge models: they tend to optimize the adjacency matrix jointly with the model weights. This process, while seemingly efficient, causes a gradual decay of bone connectivity data, culminating in a model indifferent to the very topology it sought to map. As a remedy, we propose a threefold strategy: (1) We forge an innovative pathway that encodes bone connectivity by harnessing the power of graph distances. This approach preserves the vital topological nuances often lost in conventional GCNs. (2) We highlight an oft-overlooked feature - the temporal mean of a skeletal sequence, which, despite its modest guise, carries highly action-specific information. (3) Our investigation revealed strong variations in joint-to-joint relationships across different actions. This finding exposes the limitations of a single adjacency matrix in capturing the variations of relational configurations emblematic of human movement, which we remedy by proposing an efficient refinement to Graph Convolutions (GC) - the BlockGC. This evolution slashes parameters by a substantial margin (above 40%), while elevating performance beyond original GCNs. Our full model, the BlockGCN, establishes new standards in skeleton-based action recognition for small model sizes. Its high accuracy, notably on the large-scale NTU RGB+D 120 dataset, stand as compelling proof of the efficacy of BlockGCN.

- **Summary**: Although many recent works have made advancements in the image restoration (IR) field, they often suffer from an excessive number of parameters. Another issue is that most Transformer-based IR methods focus only on either local or global features, leading to limited receptive fields or deficient parameter issues. To address these problems, we propose a lightweight IR network, Reciprocal Attention Mixing Transformer (RAMiT). It employs our proposed dimensional reciprocal attention mixing Transformer (D-RAMiT) blocks, which compute bi-dimensional (spatial and channel) self-attentions in parallel with different numbers of multi-heads. The bi-dimensional attentions help each other to complement their counterpart's drawbacks and are then mixed. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical reciprocal attention mixing (H-RAMi) layer that compensates for pixel-level information losses and utilizes semantic information while maintaining an efficient hierarchical structure. Furthermore, we revisit and modify MobileNet V1 and V2 to attach efficient convolutions to our proposed components. The experimental results demonstrate that RAMiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple lightweight IR tasks, including super-resolution, color denoising, grayscale denoising, low-light enhancement, and deraining.

- **Summary**: Referring image segmentation (RIS) is a fundamental vision-language task that intends to segment a desired object from an image based on a given natural language expression. Due to the essentially distinct data properties between image and text, most of existing methods either introduce complex designs towards fine-grained vision-language alignment or lack required dense alignment, resulting in scalability issues or mis-segmentation problems such as over- or under-segmentation. To achieve effective and efficient fine-grained feature alignment in the RIS task, we explore the potential of masked multimodal modeling coupled with self-distillation and propose a novel cross-modality masked self-distillation framework named CM-MaskSD, in which our method inherits the transferred knowledge of image-text semantic alignment from CLIP model to realize fine-grained patch-word feature alignment for better segmentation accuracy. Moreover, our CM-MaskSD framework can considerably boost model performance in a nearly parameter-free manner, since it shares weights between the main segmentation branch and the introduced masked self-distillation branches, and solely introduces negligible parameters for coordinating the multimodal features. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (i.e. RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, G-Ref) for the RIS task convincingly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) based on the generative pre-training transformer (GPT) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across a diverse range of downstream tasks. Inspired by the advancements of the GPT, we present PointGPT, a novel approach that extends the concept of GPT to point clouds, addressing the challenges associated with disorder properties, low information density, and task gaps. Specifically, a point cloud auto-regressive generation task is proposed to pre-train transformer models. Our method partitions the input point cloud into multiple point patches and arranges them in an ordered sequence based on their spatial proximity. Then, an extractor-generator based transformer decoder, with a dual masking strategy, learns latent representations conditioned on the preceding point patches, aiming to predict the next one in an auto-regressive manner. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, our approach achieves classification accuracies of 94.9% on the ModelNet40 dataset and 93.4% on the ScanObjectNN dataset, outperforming all other transformer models. Furthermore, our method also attains new state-of-the-art accuracies on all four few-shot learning benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Continual learning aims to enable a model to incrementally learn knowledge from sequentially arrived data. Previous works adopt the conventional classification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a classifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks or classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding to one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters of a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains all historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually required to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named AttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks. Specifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model CLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from both images and text. Text consists of a category name and a fixed number of learnable parameters which are selected from our designed attribute word bank and serve as attributes. As we compute the visual and textual similarity for classification, AttriCLIP is a non-incremental learner. The attribute prompts, which encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory. We evaluate our AttriCLIP and compare it with CLIP-based and previous state-of-the-art continual learning methods in realistic settings with domain-shift and long-sequence learning. The results show that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts. The implementation code can be available at https://github.com/bhrqw/AttriCLIP.

- **Summary**: Building on the recent remarkable development of large language models (LLMs), active attempts are being made to extend the utility of LLMs to multimodal tasks. There have been previous efforts to link language and visual information, and attempts to add visual capabilities to LLMs are ongoing as well. However, existing attempts use LLMs only as image decoders and no attempt has been made to generate images in the same line as the natural language. By adopting a VQ-GAN framework in which latent representations of images are treated as a kind of text tokens, we present a novel method to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to read and generate images like text without any structural changes, extra training objectives, or the need for training an ad-hoc network while still preserving the of the instruction-following capability of the LLM. We apply this framework to chest X-ray (CXR) image and report generation tasks as it is a domain in which translation of complex information between visual and language domains is important.

- **Summary**: Prompt tuning has achieved great success in transferring the knowledge from large pretrained vision-language models into downstream tasks, and has dominated the performance on visual grounding (VG). However, almost all existing prompt tuning paradigms suffer from poor interpretability. In this paper, we argue that their poor interpretability is attributed to the holistic prompt generation and inference process. By "holistic", we mean that they usually directly learn a set of vectors as the prompt (i.e., prompt generation), and use the learned global prompt to augment the textual input for the VG model (i.e., prompt inference). To this end, we propose a new prompt construction paradigm with explicit explainable ability, named TreePrompt. Specifically, we first deconstruct a complex sentence into a tree, that is consistent with human reasoning. Then, following the syntax tree, we compose a structured prompt in a bottom-up manner. Thanks to this step-by-step prompt construction process, each intermediate prompt (i.e., tree node) permits us to understand the reasoning process. Extensive ablations on various backbones and benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our TreePrompt.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based image segmentation and detection models have largely improved the efficiency of analyzing retinal landmarks such as optic disc (OD), optic cup (OC), and fovea. However, factors including ophthalmic disease-related lesions and low image quality issues may severely complicate automatic OD/OC segmentation and fovea detection. Most existing works treat the identification of each landmark as a single task, and take into account no prior information. To address these issues, we propose a prior guided multi-task transformer framework for joint OD/OC segmentation and fovea detection, named JOINEDTrans. JOINEDTrans effectively combines various spatial features of the fundus images, relieving the structural distortions induced by lesions and other imaging issues. It contains a segmentation branch and a detection branch. To be noted, we employ an encoder pretrained in a vessel segmentation task to effectively exploit the positional relationship among vessel, OD/OC, and fovea, successfully incorporating spatial prior into the proposed JOINEDTrans framework. There are a coarse stage and a fine stage in JOINEDTrans. In the coarse stage, OD/OC coarse segmentation and fovea heatmap localization are obtained through a joint segmentation and detection module. In the fine stage, we crop regions of interest for subsequent refinement and use predictions obtained in the coarse stage to provide additional information for better performance and faster convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that JOINEDTrans outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the publicly available GAMMA, REFUGE, and PALM fundus image datasets.

- **Summary**: As a promptable generic object segmentation model, segment anything model (SAM) has recently attracted significant attention, and also demonstrates its powerful performance. Nevertheless, it still meets its Waterloo when encountering several tasks, e.g., medical image segmentation, camouflaged object detection, etc. In this report, we try SAM on an unexplored popular task: shadow detection. Specifically, four benchmarks were chosen and evaluated with widely used metrics. The experimental results show that the performance for shadow detection using SAM is not satisfactory, especially when comparing with the elaborate models.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models, either with or without text condition, have demonstrated impressive capability in synthesizing photorealistic images given a few or even no words. These models may not fully satisfy user need, as normal users or artists intend to control the synthesized images with specific guidance, like overall layout, color, structure, object shape, and so on. To adapt diffusion models for controllable image synthesis, several methods have been proposed to incorporate the required conditions as regularization upon the intermediate features of the diffusion denoising network. These methods, known as early-constraint ones in this paper, have difficulties in handling multiple conditions with a single solution. They intend to train separate models for each specific condition, which require much training cost and result in non-generalizable solutions. To address these difficulties, we propose a new approach namely late-constraint: we leave the diffusion networks unchanged, but constrain its output to be aligned with the required conditions. Specifically, we train a lightweight condition adapter to establish the correlation between external conditions and internal representations of diffusion models. During the iterative denoising process, the conditional guidance is sent into corresponding condition adapter to manipulate the sampling process with the established correlation. We further equip the introduced late-constraint strategy with a timestep resampling method and an early stopping technique, which boost the quality of synthesized image meanwhile complying with the guidance. Our method outperforms the existing early-constraint methods and generalizes better to unseen condition. Our code would be available.

- **Summary**: Sensitivity to severe occlusion and large view angles limits the usage scenarios of the existing monocular 3D dense face alignment methods. The state-of-the-art 3DMM-based method, directly regresses the model's coefficients, underutilizing the low-level 2D spatial and semantic information, which can actually offer cues for face shape and orientation. In this work, we demonstrate how modeling 3D facial geometry in image and model space jointly can solve the occlusion and view angle problems. Instead of predicting the whole face directly, we regress image space features in the visible facial region by dense prediction first. Subsequently, we predict our model's coefficients based on the regressed feature of the visible regions, leveraging the prior knowledge of whole face geometry from the morphable models to complete the invisible regions. We further propose a fusion network that combines the advantages of both the image and model space predictions to achieve high robustness and accuracy in unconstrained scenarios. Thanks to the proposed fusion module, our method is robust not only to occlusion and large pitch and roll view angles, which is the benefit of our image space approach, but also to noise and large yaw angles, which is the benefit of our model space method. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods. On the 3D dense face alignment task, we achieve 3.80% NME on the AFLW2000-3D dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 5.5%. Code is available at https://github.com/lhyfst/DSFNet.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning have brought significant improvements to plant disease recognition. However, achieving satisfactory performance often requires high-quality training datasets, which are challenging and expensive to collect. Consequently, the practical application of current deep learning-based methods in real-world scenarios is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we argue that embracing poor datasets is viable and aim to explicitly define the challenges associated with using these datasets. To delve into this topic, we analyze the characteristics of high-quality datasets, namely large-scale images and desired annotation, and contrast them with the \emph{limited} and \emph{imperfect} nature of poor datasets. Challenges arise when the training datasets deviate from these characteristics. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we propose a novel and informative taxonomy that categorizes these challenges. Furthermore, we offer a brief overview of existing studies and approaches that address these challenges. We believe that our paper sheds light on the importance of embracing poor datasets, enhances the understanding of the associated challenges, and contributes to the ambitious objective of deploying deep learning in real-world applications. To facilitate the progress, we finally describe several outstanding questions and point out potential future directions. Although our primary focus is on plant disease recognition, we emphasize that the principles of embracing and analyzing poor datasets are applicable to a wider range of domains, including agriculture.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have made impressive progress in text-to-image synthesis. However, training such large-scale models (e.g. Stable Diffusion), from scratch requires high computational costs and massive high-quality text-image pairs, which becomes unaffordable in other languages. To handle this challenge, we propose IAP, a simple but effective method to transfer English Stable Diffusion into Chinese. IAP optimizes only a separate Chinese text encoder with all other parameters fixed to align Chinese semantics space to the English one in CLIP. To achieve this, we innovatively treat images as pivots and minimize the distance of attentive features produced from cross-attention between images and each language respectively. In this way, IAP establishes connections of Chinese, English and visual semantics in CLIP's embedding space efficiently, advancing the quality of the generated image with direct Chinese prompts. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several strong Chinese diffusion models with only 5%~10% training data.

- **Summary**: Every day, the human brain processes an immense volume of visual information, relying on intricate neural mechanisms to perceive and interpret these stimuli. Recent breakthroughs in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have enabled scientists to extract visual information from human brain activity patterns. In this study, we present an innovative method for decoding brain activity into meaningful images and captions, with a specific focus on brain captioning due to its enhanced flexibility as compared to brain decoding into images. Our approach takes advantage of cutting-edge image captioning models and incorporates a unique image reconstruction pipeline that utilizes latent diffusion models and depth estimation. We utilized the Natural Scenes Dataset, a comprehensive fMRI dataset from eight subjects who viewed images from the COCO dataset. We employed the Generative Image-to-text Transformer (GIT) as our backbone for captioning and propose a new image reconstruction pipeline based on latent diffusion models. The method involves training regularized linear regression models between brain activity and extracted features. Additionally, we incorporated depth maps from the ControlNet model to further guide the reconstruction process. We evaluate our methods using quantitative metrics for both generated captions and images. Our brain captioning approach outperforms existing methods, while our image reconstruction pipeline generates plausible images with improved spatial relationships. In conclusion, we demonstrate significant progress in brain decoding, showcasing the enormous potential of integrating vision and language to better understand human cognition. Our approach provides a flexible platform for future research, with potential applications in various fields, including neural art, style transfer, and portable devices.

- **Summary**: We present a lightweight system for stereo matching through embedded GPUs. It breaks the trade-off between accuracy and processing speed in stereo matching, enabling our embedded system to further improve the matching accuracy while ensuring real-time processing. The main idea of our method is to construct a tiny neural network based on variational auto-encoder (VAE) to upsample and refinement a small size of coarse disparity map, which is first generated by a traditional matching method. The proposed hybrid structure cannot only bring the advantage of traditional methods in terms of computational complexity, but also ensure the matching accuracy under the impact of neural network. Extensive experiments on the KITTI 2015 benchmark demonstrate that our tiny system exhibits high robustness in improving the accuracy of the coarse disparity maps generated by different algorithms, while also running in real-time on embedded GPUs.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have yielded impressive results in generating high-fidelity images based on consistent text prompts. However, there is a growing interest in exploring the potential of these models for more diverse reference-based image manipulation tasks that require spatial understanding and visual context. Previous approaches have achieved this by incorporating additional control modules or fine-tuning the generative models specifically for each task until convergence. In this paper, we propose a different perspective. We conjecture that current large-scale T2I generative models already possess the capability to perform these tasks but are not fully activated within the standard generation process. To unlock these capabilities, we introduce a unified Prompt-Guided In-Context inpainting (PGIC) framework, which leverages large-scale T2I models to re-formulate and solve reference-guided image manipulations. In the PGIC framework, the reference and masked target are stitched together as a new input for the generative models, enabling the filling of masked regions as producing final results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the self-attention modules in T2I models are well-suited for establishing spatial correlations and efficiently addressing challenging reference-guided manipulations. These large T2I models can be effectively driven by task-specific prompts with minimal training cost or even with frozen backbones. We synthetically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PGIC framework across various tasks, including reference-guided image inpainting, faithful inpainting, outpainting, local super-resolution, and novel view synthesis. Our results show that PGIC achieves significantly better performance while requiring less computation compared to other fine-tuning based approaches.

The encouraging outcome of the proposed approach is based on the similarity between the neural mechanisms in the auditory and visual pathways. Furthermore, we customise one of the metrics which has a psychoacoustically plausible architecture to account for the peculiarities of sound signals. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed metric and several baseline metrics using a music dataset, with promising results in terms of the correlation between the metrics and the perceived quality of audio as rated by human evaluators.

- **Summary**: Text-driven 3D scene generation is widely applicable to video gaming, film industry, and metaverse applications that have a large demand for 3D scenes. However, existing text-to-3D generation methods are limited to producing 3D objects with simple geometries and dreamlike styles that lack realism. In this work, we present Text2NeRF, which is able to generate a wide range of 3D scenes with complicated geometric structures and high-fidelity textures purely from a text prompt. To this end, we adopt NeRF as the 3D representation and leverage a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to constrain the 3D reconstruction of the NeRF to reflect the scene description. Specifically, we employ the diffusion model to infer the text-related image as the content prior and use a monocular depth estimation method to offer the geometric prior. Both content and geometric priors are utilized to update the NeRF model. To guarantee textured and geometric consistency between different views, we introduce a progressive scene inpainting and updating strategy for novel view synthesis of the scene. Our method requires no additional training data but only a natural language description of the scene as the input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Text2NeRF outperforms existing methods in producing photo-realistic, multi-view consistent, and diverse 3D scenes from a variety of natural language prompts.

- **Summary**: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have shown remarkable capability in representing geometry with details. However, without signed distance supervision, it is still a challenge to infer SDFs from point clouds or multi-view images using neural networks. In this paper, we claim that gradient consistency in the field, indicated by the parallelism of level sets, is the key factor affecting the inference accuracy. Hence, we propose a level set alignment loss to evaluate the parallelism of level sets, which can be minimized to achieve better gradient consistency. Our novelty lies in that we can align all level sets to the zero level set by constraining gradients at queries and their projections on the zero level set in an adaptive way. Our insight is to propagate the zero level set to everywhere in the field through consistent gradients to eliminate uncertainty in the field that is caused by the discreteness of 3D point clouds or the lack of observations from multi-view images. Our proposed loss is a general term which can be used upon different methods to infer SDFs from 3D point clouds and multi-view images. Our numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate that our loss can significantly improve the accuracy of SDFs inferred from point clouds or multi-view images under various benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Deep ensembles achieved state-of-the-art results in classification and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection; however, their effectiveness remains limited due to the homogeneity of learned patterns within the ensemble. To overcome this challenge, our study introduces a novel approach that promotes diversity among ensemble members by leveraging saliency maps. By incorporating saliency map diversification, our method outperforms conventional ensemble techniques in multiple classification and OOD detection tasks, while also improving calibration. Experiments on well-established OpenOOD benchmarks highlight the potential of our method in practical applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel approach for generating naturalistic adversarial patches without using GANs. Our proposed approach generates a Dynamic Adversarial Patch (DAP) that looks naturalistic while maintaining high attack efficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we redefine the optimization problem by introducing a new objective function, where a similarity metric is used to construct a similarity loss. This guides the patch to follow predefined patterns while maximizing the victim model's loss function. Our technique is based on directly modifying the pixel values in the patch which gives higher flexibility and larger space to incorporate multiple transformations compared to the GAN-based techniques. Furthermore, most clothing-based physical attacks assume static objects and ignore the possible transformations caused by non-rigid deformation due to changes in a person's pose. To address this limitation, we incorporate a ``Creases Transformation'' (CT) block, i.e., a preprocessing block following an Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) block used to generate a large variation of transformed patches incorporated in the training process to increase its robustness to different possible real-world distortions (e.g., creases in the clothing, rotation, re-scaling, random noise, brightness and contrast variations, etc.). We demonstrate that the presence of different real-world variations in clothing and object poses (i.e., above-mentioned distortions) lead to a drop in the performance of state-of-the-art attacks. For instance, these techniques can merely achieve 20\% in the physical world and 30.8\% in the digital world while our attack provides superior success rate of up to 65\% and 84.56\%, respectively when attacking the YOLOv3tiny detector deployed in smart cameras at the edge.

- **Summary**: Realistic and diverse 3D shape generation is helpful for a wide variety of applications such as virtual reality, gaming, and animation. Modern generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, learn from large-scale datasets and generate new samples following similar data distributions. However, when training data is limited, deep neural generative networks overfit and tend to replicate training samples. Prior works focus on few-shot image generation to produce high-quality and diverse results using a few target images. Unfortunately, abundant 3D shape data is typically hard to obtain as well. In this work, we make the first attempt to realize few-shot 3D shape generation by adapting generative models pre-trained on large source domains to target domains using limited data. To relieve overfitting and keep considerable diversity, we propose to maintain the probability distributions of the pairwise relative distances between adapted samples at feature-level and shape-level during domain adaptation. Our approach only needs the silhouettes of few-shot target samples as training data to learn target geometry distributions and achieve generated shapes with diverse topology and textures. Moreover, we introduce several metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of few-shot 3D shape generation. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively under a series of few-shot 3D shape adaptation setups.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing human vision from brain activities has been an appealing task that helps to understand our cognitive process. Even though recent research has seen great success in reconstructing static images from non-invasive brain recordings, work on recovering continuous visual experiences in the form of videos is limited. In this work, we propose Mind-Video that learns spatiotemporal information from continuous fMRI data of the cerebral cortex progressively through masked brain modeling, multimodal contrastive learning with spatiotemporal attention, and co-training with an augmented Stable Diffusion model that incorporates network temporal inflation. We show that high-quality videos of arbitrary frame rates can be reconstructed with Mind-Video using adversarial guidance. The recovered videos were evaluated with various semantic and pixel-level metrics. We achieved an average accuracy of 85% in semantic classification tasks and 0.19 in structural similarity index (SSIM), outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 45%. We also show that our model is biologically plausible and interpretable, reflecting established physiological processes.



### Learning Global-aware Kernel for Image Harmonization

- **Summary**: Image harmonization aims to solve the visual inconsistency problem in composited images by adaptively adjusting the foreground pixels with the background as references. Existing methods employ local color transformation or region matching between foreground and background, which neglects powerful proximity prior and independently distinguishes fore-/back-ground as a whole part for harmonization. As a result, they still show a limited performance across varied foreground objects and scenes. To address this issue, we propose a novel Global-aware Kernel Network (GKNet) to harmonize local regions with comprehensive consideration of long-distance background references. Specifically, GKNet includes two parts, \ie, harmony kernel prediction and harmony kernel modulation branches. The former includes a Long-distance Reference Extractor (LRE) to obtain long-distance context and Kernel Prediction Blocks (KPB) to predict multi-level harmony kernels by fusing global information with local features. To achieve this goal, a novel Selective Correlation Fusion (SCF) module is proposed to better select relevant long-distance background references for local harmonization. The latter employs the predicted kernels to harmonize foreground regions with both local and global awareness. Abundant experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method for image harmonization over state-of-the-art methods, \eg, achieving 39.53dB PSNR that surpasses the best counterpart by +0.78dB $\uparrow$; decreasing fMSE/MSE by 11.5\%$\downarrow$/6.7\%$\downarrow$ compared with the SoTA method.

- **Summary**: Robotic-assisted tracheal intubation requires the robot to distinguish anatomical features like an experienced physician using deep-learning techniques. However, real datasets of oropharyngeal organs are limited due to patient privacy issues, making it challenging to train deep-learning models for accurate image segmentation. We hereby consider generating a new data modality through a virtual environment to assist the training process. Specifically, this work introduces a virtual dataset generated by the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) framework to overcome the limited availability of actual endoscopic images. We also propose a domain adaptive Sim-to-Real method for oropharyngeal organ image segmentation, which employs an image blending strategy called IoU-Ranking Blend (IRB) and style-transfer techniques to address discrepancies between datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach with domain adaptive models, improving segmentation accuracy and training stability. In the practical application, the trained segmentation model holds great promise for robot-assisted intubation surgery and intelligent surgical navigation.

- **Summary**: Despite the availability of computer-aided simulators and recorded videos of surgical procedures, junior residents still heavily rely on experts to answer their queries. However, expert surgeons are often overloaded with clinical and academic workloads and limit their time in answering. For this purpose, we develop a surgical question-answering system to facilitate robot-assisted surgical scene and activity understanding from recorded videos. Most of the existing VQA methods require an object detector and regions based feature extractor to extract visual features and fuse them with the embedded text of the question for answer generation. However, (1) surgical object detection model is scarce due to smaller datasets and lack of bounding box annotation; (2) current fusion strategy of heterogeneous modalities like text and image is naive; (3) the localized answering is missing, which is crucial in complex surgical scenarios. In this paper, we propose Visual Question Localized-Answering in Robotic Surgery (Surgical-VQLA) to localize the specific surgical area during the answer prediction. To deal with the fusion of the heterogeneous modalities, we design gated vision-language embedding (GVLE) to build input patches for the Language Vision Transformer (LViT) to predict the answer. To get localization, we add the detection head in parallel with the prediction head of the LViT. We also integrate GIoU loss to boost localization performance by preserving the accuracy of the question-answering model. We annotate two datasets of VQLA by utilizing publicly available surgical videos from MICCAI challenges EndoVis-17 and 18. Our validation results suggest that Surgical-VQLA can better understand the surgical scene and localize the specific area related to the question-answering. GVLE presents an efficient language-vision embedding technique by showing superior performance over the existing benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The recent emergence of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) as a fundamental paradigm for learning image representations has, and continues to, demonstrate high empirical success in a variety of tasks. However, most SSL approaches fail to learn embeddings that capture hierarchical semantic concepts that are separable and interpretable. In this work, we aim to learn highly separable semantic hierarchical representations by stacking Joint Embedding Architectures (JEA) where higher-level JEAs are input with representations of lower-level JEA. This results in a representation space that exhibits distinct sub-categories of semantic concepts (e.g., model and colour of vehicles) in higher-level JEAs. We empirically show that representations from stacked JEA perform on a similar level as traditional JEA with comparative parameter counts and visualise the representation spaces to validate the semantic hierarchies.

- **Summary**: Creating Computer Vision (CV) models remains a complex and taxing practice for end-users to build, inspect, and improve these models. Interactive ML perspectives have helped address some of these issues by considering a teacher-in-the-loop where planning, teaching, and evaluating tasks take place. To improve the experience of end-users with various levels of ML expertise, we designed and evaluated two interactive visualizations in the context of Sprite, a system for creating CV classification and detection models for images originating from videos. We study how these visualizations, as part of the machine teaching loop, help users identify (evaluate) and select (plan) images where a model is struggling and improve the model being trained. We found that users who had used the visualizations found more images across a wider set of potential types of model errors, as well as in assessing and contrasting the prediction behavior of one or more models, thus reducing the potential effort required to improve a model.

- **Summary**: To safely deploy deep learning models in the clinic, a quality assurance framework is needed for routine or continuous monitoring of input-domain shift and the models' performance without ground truth contours. In this work, cardiac substructure segmentation was used as an example task to establish a QA framework. A benchmark dataset consisting of Computed Tomography (CT) images along with manual cardiac delineations of 241 patients were collected, including one 'common' image domain and five 'uncommon' domains. Segmentation models were tested on the benchmark dataset for an initial evaluation of model capacity and limitations. An image domain shift detector was developed by utilizing a trained Denoising autoencoder (DAE) and two hand-engineered features. Another Variational Autoencoder (VAE) was also trained to estimate the shape quality of the auto-segmentation results. Using the extracted features from the image/segmentation pair as inputs, a regression model was trained to predict the per-patient segmentation accuracy, measured by Dice coefficient similarity (DSC). The framework was tested across 19 segmentation models to evaluate the generalizability of the entire framework.   As results, the predicted DSC of regression models achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.036 to 0.046 with an averaged MAE of 0.041. When tested on the benchmark dataset, the performances of all segmentation models were not significantly affected by scanning parameters: FOV, slice thickness and reconstructions kernels. For input images with Poisson noise, CNN-based segmentation models demonstrated a decreased DSC ranging from 0.07 to 0.41, while the transformer-based model was not significantly affected.

- **Summary**: Estimating the rigid transformation between two LiDAR scans through putative 3D correspondences is a typical point cloud registration paradigm. Current 3D feature matching approaches commonly lead to numerous outlier correspondences, making outlier-robust registration techniques indispensable. Many recent studies have adopted the branch and bound (BnB) optimization framework to solve the correspondence-based point cloud registration problem globally and deterministically. Nonetheless, BnB-based methods are time-consuming to search the entire 6-dimensional parameter space, since their computational complexity is exponential to the dimension of the solution domain. In order to enhance algorithm efficiency, existing works attempt to decouple the 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) original problem into two 3-DOF sub-problems, thereby reducing the dimension of the parameter space. In contrast, our proposed approach introduces a novel pose decoupling strategy based on residual projections, effectively decomposing the raw problem into three 2-DOF rotation search sub-problems. Subsequently, we employ a novel BnB-based search method to solve these sub-problems, achieving efficient and deterministic registration. Furthermore, our method can be adapted to address the challenging problem of simultaneous pose and correspondence registration (SPCR). Through extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, while simultaneously ensuring robustness.

- **Summary**: Existing vector quantization (VQ) based autoregressive models follow a two-stage generation paradigm that first learns a codebook to encode images as discrete codes, and then completes generation based on the learned codebook. However, they encode fixed-size image regions into fixed-length codes and ignore their naturally different information densities, which results in insufficiency in important regions and redundancy in unimportant ones, and finally degrades the generation quality and speed. Moreover, the fixed-length coding leads to an unnatural raster-scan autoregressive generation. To address the problem, we propose a novel two-stage framework: (1) Dynamic-Quantization VAE (DQ-VAE) which encodes image regions into variable-length codes based on their information densities for an accurate and compact code representation. (2) DQ-Transformer which thereby generates images autoregressively from coarse-grained (smooth regions with fewer codes) to fine-grained (details regions with more codes) by modeling the position and content of codes in each granularity alternately, through a novel stacked-transformer architecture and shared-content, non-shared position input layers designs. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks validate our superiorities in both effectiveness and efficiency. Code will be released at https://github.com/CrossmodalGroup/DynamicVectorQuantization.

- **Summary**: Existing research on multimodal relation extraction (MRE) faces two co-existing challenges, internal-information over-utilization and external-information under-exploitation. To combat that, we propose a novel framework that simultaneously implements the idea of internal-information screening and external-information exploiting. First, we represent the fine-grained semantic structures of the input image and text with the visual and textual scene graphs, which are further fused into a unified cross-modal graph (CMG). Based on CMG, we perform structure refinement with the guidance of the graph information bottleneck principle, actively denoising the less-informative features. Next, we perform topic modeling over the input image and text, incorporating latent multimodal topic features to enrich the contexts. On the benchmark MRE dataset, our system outperforms the current best model significantly. With further in-depth analyses, we reveal the great potential of our method for the MRE task. Our codes are open at https://github.com/ChocoWu/MRE-ISE.

- **Summary**: Digital pathology has revolutionized cancer diagnosis by leveraging Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) for analyzing histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs). CBMIR enables searching for similar content, enhancing diagnostic reliability and accuracy. In 2020, breast and prostate cancer constituted 11.7% and 14.1% of cases, respectively, as reported by the Global Cancer Observatory (GCO). The proposed Unsupervised CBMIR (UCBMIR) replicates the traditional cancer diagnosis workflow, offering a dependable method to support pathologists in WSI-based diagnostic conclusions. This approach alleviates pathologists' workload, potentially enhancing diagnostic efficiency. To address the challenge of the lack of labeled histopathological images in CBMIR, a customized unsupervised Convolutional Auto Encoder (CAE) was developed, extracting 200 features per image for the search engine component. UCBMIR was evaluated using widely-used numerical techniques in CBMIR, alongside visual evaluation and comparison with a classifier. The validation involved three distinct datasets, with an external evaluation demonstrating its effectiveness. UCBMIR outperformed previous studies, achieving a top 5 recall of 99% and 80% on BreaKHis and SICAPv2, respectively, using the first evaluation technique. Precision rates of 91% and 70% were achieved for BreaKHis and SICAPv2, respectively, using the second evaluation technique. Furthermore, UCBMIR demonstrated the capability to identify various patterns in patches, achieving an 81% accuracy in the top 5 when tested on an external image from Arvaniti.

- **Summary**: We introduce ViDaS, a two-stream, fully convolutional Video, Depth-Aware Saliency network to address the problem of attention modeling ``in-the-wild", via saliency prediction in videos. Contrary to existing visual saliency approaches using only RGB frames as input, our network employs also depth as an additional modality. The network consists of two visual streams, one for the RGB frames, and one for the depth frames. Both streams follow an encoder-decoder approach and are fused to obtain a final saliency map. The network is trained end-to-end and is evaluated in a variety of different databases with eye-tracking data, containing a wide range of video content. Although the publicly available datasets do not contain depth, we estimate it using three different state-of-the-art methods, to enable comparisons and a deeper insight. Our method outperforms in most cases state-of-the-art models and our RGB-only variant, which indicates that depth can be beneficial to accurately estimating saliency in videos displayed on a 2D screen. Depth has been widely used to assist salient object detection problems, where it has been proven to be very beneficial. Our problem though differs significantly from salient object detection, since it is not restricted to specific salient objects, but predicts human attention in a more general aspect. These two problems not only have different objectives, but also different ground truth data and evaluation metrics. To our best knowledge, this is the first competitive deep learning video saliency estimation approach that combines both RGB and Depth features to address the general problem of saliency estimation ``in-the-wild". The code will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Long-tailed data is still a big challenge for deep neural networks, even though they have achieved great success on balanced data. We observe that vanilla training on long-tailed data with cross-entropy loss makes the instance-rich head classes severely squeeze the spatial distribution of the tail classes, which leads to difficulty in classifying tail class samples. Furthermore, the original cross-entropy loss can only propagate gradient short-lively because the gradient in softmax form rapidly approaches zero as the logit difference increases. This phenomenon is called softmax saturation. It is unfavorable for training on balanced data, but can be utilized to adjust the validity of the samples in long-tailed data, thereby solving the distorted embedding space of long-tailed problems. To this end, this paper proposes the Gaussian clouded logit adjustment by Gaussian perturbation of different class logits with varied amplitude. We define the amplitude of perturbation as cloud size and set relatively large cloud sizes to tail classes. The large cloud size can reduce the softmax saturation and thereby making tail class samples more active as well as enlarging the embedding space. To alleviate the bias in a classifier, we therefore propose the class-based effective number sampling strategy with classifier re-training. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of the proposed method. Source code is available at https://github.com/Keke921/GCLLoss.

- **Summary**: Planktonic organisms are key components of aquatic ecosystems and respond quickly to changes in the environment, therefore their monitoring is vital to understand the changes in the environment. Yet, monitoring plankton at appropriate scales still remains a challenge, limiting our understanding of functioning of aquatic systems and their response to changes. Modern plankton imaging instruments can be utilized to sample at high frequencies, enabling novel possibilities to study plankton populations. However, manual analysis of the data is costly, time consuming and expert based, making such approach unsuitable for large-scale application and urging for automatic solutions. The key problem related to the utilization of plankton datasets through image analysis is plankton recognition. Despite the large amount of research done, automatic methods have not been widely adopted for operational use. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on existing solutions for automatic plankton recognition is presented. First, we identify the most notable challenges that that make the development of plankton recognition systems difficult. Then, we provide a detailed description of solutions for these challenges proposed in plankton recognition literature. Finally, we propose a workflow to identify the specific challenges in new datasets and the recommended approaches to address them. For many of the challenges, applicable solutions exist. However, important challenges remain unsolved: 1) the domain shift between the datasets hindering the development of a general plankton recognition system that would work across different imaging instruments, 2) the difficulty to identify and process the images of previously unseen classes, and 3) the uncertainty in expert annotations that affects the training of the machine learning models for recognition. These challenges should be addressed in the future research.

- **Summary**: Visual spatial description (VSD) aims to generate texts that describe the spatial relations of the given objects within images. Existing VSD work merely models the 2D geometrical vision features, thus inevitably falling prey to the problem of skewed spatial understanding of target objects. In this work, we investigate the incorporation of 3D scene features for VSD. With an external 3D scene extractor, we obtain the 3D objects and scene features for input images, based on which we construct a target object-centered 3D spatial scene graph (Go3D-S2G), such that we model the spatial semantics of target objects within the holistic 3D scenes. Besides, we propose a scene subgraph selecting mechanism, sampling topologically-diverse subgraphs from Go3D-S2G, where the diverse local structure features are navigated to yield spatially-diversified text generation. Experimental results on two VSD datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baselines significantly, especially improving on the cases with complex visual spatial relations. Meanwhile, our method can produce more spatially-diversified generation. Code is available at https://github.com/zhaoyucs/VSD.

- **Summary**: Large pre-trained multimodal models have demonstrated significant success in a range of downstream tasks, including image captioning, image-text retrieval, visual question answering (VQA), etc. However, many of these methods rely on image-text pairs collected from the web as pre-training data and unfortunately overlook the need for fine-grained feature alignment between vision and language modalities, which requires detailed understanding of images and language expressions. While integrating VQA and dense captioning (DC) into pre-training can address this issue, acquiring image-question-answer as well as image-location-caption triplets is challenging and time-consuming. Additionally, publicly available datasets for VQA and dense captioning are typically limited in scale due to manual data collection and labeling efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Joint QA and DC GEneration (JADE), which utilizes a pre-trained multimodal model and easily-crawled image-text pairs to automatically generate and filter large-scale VQA and dense captioning datasets. We apply this method to the Conceptual Caption (CC3M) dataset to generate a new dataset called CC3M-QA-DC. Experiments show that when used for pre-training in a multi-task manner, CC3M-QA-DC can improve the performance with various backbones on various downstream tasks. Furthermore, our generated CC3M-QA-DC can be combined with larger image-text datasets (e.g., CC15M) and achieve competitive results compared with models using much more data.

- **Summary**: Humans and animals have a rich and flexible understanding of the physical world, which enables them to infer the underlying dynamical trajectories of objects and events, plausible future states, and use that to plan and anticipate the consequences of actions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these computations are unclear. We combine a goal-driven modeling approach with dense neurophysiological data and high-throughput human behavioral readouts to directly impinge on this question. Specifically, we construct and evaluate several classes of sensory-cognitive networks to predict the future state of rich, ethologically-relevant environments, ranging from self-supervised end-to-end models with pixel-wise or object-centric objectives, to models that future predict in the latent space of purely static image-based or dynamic video-based pretrained foundation models. We find strong differentiation across these model classes in their ability to predict neural and behavioral data both within and across diverse environments. In particular, we find that neural responses are currently best predicted by models trained to predict the future state of their environment in the latent space of pretrained foundation models optimized for dynamic scenes in a self-supervised manner. Notably, models that future predict in the latent space of video foundation models that are optimized to support a diverse range of sensorimotor tasks, reasonably match both human behavioral error patterns and neural dynamics across all environmental scenarios that we were able to test. Overall, these findings suggest that the neural mechanisms and behaviors of primate mental simulation are thus far most consistent with being optimized to future predict on dynamic, reusable visual representations that are useful for embodied AI more generally.

- **Summary**: The highly realistic image quality achieved by current image generative models has many academic and industrial applications. To limit the use of such models to benign applications, though, it is necessary that tools to conclusively detect whether an image has been generated synthetically or not are developed. For this reason, several detectors have been developed providing excellent performance in computer vision applications, however, they can not be applied as they are to multispectral satellite images, and hence new models must be trained. In general, two-class classifiers can achieve very good detection accuracies, however they are not able to generalise to image domains and generative models architectures different than those used during training. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a one-class classifier based on Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder 2 (VQ-VAE 2) features to overcome the limitations of two-class classifiers. First, we emphasize the generalization problem that binary classifiers suffer from by training and testing an EfficientNet-B4 architecture on multiple multispectral datasets. Then we show that, since the VQ-VAE 2 based classifier is trained only on pristine images, it is able to detect images belonging to different domains and generated by architectures that have not been used during training. Last, we compare the two classifiers head-to-head on the same generated datasets, highlighting the superiori generalization capabilities of the VQ-VAE 2-based detector.

- **Summary**: The vanilla image completion approaches are sensitive to the large missing regions due to limited available reference information for plausible generation. To mitigate this, existing methods incorporate the extra cue as a guidance for image completion. Despite improvements, these approaches are often restricted to employing a single modality (e.g., segmentation or sketch maps), which lacks scalability in leveraging multi-modality for more plausible completion. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple yet effective method for Multi-modal Guided Image Completion, dubbed MaGIC, which not only supports a wide range of single modality as the guidance (e.g., text, canny edge, sketch, segmentation, reference image, depth, and pose), but also adapts to arbitrarily customized combination of these modalities (i.e., arbitrary multi-modality) for image completion. For building MaGIC, we first introduce a modality-specific conditional U-Net (MCU-Net) that injects single-modal signal into a U-Net denoiser for single-modal guided image completion. Then, we devise a consistent modality blending (CMB) method to leverage modality signals encoded in multiple learned MCU-Nets through gradient guidance in latent space. Our CMB is training-free, and hence avoids the cumbersome joint re-training of different modalities, which is the secret of MaGIC to achieve exceptional flexibility in accommodating new modalities for completion. Experiments show the superiority of MaGIC over state-of-arts and its generalization to various completion tasks including in/out-painting and local editing.

- **Summary**: Reaction diagram parsing is the task of extracting reaction schemes from a diagram in the chemistry literature. The reaction diagrams can be arbitrarily complex, thus robustly parsing them into structured data is an open challenge. In this paper, we present RxnScribe, a machine learning model for parsing reaction diagrams of varying styles. We formulate this structured prediction task with a sequence generation approach, which condenses the traditional pipeline into an end-to-end model. We train RxnScribe on a dataset of 1,378 diagrams and evaluate it with cross validation, achieving an 80.0% soft match F1 score, with significant improvements over previous models. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thomas0809/RxnScribe.

- **Summary**: We present Composable Diffusion (CoDi), a novel generative model capable of generating any combination of output modalities, such as language, image, video, or audio, from any combination of input modalities. Unlike existing generative AI systems, CoDi can generate multiple modalities in parallel and its input is not limited to a subset of modalities like text or image. Despite the absence of training datasets for many combinations of modalities, we propose to align modalities in both the input and output space. This allows CoDi to freely condition on any input combination and generate any group of modalities, even if they are not present in the training data. CoDi employs a novel composable generation strategy which involves building a shared multimodal space by bridging alignment in the diffusion process, enabling the synchronized generation of intertwined modalities, such as temporally aligned video and audio. Highly customizable and flexible, CoDi achieves strong joint-modality generation quality, and outperforms or is on par with the unimodal state-of-the-art for single-modality synthesis.

- **Summary**: The development of algorithms that learn behavioral driving models using human demonstrations has led to increasingly realistic simulations. In general, such models learn to jointly predict trajectories for all controlled agents by exploiting road context information such as drivable lanes obtained from manually annotated high-definition (HD) maps. Recent studies show that these models can greatly benefit from increasing the amount of human data available for training. However, the manual annotation of HD maps which is necessary for every new location puts a bottleneck on efficiently scaling up human traffic datasets. We propose a drone birdview image-based map (DBM) representation that requires minimal annotation and provides rich road context information. We evaluate multi-agent trajectory prediction using the DBM by incorporating it into a differentiable driving simulator as an image-texture-based differentiable rendering module. Our results demonstrate competitive multi-agent trajectory prediction performance when using our DBM representation as compared to models trained with rasterized HD maps.

- **Summary**: We propose a 3D generation pipeline that uses diffusion models to generate realistic human digital avatars. Due to the wide variety of human identities, poses, and stochastic details, the generation of 3D human meshes has been a challenging problem. To address this, we decompose the problem into 2D normal map generation and normal map-based 3D reconstruction. Specifically, we first simultaneously generate realistic normal maps for the front and backside of a clothed human, dubbed dual normal maps, using a pose-conditional diffusion model. For 3D reconstruction, we ``carve'' the prior SMPL-X mesh to a detailed 3D mesh according to the normal maps through mesh optimization. To further enhance the high-frequency details, we present a diffusion resampling scheme on both body and facial regions, thus encouraging the generation of realistic digital avatars. We also seamlessly incorporate a recent text-to-image diffusion model to support text-based human identity control. Our method, namely, Chupa, is capable of generating realistic 3D clothed humans with better perceptual quality and identity variety.

- **Summary**: Statistical shape modeling (SSM) is an essential tool for analyzing variations in anatomical morphology. In a typical SSM pipeline, 3D anatomical images, gone through segmentation and rigid registration, are represented using lower-dimensional shape features, on which statistical analysis can be performed. Various methods for constructing compact shape representations have been proposed, but they involve laborious and costly steps. We propose Image2SSM, a novel deep-learning-based approach for SSM that leverages image-segmentation pairs to learn a radial-basis-function (RBF)-based representation of shapes directly from images. This RBF-based shape representation offers a rich self-supervised signal for the network to estimate a continuous, yet compact representation of the underlying surface that can adapt to complex geometries in a data-driven manner. Image2SSM can characterize populations of biological structures of interest by constructing statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes while requiring minimal parameter tuning and no user assistance. Once trained, Image2SSM can be used to infer low-dimensional shape representations from new unsegmented images, paving the way toward scalable approaches for SSM, especially when dealing with large cohorts. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show the efficacy of the proposed method compared to the state-of-art correspondence-based method for SSM.

- **Summary**: The advancement of computer-aided detection systems had a significant impact on clinical analysis and decision-making on human disease. Lung cancer requires more attention among the numerous diseases being examined because it affects both men and women, increasing the mortality rate. LeNet, a deep learning model, is used in this study to detect lung tumors. The studies were run on a publicly available dataset made up of CT image data (IQ-OTH/NCCD). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed in the experiment for feature extraction and classification. The proposed system was evaluated on Iraq-Oncology Teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases datasets the success percentage was calculated as 99.51%, sensitivity (93%) and specificity (95%), and better results were obtained compared to the existing methods. Development and validation of algorithms such as ours are important initial steps in the development of software suites that could be adopted in routine pathological practices and potentially help reduce the burden on pathologists.

- **Summary**: Tissue examination and quantification in a 3D context on serial section whole slide images (WSIs) were laborintensive and time-consuming tasks. Our previous study proposed a novel registration-based method (Map3D) to automatically align WSIs to the same physical space, reducing the human efforts of screening serial sections from WSIs. However, the registration performance of our Map3D method was only evaluated on single-stain WSIs with large-scale kidney tissue samples. In this paper, we provide a Docker for an end-to-end 3D slide-wise registration pipeline on needle biopsy serial sections in a multi-stain paradigm. The contribution of this study is three-fold: (1) We release a containerized Docker for an end-to-end multi-stain WSI registration. (2) We prove that the Map3D pipeline is capable of sectional registration from multi-stain WSI. (3) We verify that the Map3D pipeline can also be applied to needle biopsy tissue samples.

- **Summary**: In precision agriculture, detecting productive crop fields is an essential practice that allows the farmer to evaluate operating performance separately and compare different seed varieties, pesticides, and fertilizers. However, manually identifying productive fields is often a time-consuming and error-prone task. Previous studies explore different methods to detect crop fields using advanced machine learning algorithms, but they often lack good quality labeled data. In this context, we propose a high-quality dataset generated by machine operation combined with Sentinel-2 images tracked over time. As far as we know, it is the first one to overcome the lack of labeled samples by using this technique. In sequence, we apply a semi-supervised classification of unlabeled data and state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised deep learning methods to detect productive crop fields automatically. Finally, the results demonstrate high accuracy in Positive Unlabeled learning, which perfectly fits the problem where we have high confidence in the positive samples. Best performances have been found in Triplet Loss Siamese given the existence of an accurate dataset and Contrastive Learning considering situations where we do not have a comprehensive labeled dataset available.

- **Summary**: Accurate in-season crop type classification is crucial for the crop production estimation and monitoring of agricultural parcels. However, the complexity of the plant growth patterns and their spatio-temporal variability present significant challenges. While current deep learning-based methods show promise in crop type classification from single- and multi-modal time series, most existing methods rely on a single modality, such as satellite optical remote sensing data or crop rotation patterns. We propose a novel approach to fuse multimodal information into a model for improved accuracy and robustness across multiple years and countries. The approach relies on three modalities used: remote sensing time series from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 observations, parcel crop rotation and local crop distribution. To evaluate our approach, we release a new annotated dataset of 7.4 million agricultural parcels in France and Netherlands. We associate each parcel with time-series of surface reflectance (Red and NIR) and biophysical variables (LAI, FAPAR). Additionally, we propose a new approach to automatically aggregate crop types into a hierarchical class structure for meaningful model evaluation and a novel data-augmentation technique for early-season classification. Performance of the multimodal approach was assessed at different aggregation level in the semantic domain spanning from 151 to 8 crop types or groups. It resulted in accuracy ranging from 91\% to 95\% for NL dataset and from 85\% to 89\% for FR dataset. Pre-training on a dataset improves domain adaptation between countries, allowing for cross-domain zero-shot learning, and robustness of the performances in a few-shot setting from France to Netherlands. Our proposed approach outperforms comparable methods by enabling learning methods to use the often overlooked spatio-temporal context of parcels, resulting in increased preci...

- **Summary**: We propose two procedures to create painting styles using models trained only on natural images, providing objective proof that the model is not plagiarizing human art styles. In the first procedure we use the inductive bias from the artistic medium to achieve creative expression. Abstraction is achieved by using a reconstruction loss. The second procedure uses an additional natural image as inspiration to create a new style. These two procedures make it possible to invent new painting styles with no artistic training data. We believe that our approach can help pave the way for the ethical employment of generative AI in art, without infringing upon the originality of human creators.

- **Summary**: Simulation with realistic, interactive agents represents a key task for autonomous vehicle software development. In this work, we introduce the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC). WOSAC is the first public challenge to tackle this task and propose corresponding metrics. The goal of the challenge is to stimulate the design of realistic simulators that can be used to evaluate and train a behavior model for autonomous driving. We outline our evaluation methodology, present results for a number of different baseline simulation agent methods, and analyze several submissions to the 2023 competition which ran from March 16, 2023 to May 23, 2023. The WOSAC evaluation server remains open for submissions and we discuss open problems for the task.

- **Summary**: Image alignment and image restoration are classical computer vision tasks. However, there is still a lack of datasets that provide enough data to train and evaluate end-to-end deep learning models. Obtaining ground-truth data for image alignment requires sophisticated structure-from-motion methods or optical flow systems that often do not provide enough data variance, i.e., typically providing a high number of image correspondences, while only introducing few changes of scenery within the underlying image sequences. Alternative approaches utilize random perspective distortions on existing image data. However, this only provides trivial distortions, lacking the complexity and variance of real-world scenarios. Instead, our proposed data augmentation helps to overcome the issue of data scarcity by using 3D rendering: images are added as textures onto a plane, then varying lighting conditions, shadows, and occlusions are added to the scene. The scene is rendered from multiple viewpoints, generating perspective distortions more consistent with real-world scenarios, with homographies closely resembling those of camera projections rather than randomized homographies. For each scene, we provide a sequence of distorted images with corresponding occlusion masks, homographies, and ground-truth labels. The resulting dataset can serve as a training and evaluation set for a multitude of tasks involving image alignment and artifact removal, such as deep homography estimation, dense image matching, 2D bundle adjustment, inpainting, shadow removal, denoising, content retrieval, and background subtraction. Our data generation pipeline is customizable and can be applied to any existing dataset, serving as a data augmentation to further improve the feature learning of any existing method.

- **Summary**: We tackle the problem of threshold calibration for open-world recognition by incorporating representation compactness measures into clustering. Unlike the open-set recognition which focuses on discovering and rejecting the unknown, open-world recognition learns robust representations that are generalizable to disjoint unknown classes at test time. Our proposed method is based on two key observations: (i) representation structures among neighbouring images in high dimensional visual embedding spaces have strong self-similarity which can be leveraged to encourage transferability to the open world, (ii) intra-class embedding structures can be modeled with the marginalized von Mises-Fisher (vMF) probability, whose correlation with the true positive rate is dataset-invariant. Motivated by these, we design a unified framework centered around a graph neural network (GNN) to jointly predict the pseudo-labels and the vMF concentrations which indicate the representation compactness. These predictions can be converted into statistical estimations for recognition accuracy, allowing more robust calibration of the distance threshold to achieve target utility for the open-world classes. Results on a variety of visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional posthoc calibration methods for the open world, especially under distribution shift.

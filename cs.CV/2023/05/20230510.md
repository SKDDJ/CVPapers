- **Summary**: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new imaging modality to visualize retinal microvasculature and has been readily adopted in clinics. High-resolution OCT angiograms are important to qualitatively and quantitatively identify potential biomarkers for different retinal diseases accurately. However, one significant problem of OCTA is the inevitable decrease in resolution when increasing the field-of-view given a fixed acquisition time. To address this issue, we propose a novel reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) framework to preserve the resolution of the OCT angiograms while increasing the scanning area. Specifically, textures from the normal RefSR pipeline are used to train a learnable texture generator (LTG), which is designed to generate textures according to the input. The key difference between the proposed method and traditional RefSR models is that the textures used during inference are generated by the LTG instead of being searched from a single reference image. Since the LTG is optimized throughout the whole training process, the available texture space is significantly enlarged and no longer limited to a single reference image, but extends to all textures contained in the training samples. Moreover, our proposed LTGNet does not require a reference image at the inference phase, thereby becoming invulnerable to the selection of the reference image. Both experimental and visual results show that LTGNet has superior performance and robustness over state-of-the-art methods, indicating good reliability and promise in real-life deployment. The source code will be made available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Generative steganography (GS) is a new data hiding manner, featuring direct generation of stego media from secret data. Existing GS methods are generally criticized for their poor performances. In this paper, we propose a novel flow based GS approach -- Generative Steganographic Flow (GSF), which provides direct generation of stego images without cover image. We take the stego image generation and secret data recovery process as an invertible transformation, and build a reversible bijective mapping between input secret data and generated stego images. In the forward mapping, secret data is hidden in the input latent of Glow model to generate stego images. By reversing the mapping, hidden data can be extracted exactly from generated stego images. Furthermore, we propose a novel latent optimization strategy to improve the fidelity of stego images. Experimental results show our proposed GSF has far better performances than SOTA works.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new framework for low-light image enhancement by simultaneously conducting the appearance as well as structure modeling. It employs the structural feature to guide the appearance enhancement, leading to sharp and realistic results. The structure modeling in our framework is implemented as the edge detection in low-light images. It is achieved with a modified generative model via designing a structure-aware feature extractor and generator. The detected edge maps can accurately emphasize the essential structural information, and the edge prediction is robust towards the noises in dark areas. Moreover, to improve the appearance modeling, which is implemented with a simple U-Net, a novel structure-guided enhancement module is proposed with structure-guided feature synthesis layers. The appearance modeling, edge detector, and enhancement module can be trained end-to-end. The experiments are conducted on representative datasets (sRGB and RAW domains), showing that our model consistently achieves SOTA performance on all datasets with the same architecture.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) based on image-level labels is challenging since it is hard to obtain complete semantic regions. To address this issue, we propose a self-training method that utilizes fused multi-scale class-aware attention maps. Our observation is that attention maps of different scales contain rich complementary information, especially for large and small objects. Therefore, we collect information from attention maps of different scales and obtain multi-scale attention maps. We then apply denoising and reactivation strategies to enhance the potential regions and reduce noisy areas. Finally, we use the refined attention maps to retrain the network. Experiments showthat our method enables the model to extract rich semantic information from multi-scale images and achieves 72.4% mIou scores on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 validation and test sets. The code is available at https://bupt-ai-cz.github.io/SMAF.

- **Summary**: Learning and selecting important points on a point cloud is crucial for point cloud understanding in various applications. Most of early methods selected the important points on 3D shapes by analyzing the intrinsic geometric properties of every single shape, which fails to capture the importance of points that distinguishes a shape from objects of other classes, i.e., the distinction of points. To address this problem, we propose D-Net (Distinctive Network) to learn for distinctive point clouds based on a self-attentive point searching and a learnable feature fusion. Specifically, in the self-attentive point searching, we first learn the distinction score for each point to reveal the distinction distribution of the point cloud. After ranking the learned distinction scores, we group a point cloud into a high distinctive point set and a low distinctive one to enrich the fine-grained point cloud structure. To generate a compact feature representation for each distinctive point set, a stacked self-gated convolution is proposed to extract the distinctive features. Finally, we further introduce a learnable feature fusion mechanism to aggregate multiple distinctive features into a global point cloud representation in a channel-wise aggregation manner. The results also show that the learned distinction distribution of a point cloud is highly consistent with objects of the same class and different from objects of other classes. Extensive experiments on public datasets, including ModelNet and ShapeNet part dataset, demonstrate the ability to learn for distinctive point clouds, which helps to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in some shape understanding applications.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of video content demands efficient and flexible neural network based approaches for generating new video content. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines zero-shot text-to-video generation with ControlNet to improve the output of these models. Our method takes multiple sketched frames as input and generates video output that matches the flow of these frames, building upon the Text-to-Video Zero architecture and incorporating ControlNet to enable additional input conditions. By first interpolating frames between the inputted sketches and then running Text-to-Video Zero using the new interpolated frames video as the control technique, we leverage the benefits of both zero-shot text-to-video generation and the robust control provided by ControlNet. Experiments demonstrate that our method excels at producing high-quality and remarkably consistent video content that more accurately aligns with the user's intended motion for the subject within the video. We provide a comprehensive resource package, including a demo video, project website, open-source GitHub repository, and a Colab playground to foster further research and application of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: As the popularity of mobile photography continues to grow, considerable effort is being invested in the reconstruction of degraded images. Due to the spatial variation in optical aberrations, which cannot be avoided during the lens design process, recent commercial cameras have shifted some of these correction tasks from optical design to postprocessing systems. However, without engaging with the optical parameters, these systems only achieve limited correction for aberrations.In this work, we propose a practical method for recovering the degradation caused by optical aberrations. Specifically, we establish an imaging simulation system based on our proposed optical point spread function model. Given the optical parameters of the camera, it generates the imaging results of these specific devices. To perform the restoration, we design a spatial-adaptive network model on synthetic data pairs generated by the imaging simulation system, eliminating the overhead of capturing training data by a large amount of shooting and registration. Moreover, we comprehensively evaluate the proposed method in simulations and experimentally with a customized digital-single-lens-reflex (DSLR) camera lens and HUAWEI HONOR 20, respectively. The experiments demonstrate that our solution successfully removes spatially variant blur and color dispersion. When compared with the state-of-the-art deblur methods, the proposed approach achieves better results with a lower computational overhead. Moreover, the reconstruction technique does not introduce artificial texture and is convenient to transfer to current commercial cameras.

- **Summary**: Given a poorly documented neural network model, we take the perspective of a forensic investigator who wants to find out the model's data domain (e.g. whether on face images or traffic signs). Although existing methods such as membership inference and model inversion can be used to uncover some information about an unknown model, they still require knowledge of the data domain to start with. In this paper, we propose solving this problem by leveraging on comprehensive corpus such as ImageNet to select a meaningful distribution that is close to the original training distribution and leads to high performance in follow-up investigations. The corpus comprises two components, a large dataset of samples and meta information such as hierarchical structure and textual information on the samples. Our goal is to select a set of samples from the corpus for the given model. The core of our method is an objective function that considers two criteria on the selected samples: the model functional properties (derived from the dataset), and semantics (derived from the metadata). We also give an algorithm to efficiently search the large space of all possible subsets w.r.t. the objective function. Experimentation results show that the proposed method is effective. For example, cloning a given model (originally trained with CIFAR-10) by using Caltech 101 can achieve 45.5% accuracy. By using datasets selected by our method, the accuracy is improved to 72.0%.

- **Summary**: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have displayed significant potential in the classification and semantic segmentation of medical images in the last year. Due to the high similarity of human tissues, even slight changes in medical images may represent diseased tissues, necessitating fine-grained inspection to pinpoint diseased tissues. The random masking strategy of MAEs is likely to result in areas of lesions being overlooked by the model. At the same time, inconsistencies between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases impede the performance and efficiency of MAE in medical image classification. To address these issues, we propose a medical supervised masked autoencoder (MSMAE) in this paper. In the pre-training phase, MSMAE precisely masks medical images via the attention maps obtained from supervised training, contributing to the representation learning of human tissue in the lesion area. During the fine-tuning phase, MSMAE is also driven by attention to the accurate masking of medical images. This improves the computational efficiency of the MSMAE while increasing the difficulty of fine-tuning, which indirectly improves the quality of MSMAE medical diagnosis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in case with three official medical datasets for various diseases. Meanwhile, transfer learning for MSMAE also demonstrates the great potential of our approach for medical semantic segmentation tasks. Moreover, the MSMAE accelerates the inference time in the fine-tuning phase by 11.2% and reduces the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 74.08% compared to a traditional MAE.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel method called SHS-Net for oriented normal estimation of point clouds by learning signed hyper surfaces, which can accurately predict normals with global consistent orientation from various point clouds. Almost all existing methods estimate oriented normals through a two-stage pipeline, i.e., unoriented normal estimation and normal orientation, and each step is implemented by a separate algorithm. However, previous methods are sensitive to parameter settings, resulting in poor results from point clouds with noise, density variations and complex geometries. In this work, we introduce signed hyper surfaces (SHS), which are parameterized by multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers, to learn to estimate oriented normals from point clouds in an end-to-end manner. The signed hyper surfaces are implicitly learned in a high-dimensional feature space where the local and global information is aggregated. Specifically, we introduce a patch encoding module and a shape encoding module to encode a 3D point cloud into a local latent code and a global latent code, respectively. Then, an attention-weighted normal prediction module is proposed as a decoder, which takes the local and global latent codes as input to predict oriented normals. Experimental results show that our SHS-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both unoriented and oriented normal estimation on the widely used benchmarks. The code, data and pretrained models are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Line segment detection plays a cornerstone role in computer vision tasks. Among numerous detection methods that have been recently proposed, the ones based on edge drawing attract increasing attention owing to their excellent detection efficiency. However, the existing methods are not robust enough due to the inadequate usage of image gradients for edge drawing and line segment fitting. Based on the observation that the line segments should locate on the edge points with both consistent coordinates and level-line information, i.e., the unit vector perpendicular to the gradient orientation, this paper proposes a level-line guided edge drawing for robust line segment detection (GEDRLSD). The level-line information provides potential directions for edge tracking, which could be served as a guideline for accurate edge drawing. Additionally, the level-line information is fused in line segment fitting to improve the robustness. Numerical experiments show the superiority of the proposed GEDRLSD algorithm compared with state-of-the-art methods.



### Computational Optics for Mobile Terminals in Mass Production

  vol. 45, no. 4, pp. 4245-4259, 1 April 2023
- **Summary**: Correcting the optical aberrations and the manufacturing deviations of cameras is a challenging task. Due to the limitation on volume and the demand for mass production, existing mobile terminals cannot rectify optical degradation. In this work, we systematically construct the perturbed lens system model to illustrate the relationship between the deviated system parameters and the spatial frequency response measured from photographs. To further address this issue, an optimization framework is proposed based on this model to build proxy cameras from the machining samples' SFRs. Engaging with the proxy cameras, we synthetic data pairs, which encode the optical aberrations and the random manufacturing biases, for training the learning-based algorithms. In correcting aberration, although promising results have been shown recently with convolutional neural networks, they are hard to generalize to stochastic machining biases. Therefore, we propose a dilated Omni-dimensional dynamic convolution and implement it in post-processing to account for the manufacturing degradation. Extensive experiments which evaluate multiple samples of two representative devices demonstrate that the proposed optimization framework accurately constructs the proxy camera. And the dynamic processing model is well-adapted to manufacturing deviations of different cameras, realizing perfect computational photography. The evaluation shows that the proposed method bridges the gap between optical design, system machining, and post-processing pipeline, shedding light on the joint of image signal reception (lens and sensor) and image signal processing.

- **Summary**: ROI extraction is an active but challenging task in remote sensing because of the complicated landform, the complex boundaries and the requirement of annotations. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) aims at learning a mapping from input image to pixel-wise prediction under image-wise labels, which can dramatically decrease the labor cost. However, due to the imprecision of labels, the accuracy and time consumption of WSL methods are relatively unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a two-step ROI extraction based on contractive learning. Firstly, we present to integrate multiscale Grad-CAM to obtain pseudo pixelwise annotations with well boundaries. Then, to reduce the compact of misjudgments in pseudo annotations, we construct a contrastive learning strategy to encourage the features inside ROI as close as possible and separate background features from foreground features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposal. Code is available at https://github.com/HE-Lingfeng/ROI-Extraction

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Distribution-Flexible Subset Quantization (DFSQ), a post-training quantization method for super-resolution networks. Our motivation for developing DFSQ is based on the distinctive activation distributions of current super-resolution models, which exhibit significant variance across samples and channels. To address this issue, DFSQ conducts channel-wise normalization of the activations and applies distribution-flexible subset quantization (SQ), wherein the quantization points are selected from a universal set consisting of multi-word additive log-scale values. To expedite the selection of quantization points in SQ, we propose a fast quantization points selection strategy that uses K-means clustering to select the quantization points closest to the centroids. Compared to the common iterative exhaustive search algorithm, our strategy avoids the enumeration of all possible combinations in the universal set, reducing the time complexity from exponential to linear. Consequently, the constraint of time costs on the size of the universal set is greatly relaxed. Extensive evaluations of various super-resolution models show that DFSQ effectively retains performance even without fine-tuning. For example, when quantizing EDSRx2 on the Urban benchmark, DFSQ achieves comparable performance to full-precision counterparts on 6- and 8-bit quantization, and incurs only a 0.1 dB PSNR drop on 4-bit quantization.

- **Summary**: In digital images, the performance of optical aberration is a multivariate degradation, where the spectral of the scene, the lens imperfections, and the field of view together contribute to the results. Besides eliminating it at the hardware level, the post-processing system, which utilizes various prior information, is significant for correction. However, due to the content differences among priors, the pipeline that aligns these factors shows limited efficiency and unoptimized restoration. Here, we propose a prior quantization model to correct the optical aberrations in image processing systems. To integrate these messages, we encode various priors into a latent space and quantify them by the learnable codebooks. After quantization, the prior codes are fused with the image restoration branch to realize targeted optical aberration correction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed method and validate its potential to accomplish targeted restoration for a specific camera. Furthermore, our model promises to analyze the correlation between the various priors and the optical aberration of devices, which is helpful for joint soft-hardware design.

- **Summary**: Differential privacy (DP), as a rigorous mathematical definition quantifying privacy leakage, has become a well-accepted standard for privacy protection. Combined with powerful machine learning techniques, differentially private machine learning (DPML) is increasingly important. As the most classic DPML algorithm, DP-SGD incurs a significant loss of utility, which hinders DPML's deployment in practice. Many studies have recently proposed improved algorithms based on DP-SGD to mitigate utility loss. However, these studies are isolated and cannot comprehensively measure the performance of improvements proposed in algorithms. More importantly, there is a lack of comprehensive research to compare improvements in these DPML algorithms across utility, defensive capabilities, and generalizability.   We fill this gap by performing a holistic measurement of improved DPML algorithms on utility and defense capability against membership inference attacks (MIAs) on image classification tasks. We first present a taxonomy of where improvements are located in the machine learning life cycle. Based on our taxonomy, we jointly perform an extensive measurement study of the improved DPML algorithms. We also cover state-of-the-art label differential privacy (Label DP) algorithms in the evaluation. According to our empirical results, DP can effectively defend against MIAs, and sensitivity-bounding techniques such as per-sample gradient clipping play an important role in defense. We also explore some improvements that can maintain model utility and defend against MIAs more effectively. Experiments show that Label DP algorithms achieve less utility loss but are fragile to MIAs. To support our evaluation, we implement a modular re-usable software, DPMLBench, which enables sensitive data owners to deploy DPML algorithms and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners.

- **Summary**: With the advent of depth-to-image diffusion models, text-guided generation, editing, and transfer of realistic textures are no longer difficult. However, due to the limitations of pre-trained diffusion models, they can only create low-resolution, inconsistent textures. To address this issue, we present the High-definition Consistency Texture Model (HCTM), a novel method that can generate high-definition and consistent textures for 3D meshes according to the text prompts. We achieve this by leveraging a pre-trained depth-to-image diffusion model to generate single viewpoint results based on the text prompt and a depth map. We fine-tune the diffusion model with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to quickly learn the style of the generated result, and apply the multi-diffusion strategy to produce high-resolution and consistent results from different viewpoints. Furthermore, we propose a strategy that prevents the appearance of noise on the textures caused by backpropagation. Our proposed approach has demonstrated promising results in generating high-definition and consistent textures for 3D meshes, as demonstrated through a series of experiments.

- **Summary**: Dunhuang murals suffer from fading, breakage, surface brittleness and extensive peeling affected by prolonged environmental erosion. Image inpainting techniques are widely used in the field of digital mural inpainting. Generally speaking, for mural inpainting tasks with large area damage, it is challenging for any image inpainting method. In this paper, we design a multi-stage progressive reasoning network (MPR-Net) containing global to local receptive fields for murals inpainting. This network is capable of recursively inferring the damage boundary and progressively tightening the regional texture constraints. Moreover, to adaptively fuse plentiful information at various scales of murals, a multi-scale feature aggregation module (MFA) is designed to empower the capability to select the significant features. The execution of the model is similar to the process of a mural restorer (i.e., inpainting the structure of the damaged mural globally first and then adding the local texture details further). Our method has been evaluated through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art image inpainting methods.

- **Summary**: Generative models have advantageous characteristics for classification tasks such as the availability of unsupervised data and calibrated confidence, whereas discriminative models have advantages in terms of the simplicity of their model structures and learning algorithms and their ability to outperform their generative counterparts. In this paper, we propose a method to train a hybrid of discriminative and generative models in a single neural network (NN), which exhibits the characteristics of both models. The key idea is the Gaussian-coupled softmax layer, which is a fully connected layer with a softmax activation function coupled with Gaussian distributions. This layer can be embedded into an NN-based classifier and allows the classifier to estimate both the class posterior distribution and the class-conditional data distribution. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model can be applied to semi-supervised learning and confidence calibration.

- **Summary**: In this study, we propose a novel framework that utilizes deep learning (DL) and attention mechanisms to predict the radiographic progression of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) over a period of seven years. This study included subjects (1832 subjects, 3276 knees) from the baseline of the MOST study. PF joint regions-of-interest were identified using an automated landmark detection tool (BoneFinder) on lateral knee X-rays. An end-to-end DL method was developed for predicting PFOA progression based on imaging data in a 5-fold cross-validation setting. A set of baselines based on known risk factors were developed and analyzed using gradient boosting machine (GBM). Risk factors included age, sex, BMI and WOMAC score, and the radiographic osteoarthritis stage of the tibiofemoral joint (KL score). Finally, we trained an ensemble model using both imaging and clinical data. Among the individual models, the performance of our deep convolutional neural network attention model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.856 and AP of 0.431; slightly outperforming the deep learning approach without attention (AUC=0.832, AP= 0.4) and the best performing reference GBM model (AUC=0.767, AP= 0.334). The inclusion of imaging data and clinical variables in an ensemble model allowed statistically more powerful prediction of PFOA progression (AUC = 0.865, AP=0.447), although the clinical significance of this minor performance gain remains unknown. This study demonstrated the potential of machine learning models to predict the progression of PFOA using imaging and clinical variables. These models could be used to identify patients who are at high risk of progression and prioritize them for new treatments. However, even though the accuracy of the models were excellent in this study using the MOST dataset, they should be still validated using external patient cohorts in the future.

- **Summary**: Utilizing infrastructure and vehicle-side information to track and forecast the behaviors of surrounding traffic participants can significantly improve decision-making and safety in autonomous driving. However, the lack of real-world sequential datasets limits research in this area. To address this issue, we introduce V2X-Seq, the first large-scale sequential V2X dataset, which includes data frames, trajectories, vector maps, and traffic lights captured from natural scenery. V2X-Seq comprises two parts: the sequential perception dataset, which includes more than 15,000 frames captured from 95 scenarios, and the trajectory forecasting dataset, which contains about 80,000 infrastructure-view scenarios, 80,000 vehicle-view scenarios, and 50,000 cooperative-view scenarios captured from 28 intersections' areas, covering 672 hours of data. Based on V2X-Seq, we introduce three new tasks for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative (VIC) autonomous driving: VIC3D Tracking, Online-VIC Forecasting, and Offline-VIC Forecasting. We also provide benchmarks for the introduced tasks. Find data, code, and more up-to-date information at \href{https://github.com/AIR-THU/DAIR-V2X-Seq}{https://github.com/AIR-THU/DAIR-V2X-Seq}.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) can generate realistic images with text guidance using large-scale datasets. However, they demonstrate limited controllability in the output space of the generated images. We propose a novel learning method for text-guided image editing, namely \texttt{iEdit}, that generates images conditioned on a source image and a textual edit prompt. As a fully-annotated dataset with target images does not exist, previous approaches perform subject-specific fine-tuning at test time or adopt contrastive learning without a target image, leading to issues on preserving the fidelity of the source image. We propose to automatically construct a dataset derived from LAION-5B, containing pseudo-target images with their descriptive edit prompts given input image-caption pairs. This dataset gives us the flexibility of introducing a weakly-supervised loss function to generate the pseudo-target image from the latent noise of the source image conditioned on the edit prompt. To encourage localised editing and preserve or modify spatial structures in the image, we propose a loss function that uses segmentation masks to guide the editing during training and optionally at inference. Our model is trained on the constructed dataset with 200K samples and constrained GPU resources. It shows favourable results against its counterparts in terms of image fidelity, CLIP alignment score and qualitatively for editing both generated and real images.

- **Summary**: Deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) have drawn much attention in recent years because of their low power consumption, biological rationality and event-driven property. However, state-of-the-art deep SNNs (including Spikformer and Spikingformer) suffer from a critical challenge related to the imprecise gradient backpropagation. This problem arises from the improper design of downsampling modules in these networks, and greatly hampering the overall model performance. In this paper, we propose ConvBN-MaxPooling-LIF (CML), an SNN-optimized downsampling with precise gradient backpropagation. We prove that CML can effectively overcome the imprecision of gradient backpropagation from a theoretical perspective. In addition, we evaluate CML on ImageNet, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture datasets, and show state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets with significantly enhanced performances compared with Spikingformer. For instance, our model achieves 77.64 $\%$ on ImageNet, 96.04 $\%$ on CIFAR10, 81.4$\%$ on CIFAR10-DVS, with + 1.79$\%$ on ImageNet, +1.16$\%$ on CIFAR100 compared with Spikingformer.

- **Summary**: In recent years, numerous ideas have emerged for designing a mutually reinforcing mechanism or extra stages for the image fusion task, ignoring the inevitable gaps between different vision tasks and the computational burden. We argue that there is a scope to improve the fusion performance with the help of the FusionBooster, a model specifically designed for the fusion task. In particular, our booster is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy controlled by an information probe. The booster is composed of three building blocks: the probe units, the booster layer, and the assembling module. Given the result produced by a backbone method, the probe units assess the fused image and divide the results according to their information content. This is instrumental in identifying missing information, as a step to its recovery. The recovery of the degraded components along with the fusion guidance are the role of the booster layer. Lastly, the assembling module is responsible for piecing these advanced components together to deliver the output. We use concise reconstruction loss functions in conjunction with lightweight autoencoder models to formulate the learning task, with marginal computational complexity increase. The experimental results obtained in various fusion tasks, as well as downstream detection tasks, consistently demonstrate that the proposed FusionBooster significantly improves the performance. Our code will be publicly available on the project homepage.

- **Summary**: Flow field segmentation and classification help researchers to understand vortex structure and thus turbulent flow. Existing deep learning methods mainly based on global information and focused on 2D circumstance. Based on flow field theory, we propose novel flow field segmentation and classification deep learning methods in three-dimensional space. We construct segmentation criterion based on local velocity information and classification criterion based on the relationship between local vorticity and vortex wake, to identify vortex structure in 3D flow field, and further classify the type of vortex wakes accurately and rapidly. Simulation experiment results showed that, compared with existing methods, our segmentation method can identify the vortex area more accurately, while the time consumption is reduced more than 50%; our classification method can reduce the time consumption by more than 90% while maintaining the same classification accuracy level.

- **Summary**: Quality of deep convolutional neural network predictions strongly depends on the size of the training dataset and the quality of the annotations. Creating annotations, especially for 3D medical image segmentation, is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. We propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach that requires only a relatively small number of annotations while being able to use the remaining unlabeled data to improve model performance. Our method uses a pseudo-labeling technique that employs recent deep learning uncertainty estimation models. By using the estimated uncertainty, we were able to rank pseudo-labels and automatically select the best pseudo-annotations generated by the supervised model. We applied this to prostate zonal segmentation in T2-weighted MRI scans. Our proposed model outperformed the semi-supervised model in experiments with the ProstateX dataset and an external test set, by leveraging only a subset of unlabeled data rather than the full collection of 4953 cases, our proposed model demonstrated improved performance. The segmentation dice similarity coefficient in the transition zone and peripheral zone increased from 0.835 and 0.727 to 0.852 and 0.751, respectively, for fully supervised model and the uncertainty-aware semi-supervised learning model (USSL). Our USSL model demonstrates the potential to allow deep learning models to be trained on large datasets without requiring full annotation.

- **Summary**: LiDAR sensors are critical for autonomous driving and robotics applications due to their ability to provide accurate range measurements and their robustness to lighting conditions. However, airborne particles, such as fog, rain, snow, and dust, will degrade its performance and it is inevitable to encounter these inclement environmental conditions outdoors. It would be a straightforward approach to remove them by supervised semantic segmentation. But annotating these particles point wisely is too laborious. To address this problem and enhance the perception under inclement conditions, we develop two dynamic filtering methods called Dynamic Multi-threshold Noise Removal (DMNR) and DMNR-H by accurate analysis of the position distribution and intensity characteristics of noisy points and clean points on publicly available WADS and DENSE datasets. Both DMNR and DMNR-H outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a significant margin on the two datasets and are slightly better than supervised deep learning-based methods. Furthermore, our methods are more robust to different LiDAR sensors and airborne particles, such as snow and fog.

- **Summary**: Existing multimodal conditional image synthesis (MCIS) methods generate images conditioned on any combinations of various modalities that require all of them must be exactly conformed, hindering the synthesis controllability and leaving the potential of cross-modality under-exploited. To this end, we propose to generate images conditioned on the compositions of multimodal control signals, where modalities are imperfectly complementary, i.e., composed multimodal conditional image synthesis (CMCIS). Specifically, we observe two challenging issues of the proposed CMCIS task, i.e., the modality coordination problem and the modality imbalance problem. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Mixture-of-Modality-Tokens Transformer (MMoT) that adaptively fuses fine-grained multimodal control signals, a multimodal balanced training loss to stabilize the optimization of each modality, and a multimodal sampling guidance to balance the strength of each modality control signal. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MMoT achieves superior performance on both unimodal conditional image synthesis (UCIS) and MCIS tasks with high-quality and faithful image synthesis on complex multimodal conditions.

- **Summary**: Automatic image captioning evaluation is critical for benchmarking and promoting advances in image captioning research. Existing metrics only provide a single score to measure caption qualities, which are less explainable and informative. Instead, we humans can easily identify the problems of captions in details, e.g., which words are inaccurate and which salient objects are not described, and then rate the caption quality. To support such informative feedback, we propose an Informative Metric for Reference-free Image Caption evaluation (InfoMetIC). Given an image and a caption, InfoMetIC is able to report incorrect words and unmentioned image regions at fine-grained level, and also provide a text precision score, a vision recall score and an overall quality score at coarse-grained level. The coarse-grained score of InfoMetIC achieves significantly better correlation with human judgements than existing metrics on multiple benchmarks. We also construct a token-level evaluation dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoMetIC in fine-grained evaluation. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/HAWLYQ/InfoMetIC.

- **Summary**: The performance of computer vision models are susceptible to unexpected changes in input images, known as common corruptions (e.g. noise, blur, illumination changes, etc.), that can hinder their reliability when deployed in real scenarios. These corruptions are not always considered to test model generalization and robustness. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of methods that improve the robustness of computer vision models against common corruptions. We categorize methods into four groups based on the model part and training method addressed: data augmentation, representation learning, knowledge distillation, and network components. We also cover indirect methods for generalization and mitigation of shortcut learning, potentially useful for corruption robustness. We release a unified benchmark framework to compare robustness performance on several datasets, and address the inconsistencies of evaluation in the literature. We provide an experimental overview of the base corruption robustness of popular vision backbones, and show that corruption robustness does not necessarily scale with model size. The very large models (above 100M parameters) gain negligible robustness, considering the increased computational requirements. To achieve generalizable and robust computer vision models, we foresee the need of developing new learning strategies to efficiently exploit limited data and mitigate unwanted or unreliable learning behaviors.

- **Summary**: The first MRI scan was done in the year 1978 by researchers at EML Laboratories. As per an estimate, approximately 251,329 people died due to primary cancerous brain and CNS (Central Nervous System) Tumors in the year 2020. It has been recommended by various medical professionals that brain tumor detection at an early stage would help in saving many lives. Whenever radiologists deal with a brain MRI they try to diagnose it with the histological subtype which is quite subjective and here comes the major issue. Upon that, in developing countries like India, where there is 1 doctor for every 1151 people, the need for efficient diagnosis to help radiologists and doctors come into picture. In our approach, we aim to solve the problem using swin transformers and deep learning to detect, classify, locate and provide the size of the tumor in the particular MRI scan which would assist the doctors and radiologists in increasing their efficiency. At the end, the medics would be able to download the predictions and measures in a PDF (Portable Document Format).

- **Summary**: Multi-view stereo depth estimation based on cost volume usually works better than self-supervised monocular depth estimation except for moving objects and low-textured surfaces. So in this paper, we propose a multi-frame depth estimation framework which monocular depth can be refined continuously by multi-frame sequential constraints, leveraging a Bayesian fusion layer within several iterations. Both monocular and multi-view networks can be trained with no depth supervision. Our method also enhances the interpretability when combining monocular estimation with multi-view cost volume. Detailed experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art unsupervised methods utilizing single or multiple frames at test time on KITTI benchmark.

- **Summary**: Spontaneous retinal Venous Pulsations (SVP) are rhythmic changes in the caliber of the central retinal vein and are observed in the optic disc region (ODR) of the retina. Its absence is a critical indicator of various ocular or neurological abnormalities. Recent advances in imaging technology have enabled the development of portable smartphone-based devices for observing the retina and assessment of SVPs. However, the quality of smartphone-based retinal videos is often poor due to noise and image jitting, which in return, can severely obstruct the observation of SVPs. In this work, we developed a fully automated retinal video stabilization method that enables the examination of SVPs captured by various mobile devices. Specifically, we first propose an ODR Spatio-Temporal Localization (ODR-STL) module to localize visible ODR and remove noisy and jittering frames. Then, we introduce a Noise-Aware Template Matching (NATM) module to stabilize high-quality video segments at a fixed position in the field of view. After the processing, the SVPs can be easily observed in the stabilized videos, significantly facilitating user observations. Furthermore, our method is cost-effective and has been tested in both subjective and objective evaluations. Both of the evaluations support its effectiveness in facilitating the observation of SVPs. This can improve the timely diagnosis and treatment of associated diseases, making it a valuable tool for eye health professionals.

- **Summary**: Quantization is a widely adopted technique for deep neural networks to reduce the memory and computational resources required. However, when quantized, most models would need a suitable calibration process to keep their performance intact, which requires data from the target domain, such as a fraction of the dataset used in model training and model validation (i.e. calibration dataset).   In this study, we investigate the use of synthetic data as a substitute for the calibration with real data for the quantization method. We propose a data generation method based on Generative Adversarial Networks that are trained prior to the model quantization step. We compare the performance of models quantized using data generated by StyleGAN2-ADA and our pre-trained DiStyleGAN, with quantization using real data and an alternative data generation method based on fractal images. Overall, the results of our experiments demonstrate the potential of leveraging synthetic data for calibration during the quantization process. In our experiments, the percentage of accuracy degradation of the selected models was less than 0.6%, with our best performance achieved on MobileNetV2 (0.05%).

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning visual models has been widely shown promising performance on many downstream visual tasks. With the surprising development of pre-trained visual foundation models, visual tuning jumped out of the standard modus operandi that fine-tunes the whole pre-trained model or just the fully connected layer. Instead, recent advances can achieve superior performance than full-tuning the whole pre-trained parameters by updating far fewer parameters, enabling edge devices and downstream applications to reuse the increasingly large foundation models deployed on the cloud. With the aim of helping researchers get the full picture and future directions of visual tuning, this survey characterizes a large and thoughtful selection of recent works, providing a systematic and comprehensive overview of existing work and models. Specifically, it provides a detailed background of visual tuning and categorizes recent visual tuning techniques into five groups: prompt tuning, adapter tuning, parameter tuning, and remapping tuning. Meanwhile, it offers some exciting research directions for prospective pre-training and various interactions in visual tuning.

- **Summary**: Following the remarkable success of diffusion models on image generation, recent works have also demonstrated their impressive ability to address a number of inverse problems in an unsupervised way, by properly constraining the sampling process based on a conditioning input. Motivated by this, in this paper, we present the first approach to use diffusion models as a prior for highly accurate 3D facial BRDF reconstruction from a single image. We start by leveraging a high-quality UV dataset of facial reflectance (diffuse and specular albedo and normals), which we render under varying illumination settings to simulate natural RGB textures and, then, train an unconditional diffusion model on concatenated pairs of rendered textures and reflectance components. At test time, we fit a 3D morphable model to the given image and unwrap the face in a partial UV texture. By sampling from the diffusion model, while retaining the observed texture part intact, the model inpaints not only the self-occluded areas but also the unknown reflectance components, in a single sequence of denoising steps. In contrast to existing methods, we directly acquire the observed texture from the input image, thus, resulting in more faithful and consistent reflectance estimation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate superior performance in both texture completion as well as reflectance reconstruction tasks.

- **Summary**: Under partial-label learning (PLL) where, for each training instance, only a set of ambiguous candidate labels containing the unknown true label is accessible, contrastive learning has recently boosted the performance of PLL on vision tasks, attributed to representations learned by contrasting the same/different classes of entities. Without access to true labels, positive points are predicted using pseudo-labels that are inherently noisy, and negative points often require large batches or momentum encoders, resulting in unreliable similarity information and a high computational overhead. In this paper, we rethink a state-of-the-art contrastive PLL method PiCO[24], inspiring the design of a simple framework termed PaPi (Partial-label learning with a guided Prototypical classifier), which demonstrates significant scope for improvement in representation learning, thus contributing to label disambiguation. PaPi guides the optimization of a prototypical classifier by a linear classifier with which they share the same feature encoder, thus explicitly encouraging the representation to reflect visual similarity between categories. It is also technically appealing, as PaPi requires only a few components in PiCO with the opposite direction of guidance, and directly eliminates the contrastive learning module that would introduce noise and consume computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that PaPi significantly outperforms other PLL methods on various image classification tasks.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a feedback mechanism to 'break bad habits' using the Pavlok device. Pavlok utilises beeps, vibration and shocks as a mode of aversion technique to help individuals with behaviour modification. While the device can be useful in certain periodic daily life situations, like alarms and exercise notifications, the device relies on manual operations that limit its usage. To this end, we design a user interface to generate an automatic feedback mechanism that integrates Pavlok and a deep learning based model to detect certain behaviours via an integrated user interface i.e. mobile or desktop application. Our proposed solution is implemented and verified in the context of snoring, which first detects audio from the environment following a prediction of whether the audio content is a snore or not. Based on the prediction of the deep learning model, we use Pavlok to alert users for preventive measures. We believe that this simple solution can help people to change their atomic habits, which may lead to long-term benefits.



### Few-shot Action Recognition via Intra- and Inter-Video Information Maximization

- **Summary**: Current few-shot action recognition involves two primary sources of information for classification:(1) intra-video information, determined by frame content within a single video clip, and (2) inter-video information, measured by relationships (e.g., feature similarity) among videos. However, existing methods inadequately exploit these two information sources. In terms of intra-video information, current sampling operations for input videos may omit critical action information, reducing the utilization efficiency of video data. For the inter-video information, the action misalignment among videos makes it challenging to calculate precise relationships. Moreover, how to jointly consider both inter- and intra-video information remains under-explored for few-shot action recognition. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Video Information Maximization (VIM), for few-shot video action recognition. VIM is equipped with an adaptive spatial-temporal video sampler and a spatiotemporal action alignment model to maximize intra- and inter-video information, respectively. The video sampler adaptively selects important frames and amplifies critical spatial regions for each input video based on the task at hand. This preserves and emphasizes informative parts of video clips while eliminating interference at the data level. The alignment model performs temporal and spatial action alignment sequentially at the feature level, leading to more precise measurements of inter-video similarity. Finally, These goals are facilitated by incorporating additional loss terms based on mutual information measurement. Consequently, VIM acts to maximize the distinctiveness of video information from limited video data. Extensive experimental results on public datasets for few-shot action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of our framework.

- **Summary**: Recently, Transformer-based methods for point cloud learning have achieved good results on various point cloud learning benchmarks. However, since the attention mechanism needs to generate three feature vectors of query, key, and value to calculate attention features, most of the existing Transformer-based point cloud learning methods usually consume a large amount of computational time and memory resources when calculating global attention. To address this problem, we propose a Voxel-Transformer-Point (VTP) Block for extracting local and global features of point clouds. VTP combines the advantages of voxel-based, point-based and Transformer-based methods, which consists of Voxel-Based Branch (V branch), Point-Based Transformer Branch (PT branch) and Point-Based Branch (P branch). The V branch extracts the coarse-grained features of the point cloud through low voxel resolution; the PT branch obtains the fine-grained features of the point cloud by calculating the self-attention in the local neighborhood and the inter-neighborhood cross-attention; the P branch uses a simplified MLP network to generate the global location information of the point cloud. In addition, to enrich the local features of point clouds at different scales, we set the voxel scale in the V branch and the neighborhood sphere scale in the PT branch to one large and one small (large voxel scale \& small neighborhood sphere scale or small voxel scale \& large neighborhood sphere scale). Finally, we use VTP as the feature extraction network to construct a VTPNet for point cloud learning, and performs shape classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation tasks on the ModelNet40, ShapeNet Part, and S3DIS datasets. The experimental results indicate that VTPNet has good performance in 3D point cloud learning.

- **Summary**: Estimating the camera pose given images of a single camera is a traditional task in mobile robots and autonomous vehicles. This problem is called monocular visual odometry and it often relies on geometric approaches that require engineering effort for a specific scenario. Deep learning methods have shown to be generalizable after proper training and a considerable amount of available data. Transformer-based architectures have dominated the state-of-the-art in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, such as image and video understanding. In this work, we deal with the monocular visual odometry as a video understanding task to estimate the 6-DoF camera's pose. We contribute by presenting the TSformer-VO model based on spatio-temporal self-attention mechanisms to extract features from clips and estimate the motions in an end-to-end manner. Our approach achieved competitive state-of-the-art performance compared with geometry-based and deep learning-based methods on the KITTI visual odometry dataset, outperforming the DeepVO implementation highly accepted in the visual odometry community.

- **Summary**: Generative AI (AIGC, a.k.a. AI generated content) has made remarkable progress in the past few years, among which text-guided content generation is the most practical one since it enables the interaction between human instruction and AIGC. Due to the development in text-to-image as well 3D modeling technologies (like NeRF), text-to-3D has become a newly emerging yet highly active research field. Our work conducts the first yet comprehensive survey on text-to-3D to help readers interested in this direction quickly catch up with its fast development. First, we introduce 3D data representations, including both Euclidean data and non-Euclidean data. On top of that, we introduce various foundation technologies as well as summarize how recent works combine those foundation technologies to realize satisfactory text-to-3D. Moreover, we summarize how text-to-3D technology is used in various applications, including avatar generation, texture generation, shape transformation, and scene generation.

- **Summary**: ChatGPT and its improved variant GPT4 have revolutionized the NLP field with a single model solving almost all text related tasks. However, such a model for computer vision does not exist, especially for 3D vision. This article first provides a brief view on the progress of deep learning in text, image and 3D fields from the model perspective. Moreover, this work further discusses how AIGC evolves from the data perspective. On top of that, this work presents an outlook on the development of AIGC in 3D from the data perspective.

- **Summary**: Semantic localization, i.e., robot self-localization with semantic image modality, is critical in recently emerging embodied AI applications such as point-goal navigation, object-goal navigation and vision language navigation. However, most existing works on semantic localization focus on passive vision tasks without viewpoint planning, or rely on additional rich modalities (e.g., depth measurements). Thus, the problem is largely unsolved. In this work, we explore a lightweight, entirely CPU-based, domain-adaptive semantic localization framework, called graph neural localizer.Our approach is inspired by two recently emerging technologies: (1) Scene graph, which combines the viewpoint- and appearance- invariance of local and global features; (2) Graph neural network, which enables direct learning/recognition of graph data (i.e., non-vector data). Specifically, a graph convolutional neural network is first trained as a scene graph classifier for passive vision, and then its knowledge is transferred to a reinforcement-learning planner for active vision. Experiments on two scenarios, self-supervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation, using a photo-realistic Habitat simulator validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the problem of generalized category discovery (GCD), \ie, given a set of images where part of them are labelled and the rest are not, the task is to automatically cluster the images in the unlabelled data, leveraging the information from the labelled data, while the unlabelled data contain images from the labelled classes and also new ones. GCD is similar to semi-supervised learning (SSL) but is more realistic and challenging, as SSL assumes all the unlabelled images are from the same classes as the labelled ones. We also do not assume the class number in the unlabelled data is known a-priori, making the GCD problem even harder. To tackle the problem of GCD without knowing the class number, we propose an EM-like framework that alternates between representation learning and class number estimation. We propose a semi-supervised variant of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with a stochastic splitting and merging mechanism to dynamically determine the prototypes by examining the cluster compactness and separability. With these prototypes, we leverage prototypical contrastive learning for representation learning on the partially labelled data subject to the constraints imposed by the labelled data. Our framework alternates between these two steps until convergence. The cluster assignment for an unlabelled instance can then be retrieved by identifying its nearest prototype. We comprehensively evaluate our framework on both generic image classification datasets and challenging fine-grained object recognition datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Clothes-invariant feature extraction is critical to the clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID). It can provide discriminative identity features and eliminate the negative effects caused by the confounder--clothing changes. But we argue that there exists a strong spurious correlation between clothes and human identity, that restricts the common likelihood-based ReID method P(Y|X) to extract clothes-irrelevant features. In this paper, we propose a new Causal Clothes-Invariant Learning (CCIL) method to achieve clothes-invariant feature learning by modeling causal intervention P(Y|do(X)). This new causality-based model is inherently invariant to the confounder in the causal view, which can achieve the clothes-invariant features and avoid the barrier faced by the likelihood-based methods. Extensive experiments on three CC-ReID benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, and VC-Clothes, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves a new state of the art.

- **Summary**: Visual place classification from a first-person-view monocular RGB image is a fundamental problem in long-term robot navigation. A difficulty arises from the fact that RGB image classifiers are often vulnerable to spatial and appearance changes and degrade due to domain shifts, such as seasonal, weather, and lighting differences. To address this issue, multi-sensor fusion approaches combining RGB and depth (D) (e.g., LIDAR, radar, stereo) have gained popularity in recent years. Inspired by these efforts in multimodal RGB-D fusion, we explore the use of pseudo-depth measurements from recently-developed techniques of ``domain invariant" monocular depth estimation as an additional pseudo depth modality, by reformulating the single-modal RGB image classification task as a pseudo multi-modal RGB-D classification problem. Specifically, a practical, fully self-supervised framework for training, appropriately processing, fusing, and classifying these two modalities, RGB and pseudo-D, is described. Experiments on challenging cross-domain scenarios using public NCLT datasets validate effectiveness of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: This paper aims for a new generation task: non-stationary multi-texture synthesis, which unifies synthesizing multiple non-stationary textures in a single model. Most non-stationary textures have large scale variance and can hardly be synthesized through one model. To combat this, we propose a multi-scale generator to capture structural patterns of various scales and effectively synthesize textures with a minor cost. However, it is still hard to handle textures of different categories with different texture patterns. Therefore, we present a category-specific training strategy to focus on learning texture pattern of a specific domain. Interestingly, once trained, our model is able to produce multi-pattern generations with dynamic variations without the need to finetune the model for different styles. Moreover, an objective evaluation metric is designed for evaluating the quality of texture expansion and global structure consistency. To our knowledge, ours is the first scheme for this challenging task, including model, training, and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves superior performance and time efficiency. The code will be available after the publication.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a 3D attention-based U-Net architecture for multi-region segmentation of brain tumors using a single stacked multi-modal volume created by combining three non-native MRI volumes. The attention mechanism added to the decoder side of the U-Net helps to improve segmentation accuracy by de-emphasizing healthy tissues and accentuating malignant tissues, resulting in better generalization power and reduced computational resources. The method is trained and evaluated on the BraTS 2021 Task 1 dataset, and demonstrates improvement of accuracy over other approaches. My findings suggest that the proposed approach has potential to enhance brain tumor segmentation using multi-modal MRI data, contributing to better understanding and diagnosis of brain diseases. This work highlights the importance of combining multiple imaging modalities and incorporating attention mechanisms for improved accuracy in brain tumor segmentation.

- **Summary**: In recent years, soft prompt learning methods have been proposed to fine-tune large-scale vision-language pre-trained models for various downstream tasks. These methods typically combine learnable textual tokens with class tokens as input for models with frozen parameters. However, they often employ a single prompt to describe class contexts, failing to capture categories' diverse attributes adequately. This study introduces the Partitioned Multi-modal Prompt (PMPO), a multi-modal prompting technique that extends the soft prompt from a single learnable prompt to multiple prompts. Our method divides the visual encoder depths and connects learnable prompts to the separated visual depths, enabling different prompts to capture the hierarchical contextual depths of visual representations. Furthermore, to maximize the advantages of multi-prompt learning, we incorporate prior information from manually designed templates and learnable multi-prompts, thus improving the generalization capabilities of our approach. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three challenging tasks: new class generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization. For instance, our method achieves a $79.28$ harmonic mean, averaged over 11 diverse image recognition datasets ($+7.62$ compared to CoOp), demonstrating significant competitiveness compared to state-of-the-art prompting methods.

- **Summary**: Predominant techniques on talking head generation largely depend on 2D information, including facial appearances and motions from input face images. Nevertheless, dense 3D facial geometry, such as pixel-wise depth, plays a critical role in constructing accurate 3D facial structures and suppressing complex background noises for generation. However, dense 3D annotations for facial videos is prohibitively costly to obtain. In this work, firstly, we present a novel self-supervised method for learning dense 3D facial geometry (ie, depth) from face videos, without requiring camera parameters and 3D geometry annotations in training. We further propose a strategy to learn pixel-level uncertainties to perceive more reliable rigid-motion pixels for geometry learning. Secondly, we design an effective geometry-guided facial keypoint estimation module, providing accurate keypoints for generating motion fields. Lastly, we develop a 3D-aware cross-modal (ie, appearance and depth) attention mechanism, which can be applied to each generation layer, to capture facial geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging benchmarks (ie, VoxCeleb1, VoxCeleb2, and HDTF). The results demonstrate that our proposed framework can generate highly realistic-looking reenacted talking videos, with new state-of-the-art performances established on these benchmarks.

- **Summary**: X-ray images are the first steps for diagnosing and further treating dental problems. So, early diagnosis prevents the development and increase of oral and dental diseases. In this paper, we developed a semantic segmentation algorithm based on BEIT adaptor and Mask2Former to detect and identify teeth, roots, and multiple dental diseases and abnormalities such as pulp chamber, restoration, endodontics, crown, decay, pin, composite, bridge, pulpitis, orthodontics, radicular cyst, periapical cyst, cyst, implant, and bone graft material in panoramic, periapical, and bitewing X-ray images. We compared the result of our algorithm to two state-of-the-art algorithms in image segmentation named: Deeplabv3 and Segformer on our own data set. We discovered that Radious outperformed those algorithms by increasing the mIoU scores by 9% and 33% in Deeplabv3+ and Segformer, respectively.

- **Summary**: End-to-end autonomous driving has made impressive progress in recent years. Existing methods usually adopt the decoupled encoder-decoder paradigm, where the encoder extracts hidden features from raw sensor data, and the decoder outputs the ego-vehicle's future trajectories or actions. Under such a paradigm, the encoder does not have access to the intended behavior of the ego agent, leaving the burden of finding out safety-critical regions from the massive receptive field and inferring about future situations to the decoder. Even worse, the decoder is usually composed of several simple multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) or GRUs while the encoder is delicately designed (e.g., a combination of heavy ResNets or Transformer). Such an imbalanced resource-task division hampers the learning process.   In this work, we aim to alleviate the aforementioned problem by two principles: (1) fully utilizing the capacity of the encoder; (2) increasing the capacity of the decoder. Concretely, we first predict a coarse-grained future position and action based on the encoder features. Then, conditioned on the position and action, the future scene is imagined to check the ramification if we drive accordingly. We also retrieve the encoder features around the predicted coordinate to obtain fine-grained information about the safety-critical region. Finally, based on the predicted future and the retrieved salient feature, we refine the coarse-grained position and action by predicting its offset from ground-truth. The above refinement module could be stacked in a cascaded fashion, which extends the capacity of the decoder with spatial-temporal prior knowledge about the conditioned future. We conduct experiments on the CARLA simulator and achieve state-of-the-art performance in closed-loop benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module.

- **Summary**: Automated multi-label chest X-rays (CXR) image classification has achieved substantial progress in clinical diagnosis via utilizing sophisticated deep learning approaches. However, most deep models have high computational demands, which makes them less feasible for compact devices with low computational requirements. To overcome this problem, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) strategy to create the compact deep learning model for the real-time multi-label CXR image classification. We study different alternatives of CNNs and Transforms as the teacher to distill the knowledge to a smaller student. Then, we employed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide the visual explanation for the model decision improved by the KD. Our results on three benchmark CXR datasets show that our KD strategy provides the improved performance on the compact student model, thus being the feasible choice for many limited hardware platforms. For instance, when using DenseNet161 as the teacher network, EEEA-Net-C2 achieved an AUC of 83.7%, 87.1%, and 88.7% on the ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, and PadChest datasets, respectively, with fewer parameters of 4.7 million and computational cost of 0.3 billion FLOPS.

- **Summary**: We present a novel deep learning-based framework: Embedded Feature Similarity Optimization with Specific Parameter Initialization (SOPI) for 2D/3D medical image registration which is a most challenging problem due to the difficulty such as dimensional mismatch, heavy computation load and lack of golden evaluation standard. The framework we design includes a parameter specification module to efficiently choose initialization pose parameter and a fine-registration module to align images. The proposed framework takes extracting multi-scale features into consideration using a novel composite connection encoder with special training techniques. We compare the method with both learning-based methods and optimization-based methods on a in-house CT/X-ray dataset as well as simulated data to further evaluate performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the method in this paper has improved the registration performance, and thereby outperforms the existing methods in terms of accuracy and running time. We also show the potential of the proposed method as an initial pose estimator. The code is available at https://github.com/m1nhengChen/SOPI

- **Summary**: Recovering an outdoor environment's surface mesh is vital for an agricultural robot during task planning and remote visualization. Our proposed solution is based on a newly-designed panoramic stereo camera along with a hybrid novel software framework that consists of three fusion modules. The panoramic stereo camera with a pentagon shape consists of 5 stereo vision camera pairs to stream synchronized panoramic stereo images for the following three fusion modules. In the disparity fusion module, rectified stereo images produce the initial disparity maps using multiple stereo vision algorithms. Then, these initial disparity maps, along with the intensity images, are input into a disparity fusion network to produce refined disparity maps. Next, the refined disparity maps are converted into full-view point clouds or single-view point clouds for the pose fusion module. The pose fusion module adopts a two-stage global-coarse-to-local-fine strategy. In the first stage, each pair of full-view point clouds is registered by a global point cloud matching algorithm to estimate the transformation for a global pose graph's edge, which effectively implements loop closure. In the second stage, a local point cloud matching algorithm is used to match single-view point clouds in different nodes. Next, we locally refine the poses of all corresponding edges in the global pose graph using three proposed rules, thus constructing a refined pose graph. The refined pose graph is optimized to produce a global pose trajectory for volumetric fusion. In the volumetric fusion module, the global poses of all the nodes are used to integrate the single-view point clouds into the volume to produce the mesh of the whole garden. The proposed framework and its three fusion modules are tested on a real outdoor garden dataset to show the superiority of the performance.

- **Summary**: The ability to specify robot commands by a non-expert user is critical for building generalist agents capable of solving a large variety of tasks. One convenient way to specify the intended robot goal is by a video of a person demonstrating the target task. While prior work typically aims to imitate human demonstrations performed in robot environments, here we focus on a more realistic and challenging setup with demonstrations recorded in natural and diverse human environments. We propose Video-conditioned Policy learning (ViP), a data-driven approach that maps human demonstrations of previously unseen tasks to robot manipulation skills. To this end, we learn our policy to generate appropriate actions given current scene observations and a video of the target task. To encourage generalization to new tasks, we avoid particular tasks during training and learn our policy from unlabelled robot trajectories and corresponding robot videos. Both robot and human videos in our framework are represented by video embeddings pre-trained for human action recognition. At test time we first translate human videos to robot videos in the common video embedding space, and then use resulting embeddings to condition our policies. Notably, our approach enables robot control by human demonstrations in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without using robot trajectories paired with human instructions during training. We validate our approach on a set of challenging multi-task robot manipulation environments and outperform state of the art. Our method also demonstrates excellent performance in a new challenging zero-shot setup where no paired data is used during training.

- **Summary**: Instance segmentation is a fundamental skill for many robotic applications. We propose a self-supervised method that uses grasp interactions to collect segmentation supervision for an instance segmentation model. When a robot grasps an item, the mask of that grasped item can be inferred from the images of the scene before and after the grasp. Leveraging this insight, we learn a grasp segmentation model to segment the grasped object from before and after grasp images. Such a model can segment grasped objects from thousands of grasp interactions without costly human annotation. Using the segmented grasped objects, we can "cut" objects from their original scenes and "paste" them into new scenes to generate instance supervision. We show that our grasp segmentation model provides a 5x error reduction when segmenting grasped objects compared with traditional image subtraction approaches. Combined with our "cut-and-paste" generation method, instance segmentation models trained with our method achieve better performance than a model trained with 10x the amount of labeled data. On a real robotic grasping system, our instance segmentation model reduces the rate of grasp errors by over 3x compared to an image subtraction baseline.

- **Summary**: As virtual and physical identity grow increasingly intertwined, the importance of privacy and security in the online sphere becomes paramount. In recent years, multiple news stories have emerged of private companies scraping web content and doing research with or selling the data. Images uploaded online can be scraped without users' consent or knowledge. Users of social media platforms whose images are scraped may be at risk of being identified in other uploaded images or in real-world identification situations. This paper investigates how simple, accessible image manipulation techniques affect the accuracy of facial recognition software in identifying an individual's various face images based on one unique image.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing semantic 3D building models at the level of detail (LoD) 3 is a long-standing challenge. Unlike mesh-based models, they require watertight geometry and object-wise semantics at the fa\c{c}ade level. The principal challenge of such demanding semantic 3D reconstruction is reliable fa\c{c}ade-level semantic segmentation of 3D input data. We present a novel method, called Scan2LoD3, that accurately reconstructs semantic LoD3 building models by improving fa\c{c}ade-level semantic 3D segmentation. To this end, we leverage laser physics and 3D building model priors to probabilistically identify model conflicts. These probabilistic physical conflicts propose locations of model openings: Their final semantics and shapes are inferred in a Bayesian network fusing multimodal probabilistic maps of conflicts, 3D point clouds, and 2D images. To fulfill demanding LoD3 requirements, we use the estimated shapes to cut openings in 3D building priors and fit semantic 3D objects from a library of fa\c{c}ade objects. Extensive experiments on the TUM city campus datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Scan2LoD3 over the state-of-the-art methods in fa\c{c}ade-level detection, semantic segmentation, and LoD3 building model reconstruction. We believe our method can foster the development of probability-driven semantic 3D reconstruction at LoD3 since not only the high-definition reconstruction but also reconstruction confidence becomes pivotal for various applications such as autonomous driving and urban simulations.

- **Summary**: Malicious Deepfakes have led to a sharp conflict over distinguishing between genuine and forged faces. Although many countermeasures have been developed to detect Deepfakes ex-post, undoubtedly, passive forensics has not considered any preventive measures for the pristine face before foreseeable manipulations. To complete this forensics ecosystem, we thus put forward the proactive solution dubbed SepMark, which provides a unified framework for source tracing and Deepfake detection. SepMark originates from encoder-decoder-based deep watermarking but with two separable decoders. For the first time the deep separable watermarking, SepMark brings a new paradigm to the established study of deep watermarking, where a single encoder embeds one watermark elegantly, while two decoders can extract the watermark separately at different levels of robustness. The robust decoder termed Tracer that resists various distortions may have an overly high level of robustness, allowing the watermark to survive both before and after Deepfake. The semi-robust one termed Detector is selectively sensitive to malicious distortions, making the watermark disappear after Deepfake. Only SepMark comprising of Tracer and Detector can reliably trace the trusted source of the marked face and detect whether it has been altered since being marked; neither of the two alone can achieve this. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SepMark on typical Deepfakes, including face swapping, expression reenactment, and attribute editing.

- **Summary**: We present Integrated Multimodal Perception (IMP), a simple and scalable multimodal multi-task training and modeling approach. IMP integrates multimodal inputs including image, video, text, and audio into a single Transformer encoder with minimal modality-specific components. IMP makes use of a novel design that combines Alternating Gradient Descent (AGD) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for efficient model \& task scaling. We conduct extensive empirical studies about IMP and reveal the following key insights: 1) performing gradient descent updates by alternating on diverse heterogeneous modalities, loss functions, and tasks, while also varying input resolutions, efficiently improves multimodal understanding. 2) model sparsification with MoE on a single modality-agnostic encoder substantially improves the performance, outperforming dense models that use modality-specific encoders or additional fusion layers and greatly mitigating the conflicts between modalities. IMP achieves competitive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks including image classification, video classification, image-text, and video-text retrieval. Most notably, we train a sparse IMP-MoE-L focusing on video tasks that achieves new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video classification. Our model achieves 77.0% on Kinetics-400, 76.8% on Kinetics-600, and 76.8% on Kinetics-700 zero-shot classification accuracy, improving the previous state-of-the-art by +5%, +6.7%, and +5.8%, respectively, while using only 15% of their total training computational cost.

- **Summary**: Vision and Language (VL) models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot performance in a variety of tasks. However, recent studies have shown that even the best VL models struggle to capture aspects of scene understanding, such as object attributes, relationships, and action states. In contrast, obtaining structured annotations, e.g., scene graphs (SGs) that could improve these models is time-consuming, costly, and tedious, and thus cannot be used on a large scale. Here we ask, can small datasets containing SG annotations provide sufficient information for enhancing structured understanding of VL models? We show that it is indeed possible to improve VL models using such data by utilizing a specialized model architecture and a new training paradigm. Our approach captures structure-related information for both the visual and textual encoders by directly supervising both components when learning from SG labels. We use scene graph supervision to generate fine-grained captions based on various graph augmentations highlighting different compositional aspects of the scene, and to predict SG information using an open vocabulary approach by adding special ``Adaptive SG tokens'' to the visual encoder. Moreover, we design a new adaptation technique tailored specifically to the SG tokens that allows better learning of the graph prediction task while still maintaining zero-shot capabilities. Our model shows strong performance improvements on the Winoground and VL-checklist datasets with only a mild degradation in zero-shot performance.

- **Summary**: Building animatable 3D models is challenging due to the need for 3D scans, laborious registration, and manual rigging, which are difficult to scale to arbitrary categories. Recently, differentiable rendering provides a pathway to obtain high-quality 3D models from monocular videos, but these are limited to rigid categories or single instances. We present RAC that builds category 3D models from monocular videos while disentangling variations over instances and motion over time. Three key ideas are introduced to solve this problem: (1) specializing a skeleton to instances via optimization, (2) a method for latent space regularization that encourages shared structure across a category while maintaining instance details, and (3) using 3D background models to disentangle objects from the background. We show that 3D models of humans, cats, and dogs can be learned from 50-100 internet videos.

- **Summary**: Representing human performance at high-fidelity is an essential building block in diverse applications, such as film production, computer games or videoconferencing. To close the gap to production-level quality, we introduce HumanRF, a 4D dynamic neural scene representation that captures full-body appearance in motion from multi-view video input, and enables playback from novel, unseen viewpoints. Our novel representation acts as a dynamic video encoding that captures fine details at high compression rates by factorizing space-time into a temporal matrix-vector decomposition. This allows us to obtain temporally coherent reconstructions of human actors for long sequences, while representing high-resolution details even in the context of challenging motion. While most research focuses on synthesizing at resolutions of 4MP or lower, we address the challenge of operating at 12MP. To this end, we introduce ActorsHQ, a novel multi-view dataset that provides 12MP footage from 160 cameras for 16 sequences with high-fidelity, per-frame mesh reconstructions. We demonstrate challenges that emerge from using such high-resolution data and show that our newly introduced HumanRF effectively leverages this data, making a significant step towards production-level quality novel view synthesis.

- **Summary**: Event-based cameras are becoming increasingly popular for their ability to capture high-speed motion with low latency and high dynamic range. However, generating videos from events remains challenging due to the highly sparse and varying nature of event data. To address this, in this study, we propose HyperE2VID, a dynamic neural network architecture for event-based video reconstruction. Our approach uses hypernetworks and dynamic convolutions to generate per-pixel adaptive filters guided by a context fusion module that combines information from event voxel grids and previously reconstructed intensity images. We also employ a curriculum learning strategy to train the network more robustly. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperE2VID achieves better reconstruction quality with fewer parameters and faster inference time than the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We observe that the mapping between an image's representation in one model to its representation in another can be learned surprisingly well with just a linear layer, even across diverse models. Building on this observation, we propose $\textit{text-to-concept}$, where features from a fixed pretrained model are aligned linearly to the CLIP space, so that text embeddings from CLIP's text encoder become directly comparable to the aligned features. With text-to-concept, we convert fixed off-the-shelf vision encoders to surprisingly strong zero-shot classifiers for free, with accuracy at times even surpassing that of CLIP, despite being much smaller models and trained on a small fraction of the data compared to CLIP. We show other immediate use-cases of text-to-concept, like building concept bottleneck models with no concept supervision, diagnosing distribution shifts in terms of human concepts, and retrieving images satisfying a set of text-based constraints. Lastly, we demonstrate the feasibility of $\textit{concept-to-text}$, where vectors in a model's feature space are decoded by first aligning to the CLIP before being fed to a GPT-based generative model. Our work suggests existing deep models, with presumably diverse architectures and training, represent input samples relatively similarly, and a two-way communication across model representation spaces and to humans (through language) is viable.

- **Summary**: Autonomous robots operating in real-world environments encounter a variety of objects that can be both rigid and articulated in nature. Having knowledge of these specific object properties not only helps in designing appropriate manipulation strategies but also aids in developing reliable tracking and pose estimation techniques for many robotic and vision applications. In this context, this paper presents a registration-based local region-to-region mapping approach to classify an object as either articulated or rigid. Using the point clouds of the intended object, the proposed method performs classification by estimating unique local transformations between point clouds over the observed sequence of movements of the object. The significant advantage of the proposed method is that it is a constraint-free approach that can classify any articulated object and is not limited to a specific type of articulation. Additionally, it is a model-free approach with no learning components, which means it can classify whether an object is articulated without requiring any object models or labelled data. We analyze the performance of the proposed method on two publicly available benchmark datasets with a combination of articulated and rigid objects. It is observed that the proposed method can classify articulated and rigid objects with good accuracy.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are becoming increasingly popular in synthetic data generation and image editing applications. However, these models can amplify existing biases and propagate them to downstream applications. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the sources of bias in their outputs. In this paper, we investigate the presence of bias in diffusion-based face generation models with respect to attributes such as gender, race, and age. Moreover, we examine how dataset size affects the attribute composition and perceptual quality of both diffusion and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based face generation models across various attribute classes. Our findings suggest that diffusion models tend to worsen distribution bias in the training data for various attributes, which is heavily influenced by the size of the dataset. Conversely, GAN models trained on balanced datasets with a larger number of samples show less bias across different attributes.

- **Summary**: Outside-knowledge visual question answering is a challenging task that requires both the acquisition and the use of open-ended real-world knowledge. Some existing solutions draw external knowledge into the cross-modality space which overlooks the much vaster textual knowledge in natural-language space, while others transform the image into a text that further fuses with the textual knowledge into the natural-language space and completely abandons the use of visual features. In this paper, we are inspired to constrain the cross-modality space into the same space of natural-language space which makes the visual features preserved directly, and the model still benefits from the vast knowledge in natural-language space. To this end, we propose a novel framework consisting of a multimodal encoder, a textual encoder and an answer decoder. Such structure allows us to introduce more types of knowledge including explicit and implicit multimodal and textual knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method which outperforms the state-of-the-art by 6.17% accuracy. We also conduct comprehensive ablations of each component, and systematically study the roles of varying types of knowledge.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundation model for general image segmentation. Although it exhibits impressive performance predominantly on natural images, understanding its robustness against various image perturbations and domains is critical for real-world applications where such challenges frequently arise. In this study we conduct a comprehensive robustness investigation of SAM under diverse real-world conditions. Our experiments encompass a wide range of image perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAM's performance generally declines under perturbed images, with varying degrees of vulnerability across different perturbations. By customizing prompting techniques and leveraging domain knowledge based on the unique characteristics of each dataset, the model's resilience to these perturbations can be enhanced, addressing dataset-specific challenges. This work sheds light on the limitations and strengths of SAM in real-world applications, promoting the development of more robust and versatile image segmentation solutions.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised video representation learning aimed at maximizing similarity between different temporal segments of one video, in order to enforce feature persistence over time. This leads to loss of pertinent information related to temporal relationships, rendering actions such as `enter' and `leave' to be indistinguishable. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Latent Time Navigation (LTN), a time-parameterized contrastive learning strategy that is streamlined to capture fine-grained motions. Specifically, we maximize the representation similarity between different video segments from one video, while maintaining their representations time-aware along a subspace of the latent representation code including an orthogonal basis to represent temporal changes. Our extensive experimental analysis suggests that learning video representations by LTN consistently improves performance of action classification in fine-grained and human-oriented tasks (e.g., on Toyota Smarthome dataset). In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed model, when pre-trained on Kinetics-400, generalizes well onto the unseen real world video benchmark datasets UCF101 and HMDB51, achieving state-of-the-art performance in action recognition.

- **Summary**: Understanding human affective behaviour, especially in the dynamics of real-world settings, requires Facial Expression Recognition (FER) models to continuously adapt to individual differences in user expression, contextual attributions, and the environment. Current (deep) Machine Learning (ML)-based FER approaches pre-trained in isolation on benchmark datasets fail to capture the nuances of real-world interactions where data is available only incrementally, acquired by the agent or robot during interactions. New learning comes at the cost of previous knowledge, resulting in catastrophic forgetting. Lifelong or Continual Learning (CL), on the other hand, enables adaptability in agents by being sensitive to changing data distributions, integrating new information without interfering with previously learnt knowledge. Positing CL as an effective learning paradigm for FER, this work presents the Continual Facial Expression Recognition (ConFER) benchmark that evaluates popular CL techniques on FER tasks. It presents a comparative analysis of several CL-based approaches on popular FER datasets such as CK+, RAF-DB, and AffectNet and present strategies for a successful implementation of ConFER for Affective Computing (AC) research. CL techniques, under different learning settings, are shown to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across several datasets, thus motivating a discussion on the benefits of applying CL principles towards human behaviour understanding, particularly from facial expressions, as well the challenges entailed.

- **Summary**: We present a physics-based humanoid controller that achieves high-fidelity motion imitation and fault-tolerant behavior in the presence of noisy input (e.g. pose estimates from video or generated from language) and unexpected falls. Our controller scales up to learning ten thousand motion clips without using any external stabilizing forces and learns to naturally recover from fail-state. Given reference motion, our controller can perpetually control simulated avatars without requiring resets. At its core, we propose the progressive multiplicative control policy (PMCP), which dynamically allocates new network capacity to learn harder and harder motion sequences. PMCP allows efficient scaling for learning from large-scale motion databases and adding new tasks, such as fail-state recovery, without catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our controller by using it to imitate noisy poses from video-based pose estimators and language-based motion generators in a live and real-time multi-person avatar use case.

- **Summary**: Deformable tracking and real-time estimation of 3D tissue motion is essential to enable automation and image guidance applications in robotically assisted surgery. Our model, Sparse Efficient Neural Depth and Deformation (SENDD), extends prior 2D tracking work to estimate flow in 3D space. SENDD introduces novel contributions of learned detection, and sparse per-point depth and 3D flow estimation, all with less than half a million parameters. SENDD does this by using graph neural networks of sparse keypoint matches to estimate both depth and 3D flow. We quantify and benchmark SENDD on a comprehensively labelled tissue dataset, and compare it to an equivalent 2D flow model. SENDD performs comparably while enabling applications that 2D flow cannot. SENDD can track points and estimate depth at 10fps on an NVIDIA RTX 4000 for 1280 tracked (query) points and its cost scales linearly with an increasing/decreasing number of points. SENDD enables multiple downstream applications that require 3D motion estimation.

- **Summary**: This work proposes a novel concept for tree and plant reconstruction by directly inferring a Lindenmayer-System (L-System) word representation from image data in an image captioning approach. We train a model end-to-end which is able to translate given images into L-System words as a description of the displayed tree. To prove this concept, we demonstrate the applicability on 2D tree topologies. Transferred to real image data, this novel idea could lead to more efficient, accurate and semantically meaningful tree and plant reconstruction without using error-prone point cloud extraction, and other processes usually utilized in tree reconstruction. Furthermore, this approach bypasses the need for a predefined L-System grammar and enables species-specific L-System inference without biological knowledge.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has enabled various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Still, designing models with high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge, especially in real-time video processing applications. Such applications exhibit high inter- and intra-frame redundancy, allowing further improvement. This paper proposes a similarity-aware training methodology that exploits data redundancy in video frames for efficient processing. Our approach introduces a per-layer regularization that enhances computation reuse by increasing the similarity of weights during training. We validate our methodology on two critical real-time applications, lane detection and scene parsing. We observe an average compression ratio of approximately 50% and a speedup of \sim 1.5x for different models while maintaining the same accuracy.

- **Summary**: Lung cancer has been one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide for years. With the emergence of deep learning, computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) models based on learning algorithms can accelerate the nodule screening process, providing valuable assistance to radiologists in their daily clinical workflows. However, developing such robust and accurate models often requires large-scale and diverse medical datasets with high-quality annotations. Generating synthetic data provides a pathway for augmenting datasets at a larger scale. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the use of Semantic Diffusion Mod- els (SDM) to generate high-fidelity pulmonary CT images from segmentation maps. We utilize annotation information from the LUNA16 dataset to create paired CT images and masks, and assess the quality of the generated images using the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), as well as on two common clinical downstream tasks: nodule detection and nodule localization. Achieving improvements of 3.96% for detection accuracy and 8.50% for AP50 in nodule localization task, respectively, demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.

- **Summary**: Recently, there is an emerging interest in adversarially training a classifier with a rejection option (also known as a selective classifier) for boosting adversarial robustness. While rejection can incur a cost in many applications, existing studies typically associate zero cost with rejecting perturbed inputs, which can result in the rejection of numerous slightly-perturbed inputs that could be correctly classified. In this work, we study adversarially-robust classification with rejection in the stratified rejection setting, where the rejection cost is modeled by rejection loss functions monotonically non-increasing in the perturbation magnitude. We theoretically analyze the stratified rejection setting and propose a novel defense method -- Adversarial Training with Consistent Prediction-based Rejection (CPR) -- for building a robust selective classifier. Experiments on image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods under strong adaptive attacks. For instance, on CIFAR-10, CPR reduces the total robust loss (for different rejection losses) by at least 7.3% under both seen and unseen attacks.

- **Summary**: Despite the recent development of deep learning-based point cloud upsampling, most MLP-based point cloud upsampling methods have limitations in that it is difficult to train the local and global structure of the point cloud at the same time. To solve this problem, we present a combined graph convolution and transformer for point cloud upsampling, denoted by PU-EdgeFormer. The proposed method constructs EdgeFormer unit that consists of graph convolution and multi-head self-attention modules. We employ graph convolution using EdgeConv, which learns the local geometry and global structure of point cloud better than existing point-to-feature method. Through in-depth experiments, we confirmed that the proposed method has better point cloud upsampling performance than the existing state-of-the-art method in both subjective and objective aspects. The code is available at https://github.com/dohoon2045/PU-EdgeFormer.

- **Summary**: Although contrastive learning methods have shown prevailing performance on a variety of representation learning tasks, they encounter difficulty when the training dataset is long-tailed. Many researchers have combined contrastive learning and a logit adjustment technique to address this problem, but the combinations are done ad-hoc and a theoretical background has not yet been provided. The goal of this paper is to provide the background and further improve the performance. First, we show that the fundamental reason contrastive learning methods struggle with long-tailed tasks is that they try to maximize the mutual information maximization between latent features and input data. As ground-truth labels are not considered in the maximization, they are not able to address imbalances between class labels. Rather, we interpret the long-tailed recognition task as a mutual information maximization between latent features and ground-truth labels. This approach integrates contrastive learning and logit adjustment seamlessly to derive a loss function that shows state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed recognition benchmarks. It also demonstrates its efficacy in image segmentation tasks, verifying its versatility beyond image classification.

- **Summary**: The ability of neural radiance fields or NeRFs to conduct accurate 3D modelling has motivated application of the technique to scene representation. Previous approaches have mainly followed a centralised learning paradigm, which assumes that all training images are available on one compute node for training. In this paper, we consider training NeRFs in a federated manner, whereby multiple compute nodes, each having acquired a distinct set of observations of the overall scene, learn a common NeRF in parallel. This supports the scenario of cooperatively modelling a scene using multiple agents. Our contribution is the first federated learning algorithm for NeRF, which splits the training effort across multiple compute nodes and obviates the need to pool the images at a central node. A technique based on low-rank decomposition of NeRF layers is introduced to reduce bandwidth consumption to transmit the model parameters for aggregation. Transferring compressed models instead of the raw data also contributes to the privacy of the data collecting agents.

- **Summary**: Deep-learning-based super-resolution photoacoustic angiography (PAA) is a powerful tool that restores blood vessel images from under-sampled images to facilitate disease diagnosis. Nonetheless, due to the scarcity of training samples, PAA super-resolution models often exhibit inadequate generalization capabilities, particularly in the context of continuous monitoring tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that employs a super-resolution PAA method trained with forged PAA images. We start by generating realistic PAA images of human lips from hand-drawn curves using a diffusion-based image generation model. Subsequently, we train a self-similarity-based super-resolution model with these forged PAA images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the super-resolution model trained with authentic PAA images in both original-domain and cross-domain tests. Specially, our approach boosts the quality of super-resolution reconstruction using the images forged by the deep learning model, indicating that the collaboration between deep learning models can facilitate generalization, despite limited initial dataset. This approach shows promising potential for exploring zero-shot learning neural networks for vision tasks.

- **Summary**: In general, human pose estimation methods are categorized into two approaches according to their architectures: regression (i.e., heatmap-free) and heatmap-based methods. The former one directly estimates precise coordinates of each keypoint using convolutional and fully-connected layers. Although this approach is able to detect overlapped and dense keypoints, unexpected results can be obtained by non-existent keypoints in a scene. On the other hand, the latter one is able to filter the non-existent ones out by utilizing predicted heatmaps for each keypoint. Nevertheless, it suffers from quantization error when obtaining the keypoint coordinates from its heatmaps. In addition, unlike the regression one, it is difficult to distinguish densely placed keypoints in an image. To this end, we propose a hybrid model for single-stage multi-person pose estimation, named HybridPose, which mutually overcomes each drawback of both approaches by maximizing their strengths. Furthermore, we introduce self-correlation loss to inject spatial dependencies between keypoint coordinates and their visibility. Therefore, HybridPose is capable of not only detecting densely placed keypoints, but also filtering the non-existent keypoints in an image. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed HybridPose exhibits the keypoints visibility without performance degradation in terms of the pose estimation accuracy.

- **Summary**: For the ore particle size detection, obtaining a sizable amount of high-quality ore labeled data is time-consuming and expensive. General object detection methods often suffer from severe over-fitting with scarce labeled data. Despite their ability to eliminate over-fitting, existing few-shot object detectors encounter drawbacks such as slow detection speed and high memory requirements, making them difficult to implement in a real-world deployment scenario. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective few-shot detector to achieve competitive performance with general object detection with only a few samples for ore images. First, the proposed support feature mining block characterizes the importance of location information in support features. Next, the relationship guidance block makes full use of support features to guide the generation of accurate candidate proposals. Finally, the dual-scale semantic aggregation module retrieves detailed features at different resolutions to contribute with the prediction process. Experimental results show that our method consistently exceeds the few-shot detectors with an excellent performance gap on all metrics. Moreover, our method achieves the smallest model size of 19MB as well as being competitive at 50 FPS detection speed compared with general object detectors.

- **Summary**: Existing approaches to animatable NeRF-based head avatars are either built upon face templates or use the expression coefficients of templates as the driving signal. Despite the promising progress, their performances are heavily bound by the expression power and the tracking accuracy of the templates. In this work, we present LatentAvatar, an expressive neural head avatar driven by latent expression codes. Such latent expression codes are learned in an end-to-end and self-supervised manner without templates, enabling our method to get rid of expression and tracking issues. To achieve this, we leverage a latent head NeRF to learn the person-specific latent expression codes from a monocular portrait video, and further design a Y-shaped network to learn the shared latent expression codes of different subjects for cross-identity reenactment. By optimizing the photometric reconstruction objectives in NeRF, the latent expression codes are learned to be 3D-aware while faithfully capturing the high-frequency detailed expressions. Moreover, by learning a mapping between the latent expression code learned in shared and person-specific settings, LatentAvatar is able to perform expressive reenactment between different subjects. Experimental results show that our LatentAvatar is able to capture challenging expressions and the subtle movement of teeth and even eyeballs, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art solutions in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.

- **Summary**: Hand-eye calibration is a critical task in robotics, as it directly affects the efficacy of critical operations such as manipulation and grasping. Traditional methods for achieving this objective necessitate the careful design of joint poses and the use of specialized calibration markers, while most recent learning-based approaches using solely pose regression are limited in their abilities to diagnose inaccuracies. In this work, we introduce a new approach to hand-eye calibration called EasyHeC, which is markerless, white-box, and offers comprehensive coverage of positioning accuracy across the entire robot configuration space. We introduce two key technologies: differentiable rendering-based camera pose optimization and consistency-based joint space exploration, which enables accurate end-to-end optimization of the calibration process and eliminates the need for the laborious manual design of robot joint poses. Our evaluation demonstrates superior performance in synthetic and real-world datasets, enhancing downstream manipulation tasks by providing precise camera poses for locating and interacting with objects.

- **Summary**: Recently, metasurfaces have experienced revolutionary growth in the sensing and superresolution imaging field, due to their enabling of subwavelength manipulation of electromagnetic waves. However, the addition of metasurfaces multiplies the complexity of retrieving target information from the detected fields. Besides, although the deep learning method affords a compelling platform for a series of electromagnetic problems, many studies mainly concentrate on resolving one single function and limit the research's versatility. In this study, a multifunctional deep neural network is demonstrated to reconstruct target information in a metasurface targets interactive system. Firstly, the interactive scenario is confirmed to tolerate the system noises in a primary verification experiment. Then, fed with the electric field distributions, the multitask deep neural network can not only sense the quantity and permittivity of targets but also generate superresolution images with high precision. The deep learning method provides another way to recover targets' diverse information in metasurface based target detection, accelerating the progression of target reconstruction areas. This methodology may also hold promise for inverse reconstruction or forward prediction problems in other electromagnetic scenarios.

- **Summary**: The goal of this document is to survey existing methods for recovering CSG representations from unstructured data such as 3D point-clouds or polygon meshes. We review and discuss related topics such as the segmentation and fitting of the input data. We cover techniques from solid modeling and CAD for polyhedron to CSG and B-rep to CSG conversion. We look at approaches coming from program synthesis, evolutionary techniques (such as genetic programming or genetic algorithm), and deep learning methods. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of techniques for the generation of computer programs representing solids (not just CSG models) and higher-level representations (such as, for example, the ones based on sketch and extrusion or feature based operations).



### On Uni-Modal Feature Learning in Supervised Multi-Modal Learning

- **Summary**: We abstract the features (i.e. learned representations) of multi-modal data into 1) uni-modal features, which can be learned from uni-modal training, and 2) paired features, which can only be learned from cross-modal interactions. Multi-modal models are expected to benefit from cross-modal interactions on the basis of ensuring uni-modal feature learning. However, recent supervised multi-modal late-fusion training approaches still suffer from insufficient learning of uni-modal features on each modality. We prove that this phenomenon does hurt the model's generalization ability. To this end, we propose to choose a targeted late-fusion learning method for the given supervised multi-modal task from Uni-Modal Ensemble(UME) and the proposed Uni-Modal Teacher(UMT), according to the distribution of uni-modal and paired features. We demonstrate that, under a simple guiding strategy, we can achieve comparable results to other complex late-fusion or intermediate-fusion methods on various multi-modal datasets, including VGG-Sound, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and ModelNet40.



### DRPT: Disentangled and Recurrent Prompt Tuning for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning

- **Summary**: Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel concepts composed of known knowledge without training samples. Standard CZSL either identifies visual primitives or enhances unseen composed entities, and as a result, entanglement between state and object primitives cannot be fully utilized. Admittedly, vision-language models (VLMs) could naturally cope with CZSL through tuning prompts, while uneven entanglement leads prompts to be dragged into local optimum. In this paper, we take a further step to introduce a novel Disentangled and Recurrent Prompt Tuning framework termed DRPT to better tap the potential of VLMs in CZSL. Specifically, the state and object primitives are deemed as learnable tokens of vocabulary embedded in prompts and tuned on seen compositions. Instead of jointly tuning state and object, we devise a disentangled and recurrent tuning strategy to suppress the traction force caused by entanglement and gradually optimize the token parameters, leading to a better prompt space. Notably, we develop a progressive fine-tuning procedure that allows for incremental updates to the prompts, optimizing the object first, then the state, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the optimization of state and object is independent, thus clearer features can be learned to further alleviate the issue of entangling misleading optimization. Moreover, we quantify and analyze the entanglement in CZSL and supplement entanglement rebalancing optimization schemes. DRPT surpasses representative state-of-the-art methods on extensive benchmark datasets, demonstrating superiority in both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Panoptic segmentation is one of the most challenging scene parsing tasks, combining the tasks of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. While much progress has been made, few works focus on the real-time application of panoptic segmentation methods. In this paper, we revisit the recently introduced K-Net architecture. We propose vital changes to the architecture, training, and inference procedure, which massively decrease latency and improve performance. Our resulting RT-K-Net sets a new state-of-the-art performance for real-time panoptic segmentation methods on the Cityscapes dataset and shows promising results on the challenging Mapillary Vistas dataset. On Cityscapes, RT-K-Net reaches 60.2 % PQ with an average inference time of 32 ms for full resolution 1024x2048 pixel images on a single Titan RTX GPU. On Mapillary Vistas, RT-K-Net reaches 33.2 % PQ with an average inference time of 69 ms. Source code is available at https://github.com/markusschoen/RT-K-Net.



### DreamPaint: Few-Shot Inpainting of E-Commerce Items for Virtual Try-On without 3D Modeling

- **Summary**: We introduce DreamPaint, a framework to intelligently inpaint any e-commerce product on any user-provided context image. The context image can be, for example, the user's own image for virtual try-on of clothes from the e-commerce catalog on themselves, the user's room image for virtual try-on of a piece of furniture from the e-commerce catalog in their room, etc. As opposed to previous augmented-reality (AR)-based virtual try-on methods, DreamPaint does not use, nor does it require, 3D modeling of neither the e-commerce product nor the user context. Instead, it directly uses 2D images of the product as available in product catalog database, and a 2D picture of the context, for example taken from the user's phone camera. The method relies on few-shot fine tuning a pre-trained diffusion model with the masked latents (e.g., Masked DreamBooth) of the catalog images per item, whose weights are then loaded on a pre-trained inpainting module that is capable of preserving the characteristics of the context image. DreamPaint allows to preserve both the product image and the context (environment/user) image without requiring text guidance to describe the missing part (product/context). DreamPaint also allows to intelligently infer the best 3D angle of the product to place at the desired location on the user context, even if that angle was previously unseen in the product's reference 2D images. We compare our results against both text-guided and image-guided inpainting modules and show that DreamPaint yields superior performance in both subjective human study and quantitative metrics.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present Conditional Adversarial Latent Models (CALM), an approach for generating diverse and directable behaviors for user-controlled interactive virtual characters. Using imitation learning, CALM learns a representation of movement that captures the complexity and diversity of human motion, and enables direct control over character movements. The approach jointly learns a control policy and a motion encoder that reconstructs key characteristics of a given motion without merely replicating it. The results show that CALM learns a semantic motion representation, enabling control over the generated motions and style-conditioning for higher-level task training. Once trained, the character can be controlled using intuitive interfaces, akin to those found in video games.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) attempts to train a global model by aggregating local models from distributed devices under the coordination of a central server. However, the existence of a large number of heterogeneous devices makes FL vulnerable to various attacks, especially the stealthy backdoor attack. Backdoor attack aims to trick a neural network to misclassify data to a target label by injecting specific triggers while keeping correct predictions on original training data. Existing works focus on client-side attacks which try to poison the global model by modifying the local datasets. In this work, we propose a new attack model for FL, namely Data-Agnostic Backdoor attack at the Server (DABS), where the server directly modifies the global model to backdoor an FL system. Extensive simulation results show that this attack scheme achieves a higher attack success rate compared with baseline methods while maintaining normal accuracy on the clean data.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation with weak labels is a long-lived ill-posed problem. Mainstream methods mainly focus on improving the quality of pseudo labels. In this report, we attempt to explore the potential of 'prompt to masks' from the powerful class-agnostic large segmentation model, segment-anything. Specifically, different weak labels are used as prompts to the segment-anything model, generating precise class masks. The class masks are utilized to generate pseudo labels to train the segmentation networks. We have conducted extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. Experiments demonstrate that segment-anything can serve as a good pseudo-label generator. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: While developing a new vision-language LLM (VL-LLM) by pre-training on tremendous image-text pairs from scratch can be exceedingly resource-consuming, connecting an existing LLM with a comparatively lightweight visual prompt generator (VPG) becomes a feasible paradigm. However, further tuning the VPG part of the VL-LLM still suffers from indispensable computational costs, i.e., requiring thousands of GPU hours and millions of training data. One alternative solution is to transfer an existing VPG from any existing VL-LLMs for the target VL-LLM.   In this work, we for the first time investigate the VPG transferability across LLMs, and explore a solution to reduce the cost of VPG transfer. We first study the VPG transfer across different LLM sizes (e.g., small-to-large), and across different LLM types, through which we diagnose the key factors to maximize the transfer efficiency. Based on our observation, we design a two-stage transfer framework named VPGTrans, which is simple yet highly effective. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that VPGTrans helps significantly speed up the transfer learning process without compromising performance. Remarkably, it helps achieve the VPG transfer from BLIP-2 OPT$_\text{2.7B}$ to BLIP-2 OPT$_\text{6.7B}$ with over 10 times speed-up and 10.7% training data compared with connecting a VPG to OPT$_\text{6.7B}$ from scratch. Further, a series of intriguing findings and potential rationales behind them are provided and discussed. Finally, we showcase the practical value of our VPGTrans approach, by customizing two novel VL-LLMs, including VL-LLaMA and VL-Vicuna, with recently released LLaMA and Vicuna LLMs.

- **Summary**: Extensive work has demonstrated the effectiveness of Vision Transformers. The plain Vision Transformer tends to obtain multi-scale features by selecting fixed layers, or the last layer of features aiming to achieve higher performance in dense prediction tasks. However, this selection is often based on manual operation. And different samples often exhibit different features at different layers (e.g., edge, structure, texture, detail, etc.). This requires us to seek a dynamic adaptive fusion method to filter different layer features. In this paper, unlike previous encoder and decoder work, we design a neck network for adaptive fusion and feature selection, called ViTController. We validate the effectiveness of our method on different datasets and models and surpass previous state-of-the-art methods. Finally, our method can also be used as a plug-in module and inserted into different networks.

- **Summary**: Recently Transformer has shown good performance in several vision tasks due to its powerful modeling capabilities. To reduce the quadratic complexity caused by the attention, some outstanding work restricts attention to local regions or extends axial interactions. However, these methos often lack the interaction of local and global information, balancing coarse and fine-grained information. To address this problem, we propose AxWin Attention, which models context information in both local windows and axial views. Based on the AxWin Attention, we develop a context-aware vision transformer backbone, named AxWin Transformer, which outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in both classification and downstream segmentation and detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Face Recognition System (FRS) are shown to be vulnerable to morphed images of newborns. Detecting morphing attacks stemming from face images of newborn is important to avoid unwanted consequences, both for security and society. In this paper, we present a new reference-based/Differential Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) method to detect newborn morphing images using Wavelet Scattering Network (WSN). We propose a two-layer WSN with 250 $\times$ 250 pixels and six rotations of wavelets per layer, resulting in 577 paths. The proposed approach is validated on a dataset of 852 bona fide images and 2460 morphing images constructed using face images of 42 unique newborns. The obtained results indicate a gain of over 10\% in detection accuracy over other existing D-MAD techniques.

- **Summary**: The emergence of digital avatars has raised an exponential increase in the demand for human point clouds with realistic and intricate details. The compression of such data becomes challenging with overwhelming data amounts comprising millions of points. Herein, we leverage the human geometric prior in geometry redundancy removal of point clouds, greatly promoting the compression performance. More specifically, the prior provides topological constraints as geometry initialization, allowing adaptive adjustments with a compact parameter set that could be represented with only a few bits. Therefore, we can envisage high-resolution human point clouds as a combination of geometric priors and structural deviations. The priors could first be derived with an aligned point cloud, and subsequently the difference of features is compressed into a compact latent code. The proposed framework can operate in a play-and-plug fashion with existing learning based point cloud compression methods. Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the compression performance without deteriorating the quality, demonstrating its promise in a variety of applications.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of generating musical soundtracks in sync with rhythmic visual cues. Most existing works rely on pre-defined music representations, leading to the incompetence of generative flexibility and complexity. Other methods directly generating video-conditioned waveforms suffer from limited scenarios, short lengths, and unstable generation quality. To this end, we present Long-Term Rhythmic Video Soundtracker (LORIS), a novel framework to synthesize long-term conditional waveforms. Specifically, our framework consists of a latent conditional diffusion probabilistic model to perform waveform synthesis. Furthermore, a series of context-aware conditioning encoders are proposed to take temporal information into consideration for a long-term generation. Notably, we extend our model's applicability from dances to multiple sports scenarios such as floor exercise and figure skating. To perform comprehensive evaluations, we establish a benchmark for rhythmic video soundtracks including the pre-processed dataset, improved evaluation metrics, and robust generative baselines. Extensive experiments show that our model generates long-term soundtracks with state-of-the-art musical quality and rhythmic correspondence.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an efficient self-supervised arbitrary-scale super-resolution (SR) framework to reconstruct isotropic magnetic resonance (MR) images from anisotropic MRI inputs without involving external training data. The proposed framework builds a training dataset using in-the-wild anisotropic MR volumes with arbitrary image resolution. We then formulate the 3D volume SR task as a SR problem for 2D image slices. The anisotropic volume's high-resolution (HR) plane is used to build the HR-LR image pairs for model training. We further adapt the implicit neural representation (INR) network to implement the 2D arbitrary-scale image SR model. Finally, we leverage the well-trained proposed model to up-sample the 2D LR plane extracted from the anisotropic MR volumes to their HR views. The isotropic MR volumes thus can be reconstructed by stacking and averaging the generated HR slices. Our proposed framework has two major advantages: (1) It only involves the arbitrary-resolution anisotropic MR volumes, which greatly improves the model practicality in real MR imaging scenarios (e.g., clinical brain image acquisition); (2) The INR-based SR model enables arbitrary-scale image SR from the arbitrary-resolution input image, which significantly improves model training efficiency. We perform experiments on a simulated public adult brain dataset and a real collected 7T brain dataset. The results indicate that our current framework greatly outperforms two well-known self-supervised models for anisotropic MR image SR tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent research has shown that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly vulnerable to adversarial samples, which are highly transferable and can be used to attack other unknown black-box models. To improve the transferability of adversarial samples, several feature-based adversarial attack methods have been proposed to disrupt neuron activation in the middle layers. However, current state-of-the-art feature-based attack methods typically require additional computation costs for estimating the importance of neurons. To address this challenge, we propose a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based feature-level attack method. Our approach is inspired by the discovery that eigenvectors associated with the larger singular values decomposed from the middle layer features exhibit superior generalization and attention properties. Specifically, we conduct the attack by retaining the decomposed Top-1 singular value-associated feature for computing the output logits, which are then combined with the original logits to optimize adversarial examples. Our extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, which can be easily integrated into various baselines to significantly enhance the transferability of adversarial samples for disturbing normally trained CNNs and advanced defense strategies.

- **Summary**: Crude oil is an integral component of the modern world economy. With the growing demand for crude oil due to its widespread applications, accidental oil spills are unavoidable. Even though oil spills are in and themselves difficult to clean up, the first and foremost challenge is to detect spills. In this research, the authors test the feasibility of deep encoder-decoder models that can be trained effectively to detect oil spills. The work compares the results from several segmentation models on high dimensional satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image data. Multiple combinations of models are used in running the experiments. The best-performing model is the one with the ResNet-50 encoder and DeepLabV3+ decoder. It achieves a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 64.868% and a class IoU of 61.549% for the "oil spill" class when compared with the current benchmark model, which achieved a mean IoU of 65.05% and a class IoU of 53.38% for the "oil spill" class.

- **Summary**: Accurately predicting the performance of architecture with small sample training is an important but not easy task. How to analysis and train dataset to overcome overfitting is the core problem we should deal with. Meanwhile if there is the mult-task problem, we should also think about if we can take advantage of their correlation and estimate as fast as we can. In this track, Super Network builds a search space based on ViT-Base. The search space contain depth, num-heads, mpl-ratio and embed-dim. What we done firstly are pre-processing the data based on our understanding of this problem which can reduce complexity of problem and probability of over fitting. Then we tried different kind of models and different way to combine them. Finally we choose stacking ensemble models using GP-NAS with cross validation. Our stacking model ranked 1st in CVPR 2022 Track 2 Challenge.

- **Summary**: Video text spotting refers to localizing, recognizing, and tracking textual elements such as captions, logos, license plates, signs, and other forms of text within consecutive video frames. However, current datasets available for this task rely on quadrilateral ground truth annotations, which may result in including excessive background content and inaccurate text boundaries. Furthermore, methods trained on these datasets often produce prediction results in the form of quadrilateral boxes, which limits their ability to handle complex scenarios such as dense or curved text. To address these issues, we propose a scalable mask annotation pipeline called SAMText for video text spotting. SAMText leverages the SAM model to generate mask annotations for scene text images or video frames at scale. Using SAMText, we have created a large-scale dataset, SAMText-9M, that contains over 2,400 video clips sourced from existing datasets and over 9 million mask annotations. We have also conducted a thorough statistical analysis of the generated masks and their quality, identifying several research topics that could be further explored based on this dataset. The code and dataset will be released at \url{https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/SAMText}.

- **Summary**: Vector-Borne Disease (VBD) is an infectious disease transmitted through the pathogenic female Aedes mosquito to humans and animals. It is important to control dengue disease by reducing the spread of Aedes mosquito vectors. Community awareness plays acrucial role to ensure Aedes control programmes and encourages the communities to involve active participation. Identifying the species of mosquito will help to recognize the mosquito density in the locality and intensifying mosquito control efforts in particular areas. This willhelp in avoiding Aedes breeding sites around residential areas and reduce adult mosquitoes. To serve this purpose, an android application are developed to identify Aedes species that help the community to contribute in mosquito control events. Several Android applications have been developed to identify species like birds, plant species, and Anopheles mosquito species. In this work, a user-friendly mobile application mAedesID is developed for identifying the Aedes mosquito species using a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm which is best suited for species image classification and achieves better accuracy for voluminous images.

- **Summary**: Most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, ignore an important factor, i.e.~transformation. They are solely defined to test how well machines understand concepts and relations within static settings, like one image. Such \textbf{state driven} visual reasoning has limitations in reflecting the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has shown to be equally important for human cognition in Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel \textbf{transformation driven} visual reasoning (TVR) task. Given both the initial and final states, the target becomes to infer the corresponding intermediate transformation. Following this definition, a new synthetic dataset namely TRANCE is first constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, i.e.~Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Next, we build another real dataset called TRANCO based on COIN, to cover the loss of transformation diversity on TRANCE. Inspired by human reasoning, we propose a three-staged reasoning framework called TranNet, including observing, analyzing, and concluding, to test how recent advanced techniques perform on TVR. Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event, View, and TRANCO. We believe the proposed new paradigm will boost the development of machine visual reasoning. More advanced methods and new problems need to be investigated in this direction.

- **Summary**: The rise in loosely-structured data available through text, images, and other modalities has called for new ways of querying them. Multimedia Information Retrieval has filled this gap and has witnessed exciting progress in recent years. Tasks such as search and retrieval of extensive multimedia archives have undergone massive performance improvements, driven to a large extent by recent developments in multimodal deep learning. However, methods in this field remain limited in the kinds of queries they support and, in particular, their inability to answer database-like queries. For this reason, inspired by recent work on neural databases, we propose a new framework, which we name Multimodal Neural Databases (MMNDBs). MMNDBs can answer complex database-like queries that involve reasoning over different input modalities, such as text and images, at scale. In this paper, we present the first architecture able to fulfill this set of requirements and test it with several baselines, showing the limitations of currently available models. The results show the potential of these new techniques to process unstructured data coming from different modalities, paving the way for future research in the area. Code to replicate the experiments will be released at https://github.com/GiovanniTRA/MultimodalNeuralDatabases

- **Summary**: Reliable application of machine learning is of primary importance to the practical deployment of deep learning methods. A fundamental challenge is that models are often unreliable due to overconfidence. In this paper, we estimate a model's reliability by measuring \emph{the agreement between its latent space, and the latent space of a foundation model}. However, it is challenging to measure the agreement between two different latent spaces due to their incoherence, \eg, arbitrary rotations and different dimensionality. To overcome this incoherence issue, we design a \emph{neighborhood agreement measure} between latent spaces and find that this agreement is surprisingly well-correlated with the reliability of a model's predictions. Further, we show that fusing neighborhood agreement into a model's predictive confidence in a post-hoc way significantly improves its reliability. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on failure detection across various datasets verify the effectiveness of our method on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a framework ARBEx, a novel attentive feature extraction framework driven by Vision Transformer with reliability balancing to cope against poor class distributions, bias, and uncertainty in the facial expression learning (FEL) task. We reinforce several data pre-processing and refinement methods along with a window-based cross-attention ViT to squeeze the best of the data. We also employ learnable anchor points in the embedding space with label distributions and multi-head self-attention mechanism to optimize performance against weak predictions with reliability balancing, which is a strategy that leverages anchor points, attention scores, and confidence values to enhance the resilience of label predictions. To ensure correct label classification and improve the models' discriminative power, we introduce anchor loss, which encourages large margins between anchor points. Additionally, the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which is also trainable, plays an integral role in identifying accurate labels. This approach provides critical elements for improving the reliability of predictions and has a substantial positive effect on final prediction capabilities. Our adaptive model can be integrated with any deep neural network to forestall challenges in various recognition tasks. Our strategy outperforms current state-of-the-art methodologies, according to extensive experiments conducted in a variety of contexts.

While the traditional operations of the car-sharing service highly relied on human engagements in fleet management, modern car-sharing platforms let users upload car images before and after their use to inspect the cars without a physical visit. To automate the aforementioned inspection task, prior approaches utilized deep neural networks. They commonly employed pre-training, a de-facto technique to establish an effective model under the limited number of labeled datasets. As candidate practitioners who deal with car images would presumably get suffered from the lack of a labeled dataset, we analyzed a sophisticated analogy into the effectiveness of pre-training is important. However, prior studies primarily shed a little spotlight on the effectiveness of pre-training. Motivated by the aforementioned lack of analysis, our study proposes a series of analyses to unveil the effectiveness of various pre-training methods in image recognition tasks at the car-sharing platform. We set two real-world image recognition tasks in the car-sharing platform in a live service, established them under the many-shot and few-shot problem settings, and scrutinized which pre-training method accomplishes the most effective performance in which setting. Furthermore, we analyzed how does the pre-training and fine-tuning convey different knowledge to the neural networks for a precise understanding.

- **Summary**: The ability to collect a large dataset of human preferences from text-to-image users is usually limited to companies, making such datasets inaccessible to the public. To address this issue, we create a web app that enables text-to-image users to generate images and specify their preferences. Using this web app we build Pick-a-Pic, a large, open dataset of text-to-image prompts and real users' preferences over generated images. We leverage this dataset to train a CLIP-based scoring function, PickScore, which exhibits superhuman performance on the task of predicting human preferences. Then, we test PickScore's ability to perform model evaluation and observe that it correlates better with human rankings than other automatic evaluation metrics. Therefore, we recommend using PickScore for evaluating future text-to-image generation models, and using Pick-a-Pic prompts as a more relevant dataset than MS-COCO. Finally, we demonstrate how PickScore can enhance existing text-to-image models via ranking.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated exceptional performance and versatility, making it a promising tool for various related tasks. In this report, we explore the application of SAM in Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS). Particularly, we adapt SAM as the pseudo-label generation pipeline given only the image-level class labels. While we observed impressive results in most cases, we also identify certain limitations. Our study includes performance evaluations on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO, where we achieved remarkable improvements over the latest state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. We anticipate that this report encourages further explorations of adopting SAM in WSSS, as well as wider real-world applications.

- **Summary**: With the proliferation of algorithmic decision-making, increased scrutiny has been placed on these systems. This paper explores the relationship between the quality of the training data and the overall fairness of the models trained with such data in the context of supervised classification. We measure key fairness metrics across a range of algorithms over multiple image classification datasets that have a varying level of noise in both the labels and the training data itself. We describe noise in the labels as inaccuracies in the labelling of the data in the training set and noise in the data as distortions in the data, also in the training set. By adding noise to the original datasets, we can explore the relationship between the quality of the training data and the fairness of the output of the models trained on that data.

- **Summary**: Human and environment sensing are two important topics in Computer Vision and Graphics. Human motion is often captured by inertial sensors, while the environment is mostly reconstructed using cameras. We integrate the two techniques together in EgoLocate, a system that simultaneously performs human motion capture (mocap), localization, and mapping in real time from sparse body-mounted sensors, including 6 inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a monocular phone camera. On one hand, inertial mocap suffers from large translation drift due to the lack of the global positioning signal. EgoLocate leverages image-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques to locate the human in the reconstructed scene. On the other hand, SLAM often fails when the visual feature is poor. EgoLocate involves inertial mocap to provide a strong prior for the camera motion. Experiments show that localization, a key challenge for both two fields, is largely improved by our technique, compared with the state of the art of the two fields. Our codes are available for research at https://xinyu-yi.github.io/EgoLocate/.

- **Summary**: Multi-color holograms rely on simultaneous illumination from multiple light sources. These multi-color holograms could utilize light sources better than conventional single-color holograms and can improve the dynamic range of holographic displays. In this letter, we introduce \projectname, the first learned method for estimating the optimal light source powers required for illuminating multi-color holograms. For this purpose, we establish the first multi-color hologram dataset using synthetic images and their depth information. We generate these synthetic images using a trending pipeline combining generative, large language, and monocular depth estimation models. Finally, we train our learned model using our dataset and experimentally demonstrate that \projectname significantly decreases the number of steps required to optimize multi-color holograms from $>1000$ to $70$ iteration steps without compromising image quality.

- **Summary**: We propose a new dataset and a novel approach to learning hand-object interaction priors for hand and articulated object pose estimation. We first collect a dataset using visual teleoperation, where the human operator can directly play within a physical simulator to manipulate the articulated objects. We record the data and obtain free and accurate annotations on object poses and contact information from the simulator. Our system only requires an iPhone to record human hand motion, which can be easily scaled up and largely lower the costs of data and annotation collection. With this data, we learn 3D interaction priors including a discriminator (in a GAN) capturing the distribution of how object parts are arranged, and a diffusion model which generates the contact regions on articulated objects, guiding the hand pose estimation. Such structural and contact priors can easily transfer to real-world data with barely any domain gap. By using our data and learned priors, our method significantly improves the performance on joint hand and articulated object poses estimation over the existing state-of-the-art methods. The project is available at https://zehaozhu.github.io/ContactArt/ .

- **Summary**: Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present TMR, a simple yet effective approach for text to 3D human motion retrieval. While previous work has only treated retrieval as a proxy evaluation metric, we tackle it as a standalone task. Our method extends the state-of-the-art text-to-motion synthesis model TEMOS, and incorporates a contrastive loss to better structure the cross-modal latent space. We show that maintaining the motion generation loss, along with the contrastive training, is crucial to obtain good performance. We introduce a benchmark for evaluation and provide an in-depth analysis by reporting results on several protocols. Our extensive experiments on the KIT-ML and HumanML3D datasets show that TMR outperforms the prior work by a significant margin, for example reducing the median rank from 54 to 19. Finally, we showcase the potential of our approach on moment retrieval. Our code and models are publicly available at https://mathis.petrovich.fr/tmr.

- **Summary**: We present Neural Fields for LiDAR (NFL), a method to optimise a neural field scene representation from LiDAR measurements, with the goal of synthesizing realistic LiDAR scans from novel viewpoints. NFL combines the rendering power of neural fields with a detailed, physically motivated model of the LiDAR sensing process, thus enabling it to accurately reproduce key sensor behaviors like beam divergence, secondary returns, and ray dropping. We evaluate NFL on synthetic and real LiDAR scans and show that it outperforms explicit reconstruct-then-simulate methods as well as other NeRF-style methods on LiDAR novel view synthesis task. Moreover, we show that the improved realism of the synthesized views narrows the domain gap to real scans and translates to better registration and semantic segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image models (T2I) offer a new level of flexibility by allowing users to guide the creative process through natural language. However, personalizing these models to align with user-provided visual concepts remains a challenging problem. The task of T2I personalization poses multiple hard challenges, such as maintaining high visual fidelity while allowing creative control, combining multiple personalized concepts in a single image, and keeping a small model size. We present Perfusion, a T2I personalization method that addresses these challenges using dynamic rank-1 updates to the underlying T2I model. Perfusion avoids overfitting by introducing a new mechanism that "locks" new concepts' cross-attention Keys to their superordinate category. Additionally, we develop a gated rank-1 approach that enables us to control the influence of a learned concept during inference time and to combine multiple concepts. This allows runtime-efficient balancing of visual-fidelity and textual-alignment with a single 100KB trained model, which is five orders of magnitude smaller than the current state of the art. Moreover, it can span different operating points across the Pareto front without additional training. Finally, we show that Perfusion outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Importantly, key-locking leads to novel results compared to traditional approaches, allowing to portray personalized object interactions in unprecedented ways, even in one-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Dataset Distillation aims to distill an entire dataset's knowledge into a few synthetic images. The idea is to synthesize a small number of synthetic data points that, when given to a learning algorithm as training data, result in a model approximating one trained on the original data. Despite recent progress in the field, existing dataset distillation methods fail to generalize to new architectures and scale to high-resolution datasets. To overcome the above issues, we propose to use the learned prior from pre-trained deep generative models to synthesize the distilled data. To achieve this, we present a new optimization algorithm that distills a large number of images into a few intermediate feature vectors in the generative model's latent space. Our method augments existing techniques, significantly improving cross-architecture generalization in all settings.

- **Summary**: The relatively hot temperature of the human body causes people to turn into long-wave infrared light sources. Since this emitted light has a larger wavelength than visible light, many surfaces in typical scenes act as infrared mirrors with strong specular reflections. We exploit the thermal reflections of a person onto objects in order to locate their position and reconstruct their pose, even if they are not visible to a normal camera. We propose an analysis-by-synthesis framework that jointly models the objects, people, and their thermal reflections, which allows us to combine generative models with differentiable rendering of reflections. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show our approach works in highly challenging cases, such as with curved mirrors or when the person is completely unseen by a normal camera.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing has significantly advanced water detection by applying semantic segmentation techniques to satellite imagery. However, semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the substantial amount of annotated data required. This is particularly problematic in wetland detection, where water extent varies over time and space, necessitating multiple annotations for the same area. In this paper, we present DeepAqua, a self-supervised deep learning model that leverages knowledge distillation to eliminate the need for manual annotations during the training phase. DeepAqua utilizes the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) as a teacher model to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for segmenting water from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To train the student model, we exploit cases where optical- and radar-based water masks coincide, enabling the detection of both open and vegetated water surfaces. Our model represents a significant advancement in computer vision techniques by effectively training semantic segmentation models without any manually annotated data. This approach offers a practical solution for monitoring wetland water extent changes without needing ground truth data, making it highly adaptable and scalable for wetland conservation efforts.

- **Summary**: The Dark Energy Survey is able to collect image data of an extremely large number of extragalactic objects, and it can be reasonably assumed that many unusual objects of high scientific interest are hidden inside these data. Due to the extreme size of DES data, identifying these objects among many millions of other celestial objects is a challenging task. The problem of outlier detection is further magnified by the presence of noisy or saturated images. When the number of tested objects is extremely high, even a small rate of noise or false positives leads to a very large number of false detections, making an automatic system impractical. This study applies an automatic method for automatic detection of outlier objects in the first data release of the Dark Energy Survey. By using machine learning-based outlier detection, the algorithm is able to identify objects that are visually different from the majority of the other objects in the database. An important feature of the algorithm is that it allows to control the false-positive rate, and therefore can be used for practical outlier detection. The algorithm does not provide perfect accuracy in the detection of outlier objects, but it reduces the data substantially to allow practical outlier detection. For instance, the selection of the top 250 objects after applying the algorithm to more than $2\cdot10^6$ DES images provides a collection of uncommon galaxies. Such collection would have been extremely time-consuming to compile by using manual inspection of the data.

- **Summary**: Accurate depth maps are essential in various applications, such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, point-cloud creation, etc. However, monocular-depth estimation (MDE) algorithms often fail to provide enough texture & sharpness, and also are inconsistent for homogeneous scenes. These algorithms mostly use CNN or vision transformer-based architectures requiring large datasets for supervised training. But, MDE algorithms trained on available depth datasets do not generalize well and hence fail to perform accurately in diverse real-world scenes. Moreover, the ground-truth depth maps are either lower resolution or sparse leading to relatively inconsistent depth maps. In general, acquiring a high-resolution ground truth dataset with pixel-level precision for accurate depth prediction is an expensive, and time-consuming challenge.   In this paper, we generate a high-resolution synthetic depth dataset (HRSD) of dimension 1920 X 1080 from Grand Theft Auto (GTA-V), which contains 100,000 color images and corresponding dense ground truth depth maps. The generated datasets are diverse and have scenes from indoors to outdoors, from homogeneous surfaces to textures. For experiments and analysis, we train the DPT algorithm, a state-of-the-art transformer-based MDE algorithm on the proposed synthetic dataset, which significantly increases the accuracy of depth maps on different scenes by 9 %. Since the synthetic datasets are of higher resolution, we propose adding a feature extraction module in the transformer encoder and incorporating an attention-based loss, further improving the accuracy by 15 %.

- **Summary**: Cross view action recognition (CVAR) seeks to recognize a human action when observed from a previously unseen viewpoint. This is a challenging problem since the appearance of an action changes significantly with the viewpoint. Applications of CVAR include surveillance and monitoring of assisted living facilities where is not practical or feasible to collect large amounts of training data when adding a new camera. We present a simple yet efficient CVAR framework to learn invariant features from either RGB videos, 3D skeleton data, or both. The proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art achieving similar levels of performance across input modalities: 99.4% (RGB) and 99.9% (3D skeletons), 99.4% (RGB) and 99.9% (3D Skeletons), 97.3% (RGB), and 99.2% (3D skeletons), and 84.4%(RGB) for the N-UCLA, NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and UWA3DII datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Light's ability to perform massive linear operations parallelly has recently inspired numerous demonstrations of optics-assisted artificial neural networks (ANN). However, a clear advantage of optics over purely digital ANN in a system-level has not yet been established. While linear operations can indeed be optically performed very efficiently, the lack of nonlinearity and signal regeneration require high-power, low-latency signal transduction between optics and electronics. Additionally, a large power is needed for the lasers and photodetectors, which are often neglected in the calculation of energy consumption. Here, instead of mapping traditional digital operations to optics, we co-optimized a hybrid optical-digital ANN, that operates on incoherent light, and thus amenable to operations under ambient light. Keeping the latency and power constant between purely digital ANN and hybrid optical-digital ANN, we identified a low-power/ latency regime, where an optical encoder provides higher classification accuracy than a purely digital ANN. However, in that regime, the overall classification accuracy is lower than what is achievable with higher power and latency. Our results indicate that optics can be advantageous over digital ANN in applications, where the overall performance of the ANN can be relaxed to prioritize lower power and latency.

In our paper, we build a connection between pseudo labelling and the Expectation Maximization algorithm which partially explains its empirical successes. We thereby realise that the original pseudo labelling is an empirical estimation of its underlying full formulation. Following this insight, we demonstrate the full generalisation of pseudo labels under Bayes' principle, called Bayesian Pseudo Labels. We then provide a variational approach to learn to approximate Bayesian Pseudo Labels, by learning a threshold to select good quality pseudo labels. In the rest of the paper, we demonstrate the applications of Pseudo Labelling and its generalisation Bayesian Psuedo Labelling in semi-supervised segmentation of medical images on: 1) 3D binary segmentation of lung vessels from CT volumes; 2) 2D multi class segmentation of brain tumours from MRI volumes; 3) 3D binary segmentation of brain tumours from MRI volumes. We also show that pseudo labels can enhance the robustness of the learnt representations.

- **Summary**: Despite recent successes with neural models for sign language translation (SLT), translation quality still lags behind spoken languages because of the data scarcity and modality gap between sign video and text. To address both problems, we investigate strategies for cross-modality representation sharing for SLT. We propose SLTUNET, a simple unified neural model designed to support multiple SLTrelated tasks jointly, such as sign-to-gloss, gloss-to-text and sign-to-text translation. Jointly modeling different tasks endows SLTUNET with the capability to explore the cross-task relatedness that could help narrow the modality gap. In addition, this allows us to leverage the knowledge from external resources, such as abundant parallel data used for spoken-language machine translation (MT). We show in experiments that SLTUNET achieves competitive and even state-of-the-art performance on PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily when augmented with MT data and equipped with a set of optimization techniques. We further use the DGS Corpus for end-to-end SLT for the first time. It covers broader domains with a significantly larger vocabulary, which is more challenging and which we consider to allow for a more realistic assessment of the current state of SLT than the former two. Still, SLTUNET obtains improved results on the DGS Corpus. Code is available at https://github.com/bzhangGo/sltunet.

- **Summary**: Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) is a task to find the image that most accurately depicts the correct sense of the target word for the given context. Previously, image-text matching models often suffered from recognizing polysemous words. This paper introduces an unsupervised VWSD approach that uses gloss information of an external lexical knowledge-base, especially the sense definitions. Specifically, we suggest employing Bayesian inference to incorporate the sense definitions when sense information of the answer is not provided. In addition, to ameliorate the out-of-dictionary (OOD) issue, we propose a context-aware definition generation with GPT-3. Experimental results show that the VWSD performance significantly increased with our Bayesian inference-based approach. In addition, our context-aware definition generation achieved prominent performance improvement in OOD examples exhibiting better performance than the existing definition generation method.

- **Summary**: Researchers typically investigate neural network representations by examining activation outputs for one or more layers of a network. Here, we investigate the potential for ReLU activation patterns (encoded as bit vectors) to aid in understanding and interpreting the behavior of neural networks. We utilize Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) to investigate the coherence of data within the embedding spaces of a deep neural network. From each layer of a network, we extract and utilize bit vectors to construct similarity scores between images. From these similarity scores, we build a similarity matrix for a collection of images drawn from 2 classes. We then apply Fiedler partitioning to the associated Laplacian matrix to separate the classes. Our results indicate, through bit vector representations, that the network continues to refine class detectability with the last ReLU layer achieving better than 95\% separation accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that bit vectors aid in adversarial image detection, again achieving over 95\% accuracy in separating adversarial and non-adversarial images using a simple classifier.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based approaches have produced models with good insect classification accuracy; Most of these models are conducive for application in controlled environmental conditions. One of the primary emphasis of researchers is to implement identification and classification models in the real agriculture fields, which is challenging because input images that are wildly out of the distribution (e.g., images like vehicles, animals, humans, or a blurred image of an insect or insect class that is not yet trained on) can produce an incorrect insect classification. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms provide an exciting avenue to overcome these challenge as it ensures that a model abstains from making incorrect classification prediction of non-insect and/or untrained insect class images. We generate and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art OOD algorithms on insect detection classifiers. These algorithms represent a diversity of methods for addressing an OOD problem. Specifically, we focus on extrusive algorithms, i.e., algorithms that wrap around a well-trained classifier without the need for additional co-training. We compared three OOD detection algorithms: (i) Maximum Softmax Probability, which uses the softmax value as a confidence score, (ii) Mahalanobis distance-based algorithm, which uses a generative classification approach; and (iii) Energy-Based algorithm that maps the input data to a scalar value, called energy. We performed an extensive series of evaluations of these OOD algorithms across three performance axes: (a) \textit{Base model accuracy}: How does the accuracy of the classifier impact OOD performance? (b) How does the \textit{level of dissimilarity to the domain} impact OOD performance? and (c) \textit{Data imbalance}: How sensitive is OOD performance to the imbalance in per-class sample size?

- **Summary**: Surface analysis of the cortex is ubiquitous in human neuroimaging with MRI, e.g., for cortical registration, parcellation, or thickness estimation. The convoluted cortical geometry requires isotropic scans (e.g., 1mm MPRAGEs) and good gray-white matter contrast for 3D reconstruction. This precludes the analysis of most brain MRI scans acquired for clinical purposes. Analyzing such scans would enable neuroimaging studies with sample sizes that cannot be achieved with current research datasets, particularly for underrepresented populations and rare diseases. Here we present the first method for cortical reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and thickness estimation for clinical brain MRI scans of any resolution and pulse sequence. The methods has a learning component and a classical optimization module. The former uses domain randomization to train a CNN that predicts an implicit representation of the white matter and pial surfaces (a signed distance function) at 1mm isotropic resolution, independently of the pulse sequence and resolution of the input. The latter uses geometry processing to place the surfaces while accurately satisfying topological and geometric constraints, thus enabling subsequent parcellation and thickness estimation with existing methods. We present results on 5mm axial FLAIR scans from ADNI and on a highly heterogeneous clinical dataset with 5,000 scans.

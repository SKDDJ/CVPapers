- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based synthetic computed tomography (sCT) simplifies radiation therapy treatment planning by eliminating the need for CT simulation and error-prone image registration, ultimately reducing patient radiation dose and setup uncertainty. We propose an MRI-to-CT transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model (MC-DDPM) to transform MRI into high-quality sCT to facilitate radiation treatment planning. MC-DDPM implements diffusion processes with a shifted-window transformer network to generate sCT from MRI. The proposed model consists of two processes: a forward process which adds Gaussian noise to real CT scans, and a reverse process in which a shifted-window transformer V-net (Swin-Vnet) denoises the noisy CT scans conditioned on the MRI from the same patient to produce noise-free CT scans. With an optimally trained Swin-Vnet, the reverse diffusion process was used to generate sCT scans matching MRI anatomy. We evaluated the proposed method by generating sCT from MRI on a brain dataset and a prostate dataset. Qualitative evaluation was performed using the mean absolute error (MAE) of Hounsfield unit (HU), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), multi-scale Structure Similarity index (MS-SSIM) and normalized cross correlation (NCC) indexes between ground truth CTs and sCTs. MC-DDPM generated brain sCTs with state-of-the-art quantitative results with MAE 43.317 HU, PSNR 27.046 dB, SSIM 0.965, and NCC 0.983. For the prostate dataset, MC-DDPM achieved MAE 59.953 HU, PSNR 26.920 dB, SSIM 0.849, and NCC 0.948. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a novel approach for generating CT images from routine MRIs using a transformer-based DDPM. This model effectively captures the complex relationship between CT and MRI images, allowing for robust and high-quality synthetic CT (sCT) images to be generated in minutes.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an unsupervised transformer-based framework for temporal activity segmentation which leverages not only frame-level cues but also segment-level cues. This is in contrast with previous methods which often rely on frame-level information only. Our approach begins with a frame-level prediction module which estimates framewise action classes via a transformer encoder. The frame-level prediction module is trained in an unsupervised manner via temporal optimal transport. To exploit segment-level information, we utilize a segment-level prediction module and a frame-to-segment alignment module. The former includes a transformer decoder for estimating video transcripts, while the latter matches frame-level features with segment-level features, yielding permutation-aware segmentation results. Moreover, inspired by temporal optimal transport, we introduce simple-yet-effective pseudo labels for unsupervised training of the above modules. Our experiments on four public datasets, i.e., 50 Salads, YouTube Instructions, Breakfast, and Desktop Assembly show that our approach achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in unsupervised activity segmentation.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel self-supervised temporal video alignment framework which is useful for several fine-grained human activity understanding applications. In contrast with the state-of-the-art method of CASA, where sequences of 3D skeleton coordinates are taken directly as input, our key idea is to use sequences of 2D skeleton heatmaps as input. Unlike CASA which performs self-attention in the temporal domain only, we feed 2D skeleton heatmaps to a video transformer which performs self-attention both in the spatial and temporal domains for extracting effective spatiotemporal and contextual features. In addition, we introduce simple heatmap augmentation techniques based on 2D skeletons for self-supervised learning. Despite the lack of 3D information, our approach achieves not only higher accuracy but also better robustness against missing and noisy keypoints than CASA. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on three public datasets, i.e., Penn Action, IKEA ASM, and H2O, demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in different fine-grained human activity understanding tasks. Finally, fusing 2D skeleton heatmaps with RGB videos yields the state-of-the-art on all metrics and datasets. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to utilize 2D skeleton heatmap inputs and the first to explore multi-modality fusion for temporal video alignment.

- **Summary**: Noisy-labels are challenging for deep learning due to the high capacity of the deep models that can overfit noisy-label training samples. Arguably the most realistic and coincidentally challenging type of label noise is the instance-dependent noise (IDN), where the labelling errors are caused by the ambivalent information present in the images. The most successful label noise learning techniques to address IDN problems usually contain a noisy-label sample selection stage to separate clean and noisy-label samples during training. Such sample selection depends on a criterion, such as loss or gradient, and on a curriculum to define the proportion of training samples to be classified as clean at each training epoch.   Even though the estimated noise rate from the training set appears to be a natural signal to be used in the definition of this curriculum, previous approaches generally rely on arbitrary thresholds or pre-defined selection functions to the best of our knowledge. This paper addresses this research gap by proposing a new noisy-label learning graphical model that can easily accommodate state-of-the-art (SOTA) noisy-label learning methods and provide them with a reliable noise rate estimate to be used in a new sample selection curriculum. We show empirically that our model integrated with many SOTA methods can improve their results in many IDN benchmarks, including synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: In computer vision, different basic blocks are created around different matrix operations, and models based on different basic blocks have achieved good results. Good results achieved in vision tasks grants them rationality. However, these experimental-based models also make deep learning long criticized for principle and interpretability. Deep learning originated from the concept of neurons in neuroscience, but recent designs detached natural neural networks except for some simple concepts. In this paper, we build an artificial neural network, CVSNet, which can be seen as a computer implementation for central visual system of the brain. Each block in CVSNet represents the same vision information as that in brains. In CVSNet, blocks differs from each other and visual information flows through three independent pathways and five different blocks. Thus CVSNet is completely different from the design of all previous models, in which basic blocks are repeated to build model and information between channels is mixed at the outset. In ablation experiment, we show the information extracted by blocks in CVSNet and compare with previous networks, proving effectiveness and rationality of blocks in CVSNet from experiment side. And in the experiment of object recognition, CVSNet achieves comparable results to ConvNets, Vision Transformers and MLPs.

- **Summary**: Deep sequence recognition (DSR) models receive increasing attention due to their superior application to various applications. Most DSR models use merely the target sequences as supervision without considering other related sequences, leading to over-confidence in their predictions. The DSR models trained with label smoothing regularize labels by equally and independently smoothing each token, reallocating a small value to other tokens for mitigating overconfidence. However, they do not consider tokens/sequences correlations that may provide more effective information to regularize training and thus lead to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we find tokens/sequences with high perception and semantic correlations with the target ones contain more correlated and effective information and thus facilitate more effective regularization. To this end, we propose a Perception and Semantic aware Sequence Regularization framework, which explore perceptively and semantically correlated tokens/sequences as regularization. Specifically, we introduce a semantic context-free recognition and a language model to acquire similar sequences with high perceptive similarities and semantic correlation, respectively. Moreover, over-confidence degree varies across samples according to their difficulties. Thus, we further design an adaptive calibration intensity module to compute a difficulty score for each samples to obtain finer-grained regularization. Extensive experiments on canonical sequence recognition tasks, including scene text and speech recognition, demonstrate that our method sets novel state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their variants have achieved remarkable success on natural images. However, their performance degrades when applied to remote sensing (RS) images, and the discriminator often suffers from the overfitting problem. In this paper, we examine the differences between natural and RS images and find that the intrinsic dimensions of RS images are much lower than those of natural images. As the discriminator is more susceptible to overfitting on data with lower intrinsic dimension, it focuses excessively on local characteristics of RS training data and disregards the overall structure of the distribution, leading to a faulty generation model. In respond, we propose a novel approach that leverages the real data manifold to constrain the discriminator and enhance the model performance. Specifically, we introduce a learnable information-theoretic measure to capture the real data manifold. Building upon this measure, we propose manifold alignment regularization, which mitigates the discriminator's overfitting and improves the quality of generated samples. Moreover, we establish a unified GAN framework for manifold alignment, applicable to both supervised and unsupervised RS image generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Change detection (CD) is an essential task for various real-world applications, such as urban management and disaster assessment. However, previous methods primarily focus on improving the accuracy of CD, while neglecting the reliability of detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel change detection network, called AR-CDNet, which is able to provide accurate change maps and generate pixel-wise uncertainty. Specifically, an online uncertainty estimation branch is constructed to model the pixel-wise uncertainty, which is supervised by the difference between predicted change maps and corresponding ground truth during the training process. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge review strategy to distill temporal change knowledge from low-level features to high-level ones, thereby enhancing the discriminability of temporal difference features. Finally, we aggregate the uncertainty-aware features extracted from the online uncertainty estimation branch with multi-level temporal difference features to improve the accuracy of CD. Once trained, our AR-CDNet can provide accurate change maps and evaluate pixel-wise uncertainty without ground truth. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AR-CDNet in the CD task. The demo code for our work will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/guanyuezhen/AR-CDNet}.

- **Summary**: Learning from noisy labels is an important and long-standing problem in machine learning for real applications. One of the main research lines focuses on learning a label corrector to purify potential noisy labels. However, these methods typically rely on strict assumptions and are limited to certain types of label noise. In this paper, we reformulate the label-noise problem from a generative-model perspective, $\textit{i.e.}$, labels are generated by gradually refining an initial random guess. This new perspective immediately enables existing powerful diffusion models to seamlessly learn the stochastic generative process. Once the generative uncertainty is modeled, we can perform classification inference using maximum likelihood estimation of labels. To mitigate the impact of noisy labels, we propose the $\textbf{L}$abel-$\textbf{R}$etrieval-$\textbf{A}$ugmented (LRA) diffusion model, which leverages neighbor consistency to effectively construct pseudo-clean labels for diffusion training. Our model is flexible and general, allowing easy incorporation of different types of conditional information, $\textit{e.g.}$, use of pre-trained models, to further boost model performance. Extensive experiments are conducted for evaluation. Our model achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all the standard real-world benchmark datasets. Remarkably, by incorporating conditional information from the powerful CLIP model, our method can boost the current SOTA accuracy by 10-20 absolute points in many cases.

- **Summary**: We develop a deep learning network to estimate the illumination spectrum of hyperspectral images under various lighting conditions. To this end, a dataset, IllumNet, was created. Images were captured using a Specim IQ camera under various illumination conditions, both indoor and outdoor. Outdoor images were captured in sunny, overcast, and shady conditions and at different times of the day. For indoor images, halogen and LED light sources were used, as well as mixed light sources, mainly halogen or LED and fluorescent. The ResNet18 network was employed in this study, but with the 2D kernel changed to a 3D kernel to suit the spectral nature of the data. As well as fitting the actual illumination spectrum well, the predicted illumination spectrum should also be smooth, and this is achieved by the cubic smoothing spline error cost function. Experimental results indicate that the trained model can infer an accurate estimate of the illumination spectrum.

- **Summary**: Handwriting recognition remains challenging for some of the most spoken languages, like Bangla, due to the complexity of line and word segmentation brought by the curvilinear nature of writing and lack of quality datasets. This paper solves the segmentation problem by introducing a state-of-the-art method (BN-DRISHTI) that combines a deep learning-based object detection framework (YOLO) with Hough and Affine transformation for skew correction. However, training deep learning models requires a massive amount of data. Thus, we also present an extended version of the BN-HTRd dataset comprising 786 full-page handwritten Bangla document images, line and word-level annotation for segmentation, and corresponding ground truths for word recognition. Evaluation on the test portion of our dataset resulted in an F-score of 99.97% for line and 98% for word segmentation. For comparative analysis, we used three external Bangla handwritten datasets, namely BanglaWriting, WBSUBNdb_text, and ICDAR 2013, where our system outperformed by a significant margin, further justifying the performance of our approach on completely unseen samples.

- **Summary**: Constructing a highly accurate handwritten OCR system requires large amounts of representative training data, which is both time-consuming and expensive to collect. To mitigate the issue, we propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate training samples. This model conditions on a printed glyph image and creates mappings between printed characters and handwritten images, thus enabling the generation of photo-realistic handwritten samples with diverse styles and unseen text contents. However, the text contents in synthetic images are not always consistent with the glyph conditional images, leading to unreliable labels of synthetic samples. To address this issue, we further propose a progressive data filtering strategy to add those samples with a high confidence of correctness to the training set. Experimental results on IAM benchmark task show that OCR model trained with augmented DDPM-synthesized training samples can achieve about 45% relative word error rate reduction compared with the one trained on real data only.

- **Summary**: Despite the progress in semantic image synthesis, it remains a challenging problem to generate photo-realistic parts from input semantic map. Integrating part segmentation map can undoubtedly benefit image synthesis, but is bothersome and inconvenient to be provided by users. To improve part synthesis, this paper presents to infer Parts from Object ShapE (iPOSE) and leverage it for improving semantic image synthesis. However, albeit several part segmentation datasets are available, part annotations are still not provided for many object categories in semantic image synthesis. To circumvent it, we resort to few-shot regime to learn a PartNet for predicting the object part map with the guidance of pre-defined support part maps. PartNet can be readily generalized to handle a new object category when a small number (e.g., 3) of support part maps for this category are provided. Furthermore, part semantic modulation is presented to incorporate both inferred part map and semantic map for image synthesis. Experiments show that our iPOSE not only generates objects with rich part details, but also enables to control the image synthesis flexibly. And our iPOSE performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/csyxwei/iPOSE.

- **Summary**: The aim of object-centric vision is to construct an explicit representation of the objects in a scene. This representation is obtained via a set of interchangeable modules called \emph{slots} or \emph{object files} that compete for local patches of an image. The competition has a weak inductive bias to preserve spatial continuity; consequently, one slot may claim patches scattered diffusely throughout the image. In contrast, the inductive bias of human vision is strong, to the degree that attention has classically been described with a spotlight metaphor. We incorporate a spatial-locality prior into state-of-the-art object-centric vision models and obtain significant improvements in segmenting objects in both synthetic and real-world datasets. Similar to human visual attention, the combination of image content and spatial constraints yield robust unsupervised object-centric learning, including less sensitivity to model hyperparameters.

- **Summary**: Talking face generation is the task of synthesizing a natural face synchronous to driving audio. Although much progress has been made in terms of visual quality, lip synchronization, and facial motion of the talking face, current works still struggle to overcome issues of crude and asynchronous lip movement, which can result in puppetry-like animation. We identify that the prior works commonly correlate lip movement with audio at the phone level. However, due to co-articulation, where an isolated phone is influenced by the preceding or following phones, the articulation of a phone varies upon the phonetic context. Therefore, modeling lip motion with the phonetic context can generate more spatio-temporally aligned and stable lip movement. In this respect, we investigate the phonetic context in lip motion for authentic talking face generation. We propose a Context-Aware Lip-Sync framework (CALS), which leverages phonetic context to generate more spatio-temporally aligned and stable lip movement. The CALS comprises an Audio-to-Lip module and a Lip-to-Face module. The former explicitly maps each phone to a contextualized lip motion unit, which guides the latter in synthesizing a target identity with context-aware lip motion. In addition, we introduce a discriminative sync critic that enforces accurate lip displacements within the phonetic context through audio-visual sync loss and visual discriminative sync loss. From extensive experiments on LRW, LRS2, and HDTF datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed CALS effectively enhances spatio-temporal alignment, greatly improving upon the state-of-the-art on visual quality, lip-sync quality, and realness. Finally, we show the authenticity of the generated video through a lip readability test and achieve 97.7% of relative word prediction accuracy to real videos.

- **Summary**: =One of the most frequently farmed crops is the tomato crop. Late blight is the most prevalent tomato disease in the world, and often causes a significant reduction in the production of tomato crops. The importance of tomatoes as an agricultural product necessitates early detection of late blight. It is produced by the fungus Phytophthora. The earliest signs of late blight on tomatoes are unevenly formed, water-soaked lesions on the leaves located on the plant canopy's younger leave White cottony growth may appear in humid environments evident on the undersides of the leaves that have been impacted. Lesions increase as the disease proceeds, turning the leaves brown to shrivel up and die. Using picture segmentation and the Multi-class SVM technique, late blight disorder is discovered in this work. Image segmentation is employed for separating damaged areas on leaves, and the Multi-class SVM method is used for reliable disease categorization. 30 reputable studies were chosen from a total of 2770 recognized papers. The primary goal of this study is to compile cutting-edge research that identifies current research trends, problems, and prospects for late blight detection. It also looks at current approaches for applying image processing to diagnose and detect late blight. A suggested taxonomy for late blight detection has also been provided. In the same way, a model for the development of the solutions to problems is also presented. Finally, the research gaps have been presented in terms of open issues for the provision of future directions in image processing for the researchers.

- **Summary**: We present a novel method for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from a large-scale, sparse, and noisy point cloud. Our approach builds upon the recently introduced Neural Kernel Fields (NKF) representation. It enjoys similar generalization capabilities to NKF, while simultaneously addressing its main limitations: (a) We can scale to large scenes through compactly supported kernel functions, which enable the use of memory-efficient sparse linear solvers. (b) We are robust to noise, through a gradient fitting solve. (c) We minimize training requirements, enabling us to learn from any dataset of dense oriented points, and even mix training data consisting of objects and scenes at different scales. Our method is capable of reconstructing millions of points in a few seconds, and handling very large scenes in an out-of-core fashion. We achieve state-of-the-art results on reconstruction benchmarks consisting of single objects, indoor scenes, and outdoor scenes.

- **Summary**: Vision and Language (VL) models offer an effective method for aligning representation spaces of images and text, leading to numerous applications such as cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, captioning, and more. However, the aligned image-text spaces learned by all the popular VL models are still suffering from the so-called `object bias' - their representations behave as `bags of nouns', mostly ignoring or downsizing the attributes, relations, and states of objects described/appearing in texts/images. Although some great attempts at fixing these `compositional reasoning' issues were proposed in the recent literature, the problem is still far from being solved. In this paper, we uncover two factors limiting the VL models' compositional reasoning performance. These two factors are properties of the paired VL dataset used for finetuning and pre-training the VL model: (i) the caption quality, or in other words `image-alignment', of the texts; and (ii) the `density' of the captions in the sense of mentioning all the details appearing on the image. We propose a fine-tuning approach for automatically treating these factors leveraging a standard VL dataset (CC3M). Applied to CLIP, we demonstrate its significant compositional reasoning performance increase of up to $\sim27\%$ over the base model, up to $\sim20\%$ over the strongest baseline, and by $6.7\%$ on average.

- **Summary**: Out of the estimated few trillion galaxies, only around a million have been detected through radio frequencies, and only a tiny fraction, approximately a thousand, have been manually classified. We have addressed this disparity between labeled and unlabeled images of radio galaxies by employing a semi-supervised learning approach to classify them into the known Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FRI) and Type II (FRII) categories. A Group Equivariant Convolutional Neural Network (G-CNN) was used as an encoder of the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods SimCLR (A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) and BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent). The G-CNN preserves the equivariance for the Euclidean Group E(2), enabling it to effectively learn the representation of globally oriented feature maps. After representation learning, we trained a fully-connected classifier and fine-tuned the trained encoder with labeled data. Our findings demonstrate that our semi-supervised approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across several metrics, including cluster quality, convergence rate, accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. Moreover, statistical significance testing via a t-test revealed that our method surpasses the performance of a fully supervised G-CNN. This study emphasizes the importance of semi-supervised learning in radio galaxy classification, where labeled data are still scarce, but the prospects for discovery are immense.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality, realistic images from given text prompts. However, previous methods fail to perform accurate modality alignment between text concepts and generated images due to the lack of fine-level semantic guidance that successfully diagnoses the modality discrepancy. In this paper, we propose FineRewards to improve the alignment between text and images in text-to-image diffusion models by introducing two new fine-grained semantic rewards: the caption reward and the Semantic Segment Anything (SAM) reward. From the global semantic view, the caption reward generates a corresponding detailed caption that depicts all important contents in the synthetic image via a BLIP-2 model and then calculates the reward score by measuring the similarity between the generated caption and the given prompt. From the local semantic view, the SAM reward segments the generated images into local parts with category labels, and scores the segmented parts by measuring the likelihood of each category appearing in the prompted scene via a large language model, i.e., Vicuna-7B. Additionally, we adopt an assemble reward-ranked learning strategy to enable the integration of multiple reward functions to jointly guide the model training. Adapting results of text-to-image models on the MS-COCO benchmark show that the proposed semantic reward outperforms other baseline reward functions with a considerable margin on both visual quality and semantic similarity with the input prompt. Moreover, by adopting the assemble reward-ranked learning strategy, we further demonstrate that model performance is further improved when adapting under the unifying of the proposed semantic reward with the current image rewards.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel Lip-to-Speech synthesis (L2S) framework, for synthesizing intelligible speech from a silent lip movement video. Specifically, to complement the insufficient supervisory signal of the previous L2S model, we propose to use quantized self-supervised speech representations, named speech units, as an additional prediction target for the L2S model. Therefore, the proposed L2S model is trained to generate multiple targets, mel-spectrogram and speech units. As the speech units are discrete while mel-spectrogram is continuous, the proposed multi-target L2S model can be trained with strong content supervision, without using text-labeled data. Moreover, to accurately convert the synthesized mel-spectrogram into a waveform, we introduce a multi-input vocoder that can generate a clear waveform even from blurry and noisy mel-spectrogram by referring to the speech units. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in L2S.

- **Summary**: Computed tomography (CT) scans offer a detailed, three-dimensional representation of patients' internal organs. However, conventional CT reconstruction techniques necessitate acquiring hundreds or thousands of x-ray projections through a complete rotational scan of the body, making navigation or positioning during surgery infeasible. In image-guided radiation therapy, a method that reconstructs ultra-sparse X-ray projections into CT images, we can exploit the substantially reduced radiation dose and minimize equipment burden for localization and navigation. In this study, we introduce a novel Transformer architecture, termed XTransCT, devised to facilitate real-time reconstruction of CT images from two-dimensional X-ray images. We assess our approach regarding image quality and structural reliability using a dataset of fifty patients, supplied by a hospital, as well as the larger public dataset LIDC-IDRI, which encompasses thousands of patients. Additionally, we validated our algorithm's generalizability on the LNDb dataset. Our findings indicate that our algorithm surpasses other methods in image quality, structural precision, and generalizability. Moreover, in comparison to previous 3D convolution-based approaches, we note a substantial speed increase of approximately 300 $\%$, achieving 44 ms per 3D image reconstruction. To guarantee the replicability of our results, we have made our code publicly available.

- **Summary**: Geometry and color information provided by the point clouds are both crucial for 3D scene understanding. Two pieces of information characterize the different aspects of point clouds, but existing methods lack an elaborate design for the discrimination and relevance. Hence we explore a 3D self-supervised paradigm that can better utilize the relations of point cloud information. Specifically, we propose a universal 3D scene pre-training framework via Geometry-Color Contrast (Point-GCC), which aligns geometry and color information using a Siamese network. To take care of actual application tasks, we design (i) hierarchical supervision with point-level contrast and reconstruct and object-level contrast based on the novel deep clustering module to close the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks; (ii) architecture-agnostic backbone to adapt for various downstream models. Benefiting from the object-level representation associated with downstream tasks, Point-GCC can directly evaluate model performance and the result demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods. Transfer learning results on a wide range of tasks also show consistent improvements across all datasets. e.g., new state-of-the-art object detection results on SUN RGB-D and S3DIS datasets. Codes will be released at https://github.com/Asterisci/Point-GCC.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel multi-modal transformer network for detecting actions in untrimmed videos. To enrich the action features, our transformer network utilizes a new multi-modal attention mechanism that computes the correlations between different spatial and motion modalities combinations. Exploring such correlations for actions has not been attempted previously. To use the motion and spatial modality more effectively, we suggest an algorithm that corrects the motion distortion caused by camera movement. Such motion distortion, common in untrimmed videos, severely reduces the expressive power of motion features such as optical flow fields. Our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two public benchmarks, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet. We also conducted comparative experiments on our new instructional activity dataset, including a large set of challenging classroom videos captured from elementary schools.

- **Summary**: U-Nets are a go-to, state-of-the-art neural architecture across numerous tasks for continuous signals on a square such as images and Partial Differential Equations (PDE), however their design and architecture is understudied. In this paper, we provide a framework for designing and analysing general U-Net architectures. We present theoretical results which characterise the role of the encoder and decoder in a U-Net, their high-resolution scaling limits and their conjugacy to ResNets via preconditioning. We propose Multi-ResNets, U-Nets with a simplified, wavelet-based encoder without learnable parameters. Further, we show how to design novel U-Net architectures which encode function constraints, natural bases, or the geometry of the data. In diffusion models, our framework enables us to identify that high-frequency information is dominated by noise exponentially faster, and show how U-Nets with average pooling exploit this. In our experiments, we demonstrate how Multi-ResNets achieve competitive and often superior performance compared to classical U-Nets in image segmentation, PDE surrogate modelling, and generative modelling with diffusion models. Our U-Net framework paves the way to study the theoretical properties of U-Nets and design natural, scalable neural architectures for a multitude of problems beyond the square.

- **Summary**: The introduction of diffusion models in anomaly detection has paved the way for more effective and accurate image reconstruction in pathologies. However, the current limitations in controlling noise granularity hinder diffusion models' ability to generalize across diverse anomaly types and compromise the restoration of healthy tissues. To overcome these challenges, we propose AutoDDPM, a novel approach that enhances the robustness of diffusion models. AutoDDPM utilizes diffusion models to generate initial likelihood maps of potential anomalies and seamlessly integrates them with the original image. Through joint noised distribution re-sampling, AutoDDPM achieves harmonization and in-painting effects. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of AutoDDPM in replacing anomalous regions while preserving healthy tissues, considerably surpassing diffusion models' limitations. It also contributes valuable insights and analysis on the limitations of current diffusion models, promoting robust and interpretable anomaly detection in medical imaging - an essential aspect of building autonomous clinical decision systems with higher interpretability.

- **Summary**: Cancer is one of the most life-threatening diseases worldwide, and head and neck (H&N) cancer is a prevalent type with hundreds of thousands of new cases recorded each year. Clinicians use medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography and positron emission tomography to detect the presence of a tumor, and they combine that information with clinical data for patient prognosis. The process is mostly challenging and time-consuming. Machine learning and deep learning can automate these tasks to help clinicians with highly promising results. This work studies two approaches for H&N tumor segmentation: (i) exploration and comparison of vision transformer (ViT)-based and convolutional neural network-based models; and (ii) proposal of a novel 2D perspective to working with 3D data. Furthermore, this work proposes two new architectures for the prognosis task. An ensemble of several models predicts patient outcomes (which won the HECKTOR 2021 challenge prognosis task), and a ViT-based framework concurrently performs patient outcome prediction and tumor segmentation, which outperforms the ensemble model.

- **Summary**: To increase the generalization capability of VQA systems, many recent studies have tried to de-bias spurious language or vision associations that shortcut the question or image to the answer. Despite these efforts, the literature fails to address the confounding effect of vision and language simultaneously. As a result, when they reduce bias learned from one modality, they usually increase bias from the other. In this paper, we first model a confounding effect that causes language and vision bias simultaneously, then propose a counterfactual inference to remove the influence of this effect. The model trained in this strategy can concurrently and efficiently reduce vision and language bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reduce biases resulting from confounding effects of vision and language in VQA, leveraging causal explain-away relations. We accompany our method with an explain-away strategy, pushing the accuracy of the questions with numerical answers results compared to existing methods that have been an open problem. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in VQA-CP v2 datasets.

- **Summary**: Spurious correlations are everywhere. While humans often do not perceive them, neural networks are notorious for learning unwanted associations, also known as biases, instead of the underlying decision rule. As a result, practitioners are often unaware of the biased decision-making of their classifiers. Such a biased model based on spurious correlations might not generalize to unobserved data, leading to unintended, adverse consequences. We propose Signal is Harder (SiH), a variational-autoencoder-based method that simultaneously trains a biased and unbiased classifier using a novel, disentangling reweighting scheme inspired by the focal loss. Using the unbiased classifier, SiH matches or improves upon the performance of state-of-the-art debiasing methods. To improve the interpretability of our technique, we propose a perturbation scheme in the latent space for visualizing the bias that helps practitioners become aware of the sources of spurious correlations.

- **Summary**: The third edition of the "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning" workshop featured four data-impaired challenges, focusing on addressing the limitations of data availability in training deep learning models for computer vision tasks. The challenges comprised of four distinct data-impaired tasks, where participants were required to train models from scratch using a reduced number of training samples. The primary objective was to encourage novel approaches that incorporate relevant inductive biases to enhance the data efficiency of deep learning models. To foster creativity and exploration, participants were strictly prohibited from utilizing pre-trained checkpoints and other transfer learning techniques. Significant advancements were made compared to the provided baselines, where winning solutions surpassed the baselines by a considerable margin in all four tasks. These achievements were primarily attributed to the effective utilization of extensive data augmentation policies, model ensembling techniques, and the implementation of data-efficient training methods, including self-supervised representation learning. This report highlights the key aspects of the challenges and their outcomes.

- **Summary**: Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a leading approach for generating high-dimensional data. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of these models exhibit a spontaneous symmetry breaking that divides the generative dynamics into two distinct phases: 1) A linear steady-state dynamics around a central fixed-point and 2) an attractor dynamics directed towards the data manifold. These two "phases" are separated by the change in stability of the central fixed-point, with the resulting window of instability being responsible for the diversity of the generated samples. Using both theoretical and empirical evidence, we show that an accurate simulation of the early dynamics does not significantly contribute to the final generation, since early fluctuations are reverted to the central fixed point. To leverage this insight, we propose a Gaussian late initialization scheme, which significantly improves model performance, achieving up to 3x FID improvements on fast samplers, while also increasing sample diversity (e.g., racial composition of generated CelebA images). Our work offers a new way to understand the generative dynamics of diffusion models that has the potential to bring about higher performance and less biased fast-samplers.

- **Summary**: Gait recognition is an emerging biological recognition technology that identifies and verifies individuals based on their walking patterns. However, many current methods are limited in their use of temporal information. In order to fully harness the potential of gait recognition, it is crucial to consider temporal features at various granularities and spans. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel framework named GaitGS, which aggregates temporal features in the granularity dimension and span dimension simultaneously. Specifically, Multi-Granularity Feature Extractor (MGFE) is proposed to focus on capturing the micro-motion and macro-motion information at the frame level and unit level respectively. Moreover, we present Multi-Span Feature Learning (MSFL) module to generate global and local temporal representations. On three popular gait datasets, extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our method achieves the Rank-1 accuracies of 92.9% (+0.5%), 52.0% (+1.4%), and 97.5% (+0.8%) on CASIA-B, GREW, and OU-MVLP respectively. The source code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot classification of image scenes which can recognize the image scenes that are not seen in the training stage holds great promise of lowering the dependence on large numbers of labeled samples. To address the zero-shot image scene classification, the cross-modal feature alignment methods have been proposed in recent years. These methods mainly focus on matching the visual features of each image scene with their corresponding semantic descriptors in the latent space. Less attention has been paid to the contrastive relationships between different image scenes and different semantic descriptors. In light of the challenge of large intra-class difference and inter-class similarity among image scenes and the potential noisy samples, these methods are susceptible to the influence of the instances which are far from these of the same classes and close to these of other classes. In this work, we propose a multi-level cross-modal feature alignment method via contrastive learning for zero-shot classification of remote sensing image scenes. While promoting the single-instance level positive alignment between each image scene with their corresponding semantic descriptors, the proposed method takes the cross-instance contrastive relationships into consideration,and learns to keep the visual and semantic features of different classes in the latent space apart from each other. Extensive experiments have been done to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our proposed method outperforms state of the art methods for zero-shot remote sensing image scene classification.

- **Summary**: The spiking neural network (SNN), as a promising brain-inspired computational model with binary spike information transmission mechanism, rich spatially-temporal dynamics, and event-driven characteristics, has received extensive attention. However, its intricately discontinuous spike mechanism brings difficulty to the optimization of the deep SNN. Since the surrogate gradient method can greatly mitigate the optimization difficulty and shows great potential in directly training deep SNNs, a variety of direct learning-based deep SNN works have been proposed and achieved satisfying progress in recent years. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these direct learning-based deep SNN works, mainly categorized into accuracy improvement methods, efficiency improvement methods, and temporal dynamics utilization methods. In addition, we also divide these categorizations into finer granularities further to better organize and introduce them. Finally, the challenges and trends that may be faced in future research are prospected.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have been demonstrated to achieve phenomenal success in many domains, and yet their inner mechanisms are not well understood. In this paper, we investigate the curvature of image manifolds, i.e., the manifold deviation from being flat in its principal directions. We find that state-of-the-art trained convolutional neural networks for image classification have a characteristic curvature profile along layers: an initial steep increase, followed by a long phase of a plateau, and followed by another increase. In contrast, this behavior does not appear in untrained networks in which the curvature flattens. We also show that the curvature gap between the last two layers has a strong correlation with the generalization capability of the network. Moreover, we find that the intrinsic dimension of latent codes is not necessarily indicative of curvature. Finally, we observe that common regularization methods such as mixup yield flatter representations when compared to other methods. Our experiments show consistent results over a variety of deep learning architectures and multiple data sets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/azencot-group/CRLM

- **Summary**: Refraction is a common physical phenomenon and has long been researched in computer vision. Objects imaged through a refractive object appear distorted in the image as a function of the shape of the interface between the media. This hinders many computer vision applications, but can be utilized for obtaining the geometry of the refractive interface. Previous approaches for refractive surface recovery largely relied on various priors or additional information like multiple images of the analyzed surface. In contrast, we claim that a simple energy function based on Snell's law enables the reconstruction of an arbitrary refractive surface geometry using just a single image and known background texture and geometry. In the case of a single point, Snell's law has two degrees of freedom, therefore to estimate a surface depth, we need additional information. We show that solving for an entire surface at once introduces implicit parameter-free spatial regularization and yields convincing results when an intelligent initial guess is provided. We demonstrate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments, where the reconstruction shows encouraging results in the single-frame monocular setting.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are widely known for their remarkable effectiveness across various tasks, with the consensus that deeper networks implicitly learn more complex data representations. This paper shows that sufficiently deep networks trained for supervised image classification split into two distinct parts that contribute to the resulting data representations differently. The initial layers create linearly-separable representations, while the subsequent layers, which we refer to as \textit{the tunnel}, compress these representations and have a minimal impact on the overall performance. We explore the tunnel's behavior through comprehensive empirical studies, highlighting that it emerges early in the training process. Its depth depends on the relation between the network's capacity and task complexity. Furthermore, we show that the tunnel degrades out-of-distribution generalization and discuss its implications for continual learning.

- **Summary**: This paper is to investigate the high-quality analytical reconstructions of multiple source-translation computed tomography (mSTCT) under an extended field of view (FOV). Under the larger FOVs, the previously proposed backprojection filtration (BPF) algorithms for mSTCT, including D-BPF and S-BPF (their differences are different derivate directions along the detector and source, respectively), make some errors and artifacts in the reconstructed images due to a backprojection weighting factor and the half-scan mode, which deviates from the intention of mSTCT imaging. In this paper, to achieve reconstruction with as little error as possible under the extremely extended FOV, we combine the full-scan mSTCT (F-mSTCT) geometry with the previous BPF algorithms to study the performance and derive a suitable redundancy-weighted function for F-mSTCT. The experimental results indicate FS-BPF can get high-quality, stable images under the extremely extended FOV of imaging a large object, though it requires more projections than FD-BPF. Finally, for different practical requirements in extending FOV imaging, we give suggestions on algorithm selection.

- **Summary**: In recent years, large convolutional neural networks have been widely used as tools for image deblurring, because of their ability in restoring images very precisely. It is well known that image deblurring is mathematically modeled as an ill-posed inverse problem and its solution is difficult to approximate when noise affects the data. Really, one limitation of neural networks for deblurring is their sensitivity to noise and other perturbations, which can lead to instability and produce poor reconstructions. In addition, networks do not necessarily take into account the numerical formulation of the underlying imaging problem, when trained end-to-end. In this paper, we propose some strategies to improve stability without losing to much accuracy to deblur images with deep-learning based methods. First, we suggest a very small neural architecture, which reduces the execution time for training, satisfying a green AI need, and does not extremely amplify noise in the computed image. Second, we introduce a unified framework where a pre-processing step balances the lack of stability of the following, neural network-based, step. Two different pre-processors are presented: the former implements a strong parameter-free denoiser, and the latter is a variational model-based regularized formulation of the latent imaging problem. This framework is also formally characterized by mathematical analysis. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the accuracy and stability of the proposed approaches for image deblurring when unknown or not-quantified noise is present; the results confirm that they improve the network stability with respect to noise. In particular, the model-based framework represents the most reliable trade-off between visual precision and robustness.

- **Summary**: When used by autonomous vehicles for trajectory planning or obstacle avoidance, depth estimation methods need to be reliable. Therefore, estimating the quality of the depth outputs is critical. In this paper, we show how M4Depth, a state-of-the-art depth estimation method designed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, can be enhanced to perform joint depth and uncertainty estimation. For that, we present a solution to convert the uncertainty estimates related to parallax generated by M4Depth into uncertainty estimates related to depth, and show that it outperforms the standard probabilistic approach. Our experiments on various public datasets demonstrate that our method performs consistently, even in zero-shot transfer. Besides, our method offers a compelling value when compared to existing multi-view depth estimation methods as it performs similarly on a multi-view depth estimation benchmark despite being 2.5 times faster and causal, as opposed to other methods. The code of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/michael-fonder/M4DepthU .

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful technique for learning robust representations from unlabeled data. By learning to remain invariant to applied data augmentations, methods such as SimCLR and MoCo are able to reach quality on par with supervised approaches. However, this invariance may be harmful to solving some downstream tasks which depend on traits affected by augmentations used during pretraining, such as color. In this paper, we propose to foster sensitivity to such characteristics in the representation space by modifying the projector network, a common component of self-supervised architectures. Specifically, we supplement the projector with information about augmentations applied to images. In order for the projector to take advantage of this auxiliary guidance when solving the SSL task, the feature extractor learns to preserve the augmentation information in its representations. Our approach, coined Conditional Augmentation-aware Selfsupervised Learning (CASSLE), is directly applicable to typical joint-embedding SSL methods regardless of their objective functions. Moreover, it does not require major changes in the network architecture or prior knowledge of downstream tasks. In addition to an analysis of sensitivity towards different data augmentations, we conduct a series of experiments, which show that CASSLE improves over various SSL methods, reaching state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of large areas from very high spatial-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery remains a challenging issue in image analysis. Existing supervised and unsupervised methods both suffer from the large variance of object sizes and the difficulty in scale selection, which often result in poor segmentation accuracies. To address the above challenges, we propose a deep learning-based region-merging method (DeepMerge) to handle the segmentation in large VHR images by integrating a Transformer with a multi-level embedding module, a segment-based feature embedding module and a region-adjacency graph model. In addition, we propose a modified binary tree sampling method to generate multi-level inputs from initial segmentation results, serving as inputs for the DeepMerge model. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is the first to use deep learning to learn the similarity between adjacent segments for region-merging. The proposed DeepMerge method is validated using a remote sensing image of 0.55m resolution covering an area of 5,660 km^2 acquired from Google Earth. The experimental results show that the proposed DeepMerge with the highest F value (0.9446) and the lowest TE (0.0962) and ED2 (0.8989) is able to correctly segment objects of different sizes and outperforms all selected competing segmentation methods from both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

- **Summary**: Recently, a new line of works has emerged to understand and improve self-attention in Transformers by treating it as a kernel machine. However, existing works apply the methods for symmetric kernels to the asymmetric self-attention, resulting in a nontrivial gap between the analytical understanding and numerical implementation. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to represent and optimize self-attention through asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD), which is also motivated by the low-rank property of self-attention normally observed in deep layers. Through asymmetric KSVD, $i$) a primal-dual representation of self-attention is formulated, where the optimization objective is cast to maximize the projection variances in the attention outputs; $ii$) a novel attention mechanism, i.e., Primal-Attention, is proposed via the primal representation of KSVD, avoiding explicit computation of the kernel matrix in the dual; $iii$) with KKT conditions, we prove that the stationary solution to the KSVD optimization in Primal-Attention yields a zero-value objective. In this manner, KSVD optimization can be implemented by simply minimizing a regularization loss, so that low-rank property is promoted without extra decomposition. Numerical experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our Primal-Attention with improved efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical self-attention, further verifying the great potential of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric kernel in self-attention and successfully applies it to modeling and optimization.

- **Summary**: Diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers have shown impressive performance, but are limited in speed, mostly as they require reverse diffusion sampling starting from noise. Several recent works have tried to alleviate this problem by building a diffusion process, directly bridging the clean and the corrupted for specific inverse problems. In this paper, we first unify these existing works under the name Direct Diffusion Bridges (DDB), showing that while motivated by different theories, the resulting algorithms only differ in the choice of parameters. Then, we highlight a critical limitation of the current DDB framework, namely that it does not ensure data consistency. To address this problem, we propose a modified inference procedure that imposes data consistency without the need for fine-tuning. We term the resulting method data Consistent DDB (CDDB), which outperforms its inconsistent counterpart in terms of both perception and distortion metrics, thereby effectively pushing the Pareto-frontier toward the optimum. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on both evaluation criteria, showcasing its superiority over existing methods.

- **Summary**: In the past decade, deep neural networks have achieved significant progress in point cloud learning. However, collecting large-scale precisely-annotated training data is extremely laborious and expensive, which hinders the scalability of existing point cloud datasets and poses a bottleneck for efficient exploration of point cloud data in various tasks and applications. Label-efficient learning offers a promising solution by enabling effective deep network training with much-reduced annotation efforts. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of label-efficient learning of point clouds. We address three critical questions in this emerging research field: i) the importance and urgency of label-efficient learning in point cloud processing, ii) the subfields it encompasses, and iii) the progress achieved in this area. To achieve this, we propose a taxonomy that organizes label-efficient learning methods based on the data prerequisites provided by different types of labels. We categorize four typical label-efficient learning approaches that significantly reduce point cloud annotation efforts: data augmentation, domain transfer learning, weakly-supervised learning, and pretrained foundation models. For each approach, we outline the problem setup and provide an extensive literature review that showcases relevant progress and challenges. Finally, we share insights into current research challenges and potential future directions. A project associated with this survey has been built at \url{https://github.com/xiaoaoran/3D_label_efficient_learning}.

- **Summary**: Multilingual image captioning has recently been tackled by training with large-scale machine translated data, which is an expensive, noisy, and time-consuming process. Without requiring any multilingual caption data, we propose LMCap, an image-blind few-shot multilingual captioning model that works by prompting a language model with retrieved captions. Specifically, instead of following the standard encoder-decoder paradigm, given an image, LMCap first retrieves the captions of similar images using a multilingual CLIP encoder. These captions are then combined into a prompt for an XGLM decoder, in order to generate captions in the desired language. In other words, the generation model does not directly process the image, instead processing retrieved captions. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset of geographically diverse images show that our model is competitive with fully-supervised multilingual captioning models, without requiring any supervised training on any captioning data.

- **Summary**: Artificial neural networks are prone to being fooled by carefully perturbed inputs which cause an egregious misclassification. These \textit{adversarial} attacks have been the focus of extensive research. Likewise, there has been an abundance of research in ways to detect and defend against them. We introduce a novel approach of detection and interpretation of adversarial attacks from a graph perspective. For an image, benign or adversarial, we study how a neural network's architecture can induce an associated graph. We study this graph and introduce specific measures used to predict and interpret adversarial attacks. We show that graphs-based approaches help to investigate the inner workings of adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: Multi-output deep neural networks(MONs) contain multiple task branches, and these tasks usually share partial network filters that lead to the entanglement of different task inference routes. Due to the inconsistent optimization objectives, the task gradients used for training MONs will interfere with each other on the shared routes, which will decrease the overall model performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient de-conflict algorithm named DR-MGF(Dynamic Routes and Meta-weighted Gradient Fusion) in this work. Different from existing de-conflict methods, DR-MGF achieves gradient de-conflict in MONs by learning task-preferred inference routes. The proposed method is motivated by our experimental findings: the shared filters are not equally important to different tasks. By designing the learnable task-specific importance variables, DR-MGF evaluates the importance of filters for different tasks. Through making the dominances of tasks over filters be proportional to the task-specific importance of filters, DR-MGF can effectively reduce the inter-task interference. The task-specific importance variables ultimately determine task-preferred inference routes at the end of training iterations. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR, ImageNet, and NYUv2 illustrate that DR-MGF outperforms the existing de-conflict methods both in prediction accuracy and convergence speed of MONs. Furthermore, DR-MGF can be extended to general MONs without modifying the overall network structures.

- **Summary**: Full-reference image quality metrics (FR-IQMs) aim to measure the visual differences between a pair of reference and distorted images, with the goal of accurately predicting human judgments. However, existing FR-IQMs, including traditional ones like PSNR and SSIM and even perceptual ones such as HDR-VDP, LPIPS, and DISTS, still fall short in capturing the complexities and nuances of human perception. In this work, rather than devising a novel IQM model, we seek to improve upon the perceptual quality of existing FR-IQM methods. We achieve this by considering visual masking, an important characteristic of the human visual system that changes its sensitivity to distortions as a function of local image content. Specifically, for a given FR-IQM metric, we propose to predict a visual masking model that modulates reference and distorted images in a way that penalizes the visual errors based on their visibility. Since the ground truth visual masks are difficult to obtain, we demonstrate how they can be derived in a self-supervised manner solely based on mean opinion scores (MOS) collected from an FR-IQM dataset. Our approach results in enhanced FR-IQM metrics that are more in line with human prediction both visually and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Modern consumer cameras usually employ the rolling shutter (RS) mechanism, where images are captured by scanning scenes row-by-row, yielding RS distortions for dynamic scenes. To correct RS distortions, existing methods adopt a fully supervised learning manner, where high framerate global shutter (GS) images should be collected as ground-truth supervision. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised learning framework for Dual reversed RS distortions Correction (SelfDRSC), where a DRSC network can be learned to generate a high framerate GS video only based on dual RS images with reversed distortions. In particular, a bidirectional distortion warping module is proposed for reconstructing dual reversed RS images, and then a self-supervised loss can be deployed to train DRSC network by enhancing the cycle consistency between input and reconstructed dual reversed RS images. Besides start and end RS scanning time, GS images at arbitrary intermediate scanning time can also be supervised in SelfDRSC, thus enabling the learned DRSC network to generate a high framerate GS video. Moreover, a simple yet effective self-distillation strategy is introduced in self-supervised loss for mitigating boundary artifacts in generated GS images. On synthetic dataset, SelfDRSC achieves better or comparable quantitative metrics in comparison to state-of-the-art methods trained in the full supervision manner. On real-world RS cases, our SelfDRSC can produce high framerate GS videos with finer correction textures and better temporary consistency. The source code and trained models are made publicly available at https://github.com/shangwei5/SelfDRSC.

- **Summary**: It can be challenging to identify brain MRI anomalies using supervised deep-learning techniques due to anatomical heterogeneity and the requirement for pixel-level labeling. Unsupervised anomaly detection approaches provide an alternative solution by relying only on sample-level labels of healthy brains to generate a desired representation to identify abnormalities at the pixel level. Although, generative models are crucial for generating such anatomically consistent representations of healthy brains, accurately generating the intricate anatomy of the human brain remains a challenge. In this study, we present a method called masked-DDPM (mDPPM), which introduces masking-based regularization to reframe the generation task of diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and Masked Frequency Modeling (MFM) in our self-supervised approach that enables models to learn visual representations from unlabeled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply MFM in DPPM models for medical applications. We evaluate our approach on datasets containing tumors and numerous sclerosis lesions and exhibit the superior performance of our unsupervised method as compared to the existing fully/weakly supervised baselines.

- **Summary**: Class-incremental semantic image segmentation assumes multiple model updates, each enriching the model to segment new categories. This is typically carried out by providing expensive pixel-level annotations to the training algorithm for all new objects, limiting the adoption of such methods in practical applications. Approaches that solely require image-level labels offer an attractive alternative, yet, such coarse annotations lack precise information about the location and boundary of the new objects. In this paper we argue that, since classes represent not just indices but semantic entities, the conceptual relationships between them can provide valuable information that should be leveraged. We propose a weakly supervised approach that exploits such semantic relations to transfer objectness prior from the previously learned classes into the new ones, complementing the supervisory signal from image-level labels. We validate our approach on a number of continual learning tasks, and show how even a simple pairwise interaction between classes can significantly improve the segmentation mask quality of both old and new classes. We show these conclusions still hold for longer and, hence, more realistic sequences of tasks and for a challenging few-shot scenario.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of data presents a critical obstacle to the efficacy of medical visionlanguage pre-training (VLP). A potential solution lies in the combination of datasets from various language communities. Nevertheless, the main challenge stems from the complexity of integrating diverse syntax and semantics, language-specific medical terminology, and culture-specific implicit knowledge. Therefore, one crucial aspect to consider is the presence of community bias caused by different languages. This paper presents a novel framework named Unifying Cross-Lingual Medical Vision-Language Pre-Training (Med-UniC), designed to integrate multimodal medical data from the two most prevalent languages, English and Spanish. Specifically, we propose Cross-lingual Text Alignment Regularization (CTR) to explicitly unify cross-lingual semantic representations of medical reports originating from diverse language communities. CTR is optimized through latent language disentanglement, rendering our optimization objective to not depend on negative samples, thereby significantly mitigating the bias from determining positive-negative sample pairs within analogous medical reports. Furthermore, it ensures that the cross-lingual representation is not biased toward any specific language community. Med-UniC reaches superior performance across 5 medical image tasks and 10 datasets encompassing over 30 diseases, offering a versatile framework for unifying multi-modal medical data within diverse linguistic communities. The experimental outcomes highlight the presence of community bias in cross-lingual VLP. Reducing this bias enhances the performance not only in vision-language tasks but also in uni-modal visual tasks.

- **Summary**: Surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, human monitoring systems, and video retrieval are just few of the many applications in which 3D Convolutional Neural Networks are exploited. However, their extensive use is restricted by their high computational and memory requirements, especially when integrated into systems with limited resources. This study proposes a toolflow that optimises the mapping of 3D CNN models for Human Action Recognition onto FPGA devices, taking into account FPGA resources and off-chip memory characteristics. The proposed system employs Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) graphs to model the designs and introduces transformations to expand and explore the design space, resulting in high-throughput designs. A variety of 3D CNN models were evaluated using the proposed toolflow on multiple FPGA devices, demonstrating its potential to deliver competitive performance compared to earlier hand-tuned and model-specific designs.

- **Summary**: The value of luxury goods, particularly investment-grade gemstones, is greatly influenced by their origin and authenticity, sometimes resulting in differences worth millions of dollars. Traditionally, human experts have determined the origin and detected treatments on gemstones through visual inspections and a range of analytical methods. However, the interpretation of the data can be subjective and time-consuming, resulting in inconsistencies. In this study, we propose Gemtelligence, a novel approach based on deep learning that enables accurate and consistent origin determination and treatment detection. Gemtelligence comprises convolutional and attention-based neural networks that process heterogeneous data types collected by multiple instruments. Notably, the algorithm demonstrated comparable predictive performance to expensive laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis and visual examination by human experts, despite using input data from relatively inexpensive analytical methods. Our innovative methodology represents a major breakthrough in the field of gemstone analysis by significantly improving the automation and robustness of the entire analytical process pipeline.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing deformable tissues from endoscopic stereo videos in robotic surgery is crucial for various clinical applications. However, existing methods relying only on implicit representations are computationally expensive and require dozens of hours, which limits further practical applications. To address this challenge, we introduce LerPlane, a novel method for fast and accurate reconstruction of surgical scenes under a single-viewpoint setting. LerPlane treats surgical procedures as 4D volumes and factorizes them into explicit 2D planes of static and dynamic fields, leading to a compact memory footprint and significantly accelerated optimization. The efficient factorization is accomplished by fusing features obtained through linear interpolation of each plane and enables using lightweight neural networks to model surgical scenes. Besides, LerPlane shares static fields, significantly reducing the workload of dynamic tissue modeling. We also propose a novel sample scheme to boost optimization and improve performance in regions with tool occlusion and large motions. Experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos demonstrate that LerPlane accelerates optimization by over 100$\times$ while maintaining high quality across various non-rigid deformations, showing significant promise for future intraoperative surgery applications.

- **Summary**: Musculoskeletal diseases such as sarcopenia and osteoporosis are major obstacles to health during aging. Although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT) can be used to evaluate musculoskeletal conditions, frequent monitoring is difficult due to the cost and accessibility (as well as high radiation exposure in the case of CT). We propose a method (named MSKdeX) to estimate fine-grained muscle properties from a plain X-ray image, a low-cost, low-radiation, and highly accessible imaging modality, through musculoskeletal decomposition leveraging fine-grained segmentation in CT. We train a multi-channel quantitative image translation model to decompose an X-ray image into projections of CT of individual muscles to infer the lean muscle mass and muscle volume. We propose the object-wise intensity-sum loss, a simple yet surprisingly effective metric invariant to muscle deformation and projection direction, utilizing information in CT and X-ray images collected from the same patient. While our method is basically an unpaired image-to-image translation, we also exploit the nature of the bone's rigidity, which provides the paired data through 2D-3D rigid registration, adding strong pixel-wise supervision in unpaired training. Through the evaluation using a 539-patient dataset, we showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed conventional methods. The average Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and CT-derived ground truth metrics was increased from 0.460 to 0.863. We believe our method opened up a new musculoskeletal diagnosis method and has the potential to be extended to broader applications in multi-channel quantitative image translation tasks. Our source code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Image-language learning has made unprecedented progress in visual understanding. These developments have come at high costs, as contemporary vision-language models require large model scales and amounts of data. We here propose a much easier recipe for image-language learning, which produces effective models, outperforming bigger and more expensive ones, often trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our key finding is the joint learning of a compact vision and language representation, which adaptively and iteratively fuses the multi-modal features. This results in a more effective image-language learning, greatly lowering the FLOPs by combining and reducing the number of tokens for both text and images, e.g. a 33\% reduction in FLOPs is achieved, compared to baseline fusion techniques used by popular image-language models, while improving performance. This also allows the model to scale without a large increase in FLOPs or memory. In addition, we propose adaptive pre-training data sampling which improves the data efficiency. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance compared to much larger models, and does so with significantly less data and FLOPs. With only 40M training examples and with 39 GFLOPs our lightweight model outperforms many times larger state-of-the-art models of 2-20x more FLOPs and using bigger datasets some of which with close to 1B training examples.

- **Summary**: Dialogue participants may have varying levels of knowledge about the topic under discussion. In such cases, it is essential for speakers to adapt their utterances by taking their audience into account. Yet, it is an open question how such adaptation can be modelled in computational agents. In this paper, we model a visually grounded referential game between a knowledgeable speaker and a listener with more limited visual and linguistic experience. Inspired by psycholinguistic theories, we endow our speaker with the ability to adapt its referring expressions via a simulation module that monitors the effectiveness of planned utterances from the listener's perspective. We propose an adaptation mechanism building on plug-and-play approaches to controlled language generation, where utterance generation is steered on the fly by the simulator without finetuning the speaker's underlying language model. Our results and analyses show that our approach is effective: the speaker's utterances become closer to the listener's domain of expertise, which leads to higher communicative success.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer among women, with over 1.5 million women being diagnosed each year. Unfortunately, the survival rates for breast cancer patients in certain third-world countries, like South Africa, are alarmingly low, with only 40% of diagnosed patients surviving beyond five years. The inadequate availability of resources, including qualified pathologists, delayed diagnoses, and ineffective therapy planning, contribute to this low survival rate. To address this pressing issue, medical specialists and researchers have turned to domain-specific AI approaches, specifically deep learning models, to develop end-to-end solutions that can be integrated into computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. By improving the workflow of pathologists, these AI models have the potential to enhance the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This research focuses on evaluating the performance of various cutting-edge convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures in comparison to a relatively new model called the Vision Trans-former (ViT). The objective is to determine the superiority of these models in terms of their accuracy and effectiveness. The experimental results reveal that the ViT models outperform the other selected state-of-the-art CNN architectures, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 95.15%. This study signifies a significant advancement in the field, as it explores the utilization of data augmentation and other relevant preprocessing techniques in conjunction with deep learning models for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer using datasets of Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification.

- **Summary**: Early diagnosis of prostate cancer significantly improves a patient's 5-year survival rate. Biopsy of small prostate cancers is improved with image-guided biopsy. MRI-ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy is sensitive to smaller tumors but is underutilized due to the high cost of MRI and fusion equipment. Micro-ultrasound (micro-US), a novel high-resolution ultrasound technology, provides a cost-effective alternative to MRI while delivering comparable diagnostic accuracy. However, the interpretation of micro-US is challenging due to subtle gray scale changes indicating cancer vs normal tissue. This challenge can be addressed by training urologists with a large dataset of micro-US images containing the ground truth cancer outlines. Such a dataset can be mapped from surgical specimens (histopathology) onto micro-US images via image registration. In this paper, we present a semi-automated pipeline for registering in vivo micro-US images with ex vivo whole-mount histopathology images. Our pipeline begins with the reconstruction of pseudo-whole-mount histopathology images and a 3-dimensional (3D) micro-US volume. Each pseudo-whole-mount histopathology image is then registered with the corresponding axial micro-US slice using a two-stage approach that estimates an affine transformation followed by a deformable transformation. We evaluated our registration pipeline using micro-US and histopathology images from 18 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. The results showed a Dice coefficient of 0.94 and a landmark error of 2.7 mm, indicating the accuracy of our registration pipeline. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately aligning micro-US and histopathology images. To promote transparency and collaboration in research, we will make our code and dataset publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing efficient training and fast sampling approaches for diffusion models. A recent remarkable advancement is the use of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to describe data perturbation and generative modeling in a unified mathematical framework. In this paper, we reveal several intriguing geometric structures of diffusion models and contribute a simple yet powerful interpretation to their sampling dynamics. Through carefully inspecting a popular variance-exploding SDE and its marginal-preserving ordinary differential equation (ODE) for sampling, we discover that the data distribution and the noise distribution are smoothly connected with an explicit, quasi-linear sampling trajectory, and another implicit denoising trajectory, which even converges faster in terms of visual quality. We also establish a theoretical relationship between the optimal ODE-based sampling and the classic mean-shift (mode-seeking) algorithm, with which we can characterize the asymptotic behavior of diffusion models and identify the score deviation. These new geometric observations enable us to improve previous sampling algorithms, re-examine latent interpolation, as well as re-explain the working principles of distillation-based fast sampling techniques.

- **Summary**: Although recent years have witnessed the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image segmentation, the domain shift issue caused by the highly variable image quality of medical images hinders the deployment of CNNs in real-world clinical applications. Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to address this issue by training a robust model on the source domain, which has a strong generalization ability. Previously, many DG methods based on feature-space domain randomization have been proposed, which, however, suffer from the limited and unordered search space of feature styles. In this paper, we propose a multi-source DG method called Treasure in Distribution (TriD), which constructs an unprecedented search space to obtain the model with strong robustness by randomly sampling from a uniform distribution. To learn the domain-invariant representations explicitly, we further devise a style-mixing strategy in our TriD, which mixes the feature styles by randomly mixing the augmented and original statistics along the channel wise and can be extended to other DG methods. Extensive experiments on two medical segmentation tasks with different modalities demonstrate that our TriD achieves superior generalization performance on unseen target-domain data. Code is available at https://github.com/Chen-Ziyang/TriD.

- **Summary**: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel 29-MHz ultrasound technique that provides 3-4 times higher resolution than traditional ultrasound, delivering comparable accuracy for diagnosing prostate cancer to MRI but at a lower cost. Accurate prostate segmentation is crucial for prostate volume measurement, cancer diagnosis, prostate biopsy, and treatment planning. However, prostate segmentation on microUS is challenging due to artifacts and indistinct borders between the prostate, bladder, and urethra in the midline. This paper presents MicroSegNet, a multi-scale annotation-guided transformer UNet model designed specifically to tackle these challenges. During the training process, MicroSegNet focuses more on regions that are hard to segment (hard regions), characterized by discrepancies between expert and non-expert annotations. We achieve this by proposing an annotation-guided binary cross entropy (AG-BCE) loss that assigns a larger weight to prediction errors in hard regions and a lower weight to prediction errors in easy regions. The AG-BCE loss was seamlessly integrated into the training process through the utilization of multi-scale deep supervision, enabling MicroSegNet to capture global contextual dependencies and local information at various scales. We trained our model using micro-US images from 55 patients, followed by evaluation on 20 patients. Our MicroSegNet model achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.942 and a Hausdorff distance of 2.11 mm, outperforming several state-of-the-art segmentation methods, as well as three human annotators with different experience levels. We will make our code and dataset publicly available to promote transparency and collaboration in research.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: End-to-end text spotting aims to integrate scene text detection and recognition into a unified framework. Dealing with the relationship between the two sub-tasks plays a pivotal role in designing effective spotters. Although Transformer-based methods eliminate the heuristic post-processing, they still suffer from the synergy issue between the sub-tasks and low training efficiency. In this paper, we present DeepSolo, a simple DETR-like baseline that lets a single decoder with explicit points solo for text detection and recognition simultaneously and efficiently. Technically, for each text instance, we represent the character sequence as ordered points and model them with learnable explicit point queries. After passing a single decoder, the point queries have encoded requisite text semantics and locations. Furthermore, we show the surprisingly good extensibility of our method, in terms of character class, language type, and task. On the one hand, DeepSolo not only performs well in English scenes but also masters the Chinese transcription with complex font structure and a thousand-level character classes. On the other hand, based on the extensibility of DeepSolo, we launch DeepSolo++ for multilingual text spotting, making a further step to let Transformer decoder with explicit points solo for multilingual text detection, recognition, and script identification all at once. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that our simple approach achieves better training efficiency compared with Transformer-based models and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. In addition, DeepSolo and DeepSolo++ are also compatible with line annotations, which require much less annotation cost than polygons.

- **Summary**: Face recognition systems have significantly advanced in recent years, driven by the availability of large-scale datasets. However, several issues have recently came up, including privacy concerns that have led to the discontinuation of well-established public datasets. Synthetic datasets have emerged as a solution, even though current synthesis methods present other drawbacks such as limited intra-class variations, lack of realism, and unfair representation of demographic groups. This study introduces GANDiffFace, a novel framework for the generation of synthetic datasets for face recognition that combines the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models to overcome the limitations of existing synthetic datasets. In GANDiffFace, we first propose the use of GANs to synthesize highly realistic identities and meet target demographic distributions. Subsequently, we fine-tune Diffusion models with the images generated with GANs, synthesizing multiple images of the same identity with a variety of accessories, poses, expressions, and contexts. We generate multiple synthetic datasets by changing GANDiffFace settings, and compare their mated and non-mated score distributions with the distributions provided by popular real-world datasets for face recognition, i.e. VGG2 and IJB-C. Our results show the feasibility of the proposed GANDiffFace, in particular the use of Diffusion models to enhance the (limited) intra-class variations provided by GANs towards the level of real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent learning-based approaches have achieved significant progress in light field (LF) image super-resolution (SR) by exploring convolution-based or transformer-based network structures. However, LF imaging has many intrinsic physical priors that have not been fully exploited. In this paper, we analyze the coordinate transformation of the LF imaging process to reveal the geometric relationship in the LF images. Based on such geometric priors, we introduce a new LF subspace of virtual-slit images (VSI) that provide sub-pixel information complementary to sub-aperture images. To leverage the abundant correlation across the four-dimensional data with manageable complexity, we propose learning ensemble representation of all $C_4^2$ LF subspaces for more effective feature extraction. To super-resolve image structures from undersampled LF data, we propose a geometry-aware decoder, named EPIXformer, which constrains the transformer's operational searching regions with a LF physical prior. Experimental results on both spatial and angular SR tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art schemes, especially in handling various disparities.

- **Summary**: Multi-class cell segmentation in high-resolution Giga-pixel whole slide images (WSI) is critical for various clinical applications. Training such an AI model typically requires labor-intensive pixel-wise manual annotation from experienced domain experts (e.g., pathologists). Moreover, such annotation is error-prone when differentiating fine-grained cell types (e.g., podocyte and mesangial cells) via the naked human eye. In this study, we assess the feasibility of democratizing pathological AI deployment by only using lay annotators (annotators without medical domain knowledge). The contribution of this paper is threefold: (1) We proposed a molecular-empowered learning scheme for multi-class cell segmentation using partial labels from lay annotators; (2) The proposed method integrated Giga-pixel level molecular-morphology cross-modality registration, molecular-informed annotation, and molecular-oriented segmentation model, so as to achieve significantly superior performance via 3 lay annotators as compared with 2 experienced pathologists; (3) A deep corrective learning (learning with imperfect label) method is proposed to further improve the segmentation performance using partially annotated noisy data. From the experimental results, our learning method achieved F1 = 0.8496 using molecular-informed annotations from lay annotators, which is better than conventional morphology-based annotations (F1 = 0.7015) from experienced pathologists. Our method democratizes the development of a pathological segmentation deep model to the lay annotator level, which consequently scales up the learning process similar to a non-medical computer vision task.

- **Summary**: Watermarking the outputs of generative models is a crucial technique for tracing copyright and preventing potential harm from AI-generated content. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called Tree-Ring Watermarking that robustly fingerprints diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing methods that perform post-hoc modifications to images after sampling, Tree-Ring Watermarking subtly influences the entire sampling process, resulting in a model fingerprint that is invisible to humans. The watermark embeds a pattern into the initial noise vector used for sampling. These patterns are structured in Fourier space so that they are invariant to convolutions, crops, dilations, flips, and rotations. After image generation, the watermark signal is detected by inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector, which is then checked for the embedded signal. We demonstrate that this technique can be easily applied to arbitrary diffusion models, including text-conditioned Stable Diffusion, as a plug-in with negligible loss in FID. Our watermark is semantically hidden in the image space and is far more robust than watermarking alternatives that are currently deployed.

- **Summary**: We present LOWA, a novel method for localizing objects with attributes effectively in the wild. It aims to address the insufficiency of current open-vocabulary object detectors, which are limited by the lack of instance-level attribute classification and rare class names. To train LOWA, we propose a hybrid vision-language training strategy to learn object detection and recognition with class names as well as attribute information. With LOWA, users can not only detect objects with class names, but also able to localize objects by attributes. LOWA is built on top of a two-tower vision-language architecture and consists of a standard vision transformer as the image encoder and a similar transformer as the text encoder. To learn the alignment between visual and text inputs at the instance level, we train LOWA with three training steps: object-level training, attribute-aware learning, and free-text joint training of objects and attributes. This hybrid training strategy first ensures correct object detection, then incorporates instance-level attribute information, and finally balances the object class and attribute sensitivity. We evaluate our model performance of attribute classification and attribute localization on the Open-Vocabulary Attribute Detection (OVAD) benchmark and the Visual Attributes in the Wild (VAW) dataset, and experiments indicate strong zero-shot performance. Ablation studies additionally demonstrate the effectiveness of each training step of our approach.



### F?D: On understanding the role of deep feature spaces on face generation evaluation

- **Summary**: Perceptual metrics, like the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), are widely used to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and ground truth (real) images. The key idea behind these metrics is to compute errors in a deep feature space that captures perceptually and semantically rich image features. Despite their popularity, the effect that different deep features and their design choices have on a perceptual metric has not been well studied. In this work, we perform a causal analysis linking differences in semantic attributes and distortions between face image distributions to Fr\'echet distances (FD) using several popular deep feature spaces. A key component of our analysis is the creation of synthetic counterfactual faces using deep face generators. Our experiments show that the FD is heavily influenced by its feature space's training dataset and objective function. For example, FD using features extracted from ImageNet-trained models heavily emphasize hats over regions like the eyes and mouth. Moreover, FD using features from a face gender classifier emphasize hair length more than distances in an identity (recognition) feature space. Finally, we evaluate several popular face generation models across feature spaces and find that StyleGAN2 consistently ranks higher than other face generators, except with respect to identity (recognition) features. This suggests the need for considering multiple feature spaces when evaluating generative models and using feature spaces that are tuned to nuances of the domain of interest.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in image generation tasks, which are capable of generating highly realistic images. When adopting DPMs for image restoration tasks, the crucial aspect lies in how to integrate the conditional information to guide the DPMs to generate accurate and natural output, which has been largely overlooked in existing works. In this paper, we present a unified conditional framework based on diffusion models for image restoration. We leverage a lightweight UNet to predict initial guidance and the diffusion model to learn the residual of the guidance. By carefully designing the basic module and integration module for the diffusion model block, we integrate the guidance and other auxiliary conditional information into every block of the diffusion model to achieve spatially-adaptive generation conditioning. To handle high-resolution images, we propose a simple yet effective inter-step patch-splitting strategy to produce arbitrary-resolution images without grid artifacts. We evaluate our conditional framework on three challenging tasks: extreme low-light denoising, deblurring, and JPEG restoration, demonstrating its significant improvements in perceptual quality and the generalization to restoration tasks.

- **Summary**: Attribution algorithms are frequently employed to explain the decisions of neural network models. Integrated Gradients (IG) is an influential attribution method due to its strong axiomatic foundation. The algorithm is based on integrating the gradients along a path from a reference image to the input image. Unfortunately, it can be observed that gradients computed from regions where the output logit changes minimally along the path provide poor explanations for the model decision, which is called the saturation effect problem. In this paper, we propose an attribution algorithm called integrated decision gradients (IDG). The algorithm focuses on integrating gradients from the region of the path where the model makes its decision, i.e., the portion of the path where the output logit rapidly transitions from zero to its final value. This is practically realized by scaling each gradient by the derivative of the output logit with respect to the path. The algorithm thereby provides a principled solution to the saturation problem. Additionally, we minimize the errors within the Riemann sum approximation of the path integral by utilizing non-uniform subdivisions determined by adaptive sampling. In the evaluation on ImageNet, it is demonstrated that IDG outperforms IG, left-IG, guided IG, and adversarial gradient integration both qualitatively and quantitatively using standard insertion and deletion metrics across three common models.

- **Summary**: Car detection, particularly through camera vision, has become a major focus in the field of computer vision and has gained widespread adoption. While current car detection systems are capable of good detection, reliable detection can still be challenging due to factors such as proximity between the car, light intensity, and environmental visibility. To address these issues, we propose cross-domain Car Detection Model with integrated convolutional block Attention mechanism(CDMA) that we apply to car recognition for autonomous driving and other areas. CDMA includes several novelties: 1)Building a complete cross-domain target detection framework. 2)Developing an unpaired target domain picture generation module with an integrated convolutional attention mechanism which specifically emphasizes the car headlights feature. 3)Adopting Generalized Intersection over Union (GIOU) as the loss function of the target detection framework. 4)Designing an object detection model integrated with two-headed Convolutional Block Attention Module(CBAM). 5)Utilizing an effective data enhancement method. To evaluate the model's effectiveness, we performed a reduced will resolution process on the data in the SSLAD dataset and used it as the benchmark dataset for our task. Experimental results show that the performance of the cross-domain car target detection model improves by 40% over the model without our framework, and our improvements have a significant impact on cross-domain car recognition.

- **Summary**: Computer aided detection and diagnosis systems based on deep learning have shown promising performance in breast cancer detection. However, there are cases where the obtained results lack justification. In this study, our objective is to highlight the regions of interest used by a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying histological images as benign or malignant. We compare these regions with the regions identified by pathologists. To achieve this, we employed the VGG19 architecture and tested three visualization methods: Gradient, LRP Z, and LRP Epsilon. Additionally, we experimented with three pixel selection methods: Bins, K-means, and MeanShift. Based on the results obtained, the Gradient visualization method and the MeanShift selection method yielded satisfactory outcomes for visualizing the images.

- **Summary**: Chats emerge as an effective user-friendly approach for information retrieval, and are successfully employed in many domains, such as customer service, healthcare, and finance. However, existing image retrieval approaches typically address the case of a single query-to-image round, and the use of chats for image retrieval has been mostly overlooked. In this work, we introduce ChatIR: a chat-based image retrieval system that engages in a conversation with the user to elicit information, in addition to an initial query, in order to clarify the user's search intent. Motivated by the capabilities of today's foundation models, we leverage Large Language Models to generate follow-up questions to an initial image description. These questions form a dialog with the user in order to retrieve the desired image from a large corpus. In this study, we explore the capabilities of such a system tested on a large dataset and reveal that engaging in a dialog yields significant gains in image retrieval. We start by building an evaluation pipeline from an existing manually generated dataset and explore different modules and training strategies for ChatIR. Our comparison includes strong baselines derived from related applications trained with Reinforcement Learning. Our system is capable of retrieving the target image from a pool of 50K images with over 78% success rate after 5 dialogue rounds, compared to 75% when questions are asked by humans, and 64% for a single shot text-to-image retrieval. Extensive evaluations reveal the strong capabilities and examine the limitations of CharIR under different settings.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes the Hierarchical Functional Maximal Correlation Algorithm (HFMCA), a hierarchical methodology that characterizes dependencies across two hierarchical levels in multiview systems. By framing view similarities as dependencies and ensuring contrastivity by imposing orthonormality, HFMCA achieves faster convergence and increased stability in self-supervised learning. HFMCA defines and measures dependencies within image hierarchies, from pixels and patches to full images. We find that the network topology for approximating orthonormal basis functions aligns with a vanilla CNN, enabling the decomposition of density ratios between neighboring layers of feature maps. This approach provides powerful interpretability, revealing the resemblance between supervision and self-supervision through the lens of internal representations.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed considerable achievements in editing images with text instructions. When applying these editors to dynamic scene editing, the new-style scene tends to be temporally inconsistent due to the frame-by-frame nature of these 2D editors. To tackle this issue, we propose Control4D, a novel approach for high-fidelity and temporally consistent 4D portrait editing. Control4D is built upon an efficient 4D representation with a 2D diffusion-based editor. Instead of using direct supervisions from the editor, our method learns a 4D GAN from it and avoids the inconsistent supervision signals. Specifically, we employ a discriminator to learn the generation distribution based on the edited images and then update the generator with the discrimination signals. For more stable training, multi-level information is extracted from the edited images and used to facilitate the learning of the generator. Experimental results show that Control4D surpasses previous approaches and achieves more photo-realistic and consistent 4D editing performances.

- **Summary**: Images generated by diffusion models like Stable Diffusion are increasingly widespread. Recent works and even lawsuits have shown that these models are prone to replicating their training data, unbeknownst to the user. In this paper, we first analyze this memorization problem in text-to-image diffusion models. While it is widely believed that duplicated images in the training set are responsible for content replication at inference time, we observe that the text conditioning of the model plays a similarly important role. In fact, we see in our experiments that data replication often does not happen for unconditional models, while it is common in the text-conditional case. Motivated by our findings, we then propose several techniques for reducing data replication at both training and inference time by randomizing and augmenting image captions in the training set.

- **Summary**: This paper examines the problems of severe image-text misalignment and high redundancy in the widely-used large-scale Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP) datasets. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and straightforward Vision-Language learning algorithm called TL;DR, which aims to compress the existing large VLP data into a small, high-quality set. Our approach consists of two major steps. First, a codebook-based encoder-decoder captioner is developed to select representative samples. Second, a new caption is generated to complement the original captions for selected samples, mitigating the text-image misalignment problem while maintaining uniqueness. As the result, TL;DR enables us to reduce the large dataset into a small set of high-quality data, which can serve as an alternative pre-training dataset. This algorithm significantly speeds up the time-consuming pretraining process. Specifically, TL;DR can compress the mainstream VLP datasets at a high ratio, e.g., reduce well-cleaned CC3M dataset from 2.82M to 0.67M ($\sim$24\%) and noisy YFCC15M from 15M to 2.5M ($\sim$16.7\%). Extensive experiments with three popular VLP models over seven downstream tasks show that VLP model trained on the compressed dataset provided by TL;DR can perform similar or even better results compared with training on the full-scale dataset. The code will be made available at \url{https://github.com/showlab/datacentric.vlp}.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) stands as one of the most effective and scalable methods for training transferable vision models using paired image and text data. CLIP models are trained using contrastive loss, which typically relies on data augmentations to prevent overfitting and shortcuts. However, in the CLIP training paradigm, data augmentations are exclusively applied to image inputs, while language inputs remain unchanged throughout the entire training process, limiting the exposure of diverse texts to the same image. In this paper, we introduce Language augmented CLIP (LaCLIP), a simple yet highly effective approach to enhance CLIP training through language rewrites. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of large language models, we rewrite the text descriptions associated with each image. These rewritten texts exhibit diversity in sentence structure and vocabulary while preserving the original key concepts and meanings. During training, LaCLIP randomly selects either the original texts or the rewritten versions as text augmentations for each image. Extensive experiments on CC3M, CC12M, RedCaps and LAION-400M datasets show that CLIP pre-training with language rewrites significantly improves the transfer performance without computation or memory overhead during training. Specifically for ImageNet zero-shot accuracy, LaCLIP outperforms CLIP by 8.2% on CC12M and 2.4% on LAION-400M. Code is available at https://github.com/LijieFan/LaCLIP.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing hand-held objects from monocular RGB images is an appealing yet challenging task. In this task, contacts between hands and objects provide important cues for recovering the 3D geometry of the hand-held objects. Though recent works have employed implicit functions to achieve impressive progress, they ignore formulating contacts in their frameworks, which results in producing less realistic object meshes. In this work, we explore how to model contacts in an explicit way to benefit the implicit reconstruction of hand-held objects. Our method consists of two components: explicit contact prediction and implicit shape reconstruction. In the first part, we propose a new subtask of directly estimating 3D hand-object contacts from a single image. The part-level and vertex-level graph-based transformers are cascaded and jointly learned in a coarse-to-fine manner for more accurate contact probabilities. In the second part, we introduce a novel method to diffuse estimated contact states from the hand mesh surface to nearby 3D space and leverage diffused contact probabilities to construct the implicit neural representation for the manipulated object. Benefiting from estimating the interaction patterns between the hand and the object, our method can reconstruct more realistic object meshes, especially for object parts that are in contact with hands. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms the current state of the arts by a great margin.

- **Summary**: We present an approach to reconstruct humans and track them over time. At the core of our approach, we propose a fully "transformerized" version of a network for human mesh recovery. This network, HMR 2.0, advances the state of the art and shows the capability to analyze unusual poses that have in the past been difficult to reconstruct from single images. To analyze video, we use 3D reconstructions from HMR 2.0 as input to a tracking system that operates in 3D. This enables us to deal with multiple people and maintain identities through occlusion events. Our complete approach, 4DHumans, achieves state-of-the-art results for tracking people from monocular video. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HMR 2.0 on the downstream task of action recognition, achieving significant improvements over previous pose-based action recognition approaches. Our code and models are available on the project website: https://shubham-goel.github.io/4dhumans/.

- **Summary**: Road traffic scene reconstruction from videos has been desirable by road safety regulators, city planners, researchers, and autonomous driving technology developers. However, it is expensive and unnecessary to cover every mile of the road with cameras mounted on the road infrastructure. This paper presents a method that can process aerial videos to vehicle trajectory data so that a traffic scene can be automatically reconstructed and accurately re-simulated using computers. On average, the vehicle localization error is about 0.1 m to 0.3 m using a consumer-grade drone flying at 120 meters. This project also compiles a dataset of 50 reconstructed road traffic scenes from about 100 hours of aerial videos to enable various downstream traffic analysis applications and facilitate further road traffic related research.

- **Summary**: Two-Tower Vision-Language (VL) models have shown promising improvements on various downstream VL tasks. Although the most advanced work improves performance by building bridges between encoders, it suffers from ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of uni-modal representations and cannot flexibly exploit different levels of uni-modal semantic knowledge. In this work, we propose ManagerTower, a novel VL model architecture that gathers and combines the insights of pre-trained uni-modal experts at different levels. The managers introduced in each cross-modal layer can adaptively aggregate uni-modal semantic knowledge to facilitate more comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion. ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines both with and without Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP). With only 4M VLP data, ManagerTower achieves superior performances on various downstream VL tasks, especially 79.15% accuracy on VQAv2 Test-Std, 86.56% IR@1 and 95.64% TR@1 on Flickr30K.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new way to identify additional positive pairs for BYOL, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised learning framework, to improve its representation learning ability. Unlike conventional BYOL which relies on only one positive pair generated by two augmented views of the same image, we argue that information from different images with the same label can bring more diversity and variations to the target features, thus benefiting representation learning. To identify such pairs without any label, we investigate TracIn, an instance-based and computationally efficient influence function, for BYOL training. Specifically, TracIn is a gradient-based method that reveals the impact of a training sample on a test sample in supervised learning. We extend it to the self-supervised learning setting and propose an efficient batch-wise per-sample gradient computation method to estimate the pairwise TracIn to represent the similarity of samples in the mini-batch during training. For each image, we select the most similar sample from other images as the additional positive and pull their features together with BYOL loss. Experimental results on two public medical datasets (i.e., ISIC 2019 and ChestX-ray) demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the classification performance compared to other competitive baselines in both semi-supervised and transfer learning settings.

- **Summary**: Monitoring land cover using remote sensing is vital for studying environmental changes and ensuring global food security through crop yield forecasting. Specifically, multitemporal remote sensing imagery provides relevant information about the dynamics of a scene, which has proven to lead to better land cover classification results. Nevertheless, few studies have benefited from high spatial and temporal resolution data due to the difficulty of accessing reliable, fine-grained and high-quality annotated samples to support their hypotheses. Therefore, we introduce a temporal patch-based dataset of Canadian croplands, enriched with labels retrieved from the Canadian Annual Crop Inventory. The dataset contains 78,536 manually verified high-resolution (10 m/pixel, 640 x 640 m) geo-referenced images from 10 crop classes collected over four crop production years (2017-2020) and five months (June-October). Each instance contains 12 spectral bands, an RGB image, and additional vegetation index bands. Individually, each category contains at least 4,800 images. Moreover, as a benchmark, we provide models and source code that allow a user to predict the crop class using a single image (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) or a sequence of images (LRCN, 3D-CNN) from the same location. In perspective, we expect this evolving dataset to propel the creation of robust agro-environmental models that can accelerate the comprehension of complex agricultural regions by providing accurate and continuous monitoring of land cover.

- **Summary**: Human vision demonstrates higher robustness than current AI algorithms under out-of-distribution scenarios. It has been conjectured such robustness benefits from performing analysis-by-synthesis. Our paper formulates triple vision tasks in a consistent manner using approximate analysis-by-synthesis by render-and-compare algorithms on neural features. In this work, we introduce Neural Textured Deformable Meshes, which involve the object model with deformable geometry that allows optimization on both camera parameters and object geometries. The deformable mesh is parameterized as a neural field, and covered by whole-surface neural texture maps, which are trained to have spatial discriminability. During inference, we extract the feature map of the test image and subsequently optimize the 3D pose and shape parameters of our model using differentiable rendering to best reconstruct the target feature map. We show that our analysis-by-synthesis is much more robust than conventional neural networks when evaluated on real-world images and even in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios, such as occlusion and domain shift. Our algorithms are competitive with standard algorithms when tested on conventional performance measures.

- **Summary**: Object pose estimation is important for object manipulation and scene understanding. In order to improve the general applicability of pose estimators, recent research focuses on providing estimates for novel objects, that is objects unseen during training. Such works use deep template matching strategies to retrieve the closest template connected to a query image. This template retrieval implicitly provides object class and pose. Despite the recent success and improvements of Vision Transformers over CNNs for many vision tasks, the state of the art uses CNN-based approaches for novel object pose estimation. This work evaluates and demonstrates the differences between self-supervised CNNs and Vision Transformers for deep template matching. In detail, both types of approaches are trained using contrastive learning to match training images against rendered templates of isolated objects. At test time, such templates are matched against query images of known and novel objects under challenging settings, such as clutter, occlusion and object symmetries, using masked cosine similarity. The presented results not only demonstrate that Vision Transformers improve in matching accuracy over CNNs, but also that for some cases pre-trained Vision Transformers do not need fine-tuning to do so. Furthermore, we highlight the differences in optimization and network architecture when comparing these two types of network for deep template matching.

- **Summary**: Public imaging datasets are critical for the development and evaluation of automated tools in cancer imaging. Unfortunately, many do not include annotations or image-derived features, complicating their downstream analysis. Artificial intelligence-based annotation tools have been shown to achieve acceptable performance and thus can be used to automatically annotate large datasets. As part of the effort to enrich public data available within NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC), here we introduce AI-generated annotations for two collections of computed tomography images of the chest, NSCLC-Radiomics, and the National Lung Screening Trial. Using publicly available AI algorithms we derived volumetric annotations of thoracic organs at risk, their corresponding radiomics features, and slice-level annotations of anatomical landmarks and regions. The resulting annotations are publicly available within IDC, where the DICOM format is used to harmonize the data and achieve FAIR principles. The annotations are accompanied by cloud-enabled notebooks demonstrating their use. This study reinforces the need for large, publicly accessible curated datasets and demonstrates how AI can be used to aid in cancer imaging.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a multi-spectral random forest classifier with suitable feature selection and masking for tree cover estimation in urban areas. The key feature of the proposed classifier is filtering out the built-up region using spectral indices followed by random forest classification on the remaining mask with carefully selected features. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, we evaluate the performance of the proposed technique on a specified area (approximately 82 acres) of Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and demonstrate that our method outperforms a conventional random forest classifier as well as state-of-the-art methods such as European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover 10m 2020 product as well as a DeepLabv3 deep learning architecture.

- **Summary**: A reliable yet inexpensive tool for the estimation of flood water spread is conducive for efficient disaster management. The application of optical and SAR imagery in tandem provides a means of extended availability and enhanced reliability of flood mapping. We propose a methodology to merge these two types of imagery into a common data space and demonstrate its use in the identification of affected populations and infrastructure for the 2022 floods in Pakistan. The merging of optical and SAR data provides us with improved observations in cloud-prone regions; that is then used to gain additional insights into flood mapping applications. The use of open source datasets from WorldPop and OSM for population and roads respectively makes the exercise globally replicable. The integration of flood maps with spatial data on population and infrastructure facilitates informed policy design. We have shown that within the top five flood-affected districts in Sindh province, Pakistan, the affected population accounts for 31 %, while the length of affected roads measures 1410.25 km out of a total of 7537.96 km.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction of 3D neural fields from posed images has emerged as a promising method for self-supervised representation learning. The key challenge preventing the deployment of these 3D scene learners on large-scale video data is their dependence on precise camera poses from structure-from-motion, which is prohibitively expensive to run at scale. We propose a method that jointly reconstructs camera poses and 3D neural scene representations online and in a single forward pass. We estimate poses by first lifting frame-to-frame optical flow to 3D scene flow via differentiable rendering, preserving locality and shift-equivariance of the image processing backbone. SE(3) camera pose estimation is then performed via a weighted least-squares fit to the scene flow field. This formulation enables us to jointly supervise pose estimation and a generalizable neural scene representation via re-rendering the input video, and thus, train end-to-end and fully self-supervised on real-world video datasets. We demonstrate that our method performs robustly on diverse, real-world video, notably on sequences traditionally challenging to optimization-based pose estimation techniques.

- **Summary**: There is a growing gap between the impressive results of deep image generative models and classical algorithms that offer theoretical guarantees. The former suffer from mode collapse or memorization issues, limiting their application to scientific data. The latter require restrictive assumptions such as log-concavity to escape the curse of dimensionality. We partially bridge this gap by introducing conditionally strongly log-concave (CSLC) models, which factorize the data distribution into a product of conditional probability distributions that are strongly log-concave. This factorization is obtained with orthogonal projectors adapted to the data distribution. It leads to efficient parameter estimation and sampling algorithms, with theoretical guarantees, although the data distribution is not globally log-concave. We show that several challenging multiscale processes are conditionally log-concave using wavelet packet orthogonal projectors. Numerical results are shown for physical fields such as the $\varphi^4$ model and weak lensing convergence maps with higher resolution than in previous works.

- **Summary**: Deep reinforcement learning(DRL) is increasingly being explored in medical imaging. However, the environments for medical imaging tasks are constantly evolving in terms of imaging orientations, imaging sequences, and pathologies. To that end, we developed a Lifelong DRL framework, SERIL to continually learn new tasks in changing imaging environments without catastrophic forgetting. SERIL was developed using selective experience replay based lifelong learning technique for the localization of five anatomical landmarks in brain MRI on a sequence of twenty-four different imaging environments. The performance of SERIL, when compared to two baseline setups: MERT(multi-environment-best-case) and SERT(single-environment-worst-case) demonstrated excellent performance with an average distance of $9.90\pm7.35$ pixels from the desired landmark across all 120 tasks, compared to $10.29\pm9.07$ for MERT and $36.37\pm22.41$ for SERT($p<0.05$), demonstrating the excellent potential for continuously learning multiple tasks across dynamically changing imaging environments.

- **Summary**: Data-driven methods have shown tremendous progress in medical image analysis. In this context, deep learning-based supervised methods are widely popular. However, they require a large amount of training data and face issues in generalisability to unseen datasets that hinder clinical translation. Endoscopic imaging data incorporates large inter- and intra-patient variability that makes these models more challenging to learn representative features for downstream tasks. Thus, despite the publicly available datasets and datasets that can be generated within hospitals, most supervised models still underperform. While self-supervised learning has addressed this problem to some extent in natural scene data, there is a considerable performance gap in the medical image domain. In this paper, we propose to explore patch-level instance-group discrimination and penalisation of inter-class variation using additive angular margin within the cosine similarity metrics. Our novel approach enables models to learn to cluster similar representative patches, thereby improving their ability to provide better separation between different classes. Our results demonstrate significant improvement on all metrics over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the test set from the same and diverse datasets. We evaluated our approach for classification, detection, and segmentation. SSL-CPCD achieves 79.77% on Top 1 accuracy for ulcerative colitis classification, 88.62% on mAP for polyp detection, and 82.32% on dice similarity coefficient for segmentation tasks are nearly over 4%, 2%, and 3%, respectively, compared to the baseline architectures. We also demonstrate that our method generalises better than all SOTA methods to unseen datasets, reporting nearly 7% improvement in our generalisability assessment.

- **Summary**: Transferring the pose of a reference avatar to stylized 3D characters of various shapes is a fundamental task in computer graphics. Existing methods either require the stylized characters to be rigged, or they use the stylized character in the desired pose as ground truth at training. We present a zero-shot approach that requires only the widely available deformed non-stylized avatars in training, and deforms stylized characters of significantly different shapes at inference. Classical methods achieve strong generalization by deforming the mesh at the triangle level, but this requires labelled correspondences. We leverage the power of local deformation, but without requiring explicit correspondence labels. We introduce a semi-supervised shape-understanding module to bypass the need for explicit correspondences at test time, and an implicit pose deformation module that deforms individual surface points to match the target pose. Furthermore, to encourage realistic and accurate deformation of stylized characters, we introduce an efficient volume-based test-time training procedure. Because it does not need rigging, nor the deformed stylized character at training time, our model generalizes to categories with scarce annotation, such as stylized quadrupeds. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art approaches trained with comparable or more supervision.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL) techniques are highly effective for defect detection from images. Training DL classification models, however, requires vast amounts of labeled data which is often expensive to collect. In many cases, not only the available training data is limited but may also imbalanced. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation (DA) approach to address the problem of labeled training data scarcity for a target learning task by transferring knowledge gained from an existing source dataset used for a similar learning task. Our approach works for scenarios where the source dataset and the dataset available for the target learning task have same or different feature spaces. We combine our DA approach with an autoencoder-based data augmentation approach to address the problem of imbalanced target datasets. We evaluate our combined approach using image data for wafer defect prediction. The experiments show its superior performance against other algorithms when the number of labeled samples in the target dataset is significantly small and the target dataset is imbalanced.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generative models have made remarkable advancements in generating high-quality images. However, generated images often contain undesirable artifacts or other errors due to model limitations. Existing techniques to fine-tune generated images are time-consuming (manual editing), produce poorly-integrated results (inpainting), or result in unexpected changes across the entire image (variation selection and prompt fine-tuning). In this work, we present Diffusion Brush, a Latent Diffusion Model-based (LDM) tool to efficiently fine-tune desired regions within an AI-synthesized image. Our method introduces new random noise patterns at targeted regions during the reverse diffusion process, enabling the model to efficiently make changes to the specified regions while preserving the original context for the rest of the image. We evaluate our method's usability and effectiveness through a user study with artists, comparing our technique against other state-of-the-art image inpainting techniques and editing software for fine-tuning AI-generated imagery.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering is a challenging task, as it requires seamless interaction between perceptual, linguistic, and background knowledge systems. While the recent progress of visual and natural language models like BLIP has led to improved performance on this task, we lack understanding of the ability of such models to perform on different kinds of questions and reasoning types. As our initial analysis of BLIP-family models revealed difficulty with answering fine-detail questions, we investigate the following question: Can visual cropping be employed to improve the performance of state-of-the-art visual question answering models on fine-detail questions? Given the recent success of the BLIP-family models, we study a zero-shot and a fine-tuned BLIP model. We define three controlled subsets of the popular VQA-v2 benchmark to measure whether cropping can help model performance. Besides human cropping, we devise two automatic cropping strategies based on multi-modal embedding by CLIP and BLIP visual QA model gradients. Our experiments demonstrate that the performance of BLIP model variants can be significantly improved through human cropping, and automatic cropping methods can produce comparable benefits. A deeper dive into our findings indicates that the performance enhancement is more pronounced in zero-shot models than in fine-tuned models and more salient with smaller bounding boxes than larger ones. We perform case studies to connect quantitative differences with qualitative observations across question types and datasets. Finally, we see that the cropping enhancement is robust, as we gain an improvement of 4.59% (absolute) in the general VQA-random task by simply inputting a concatenation of the original and gradient-based cropped images. We make our code available to facilitate further innovation on visual cropping methods for question answering.

- **Summary**: Forensic science heavily relies on analyzing latent fingerprints, which are crucial for criminal investigations. However, various challenges, such as background noise, overlapping prints, and contamination, make the identification process difficult. Moreover, limited access to real crime scene and laboratory-generated databases hinders the development of efficient recognition algorithms. This study aims to develop a fast method, which we call ULPrint, to enhance various latent fingerprint types, including those obtained from real crime scenes and laboratory-created samples, to boost fingerprint recognition system performance. In closed-set identification accuracy experiments, the enhanced image was able to improve the performance of the MSU-AFIS from 61.56\% to 75.19\% in the NIST SD27 database, from 67.63\% to 77.02\% in the MSP Latent database, and from 46.90\% to 52.12\% in the NIST SD302 database. Our contributions include (1) the development of a two-step latent fingerprint enhancement method that combines Ridge Segmentation with UNet and Mix Visual Transformer (MiT) SegFormer-B5 encoder architecture, (2) the implementation of multiple dilated convolutions in the UNet architecture to capture intricate, non-local patterns better and enhance ridge segmentation, and (3) the guided blending of the predicted ridge mask with the latent fingerprint. This novel approach, ULPrint, streamlines the enhancement process, addressing challenges across diverse latent fingerprint types to improve forensic investigations and criminal justice outcomes.

- **Summary**: Modern deep learning approaches usually transform inputs into a modality-specific form. For example, the most common deep learning approach to image classification involves decoding image file bytes into an RGB tensor which is passed into a neural network. Instead, we investigate performing classification directly on file bytes, without the need for decoding files at inference time. Using file bytes as model inputs enables the development of models which can operate on multiple input modalities. Our model, \emph{ByteFormer}, achieves an ImageNet Top-1 classification accuracy of $77.33\%$ when training and testing directly on TIFF file bytes using a transformer backbone with configuration similar to DeiT-Ti ($72.2\%$ accuracy when operating on RGB images). Without modifications or hyperparameter tuning, ByteFormer achieves $95.42\%$ classification accuracy when operating on WAV files from the Speech Commands v2 dataset (compared to state-of-the-art accuracy of $98.7\%$). Additionally, we demonstrate that ByteFormer has applications in privacy-preserving inference. ByteFormer is capable of performing inference on particular obfuscated input representations with no loss of accuracy. We also demonstrate ByteFormer's ability to perform inference with a hypothetical privacy-preserving camera which avoids forming full images by consistently masking $90\%$ of pixel channels, while still achieving $71.35\%$ accuracy on ImageNet. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets/tree/main/examples/byteformer.

- **Summary**: The exploration of the latent space in StyleGANs and GAN inversion exemplify impressive real-world image editing, yet the trade-off between reconstruction quality and editing quality remains an open problem. In this study, we revisit StyleGANs' hyperspherical prior $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{Z}^+$ and integrate them into seminal GAN inversion methods to improve editing quality. Besides faithful reconstruction, our extensions achieve sophisticated editing quality with the aid of the StyleGAN prior. We project the real images into the proposed space to obtain the inverted codes, by which we then move along $\mathcal{Z}^{+}$, enabling semantic editing without sacrificing image quality. Comprehensive experiments show that $\mathcal{Z}^{+}$ can replace the most commonly-used $\mathcal{W}$, $\mathcal{W}^{+}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ spaces while preserving reconstruction quality, resulting in reduced distortion of edited images.

- **Summary**: Much of the previous work towards digital agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) has relied on text-based representations (derived from HTML or other structured data sources), which are not always readily available. These input representations have been often coupled with custom, task-specific action spaces. This paper focuses on creating agents that interact with the digital world using the same conceptual interface that humans commonly use -- via pixel-based screenshots and a generic action space corresponding to keyboard and mouse actions. Building upon recent progress in pixel-based pretraining, we show, for the first time, that it is possible for such agents to outperform human crowdworkers on the MiniWob++ benchmark of GUI-based instruction following tasks.

- **Summary**: The monetary value of a given piece of real estate, a parcel, is often readily available from a geographic information system. However, for many applications, such as insurance and urban planning, it is useful to have estimates of property value at much higher spatial resolutions. We propose a method to estimate the distribution over property value at the pixel level from remote sensing imagery. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of a major urban area. Our results show that the proposed approaches are capable of generating fine-level estimates of property values, significantly improving upon a diverse collection of baseline approaches.

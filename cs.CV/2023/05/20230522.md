- **Summary**: In recent years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in the field of dermatological image analysis. However, existing datasets in this domain have significant limitations, including a small number of image samples, limited disease conditions, insufficient annotations, and non-standardized image acquisitions. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel framework called DermSynth3D. DermSynth3D blends skin disease patterns onto 3D textured meshes of human subjects using a differentiable renderer and generates 2D images from various camera viewpoints under chosen lighting conditions in diverse background scenes. Our method adheres to top-down rules that constrain the blending and rendering process to create 2D images with skin conditions that mimic in-the-wild acquisitions, ensuring more meaningful results. The framework generates photo-realistic 2D dermoscopy images and the corresponding dense annotations for semantic segmentation of the skin, skin conditions, body parts, bounding boxes around lesions, depth maps, and other 3D scene parameters, such as camera position and lighting conditions. DermSynth3D allows for the creation of custom datasets for various dermatology tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of data generated using DermSynth3D by training DL models on synthetic data and evaluating them on various dermatology tasks using real 2D dermatological images. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/DermSynth3D.

- **Summary**: In order to meaningfully interact with the world, robot manipulators must be able to interpret objects they encounter. A critical aspect of this interpretation is pose estimation: inferring quantities that describe the position and orientation of an object in 3D space. Most existing approaches to pose estimation make limiting assumptions, often working only for specific, known object instances, or at best generalising to an object category using large pose-labelled datasets. In this work, we present a method for achieving category-level pose estimation by inspection of just a single object from a desired category. We show that we can subsequently perform accurate pose estimation for unseen objects from an inspected category, and considerably outperform prior work by exploiting multi-view correspondences. We demonstrate that our method runs in real-time, enabling a robot manipulator equipped with an RGBD sensor to perform online 6D pose estimation for novel objects. Finally, we showcase our method in a continual learning setting, with a robot able to determine whether objects belong to known categories, and if not, use active perception to produce a one-shot category representation for subsequent pose estimation.

- **Summary**: Camouflaged objects are typically assimilated into their backgrounds and exhibit fuzzy boundaries. The complex environmental conditions and the high intrinsic similarity between camouflaged targets and their surroundings pose significant challenges in accurately locating and segmenting these objects in their entirety. While existing methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in various real-world scenarios, they still face limitations when confronted with difficult cases, such as small targets, thin structures, and indistinct boundaries. Drawing inspiration from human visual perception when observing images containing camouflaged objects, we propose a three-stage model that enables coarse-to-fine segmentation in a single iteration. Specifically, our model employs three decoders to sequentially process subsampled features, cropped features, and high-resolution original features. This proposed approach not only reduces computational overhead but also mitigates interference caused by background noise. Furthermore, considering the significance of multi-scale information, we have designed a multi-scale feature enhancement module that enlarges the receptive field while preserving detailed structural cues. Additionally, a boundary enhancement module has been developed to enhance performance by leveraging boundary information. Subsequently, a mask-guided fusion module is proposed to generate fine-grained results by integrating coarse prediction maps with high-resolution feature maps. Our network surpasses state-of-the-art CNN-based counterparts without unnecessary complexities. Upon acceptance of the paper, the source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/clelouch/BTSNet.

- **Summary**: In minimally-invasive brain surgeries with indirect and narrow operating environments, 3D brain reconstruction is crucial. However, as requirements of accuracy for some new minimally-invasive surgeries (such as brain-computer interface surgery) are higher and higher, the outputs of conventional 3D reconstruction, such as point cloud (PC), are facing the challenges that sample points are too sparse and the precision is insufficient. On the other hand, there is a scarcity of high-density point cloud datasets, which makes it challenging to train models for direct reconstruction of high-density brain point clouds. In this work, a novel model named stereoscopic-aware graph generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) with two stages is proposed to generate fine high-density PC conditioned on a single image. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and basic structure of the organ based on the given image, yielding Stage-I point clouds. The Stage-II GAN takes the results from Stage-I and generates high-density point clouds with detailed features. The Stage-II GAN is capable of correcting defects and restoring the detailed features of the region of interest (ROI) through the up-sampling process. Furthermore, a parameter-free-attention-based free-transforming module is developed to learn the efficient features of input, while upholding a promising performance. Comparing with the existing methods, the SG-GAN model shows superior performance in terms of visual quality, objective measurements, and performance in classification, as demonstrated by comprehensive results measured by several evaluation metrics including PC-to-PC error and Chamfer distance.

- **Summary**: Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SF-UDA) aims to adapt a well-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without access to the source data. One key challenge is the lack of source data during domain adaptation. To handle this, we propose to mine the hidden knowledge of the source model and exploit it to generate source avatar prototypes. To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prototype Generation and Adaptation (CPGA) method. CPGA consists of two stages: Prototype generation and Prototype adaptation. Extensive experiments on three UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CPGA. However, existing SF.UDA studies implicitly assume balanced class distributions for both the source and target domains, which hinders their real applications. To address this issue, we study a more practical SF-UDA task, termed imbalance-agnostic SF-UDA, where the class distributions of both the unseen source domain and unlabeled target domain are unknown and could be arbitrarily skewed. This task is much more challenging than vanilla SF-UDA due to the co-occurrence of covariate shifts and unidentified class distribution shifts between the source and target domains. To address this task, we extend CPGA and propose a new Target-aware Contrastive Prototype Generation and Adaptation (T-CPGA) method. Specifically, for better prototype adaptation in the imbalance-agnostic scenario, T-CPGA applies a new pseudo label generation strategy to identify unknown target class distribution and generate accurate pseudo labels, by utilizing the collective intelligence of the source model and an additional contrastive language-image pre-trained model. Meanwhile, we further devise a target label-distribution-aware classifier to adapt the model to the unknown target class distribution. We empirically show that T-CPGA significantly outperforms CPGA and other SF-UDA methods in imbalance-agnostic SF-UDA.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel approach for measuring the total curvature at every triangle of a discrete surface. This method takes advantage of the relationship between per triangle total curvature and the Dirichlet energy of the Gauss map. This new tool can be used on both triangle meshes and point clouds and has numerous applications. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by using it for feature-aware mesh decimation, and show that it outperforms existing curvature-estimation methods from popular libraries such as Meshlab, Trimesh2, and Libigl. When estimating curvature on point clouds, our method outperforms popular libraries PCL and CGAL.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised video object segmentation has made significant progress in recent years, but the manual annotation of video mask datasets is expensive and limits the diversity of available datasets. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has introduced a new prompt-driven paradigm for image segmentation, unlocking a range of previously unexplored capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm called UVOSAM, which leverages SAM for unsupervised video object segmentation without requiring video mask labels. To address SAM's limitations in instance discovery and identity association, we introduce a video salient object tracking network that automatically generates trajectories for prominent foreground objects. These trajectories then serve as prompts for SAM to produce video masks on a frame-by-frame basis. Our experimental results demonstrate that UVOSAM significantly outperforms current mask-supervised methods. These findings suggest that UVOSAM has the potential to improve unsupervised video object segmentation and reduce the cost of manual annotation.



### Semantic-guided context modeling for indoor scene recognition

- **Summary**: Exploring the semantic context in scene images is essential for indoor scene recognition. However, due to the diverse intra-class spatial layouts and the coexisting inter-class objects, modeling contextual relationships to adapt various image characteristics is a great challenge. Existing contextual modeling methods for indoor scene recognition exhibit two limitations: 1) During training, space-independent information, such as color, may hinder optimizing the network's capacity to represent the spatial context. 2) These methods often overlook the differences in coexisting objects across different scenes, suppressing the performance of scene recognition. To address these limitations, we propose SpaCoNet, a novel approach that simultaneously models the Spatial relation and Co-occurrence of objects based on semantic segmentation. Firstly, the semantic spatial relation module (SSRM) is designed to explore the spatial relations among objects within a scene. With the help of semantic segmentation, this module decouples the spatial information from the image, effectively avoiding the influence of irrelevant features. Secondly, both spatial context features from SSRM and deep features from RGB feature extractor are used to distinguish the coexisting object across different scenes. Finally, utilizing the discriminative features mentioned above, we employ the self-attention mechanism to explore the long-range co-occurrence relationships among objects, and further generate a semantic-guided feature representation for indoor scene recognition. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available after the blind-review process is completed.

- **Summary**: Plug-and-play (PnP) prior is a well-known class of methods for solving imaging inverse problems by computing fixed-points of operators combining physical measurement models and learned image denoisers. While PnP methods have been extensively used for image recovery with known measurement operators, there is little work on PnP for solving blind inverse problems. We address this gap by presenting a new block-coordinate PnP (BC-PnP) method that efficiently solves this joint estimation problem by introducing learned denoisers as priors on both the unknown image and the unknown measurement operator. We present a new convergence theory for BC-PnP compatible with blind inverse problems by considering nonconvex data-fidelity terms and expansive denoisers. Our theory analyzes the convergence of BC-PnP to a stationary point of an implicit function associated with an approximate minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser. We numerically validate our method on two blind inverse problems: automatic coil sensitivity estimation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blind image deblurring. Our results show that BC-PnP provides an efficient and principled framework for using denoisers as PnP priors for jointly estimating measurement operators and images.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian images of the same identity from different modalities without annotations. Existing works mainly focus on alleviating the modality gap by aligning instance-level features of the unlabeled samples. However, the relationships between cross-modality clusters are not well explored. To this end, we propose a novel bilateral cluster matching-based learning framework to reduce the modality gap by matching cross-modality clusters. Specifically, we design a Many-to-many Bilateral Cross-Modality Cluster Matching (MBCCM) algorithm through optimizing the maximum matching problem in a bipartite graph. Then, the matched pairwise clusters utilize shared visible and infrared pseudo-labels during the model training. Under such a supervisory signal, a Modality-Specific and Modality-Agnostic (MSMA) contrastive learning framework is proposed to align features jointly at a cluster-level. Meanwhile, the cross-modality Consistency Constraint (CC) is proposed to explicitly reduce the large modality discrepancy. Extensive experiments on the public SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin of 8.76% mAP on average.

- **Summary**: With development of deep learning, researchers have developed generative models in generating realistic images. One of such generative models, a PixelCNNs model with Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder 2 (VQ-VAE-2), can generate more various images than other models. However, a PixelCNNs model with VQ-VAE-2, I call it PC-VQ2, requires sufficiently much training data like other deep learning models. Its practical applications are often limited in domains where collecting sufficient data is not difficult. To solve the problem, researchers have recently proposed more data-efficient methods for training generative models with limited unlabeled data from scratch. However, no such methods in PC-VQ2s have been researched. This study provides the first step in this direction, considering generation of images using PC-VQ2s and limited unlabeled data. In this study, I propose a training strategy for training a PC-VQ2 with limited data from scratch, phased data augmentation. In the strategy, ranges of parameters of data augmentation is narrowed in phases through learning. Quantitative evaluation shows that the phased data augmentation enables the model with limited data to generate images competitive with the one with sufficient data in diversity and outperforming it in fidelity. The evaluation suggests that the proposed method should be useful for training a PC-VQ2 with limited data efficiently to generate various and natural images.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Models (DMs) have empowered great success in artificial-intelligence-generated content, especially in artwork creation, yet raising new concerns in intellectual properties and copyright. For example, infringers can make profits by imitating non-authorized human-created paintings with DMs. Recent researches suggest that various adversarial examples for diffusion models can be effective tools against these copyright infringements. However, current adversarial examples show weakness in transferability over different painting-imitating methods and robustness under straightforward adversarial defense, for example, noise purification. We surprisingly find that the transferability of adversarial examples can be significantly enhanced by exploiting a fused and modified adversarial loss term under consistent parameters. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate the cross-method transferability of adversarial examples. The experimental observation shows that our method generates more transferable adversarial examples with even stronger robustness against the simple adversarial defense.



### FIT: Far-reaching Interleaved Transformers

- **Comment**: preliminary work (code at https://github.com/google-research/pix2seq)
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present FIT: a transformer-based architecture with efficient self-attention and adaptive computation. Unlike original transformers, which operate on a single sequence of data tokens, we divide the data tokens into groups, with each group being a shorter sequence of tokens. We employ two types of transformer layers: local layers operate on data tokens within each group, while global layers operate on a smaller set of introduced latent tokens. These layers, comprising the same set of self-attention and feed-forward layers as standard transformers, are interleaved, and cross-attention is used to facilitate information exchange between data and latent tokens within the same group. The attention complexity is $O(n^2)$ locally within each group of size $n$, but can reach $O(L^{{4}/{3}})$ globally for sequence length of $L$. The efficiency can be further enhanced by relying more on global layers that perform adaptive computation using a smaller set of latent tokens. FIT is a versatile architecture and can function as an encoder, diffusion decoder, or autoregressive decoder. We provide initial evidence demonstrating its effectiveness in high-resolution image understanding and generation tasks. Notably, FIT exhibits potential in performing end-to-end training on gigabit-scale data, such as 6400$\times$6400 images, or 160K tokens (after patch tokenization), within a memory capacity of 16GB, without requiring specific optimizations or model parallelism.

- **Summary**: High-resolution remote sensing (HRS) semantic segmentation extracts key objects from high-resolution coverage areas. However, objects of the same category within HRS images generally show significant differences in scale and shape across diverse geographical environments, making it difficult to fit the data distribution. Additionally, a complex background environment causes similar appearances of objects of different categories, which precipitates a substantial number of objects into misclassification as background. These issues make existing learning algorithms sub-optimal. In this work, we solve the above-mentioned problems by proposing a High-resolution remote sensing network (Hi-ResNet) with efficient network structure designs, which consists of a funnel module, a multi-branch module with stacks of information aggregation (IA) blocks, and a feature refinement module, sequentially, and Class-agnostic Edge Aware (CEA) loss. Specifically, we propose a funnel module to downsample, which reduces the computational cost, and extract high-resolution semantic information from the initial input image. Secondly, we downsample the processed feature images into multi-resolution branches incrementally to capture image features at different scales and apply IA blocks, which capture key latent information by leveraging attention mechanisms, for effective feature aggregation, distinguishing image features of the same class with variant scales and shapes. Finally, our feature refinement module integrate the CEA loss function, which disambiguates inter-class objects with similar shapes and increases the data distribution distance for correct predictions. With effective pre-training strategies, we demonstrated the superiority of Hi-ResNet over state-of-the-art methods on three HRS segmentation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Appearance-based gaze estimation has been actively studied in recent years. However, its generalization performance for unseen head poses is still a significant limitation for existing methods. This work proposes a generalizable multi-view gaze estimation task and a cross-view feature fusion method to address this issue. In addition to paired images, our method takes the relative rotation matrix between two cameras as additional input. The proposed network learns to extract rotatable feature representation by using relative rotation as a constraint and adaptively fuses the rotatable features via stacked fusion modules. This simple yet efficient approach significantly improves generalization performance under unseen head poses without significantly increasing computational cost. The model can be trained with random combinations of cameras without fixing the positioning and can generalize to unseen camera pairs during inference. Through experiments using multiple datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over baseline methods, including state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised learning visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) aims at learning modality-invariant features from unlabeled cross-modality dataset, which is crucial for practical applications in video surveillance systems. The key to essentially address the USL-VI-ReID task is to solve the cross-modality data association problem for further heterogeneous joint learning. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Optimal Transport Label Assignment (DOTLA) framework to simultaneously assign the generated labels from one modality to its counterpart modality. The proposed DOTLA mechanism formulates a mutual reinforcement and efficient solution to cross-modality data association, which could effectively reduce the side-effects of some insufficient and noisy label associations. Besides, we further propose a cross-modality neighbor consistency guided label refinement and regularization module, to eliminate the negative effects brought by the inaccurate supervised signals, under the assumption that the prediction or label distribution of each example should be similar to its nearest neighbors. Extensive experimental results on the public SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approach by a large margin of 7.76% mAP on average, which even surpasses some supervised VI-ReID methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce the imprecise label learning (ILL) framework, a unified approach to handle various imprecise label configurations, which are commonplace challenges in machine learning tasks. ILL leverages an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the imprecise label information, treating the precise labels as latent variables. Compared to previous versatile methods attempting to infer correct labels from the imprecise label information, our ILL framework considers all possible labeling imposed by the imprecise label information, allowing a unified solution to deal with any imprecise labels. With comprehensive experimental results, we demonstrate that ILL can seamlessly adapt to various situations, including partial label learning, semi-supervised learning, noisy label learning, and a mixture of these settings. Notably, our simple method surpasses the existing techniques for handling imprecise labels, marking the first unified framework with robust and effective performance across various imprecise labels. We believe that our approach has the potential to significantly enhance the performance of machine learning models on tasks where obtaining precise labels is expensive and complicated.

- **Summary**: The Stable Diffusion model is a prominent text-to-image generation model that relies on a text prompt as its input, which is encoded using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). However, text prompts have limitations when it comes to incorporating implicit information from reference images. Existing methods have attempted to address this limitation by employing expensive training procedures involving millions of training samples for image-to-image generation. In contrast, this paper demonstrates that the CLIP model, as utilized in Stable Diffusion, inherently possesses the ability to instantaneously convert images into text prompts. Such an image-to-prompt conversion can be achieved by utilizing a linear projection matrix that is calculated in a closed form. Moreover, the paper showcases that this capability can be further enhanced by either utilizing a small amount of similar-domain training data (approximately 100 images) or incorporating several online training steps (around 30 iterations) on the reference images. By leveraging these approaches, the proposed method offers a simple and flexible solution to bridge the gap between images and text prompts. This methodology can be applied to various tasks such as image variation and image editing, facilitating more effective and seamless interaction between images and textual prompts.

- **Summary**: We propose a cyclic generative adversarial network with spatial-wise and channel-wise attention modules for text-to-image synthesis. To accurately depict and design scenes with multiple occluded objects, we design a pre-trained ordering recovery model and a generative adversarial network to predict layout and composite novel box lunch presentations. In the experiments, we devise the Bento800 dataset to evaluate the performance of the text-to-image synthesis model and the layout generation & image composition model. This paper is the continuation of our previous paper works. We also present additional experiments and qualitative performance comparisons to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Existing end-to-end Multi-Object Tracking (e2e-MOT) methods have not surpassed non-end-to-end tracking-by-detection methods. One potential reason is its label assignment strategy during training that consistently binds the tracked objects with tracking queries and then assigns the few newborns to detection queries. With one-to-one bipartite matching, such an assignment will yield unbalanced training, i.e., scarce positive samples for detection queries, especially for an enclosed scene, as the majority of the newborns come on stage at the beginning of videos. Thus, e2e-MOT will be easier to yield a tracking terminal without renewal or re-initialization, compared to other tracking-by-detection methods. To alleviate this problem, we present Co-MOT, a simple and effective method to facilitate e2e-MOT by a novel coopetition label assignment with a shadow concept. Specifically, we add tracked objects to the matching targets for detection queries when performing the label assignment for training the intermediate decoders. For query initialization, we expand each query by a set of shadow counterparts with limited disturbance to itself. With extensive ablations, Co-MOT achieves superior performance without extra costs, e.g., 69.4% HOTA on DanceTrack and 52.8% TETA on BDD100K. Impressively, Co-MOT only requires 38\% FLOPs of MOTRv2 to attain a similar performance, resulting in the 1.4$\times$ faster inference speed.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of in-the-wild videos has greatly expanded the Video Quality Assessment (VQA) problem. Unlike early definitions that usually focus on limited distortion types, VQA on in-the-wild videos is especially challenging as it could be affected by complicated factors, including various distortions and diverse contents. Though subjective studies have collected overall quality scores for these videos, how the abstract quality scores relate with specific factors is still obscure, hindering VQA methods from more concrete quality evaluations (e.g. sharpness of a video). To solve this problem, we collect over two million opinions on 4,543 in-the-wild videos on 13 dimensions of quality-related factors, including in-capture authentic distortions (e.g. motion blur, noise, flicker), errors introduced by compression and transmission, and higher-level experiences on semantic contents and aesthetic issues (e.g. composition, camera trajectory), to establish the multi-dimensional Maxwell database. Specifically, we ask the subjects to label among a positive, a negative, and a neutral choice for each dimension. These explanation-level opinions allow us to measure the relationships between specific quality factors and abstract subjective quality ratings, and to benchmark different categories of VQA algorithms on each dimension, so as to more comprehensively analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, we propose the MaxVQA, a language-prompted VQA approach that modifies vision-language foundation model CLIP to better capture important quality issues as observed in our analyses. The MaxVQA can jointly evaluate various specific quality factors and final quality scores with state-of-the-art accuracy on all dimensions, and superb generalization ability on existing datasets.

- **Summary**: Although remarkable progress has been made in recent years, current multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) research is still bounded by the lack of real ground truth, objective evaluation function, and robust fusion strategy. In this paper, we study the MEF problem from a new perspective. We don't utilize any synthesized ground truth, design any loss function, or develop any fusion strategy. Our proposed method EMEF takes advantage of the wisdom of multiple imperfect MEF contributors including both conventional and deep learning-based methods. Specifically, EMEF consists of two main stages: pre-train an imitator network and tune the imitator in the runtime. In the first stage, we make a unified network imitate different MEF targets in a style modulation way. In the second stage, we tune the imitator network by optimizing the style code, in order to find an optimal fusion result for each input pair. In the experiment, we construct EMEF from four state-of-the-art MEF methods and then make comparisons with the individuals and several other competitive methods on the latest released MEF benchmark dataset. The promising experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble framework can "get the best of all worlds". The code is available at https://github.com/medalwill/EMEF.

- **Summary**: Robust multi-view learning with incomplete information has received significant attention due to issues such as incomplete correspondences and incomplete instances that commonly affect real-world multi-view applications. Existing approaches heavily rely on paired samples to realign or impute defective ones, but such preconditions cannot always be satisfied in practice due to the complexity of data collection and transmission. To address this problem, we present a novel framework called SeMantic Invariance LEarning (SMILE) for multi-view clustering with incomplete information that does not require any paired samples. To be specific, we discover the existence of invariant semantic distribution across different views, which enables SMILE to alleviate the cross-view discrepancy to learn consensus semantics without requiring any paired samples. The resulting consensus semantics remains unaffected by cross-view distribution shifts, making them useful for realigning/imputing defective instances and forming clusters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMILE through extensive comparison experiments with 13 state-of-the-art baselines on five benchmarks. Our approach improves the clustering accuracy of NoisyMNIST from 19.3\%/23.2\% to 82.7\%/69.0\% when the correspondences/instances are fully incomplete. We will release the code after acceptance.

- **Summary**: Many-to-many multimodal summarization (M$^3$S) task aims to generate summaries in any language with document inputs in any language and the corresponding image sequence, which essentially comprises multimodal monolingual summarization (MMS) and multimodal cross-lingual summarization (MXLS) tasks. Although much work has been devoted to either MMS or MXLS and has obtained increasing attention in recent years, little research pays attention to the M$^3$S task. Besides, existing studies mainly focus on 1) utilizing MMS to enhance MXLS via knowledge distillation without considering the performance of MMS or 2) improving MMS models by filtering summary-unrelated visual features with implicit learning or explicitly complex training objectives. In this paper, we first introduce a general and practical task, i.e., M$^3$S. Further, we propose a dual knowledge distillation and target-oriented vision modeling framework for the M$^3$S task. Specifically, the dual knowledge distillation method guarantees that the knowledge of MMS and MXLS can be transferred to each other and thus mutually prompt both of them. To offer target-oriented visual features, a simple yet effective target-oriented contrastive objective is designed and responsible for discarding needless visual information. Extensive experiments on the many-to-many setting show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Additionally, we will contribute a many-to-many multimodal summarization (M$^3$Sum) dataset.

- **Summary**: For autonomous driving, radar sensors provide superior reliability regardless of weather conditions as well as a significantly high detection range. State-of-the-art algorithms for environment perception based on radar scans build up on deep neural network architectures that can be costly in terms of memory and computation. By processing radar scans as point clouds, however, an increase in efficiency can be achieved in this respect. While Convolutional Neural Networks show superior performance on pattern recognition of regular data formats like images, the concept of convolutions is not yet fully established in the domain of radar detections represented as point clouds. The main challenge in convolving point clouds lies in their irregular and unordered data format and the associated permutation variance. Therefore, we apply a deep-learning based method introduced by PointCNN that weights and permutes grouped radar detections allowing the resulting permutation invariant cluster to be convolved. In addition, we further adapt this algorithm to radar-specific properties through distance-dependent clustering and pre-processing of input point clouds. Finally, we show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that are based on PointNet++ on the task of semantic segmentation of radar point clouds.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the computational offloading of video action recognition in edge computing. To achieve effective semantic information extraction and compression, following semantic communication we propose a novel spatiotemporal attention-based autoencoder (STAE) architecture, including a frame attention module and a spatial attention module, to evaluate the importance of frames and pixels in each frame. Additionally, we use entropy encoding to remove statistical redundancy in the compressed data to further reduce communication overhead. At the receiver, we develop a lightweight decoder that leverages a 3D-2D CNN combined architecture to reconstruct missing information by simultaneously learning temporal and spatial information from the received data to improve accuracy. To fasten convergence, we use a step-by-step approach to train the resulting STAE-based vision transformer (ViT_STAE) models. Experimental results show that ViT_STAE can compress the video dataset HMDB51 by 104x with only 5% accuracy loss, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline DeepISC. The proposed ViT_STAE achieves faster inference and higher accuracy than the DeepISC-based ViT model under time-varying wireless channel, which highlights the effectiveness of STAE in guaranteeing higher accuracy under time constraints.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image generation models have shown promising results in generating high-fidelity photo-realistic images. In parallel, the problem of data scarcity has brought a growing interest in employing AIGC technology for high-quality data expansion. However, this paradigm requires well-designed prompt engineering that cost-less data expansion and labeling remain under-explored. Inspired by LLM's powerful capability in task guidance, we propose a new paradigm of annotated data expansion named as ChatGenImage. The core idea behind it is to leverage the complementary strengths of diverse models to establish a highly effective and user-friendly pipeline for interactive data augmentation. In this work, we extensively study how LLMs communicate with AIGC model to achieve more controllable image generation and make the first attempt to collaborate them for automatic data augmentation for a variety of downstream tasks. Finally, we present fascinating results obtained from our ChatGenImage framework and demonstrate the powerful potential of our synthetic data for systematic vision adaptation.

- **Summary**: Iris presentation attack detection (PAD) has achieved great success under intra-domain settings but easily degrades on unseen domains. Conventional domain generalization methods mitigate the gap by learning domain-invariant features. However, they ignore the discriminative information in the domain-specific features. Moreover, we usually face a more realistic scenario with only one single domain available for training. To tackle the above issues, we propose a Single Domain Dynamic Generalization (SDDG) framework, which simultaneously exploits domain-invariant and domain-specific features on a per-sample basis and learns to generalize to various unseen domains with numerous natural images. Specifically, a dynamic block is designed to adaptively adjust the network with a dynamic adaptor. And an information maximization loss is further combined to increase diversity. The whole network is integrated into the meta-learning paradigm. We generate amplitude perturbed images and cover diverse domains with natural images. Therefore, the network can learn to generalize to the perturbed domains in the meta-test phase. Extensive experiments show the proposed method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art on LivDet-Iris 2017 dataset.

- **Summary**: High-quality data is crucial for the success of machine learning, but labeling large datasets is often a time-consuming and costly process. While semi-supervised learning can help mitigate the need for labeled data, label quality remains an open issue due to ambiguity and disagreement among annotators. Thus, we use proposal-guided annotations as one option which leads to more consistency between annotators. However, proposing a label increases the probability of the annotators deciding in favor of this specific label. This introduces a bias which we can simulate and remove. We propose a new method CleverLabel for Cost-effective LabEling using Validated proposal-guidEd annotations and Repaired LABELs. CleverLabel can reduce labeling costs by up to 30.0%, while achieving a relative improvement in Kullback-Leibler divergence of up to 29.8% compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a multi-domain real-world image classification benchmark. CleverLabel offers a novel solution to the challenge of efficiently labeling large datasets while also improving the label quality.

- **Summary**: X-ray imaging is widely used for non-destructive detection of defects in industrial products on a conveyor belt. Real-time detection requires highly accurate, robust, and fast algorithms to analyze X-ray images. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) satisfy these requirements if a large amount of labeled data is available. To overcome the challenge of collecting these data, different methods of X-ray image generation can be considered. Depending on the desired level of similarity to real data, various physical effects either should be simulated or can be ignored. X-ray scattering is known to be computationally expensive to simulate, and this effect can heavily influence the accuracy of a generated X-ray image. We propose a methodology for quantitative evaluation of the effect of scattering on defect detection. This methodology compares the accuracy of DCNNs trained on different versions of the same data that include and exclude the scattering signal. We use the Probability of Detection (POD) curves to find the size of the smallest defect that can be detected with a DCNN and evaluate how this size is affected by the choice of training data. We apply the proposed methodology to a model problem of defect detection in cylinders. Our results show that the exclusion of the scattering signal from the training data has the largest effect on the smallest detectable defects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that accurate inspection is more reliant on high-quality training data for images with a high quantity of scattering. We discuss how the presented methodology can be used for other tasks and objects.

- **Summary**: Combating disinformation is one of the burning societal crises -- about 67% of the American population believes that disinformation produces a lot of uncertainty, and 10% of them knowingly propagate disinformation. Evidence shows that disinformation can manipulate democratic processes and public opinion, causing disruption in the share market, panic and anxiety in society, and even death during crises. Therefore, disinformation should be identified promptly and, if possible, mitigated. With approximately 3.2 billion images and 720,000 hours of video shared online daily on social media platforms, scalable detection of multimodal disinformation requires efficient fact verification. Despite progress in automatic text-based fact verification (e.g., FEVER, LIAR), the research community lacks substantial effort in multimodal fact verification. To address this gap, we introduce FACTIFY 3M, a dataset of 3 million samples that pushes the boundaries of the domain of fact verification via a multimodal fake news dataset, in addition to offering explainability through the concept of 5W question-answering. Salient features of the dataset include: (i) textual claims, (ii) ChatGPT-generated paraphrased claims, (iii) associated images, (iv) stable diffusion-generated additional images (i.e., visual paraphrases), (v) pixel-level image heatmap to foster image-text explainability of the claim, (vi) 5W QA pairs, and (vii) adversarial fake news stories.

- **Summary**: We present READMem (Robust Embedding Association for a Diverse Memory), a modular framework for semi-automatic video object segmentation (sVOS) methods designed to handle unconstrained videos. Contemporary sVOS works typically aggregate video frames in an ever-expanding memory, demanding high hardware resources for long-term applications. To mitigate memory requirements and prevent near object duplicates (caused by information of adjacent frames), previous methods introduce a hyper-parameter that controls the frequency of frames eligible to be stored. This parameter has to be adjusted according to concrete video properties (such as rapidity of appearance changes and video length) and does not generalize well. Instead, we integrate the embedding of a new frame into the memory only if it increases the diversity of the memory content. Furthermore, we propose a robust association of the embeddings stored in the memory with query embeddings during the update process. Our approach avoids the accumulation of redundant data, allowing us in return, to restrict the memory size and prevent extreme memory demands in long videos. We extend popular sVOS baselines with READMem, which previously showed limited performance on long videos. Our approach achieves competitive results on the Long-time Video dataset (LV1) while not hindering performance on short sequences. Our code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art deep neural networks have proven to be highly powerful in a broad range of tasks, including semantic image segmentation. However, these networks are vulnerable against adversarial attacks, i.e., non-perceptible perturbations added to the input image causing incorrect predictions, which is hazardous in safety-critical applications like automated driving. Adversarial examples and defense strategies are well studied for the image classification task, while there has been limited research in the context of semantic segmentation. First works however show that the segmentation outcome can be severely distorted by adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-based method for the detection of adversarial attacks in semantic segmentation. We observe that uncertainty as for example captured by the entropy of the output distribution behaves differently on clean and perturbed images using this property to distinguish between the two cases. Our method works in a light-weight and post-processing manner, i.e., we do not modify the model or need knowledge of the process used for generating adversarial examples. In a thorough empirical analysis, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to detect perturbed images across multiple types of adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a cost-effective and scalable approach to edit pre-trained models directly in weight space: By adding the fine-tuned weights of different tasks, the model's performance can be improved on these tasks, while negating them leads to task forgetting. Yet, our understanding of the effectiveness of task arithmetic and its underlying principles remains limited. We present a comprehensive study of task arithmetic in vision-language models and show that weight disentanglement is the crucial factor that makes it effective. This property arises during pre-training and manifests when distinct directions in weight space govern separate, localized regions in function space associated with the tasks. Notably, we show that fine-tuning models in their tangent space by linearizing them amplifies weight disentanglement. This leads to substantial performance improvements across multiple task arithmetic benchmarks and diverse models. Building on these findings, we provide theoretical and empirical analyses of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of these models and establish a compelling link between task arithmetic and the spatial localization of the NTK eigenfunctions. Overall, our work uncovers novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of task arithmetic and offers a more reliable and effective approach to edit pre-trained models through the NTK linearization.

- **Summary**: Real-world data tends to follow a long-tailed distribution, where the class imbalance results in dominance of the head classes during training. In this paper, we propose a frustratingly simple but effective step-wise learning framework to gradually enhance the capability of the model in detecting all categories of long-tailed datasets. Specifically, we build smooth-tail data where the long-tailed distribution of categories decays smoothly to correct the bias towards head classes. We pre-train a model on the whole long-tailed data to preserve discriminability between all categories. We then fine-tune the class-agnostic modules of the pre-trained model on the head class dominant replay data to get a head class expert model with improved decision boundaries from all categories. Finally, we train a unified model on the tail class dominant replay data while transferring knowledge from the head class expert model to ensure accurate detection of all categories. Extensive experiments on long-tailed datasets LVIS v0.5 and LVIS v1.0 demonstrate the superior performance of our method, where we can improve the AP with ResNet-50 backbone from 27.0% to 30.3% AP, and especially for the rare categories from 15.5% to 24.9% AP. Our best model using ResNet-101 backbone can achieve 30.7% AP, which suppresses all existing detectors using the same backbone.

- **Summary**: No significant work has been done to directly merge two partially overlapping scenes using NeRF representations. Given pre-trained NeRF models of a 3D scene with partial overlapping, this paper aligns them with a rigid transform, by generalizing the traditional registration pipeline, that is, key point detection and point set registration, to operate on 3D density fields. To describe corner points as key points in 3D, we propose to use universal pre-trained descriptor-generating neural networks that can be trained and tested on different scenes. We perform experiments to demonstrate that the descriptor networks can be conveniently trained using a contrastive learning strategy. We demonstrate that our method, as a global approach, can effectively register NeRF models, thus making possible future large-scale NeRF construction by registering its smaller and overlapping NeRFs captured individually.

- **Summary**: Brain tumors are among the most fatal and devastating diseases, often resulting in significantly reduced life expectancy. An accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is crucial to devise treatment plans that can extend the lives of affected individuals. Manually identifying and analyzing large volumes of MRI data is both challenging and time-consuming. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a reliable deep learning (DL) model to accurately diagnose brain tumors. In this study, we propose a novel DL approach based on transfer learning to effectively classify brain tumors. Our novel method incorporates extensive pre-processing, transfer learning architecture reconstruction, and fine-tuning. We employ several transfer learning algorithms, including Xception, ResNet50V2, InceptionResNetV2, and DenseNet201. Our experiments used the Figshare MRI brain tumor dataset, comprising 3,064 images, and achieved accuracy scores of 99.40%, 99.68%, 99.36%, and 98.72% for Xception, ResNet50V2, InceptionResNetV2, and DenseNet201, respectively. Our findings reveal that ResNet50V2 achieves the highest accuracy rate of 99.68% on the Figshare MRI brain tumor dataset, outperforming existing models. Therefore, our proposed model's ability to accurately classify brain tumors in a short timeframe can aid neurologists and clinicians in making prompt and precise diagnostic decisions for brain tumor patients.

- **Summary**: Multispectral methods have gained considerable attention due to their promising performance across various fields. However, most existing methods cannot effectively utilize information from two modalities while optimizing time efficiency. These methods often prioritize accuracy or time efficiency, leaving room for improvement in their performance. To this end, we propose a new method bright channel prior attention for enhancing pedestrian detection in low-light conditions by integrating image enhancement and detection within a unified framework. The method uses the V-channel of the HSV image of the thermal image as an attention map to trigger the unsupervised auto-encoder for visible light images, which gradually emphasizes pedestrian features across layers. Moreover, we utilize unsupervised bright channel prior algorithms to address light compensation in low light images. The proposed method includes a self-attention enhancement module and a detection module, which work together to improve object detection. An initial illumination map is estimated using the BCP, guiding the learning of the self-attention map from the enhancement network to obtain more informative representation focused on pedestrians. The extensive experiments show effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through.

- **Summary**: Uncertainty estimation is critical for numerous applications of deep neural networks and draws growing attention from researchers. Here, we demonstrate an uncertainty quantification approach for deep neural networks used in inverse problems based on cycle consistency. We build forward-backward cycles using the physical forward model available and a trained deep neural network solving the inverse problem at hand, and accordingly derive uncertainty estimators through regression analysis on the consistency of these forward-backward cycles. We theoretically analyze cycle consistency metrics and derive their relationship with respect to uncertainty, bias, and robustness of the neural network inference. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these cycle consistency-based uncertainty estimators, we classified corrupted and out-of-distribution input image data using some of the widely used image deblurring and super-resolution neural networks as testbeds. The blind testing of our method outperformed other models in identifying unseen input data corruption and distribution shifts. This work provides a simple-to-implement and rapid uncertainty quantification method that can be universally applied to various neural networks used for solving inverse problems.

- **Summary**: Data and model are the undoubtable two supporting pillars for LiDAR object detection. However, data-centric works have fallen far behind compared with the ever-growing list of fancy new models. In this work, we systematically study the synthesis-based LiDAR data augmentation approach (so-called GT-Aug) which offers maxium controllability over generated data samples. We pinpoint the main shortcoming of existing works is introducing unrealistic LiDAR scan patterns during GT-Aug. In light of this finding, we propose Real-Aug, a synthesis-based augmentation method which prioritizes on generating realistic LiDAR scans. Our method consists a reality-conforming scene composition module which handles the details of the composition and a real-synthesis mixing up training strategy which gradually adapts the data distribution from synthetic data to the real one. To verify the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct extensive ablation studies and validate the proposed Real-Aug on a wide combination of detectors and datasets. We achieve a state-of-the-art 0.744 NDS and 0.702 mAP on nuScenes test set. The code shall be released soon.

- **Summary**: Shape encoding and shape analysis are valuable tools for comparing shapes and for dimensionality reduction. A specific framework for shape analysis is the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework, which is capable of shape matching and dimensionality reduction. Researchers have recently introduced neural networks into this framework. However, these works can not match more than two objects simultaneously or have suboptimal performance in shape variability modeling. The latter limitation occurs as the works do not use state-of-the-art shape encoding methods. Moreover, the literature does not discuss the connection between the LDDMM Riemannian distance and the Riemannian geometry for deep learning literature. Our work aims to bridge this gap by demonstrating how LDDMM can integrate Riemannian geometry into deep learning. Furthermore, we discuss how deep learning solves and generalizes shape matching and dimensionality reduction formulations of LDDMM. We achieve both goals by designing a novel implicit encoder for shapes. This model extends a neural network-based algorithm for LDDMM-based pairwise registration, results in a nonlinear manifold PCA, and adds a Riemannian geometry aspect to deep learning models for shape variability modeling. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Riemannian geometry component improves the reconstruction procedure of the implicit encoder in terms of reconstruction quality and stability to noise. We hope our discussion paves the way to more research into how Riemannian geometry, shape/image analysis, and deep learning can be combined.

- **Summary**: Physical world adversarial attack is a highly practical and threatening attack, which fools real world deep learning systems by generating conspicuous and maliciously crafted real world artifacts. In physical world attacks, evaluating naturalness is highly emphasized since human can easily detect and remove unnatural attacks. However, current studies evaluate naturalness in a case-by-case fashion, which suffers from errors, bias and inconsistencies. In this paper, we take the first step to benchmark and assess visual naturalness of physical world attacks, taking autonomous driving scenario as the first attempt. First, to benchmark attack naturalness, we contribute the first Physical Attack Naturalness (PAN) dataset with human rating and gaze. PAN verifies several insights for the first time: naturalness is (disparately) affected by contextual features (i.e., environmental and semantic variations) and correlates with behavioral feature (i.e., gaze signal). Second, to automatically assess attack naturalness that aligns with human ratings, we further introduce Dual Prior Alignment (DPA) network, which aims to embed human knowledge into model reasoning process. Specifically, DPA imitates human reasoning in naturalness assessment by rating prior alignment and mimics human gaze behavior by attentive prior alignment. We hope our work fosters researches to improve and automatically assess naturalness of physical world attacks. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/zhangsn-19/PAN.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Contrastive Representation (MCR) learning aims to encode different modalities into a semantically aligned shared space. This paradigm shows remarkable generalization ability on numerous downstream tasks across various modalities. However, the reliance on massive high-quality data pairs limits its further development on more modalities. This paper proposes a novel training-efficient method for learning MCR without paired data called Connecting Multi-modal Contrastive Representations (C-MCR). Specifically, given two existing MCRs pre-trained on (A, B) and (B, C) modality pairs, we project them to a new space and use the data from the overlapping modality B to aligning the two MCRs in the new space. Meanwhile, since the modality pairs (A, B) and (B, C) are already aligned within each MCR, the connection learned by overlapping modality can also be transferred to non-overlapping modality pair (A, C). To unleash the potential of C-MCR, we further introduce a semantic-enhanced inter- and intra-MCR connection method. We first enhance the semantic consistency and completion of embeddings across different modalities for more robust alignment. Then we utilize the inter-MCR alignment to establish the connection, and employ the intra-MCR alignment to better maintain the connection for inputs from non-overlapping modalities. We take the field of audio-visual contrastive learning as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of C-MCR. We connect pre-trained CLIP and CLAP models via texts to derive audio-visual contrastive representations. Remarkably, without using any paired audio-visual data and further tuning, C-MCR achieves state-of-the-art performance on six datasets across three audio-visual downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we tackle the problem of sign language translation (SLT) without gloss annotations. Although intermediate representation like gloss has been proven effective, gloss annotations are hard to acquire, especially in large quantities. This limits the domain coverage of translation datasets, thus handicapping real-world applications. To mitigate this problem, we design the Gloss-Free End-to-end sign language translation framework (GloFE). Our method improves the performance of SLT in the gloss-free setting by exploiting the shared underlying semantics of signs and the corresponding spoken translation. Common concepts are extracted from the text and used as a weak form of intermediate representation. The global embedding of these concepts is used as a query for cross-attention to find the corresponding information within the learned visual features. In a contrastive manner, we encourage the similarity of query results between samples containing such concepts and decrease those that do not. We obtained state-of-the-art results on large-scale datasets, including OpenASL and How2Sign. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/HenryLittle/GloFE.

- **Summary**: The ability to pick up on language signals in an ongoing interaction is crucial for future machine learning models to collaborate and interact with humans naturally. In this paper, we present an initial study that evaluates intra-episodic feedback given in a collaborative setting. We use a referential language game as a controllable example of a task-oriented collaborative joint activity. A teacher utters a referring expression generated by a well-known symbolic algorithm (the "Incremental Algorithm") as an initial instruction and then monitors the follower's actions to possibly intervene with intra-episodic feedback (which does not explicitly have to be requested). We frame this task as a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and learn a follower policy for a heuristic teacher. Our results show that intra-episodic feedback allows the follower to generalize on aspects of scene complexity and performs better than providing only the initial statement.

- **Summary**: The issue of detecting deepfakes has garnered significant attention in the research community, with the goal of identifying facial manipulations for abuse prevention. Although recent studies have focused on developing generalized models that can detect various types of deepfakes, their performance is not always be reliable and stable, which poses limitations in real-world applications. Instead of learning a forgery detector, in this paper, we propose a novel framework - Integrity Encryptor, aiming to protect portraits in a proactive strategy. Our methodology involves covertly encoding messages that are closely associated with key facial attributes into authentic images prior to their public release. Unlike authentic images, where the hidden messages can be extracted with precision, manipulating the facial attributes through deepfake techniques can disrupt the decoding process. Consequently, the modified facial attributes serve as a mean of detecting manipulated images through a comparison of the decoded messages. Our encryption approach is characterized by its brevity and efficiency, and the resulting method exhibits a good robustness against typical image processing traces, such as image degradation and noise. When compared to baselines that struggle to detect deepfakes in a black-box setting, our method utilizing conditional encryption showcases superior performance when presented with a range of different types of forgeries. In experiments conducted on our protected data, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation is a recent popular problem that aims to synthesize general audio given text descriptions. Previous methods utilized latent diffusion models to learn audio embedding in a latent space with text embedding as the condition. However, they ignored the synchronization between audio and visual content in the video, and tended to generate audio mismatching from video frames. In this work, we propose a novel and personalized text-to-sound generation approach with visual alignment based on latent diffusion models, namely DiffAVA, that can simply fine-tune lightweight visual-text alignment modules with frozen modality-specific encoders to update visual-aligned text embeddings as the condition. Specifically, our DiffAVA leverages a multi-head attention transformer to aggregate temporal information from video features, and a dual multi-modal residual network to fuse temporal visual representations with text embeddings. Then, a contrastive learning objective is applied to match visual-aligned text embeddings with audio features. Experimental results on the AudioCaps dataset demonstrate that the proposed DiffAVA can achieve competitive performance on visual-aligned text-to-audio generation.

- **Summary**: Exploring a substantial amount of unlabeled data, semi-supervised learning (SSL) boosts the recognition performance when only a limited number of labels are provided. However, traditional methods assume that the data distribution is class-balanced, which is difficult to achieve in reality due to the long-tailed nature of real-world data. While the data imbalance problem has been extensively studied in supervised learning (SL) paradigms, directly transferring existing approaches to SSL is nontrivial, as prior knowledge about data distribution remains unknown in SSL. In light of this, we propose Balanced Memory Bank (BMB), a semi-supervised framework for long-tailed recognition. The core of BMB is an online-updated memory bank that caches historical features with their corresponding pseudo labels, and the memory is also carefully maintained to ensure the data therein are class-rebalanced. Additionally, an adaptive weighting module is introduced to work jointly with the memory bank so as to further re-calibrate the biased training process. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and demonstrate, among other things, that BMB surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by clear margins, for example 8.2$\%$ on the 1$\%$ labeled subset of ImageNet127 (with a resolution of 64$\times$64) and 4.3$\%$ on the 50$\%$ labeled subset of ImageNet-LT.

- **Summary**: This work studies how to transform an album to vivid and coherent stories, a task we refer to as "album storytelling". While this task can help preserve memories and facilitate experience sharing, it remains an underexplored area in current literature. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is now possible to generate lengthy, coherent text, opening up the opportunity to develop an AI assistant for album storytelling. One natural approach is to use caption models to describe each photo in the album, and then use LLMs to summarize and rewrite the generated captions into an engaging story. However, we find this often results in stories containing hallucinated information that contradicts the images, as each generated caption ("story-agnostic") is not always about the description related to the whole story or miss some necessary information. To address these limitations, we propose a new iterative album storytelling pipeline. Specifically, we start with an initial story and build a story-aware caption model to refine the captions using the whole story as guidance. The polished captions are then fed into the LLMs to generate a new refined story. This process is repeated iteratively until the story contains minimal factual errors while maintaining coherence. To evaluate our proposed pipeline, we introduce a new dataset of image collections from vlogs and a set of systematic evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that our method effectively generates more accurate and engaging stories for albums, with enhanced coherence and vividness.

- **Summary**: Short-term action anticipation (STA) in first-person videos is a challenging task that involves understanding the next active object interactions and predicting future actions. Existing action anticipation methods have primarily focused on utilizing features extracted from video clips, but often overlooked the importance of objects and their interactions. To this end, we propose a novel approach that applies a guided attention mechanism between the objects, and the spatiotemporal features extracted from video clips, enhancing the motion and contextual information, and further decoding the object-centric and motion-centric information to address the problem of STA in egocentric videos. Our method, GANO (Guided Attention for Next active Objects) is a multi-modal, end-to-end, single transformer-based network. The experimental results performed on the largest egocentric dataset demonstrate that GANO outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for the prediction of the next active object label, its bounding box location, the corresponding future action, and the time to contact the object. The ablation study shows the positive contribution of the guided attention mechanism compared to other fusion methods. Moreover, it is possible to improve the next active object location and class label prediction results of GANO by just appending the learnable object tokens with the region of interest embeddings.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have recently achieved astonishing performance in generating high-fidelity photo-realistic images. Given their huge success, it is still unclear whether synthetic images are applicable for knowledge distillation when real images are unavailable. In this paper, we extensively study whether and how synthetic images produced from state-of-the-art diffusion models can be used for knowledge distillation without access to real images, and obtain three key conclusions: (1) synthetic data from diffusion models can easily lead to state-of-the-art performance among existing synthesis-based distillation methods, (2) low-fidelity synthetic images are better teaching materials, and (3) relatively weak classifiers are better teachers.

- **Summary**: We propose Gated Stereo, a high-resolution and long-range depth estimation technique that operates on active gated stereo images. Using active and high dynamic range passive captures, Gated Stereo exploits multi-view cues alongside time-of-flight intensity cues from active gating. To this end, we propose a depth estimation method with a monocular and stereo depth prediction branch which are combined in a final fusion stage. Each block is supervised through a combination of supervised and gated self-supervision losses. To facilitate training and validation, we acquire a long-range synchronized gated stereo dataset for automotive scenarios. We find that the method achieves an improvement of more than 50 % MAE compared to the next best RGB stereo method, and 74 % MAE to existing monocular gated methods for distances up to 160 m. Our code,models and datasets are available here.

- **Summary**: We present a new self-supervised paradigm on point cloud sequence understanding. Inspired by the discriminative and generative self-supervised methods, we design two tasks, namely point cloud sequence based Contrastive Prediction and Reconstruction (CPR), to collaboratively learn more comprehensive spatiotemporal representations. Specifically, dense point cloud segments are first input into an encoder to extract embeddings. All but the last ones are then aggregated by a context-aware autoregressor to make predictions for the last target segment. Towards the goal of modeling multi-granularity structures, local and global contrastive learning are performed between predictions and targets. To further improve the generalization of representations, the predictions are also utilized to reconstruct raw point cloud sequences by a decoder, where point cloud colorization is employed to discriminate against different frames. By combining classic contrast and reconstruction paradigms, it makes the learned representations with both global discrimination and local perception. We conduct experiments on four point cloud sequence benchmarks, and report the results on action recognition and gesture recognition under multiple experimental settings. The performances are comparable with supervised methods and show powerful transferability.

- **Summary**: Traditional methods for learning with the presence of noisy labels have successfully handled datasets with artificially injected noise but still fall short of adequately handling real-world noise. With the increasing use of meta-learning in the diverse fields of machine learning, researchers leveraged auxiliary small clean datasets to meta-correct the training labels. Nonetheless, existing meta-label correction approaches are not fully exploiting their potential. In this study, we propose an Enhanced Meta Label Correction approach abbreviated as EMLC for the learning with noisy labels (LNL) problem. We re-examine the meta-learning process and introduce faster and more accurate meta-gradient derivations. We propose a novel teacher architecture tailored explicitly to the LNL problem, equipped with novel training objectives. EMLC outperforms prior approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results in all standard benchmarks. Notably, EMLC enhances the previous art on the noisy real-world dataset Clothing1M by $1.52\%$ while requiring $\times 0.5$ the time per epoch and with much faster convergence of the meta-objective when compared to the baseline approach.

- **Summary**: Text-based person search (TBPS) aims to retrieve the images of the target person from a large image gallery based on a given natural language description. Existing methods are dominated by training models with parallel image-text pairs, which are very costly to collect. In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore TBPS without parallel image-text data ($\mu$-TBPS), in which only non-parallel images and texts, or even image-only data, can be adopted. Towards this end, we propose a two-stage framework, generation-then-retrieval (GTR), to first generate the corresponding pseudo text for each image and then perform the retrieval in a supervised manner. In the generation stage, we propose a fine-grained image captioning strategy to obtain an enriched description of the person image, which firstly utilizes a set of instruction prompts to activate the off-the-shelf pretrained vision-language model to capture and generate fine-grained person attributes, and then converts the extracted attributes into a textual description via the finetuned large language model or the hand-crafted template. In the retrieval stage, considering the noise interference of the generated texts for training model, we develop a confidence score-based training scheme by enabling more reliable texts to contribute more during the training. Experimental results on multiple TBPS benchmarks (i.e., CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid) show that the proposed GTR can achieve a promising performance without relying on parallel image-text data.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code and trained models are available at https://github.com/zhengchen1999/HI-Diff.

- **Summary**: At the heart of foundation models is the philosophy of "more is different", exemplified by the astonishing success in computer vision and natural language processing. However, the challenges of optimization and inherent complexity of transformer models call for a paradigm shift towards simplicity. In this study, we introduce VanillaNet, a neural network architecture that embraces elegance in design. By avoiding high depth, shortcuts, and intricate operations like self-attention, VanillaNet is refreshingly concise yet remarkably powerful. Each layer is carefully crafted to be compact and straightforward, with nonlinear activation functions pruned after training to restore the original architecture. VanillaNet overcomes the challenges of inherent complexity, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments. Its easy-to-understand and highly simplified architecture opens new possibilities for efficient deployment. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that VanillaNet delivers performance on par with renowned deep neural networks and vision transformers, showcasing the power of minimalism in deep learning. This visionary journey of VanillaNet has significant potential to redefine the landscape and challenge the status quo of foundation model, setting a new path for elegant and effective model design.

### Why current rain denoising models fail on CycleGAN created rain images in autonomous driving

- **Summary**: One of the main tasks of an autonomous agent in a vehicle is to correctly perceive its environment. Much of the data that needs to be processed is collected by optical sensors such as cameras. Unfortunately, the data collected in this way can be affected by a variety of factors, including environmental influences such as inclement weather conditions (e.g., rain). Such noisy data can cause autonomous agents to take wrong decisions with potentially fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the rain image challenge by two steps: First, rain is artificially added to a set of clear-weather condition images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This yields good/bad weather image pairs for training de-raining models. This artificial generation of rain images is sufficiently realistic as in 7 out of 10 cases, human test subjects believed the generated rain images to be real. In a second step, this paired good/bad weather image data is used to train two rain denoising models, one based primarily on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the other using a Vision Transformer. This rain de-noising step showed limited performance as the quality gain was only about 15%. This lack of performance on realistic rain images as used in our study is likely due to current rain de-noising models being developed for simplistic rain overlay data. Our study shows that there is ample space for improvement of de-raining models in autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: The learned denoising-based approximate message passing (LDAMP) algorithm has attracted great attention for image compressed sensing (CS) tasks. However, it has two issues: first, its global measurement model severely restricts its applicability to high-dimensional images, and its block-based measurement method exhibits obvious block artifacts; second, the denoiser in the LDAMP is too simple, and existing denoisers have limited ability in detail recovery. In this paper, to overcome the issues and develop a high-performance LDAMP method for image block compressed sensing (BCS), we propose a novel sparsity and coefficient permutation-based AMP (SCP-AMP) method consisting of the block-based sampling and the two-domain reconstruction modules. In the sampling module, SCP-AMP adopts a discrete cosine transform (DCT) based sparsity strategy to reduce the impact of the high-frequency coefficient on the reconstruction, followed by a coefficient permutation strategy to avoid block artifacts. In the reconstruction module, a two-domain AMP method with DCT domain noise correction and pixel domain denoising is proposed for iterative reconstruction. Regarding the denoiser, we proposed a multi-level deep attention network (MDANet) to enhance the texture details by employing multi-level features and multiple attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed SCP-AMP method achieved better reconstruction accuracy than other state-of-the-art BCS algorithms in terms of both visual perception and objective metrics.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a highly flexible, quantized, memory-efficient, and ultra-lightweight object detection network, called TinyissimoYOLO. It aims to enable object detection on microcontrollers in the power domain of milliwatts, with less than 0.5MB memory available for storing convolutional neural network (CNN) weights. The proposed quantized network architecture with 422k parameters, enables real-time object detection on embedded microcontrollers, and it has been evaluated to exploit CNN accelerators. In particular, the proposed network has been deployed on the MAX78000 microcontroller achieving high frame-rate of up to 180fps and an ultra-low energy consumption of only 196{\mu}J per inference with an inference efficiency of more than 106 MAC/Cycle. TinyissimoYOLO can be trained for any multi-object detection. However, considering the small network size, adding object detection classes will increase the size and memory consumption of the network, thus object detection with up to 3 classes is demonstrated. Furthermore, the network is trained using quantization-aware training and deployed with 8-bit quantization on different microcontrollers, such as STM32H7A3, STM32L4R9, Apollo4b and on the MAX78000's CNN accelerator. Performance evaluations are presented in this paper.

- **Summary**: We propose MFT -- Multi-Flow dense Tracker -- a novel method for dense, pixel-level, long-term tracking. The approach exploits optical flows estimated not only between consecutive frames, but also for pairs of frames at logarithmically spaced intervals. It then selects the most reliable sequence of flows on the basis of estimates of its geometric accuracy and the probability of occlusion, both provided by a pre-trained CNN.   We show that MFT achieves state-of-the-art results on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS benchmark, outperforming the baselines, their combination, and published methods by a significant margin, achieving an average position accuracy of 70.8%, average Jaccard of 56.1% and average occlusion accuracy of 86.9%. The method is insensitive to medium-length occlusions and it is robustified by estimating flow with respect to the reference frame, which reduces drift.

- **Summary**: Current semantic segmentation models have achieved great success under the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) condition. However, in real-world applications, test data might come from a different domain than training data. Therefore, it is important to improve model robustness against domain differences. This work studies semantic segmentation under the domain generalization setting, where a model is trained only on the source domain and tested on the unseen target domain. Existing works show that Vision Transformers are more robust than CNNs and show that this is related to the visual grouping property of self-attention. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical grouping transformer (HGFormer) to explicitly group pixels to form part-level masks and then whole-level masks. The masks at different scales aim to segment out both parts and a whole of classes. HGFormer combines mask classification results at both scales for class label prediction. We assemble multiple interesting cross-domain settings by using seven public semantic segmentation datasets. Experiments show that HGFormer yields more robust semantic segmentation results than per-pixel classification methods and flat grouping transformers, and outperforms previous methods significantly. Code will be available at https://github.com/dingjiansw101/HGFormer.

- **Summary**: Scaling laws have been recently employed to derive compute-optimal model size (number of parameters) for a given compute duration. We advance and refine such methods to infer compute-optimal model shapes, such as width and depth, and successfully implement this in vision transformers. Our shape-optimized vision transformer, SoViT, achieves results competitive with models that exceed twice its size, despite being pre-trained with an equivalent amount of compute. For example, SoViT-400m/14 achieves 90.3% fine-tuning accuracy on ILSRCV2012, surpassing the much larger ViT-g/14 and approaching ViT-G/14 under identical settings, with also less than half the inference cost. We conduct a thorough evaluation across multiple tasks, such as image classification, captioning, VQA and zero-shot transfer, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model across a broad range of domains and identifying limitations. Overall, our findings challenge the prevailing approach of blindly scaling up vision models and pave a path for a more informed scaling.



### POEM: Polarization of Embeddings for Domain-Invariant Representations

- **Summary**: Handling out-of-distribution samples is a long-lasting challenge for deep visual models. In particular, domain generalization (DG) is one of the most relevant tasks that aims to train a model with a generalization capability on novel domains. Most existing DG approaches share the same philosophy to minimize the discrepancy between domains by finding the domain-invariant representations. On the contrary, our proposed method called POEM acquires a strong DG capability by learning domain-invariant and domain-specific representations and polarizing them. Specifically, POEM cotrains category-classifying and domain-classifying embeddings while regularizing them to be orthogonal via minimizing the cosine-similarity between their features, i.e., the polarization of embeddings. The clear separation of embeddings suppresses domain-specific features in the domain-invariant embeddings. The concept of POEM shows a unique direction to enhance the domain robustness of representations that brings considerable and consistent performance gains when combined with existing DG methods. Extensive simulation results in popular DG benchmarks with the PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet datasets show that POEM indeed facilitates the category-classifying embedding to be more domain-invariant.

- **Summary**: In recent years, image generation has shown a great leap in performance, where diffusion models play a central role. Although generating high-quality images, such models are mainly conditioned on textual descriptions. This begs the question: "how can we adopt such models to be conditioned on other modalities?". In this paper, we propose a novel method utilizing latent diffusion models trained for text-to-image-generation to generate images conditioned on audio recordings. Using a pre-trained audio encoding model, the proposed method encodes audio into a new token, which can be considered as an adaptation layer between the audio and text representations. Such a modeling paradigm requires a small number of trainable parameters, making the proposed approach appealing for lightweight optimization. Results suggest the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baseline methods, considering objective and subjective metrics.

- **Summary**: To ensure safe autonomous driving in urban environments with complex vehicle-pedestrian interactions, it is critical for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to have the ability to predict pedestrians' short-term and immediate actions in real-time. In recent years, various methods have been developed to study estimating pedestrian behaviors for autonomous driving scenarios, but there is a lack of clear definitions for pedestrian behaviors. In this work, the literature gaps are investigated and a taxonomy is presented for pedestrian behavior characterization. Further, a novel multi-task sequence to sequence Transformer encoders-decoders (TF-ed) architecture is proposed for pedestrian action and trajectory prediction using only ego vehicle camera observations as inputs. The proposed approach is compared against an existing LSTM encoders decoders (LSTM-ed) architecture for action and trajectory prediction. The performance of both models is evaluated on the publicly available Joint Attention Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset, CARLA simulation data as well as real-time self-driving shuttle data collected on university campus. Evaluation results illustrate that the proposed method reaches an accuracy of 81% on action prediction task on JAAD testing data and outperforms the LSTM-ed by 7.4%, while LSTM counterpart performs much better on trajectory prediction task for a prediction sequence length of 25 frames.

- **Summary**: Optical flow estimation is crucial for autonomous navigation and localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). On micro and nano UAVs, real-time calculation of the optical flow is run on low power and resource-constrained microcontroller units (MCUs). Thus, lightweight algorithms for optical flow have been proposed targeting real-time execution on traditional single-core MCUs. This paper introduces an efficient parallelization strategy for optical flow computation targeting new-generation multicore low power RISC-V based microcontroller units. Our approach enables higher frame rates at lower clock speeds. It has been implemented and evaluated on the eight-core cluster of a commercial octa-core MCU (GAP8) reaching a parallelization speedup factor of 7.21 allowing for a frame rate of 500 frames per second when running on a 50 MHz clock frequency. The proposed parallel algorithm significantly boosts the camera frame rate on micro unmanned aerial vehicles, which enables higher flight speeds: the maximum flight speed can be doubled, while using less than a third of the clock frequency of previous single-core implementations.

- **Summary**: Text-driven diffusion models have unlocked unprecedented abilities in image generation, whereas their video counterpart still lags behind due to the excessive training cost of temporal modeling. Besides the training burden, the generated videos also suffer from appearance inconsistency and structural flickers, especially in long video synthesis. To address these challenges, we design a \emph{training-free} framework called \textbf{ControlVideo} to enable natural and efficient text-to-video generation. ControlVideo, adapted from ControlNet, leverages coarsely structural consistency from input motion sequences, and introduces three modules to improve video generation. Firstly, to ensure appearance coherence between frames, ControlVideo adds fully cross-frame interaction in self-attention modules. Secondly, to mitigate the flicker effect, it introduces an interleaved-frame smoother that employs frame interpolation on alternated frames. Finally, to produce long videos efficiently, it utilizes a hierarchical sampler that separately synthesizes each short clip with holistic coherency. Empowered with these modules, ControlVideo outperforms the state-of-the-arts on extensive motion-prompt pairs quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, thanks to the efficient designs, it generates both short and long videos within several minutes using one NVIDIA 2080Ti. Code is available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/ControlVideo.

- **Summary**: Recent image restoration methods have produced significant advancements using deep learning. However, existing methods tend to treat the whole image as a single entity, failing to account for the distinct objects in the image that exhibit individual texture properties. Existing methods also typically generate a single result, which may not suit the preferences of different users. In this paper, we introduce the Restore Anything Pipeline (RAP), a novel interactive and per-object level image restoration approach that incorporates a controllable model to generate different results that users may choose from. RAP incorporates image segmentation through the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a controllable image restoration model to create a user-friendly pipeline for several image restoration tasks. We demonstrate the versatility of RAP by applying it to three common image restoration tasks: image deblurring, image denoising, and JPEG artifact removal. Our experiments show that RAP produces superior visual results compared to state-of-the-art methods. RAP represents a promising direction for image restoration, providing users with greater control, and enabling image restoration at an object level.

- **Summary**: Traditional semi-supervised learning tasks assume that both labeled and unlabeled data follow the same class distribution, but the realistic open-world scenarios are of more complexity with unknown novel classes mixed in the unlabeled set. Therefore, it is of great challenge to not only recognize samples from known classes but also discover the unknown number of novel classes within the unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce a new open-world semi-supervised novel class discovery approach named OpenNCD, a progressive bi-level contrastive learning method over multiple prototypes. The proposed method is composed of two reciprocally enhanced parts. First, a bi-level contrastive learning method is introduced, which maintains the pair-wise similarity of the prototypes and the prototype group levels for better representation learning. Then, a reliable prototype similarity metric is proposed based on the common representing instances. Prototypes with high similarities will be grouped progressively for known class recognition and novel class discovery. Extensive experiments on three image datasets are conducted and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in open-world scenarios, especially with scarce known classes and labels.

- **Summary**: The generative AI revolution in recent years has been spurred by an expansion in compute power and data quantity, which together enable extensive pre-training of powerful text-to-image (T2I) models. With their greater capabilities to generate realistic and creative content, these T2I models like DALL-E, MidJourney, Imagen or Stable Diffusion are reaching ever wider audiences. Any unsafe behaviors inherited from pretraining on uncurated internet-scraped datasets thus have the potential to cause wide-reaching harm, for example, through generated images which are violent, sexually explicit, or contain biased and derogatory stereotypes. Despite this risk of harm, we lack systematic and structured evaluation datasets to scrutinize model behavior, especially adversarial attacks that bypass existing safety filters. A typical bottleneck in safety evaluation is achieving a wide coverage of different types of challenging examples in the evaluation set, i.e., identifying 'unknown unknowns' or long-tail problems. To address this need, we introduce the Adversarial Nibbler challenge. The goal of this challenge is to crowdsource a diverse set of failure modes and reward challenge participants for successfully finding safety vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art T2I models. Ultimately, we aim to provide greater awareness of these issues and assist developers in improving the future safety and reliability of generative AI models. Adversarial Nibbler is a data-centric challenge, part of the DataPerf challenge suite, organized and supported by Kaggle and MLCommons.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive results in both data generation and downstream tasks such as inverse problems, text-based editing, classification, and more. However, training such models usually requires large amounts of clean signals which are often difficult or impossible to obtain. In this work, we propose a novel training technique for generative diffusion models based only on corrupted data. We introduce a loss function based on the Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (GSURE), and prove that under some conditions, it is equivalent to the training objective used in fully supervised diffusion models. We demonstrate our technique on face images as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where the use of undersampled data significantly alleviates data collection costs. Our approach achieves generative performance comparable to its fully supervised counterpart without training on any clean signals. In addition, we deploy the resulting diffusion model in various downstream tasks beyond the degradation present in the training set, showcasing promising results.

- **Summary**: Large-scale image-text contrastive pre-training models, such as CLIP, have been demonstrated to effectively learn high-quality multimodal representations. However, there is limited research on learning video-text representations for general video multimodal tasks based on these powerful features. Towards this goal, we propose a novel video-text pre-training method dubbed VLAB: Video Language pre-training by feature Adapting and Blending, which transfers CLIP representations to video pre-training tasks and develops unified video multimodal models for a wide range of video-text tasks. Specifically, VLAB is founded on two key strategies: feature adapting and feature blending. In the former, we introduce a new video adapter module to address CLIP's deficiency in modeling temporal information and extend the model's capability to encompass both contrastive and generative tasks. In the latter, we propose an end-to-end training method that further enhances the model's performance by exploiting the complementarity of image and video features. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of VLAB through extensive experiments on highly competitive video multimodal tasks, including video text retrieval, video captioning, and video question answering. Remarkably, VLAB outperforms competing methods significantly and sets new records in video question answering on MSRVTT, MSVD, and TGIF datasets. It achieves an accuracy of 49.6, 61.0, and 79.0, respectively. Codes and models will be released.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning have precipitated the emergence of large language models (LLMs) which exhibit an impressive aptitude for understanding and producing text akin to human language. Despite the ability to train highly capable LLMs, the methodology for maintaining their relevancy and rectifying errors remains elusive. To that end, the past few years have witnessed a surge in techniques for editing LLMs, the objective of which is to alter the behavior of LLMs within a specific domain without negatively impacting performance across other inputs. This paper embarks on a deep exploration of the problems, methods, and opportunities relating to model editing for LLMs. In particular, we provide an exhaustive overview of the task definition and challenges associated with model editing, along with an in-depth empirical analysis of the most progressive methods currently at our disposal. We also build a new benchmark dataset to facilitate a more robust evaluation and pinpoint enduring issues intrinsic to existing techniques. Our objective is to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and feasibility of each model editing technique, thereby assisting the research community in making informed decisions when choosing the most appropriate method for a specific task or context.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot instance segmentation aims to detect and precisely segment objects of unseen categories without any training samples. Since the model is trained on seen categories, there is a strong bias that the model tends to classify all the objects into seen categories. Besides, there is a natural confusion between background and novel objects that have never shown up in training. These two challenges make novel objects hard to be raised in the final instance segmentation results. It is desired to rescue novel objects from background and dominated seen categories. To this end, we propose D$^2$Zero with Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation to enhance the performance of Zero-shot instance segmentation. Semantic-promoted debiasing utilizes inter-class semantic relationships to involve unseen categories in visual feature training and learns an input-conditional classifier to conduct dynamical classification based on the input image. Background disambiguation produces image-adaptive background representation to avoid mistaking novel objects for background. Extensive experiments show that we significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., 16.86% improvement on COCO.

- **Summary**: Indoor scene reconstruction from monocular images has long been sought after by augmented reality and robotics developers. Recent advances in neural field representations and monocular priors have led to remarkable results in scene-level surface reconstructions. The reliance on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), however, significantly limits speed in training and rendering. In this work, we propose to directly use signed distance function (SDF) in sparse voxel block grids for fast and accurate scene reconstruction without MLPs. Our globally sparse and locally dense data structure exploits surfaces' spatial sparsity, enables cache-friendly queries, and allows direct extensions to multi-modal data such as color and semantic labels. To apply this representation to monocular scene reconstruction, we develop a scale calibration algorithm for fast geometric initialization from monocular depth priors. We apply differentiable volume rendering from this initialization to refine details with fast convergence. We also introduce efficient high-dimensional Continuous Random Fields (CRFs) to further exploit the semantic-geometry consistency between scene objects. Experiments show that our approach is 10x faster in training and 100x faster in rendering while achieving comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art neural implicit methods.

- **Summary**: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is often treated minimally invasively with a catheter being inserted into the diseased coronary vessel. If a patient exhibits a Shepherd's Crook (SC) Right Coronary Artery (RCA) - an anatomical norm variant of the coronary vasculature - the complexity of this procedure is increased. Automated reporting of this variant from coronary CT angiography screening would ease prior risk assessment. We propose a 1D convolutional neural network which leverages a sequence of residual dilated convolutions to automatically determine this norm variant from a prior extracted vessel centerline. As the SC RCA is not clearly defined with respect to concrete measurements, labeling also includes qualitative aspects. Therefore, 4.23% samples in our dataset of 519 RCA centerlines were labeled as unsure SC RCAs, with 5.97% being labeled as sure SC RCAs. We explore measures to handle this label uncertainty, namely global/model-wise random assignment, exclusion, and soft label assignment. Furthermore, we evaluate how this uncertainty can be leveraged for the determination of a rejection class. With our best configuration, we reach an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.938 on confident labels. Moreover, we observe an increase of up to 0.020 AUC when rejecting 10% of the data and leveraging the labeling uncertainty information in the exclusion process.

- **Summary**: Humans can infer the affordance of objects by extracting related contextual preconditions for each scenario. For example, upon seeing an image of a broken cup, we can infer that this precondition prevents the cup from being used for drinking. Reasoning with preconditions of commonsense is studied in NLP where the model explicitly gets the contextual precondition. However, it is unclear if SOTA visual language models (VLMs) can extract such preconditions and infer the affordance of objects with them. In this work, we introduce the task of preconditioned visual language inference and rationalization (PVLIR). We propose a learning resource based on three strategies to retrieve weak supervision signals for the task and develop a human-verified test set for evaluation. Our results reveal the shortcomings of SOTA VLM models in the task and draw a road map to address the challenges ahead in improving them.



### Revisiting Data Augmentation in Model Compression: An Empirical and Comprehensive Study

- **Summary**: The excellent performance of deep neural networks is usually accompanied by a large number of parameters and computations, which have limited their usage on the resource-limited edge devices. To address this issue, abundant methods such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation have been proposed to compress neural networks and achieved significant breakthroughs. However, most of these compression methods focus on the architecture or the training method of neural networks but ignore the influence from data augmentation. In this paper, we revisit the usage of data augmentation in model compression and give a comprehensive study on the relation between model sizes and their optimal data augmentation policy. To sum up, we mainly have the following three observations: (A) Models in different sizes prefer data augmentation with different magnitudes. Hence, in iterative pruning, data augmentation with varying magnitudes leads to better performance than data augmentation with a consistent magnitude. (B) Data augmentation with a high magnitude may significantly improve the performance of large models but harm the performance of small models. Fortunately, small models can still benefit from strong data augmentations by firstly learning them with "additional parameters" and then discard these "additional parameters" during inference. (C) The prediction of a pre-trained large model can be utilized to measure the difficulty of data augmentation. Thus it can be utilized as a criterion to design better data augmentation policies. We hope this paper may promote more research on the usage of data augmentation in model compression.

- **Summary**: Satellite image time series in the optical and infrared spectrum suffer from frequent data gaps due to cloud cover, cloud shadows, and temporary sensor outages. It has been a long-standing problem of remote sensing research how to best reconstruct the missing pixel values and obtain complete, cloud-free image sequences. We approach that problem from the perspective of representation learning and develop U-TILISE, an efficient neural model that is able to implicitly capture spatio-temporal patterns of the spectral intensities, and that can therefore be trained to map a cloud-masked input sequence to a cloud-free output sequence. The model consists of a convolutional spatial encoder that maps each individual frame of the input sequence to a latent encoding; an attention-based temporal encoder that captures dependencies between those per-frame encodings and lets them exchange information along the time dimension; and a convolutional spatial decoder that decodes the latent embeddings back into multi-spectral images. We experimentally evaluate the proposed model on EarthNet2021, a dataset of Sentinel-2 time series acquired all over Europe, and demonstrate its superior ability to reconstruct the missing pixels. Compared to a standard interpolation baseline, it increases the PSNR by 1.8 dB at previously seen locations and by 1.3 dB at unseen locations.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the problem of adapting models from a source domain to a target domain, a task that has become increasingly important due to the brittle generalization of deep neural networks. While several test-time adaptation techniques have emerged, they typically rely on synthetic toolbox data augmentations in cases of limited target data availability. We consider the challenging setting of single-shot adaptation and explore the design of augmentation strategies. We argue that augmentations utilized by existing methods are insufficient to handle large distribution shifts, and hence propose a new approach SiSTA, which first fine-tunes a generative model from the source domain using a single-shot target, and then employs novel sampling strategies for curating synthetic target data. Using experiments on a variety of benchmarks, distribution shifts and image corruptions, we find that SiSTA produces significantly improved generalization over existing baselines in face attribute detection and multi-class object recognition. Furthermore, SiSTA performs competitively to models obtained by training on larger target datasets. Our codes can be accessed at https://github.com/Rakshith-2905/SiSTA.

- **Summary**: Separating an image into meaningful underlying components is a crucial first step for both editing and understanding images. We present a method capable of selecting the regions of a photograph exhibiting the same material as an artist-chosen area. Our proposed approach is robust to shading, specular highlights, and cast shadows, enabling selection in real images. As we do not rely on semantic segmentation (different woods or metal should not be selected together), we formulate the problem as a similarity-based grouping problem based on a user-provided image location. In particular, we propose to leverage the unsupervised DINO features coupled with a proposed Cross-Similarity module and an MLP head to extract material similarities in an image. We train our model on a new synthetic image dataset, that we release. We show that our method generalizes well to real-world images. We carefully analyze our model's behavior on varying material properties and lighting. Additionally, we evaluate it against a hand-annotated benchmark of 50 real photographs. We further demonstrate our model on a set of applications, including material editing, in-video selection, and retrieval of object photographs with similar materials.

- **Summary**: With the exponential growth of video data, there is an urgent need for automated technology to analyze and comprehend video content. However, existing video understanding models are often task-specific and lack a comprehensive capability of handling diverse tasks. The success of large language models (LLMs) like GPT has demonstrated their impressive abilities in sequence causal reasoning. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel framework called VideoLLM that leverages the sequence reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs from natural language processing (NLP) for video sequence understanding. VideoLLM incorporates a carefully designed Modality Encoder and Semantic Translator, which convert inputs from various modalities into a unified token sequence. This token sequence is then fed into a decoder-only LLM. Subsequently, with the aid of a simple task head, our VideoLLM yields an effective unified framework for different kinds of video understanding tasks. To evaluate the efficacy of VideoLLM, we conduct extensive experiments using multiple LLMs and fine-tuning methods. We evaluate our VideoLLM on eight tasks sourced from four different datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively transferred to video understanding tasks. We release the code at https://github.com/cg1177/VideoLLM.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing high-fidelity head avatars is a central problem for computer vision and graphics. While head avatar synthesis algorithms have advanced rapidly, the best ones still face great obstacles in real-world scenarios. One of the vital causes is inadequate datasets -- 1) current public datasets can only support researchers to explore high-fidelity head avatars in one or two task directions; 2) these datasets usually contain digital head assets with limited data volume, and narrow distribution over different attributes. In this paper, we present RenderMe-360, a comprehensive 4D human head dataset to drive advance in head avatar research. It contains massive data assets, with 243+ million complete head frames, and over 800k video sequences from 500 different identities captured by synchronized multi-view cameras at 30 FPS. It is a large-scale digital library for head avatars with three key attributes: 1) High Fidelity: all subjects are captured by 60 synchronized, high-resolution 2K cameras in 360 degrees. 2) High Diversity: The collected subjects vary from different ages, eras, ethnicities, and cultures, providing abundant materials with distinctive styles in appearance and geometry. Moreover, each subject is asked to perform various motions, such as expressions and head rotations, which further extend the richness of assets. 3) Rich Annotations: we provide annotations with different granularities: cameras' parameters, matting, scan, 2D/3D facial landmarks, FLAME fitting, and text description.   Based on the dataset, we build a comprehensive benchmark for head avatar research, with 16 state-of-the-art methods performed on five main tasks: novel view synthesis, novel expression synthesis, hair rendering, hair editing, and talking head generation. Our experiments uncover the strengths and weaknesses of current methods. RenderMe-360 opens the door for future exploration in head avatars.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are a class of flexible generative models trained with an approximation to the log-likelihood objective. However, most use cases of diffusion models are not concerned with likelihoods, but instead with downstream objectives such as human-perceived image quality or drug effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning methods for directly optimizing diffusion models for such objectives. We describe how posing denoising as a multi-step decision-making problem enables a class of policy gradient algorithms, which we refer to as denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO), that are more effective than alternative reward-weighted likelihood approaches. Empirically, DDPO is able to adapt text-to-image diffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality. Finally, we show that DDPO can improve prompt-image alignment using feedback from a vision-language model without the need for additional data collection or human annotation.

- **Summary**: A practical benefit of implicit visual representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) is their memory efficiency: large scenes can be efficiently stored and shared as small neural nets instead of collections of images. However, operating on these implicit visual data structures requires extending classical image-based vision techniques (e.g., registration, blending) from image sets to neural fields. Towards this goal, we propose NeRFuser, a novel architecture for NeRF registration and blending that assumes only access to pre-generated NeRFs, and not the potentially large sets of images used to generate them. We propose registration from re-rendering, a technique to infer the transformation between NeRFs based on images synthesized from individual NeRFs. For blending, we propose sample-based inverse distance weighting to blend visual information at the ray-sample level. We evaluate NeRFuser on public benchmarks and a self-collected object-centric indoor dataset, showing the robustness of our method, including to views that are challenging to render from the individual source NeRFs.

- **Summary**: Despite their impressive capabilities, diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models can lack faithfulness to the text prompt, where generated images may not contain all the mentioned objects, attributes or relations. To alleviate these issues, recent works proposed post-hoc methods to improve model faithfulness without costly retraining, by modifying how the model utilizes the input prompt. In this work, we take a step back and show that large T2I diffusion models are more faithful than usually assumed, and can generate images faithful to even complex prompts without the need to manipulate the generative process. Based on that, we show how faithfulness can be simply treated as a candidate selection problem instead, and introduce a straightforward pipeline that generates candidate images for a text prompt and picks the best one according to an automatic scoring system that can leverage already existing T2I evaluation metrics. Quantitative comparisons alongside user studies on diverse benchmarks show consistently improved faithfulness over post-hoc enhancement methods, with comparable or lower computational cost.

- **Summary**: Powered by large-scale pre-training, vision foundation models exhibit significant potential in open-world image understanding. Even though individual models have limited capabilities, combining multiple such models properly can lead to positive synergies and unleash their full potential. In this work, we present Matcher, which segments anything with one shot by integrating an all-purpose feature extraction model and a class-agnostic segmentation model. Naively connecting the models results in unsatisfying performance, e.g., the models tend to generate matching outliers and false-positive mask fragments. To address these issues, we design a bidirectional matching strategy for accurate cross-image semantic dense matching and a robust prompt sampler for mask proposal generation. In addition, we propose a novel instance-level matching strategy for controllable mask merging. The proposed Matcher method delivers impressive generalization performance across various segmentation tasks, all without training. For example, it achieves 52.7% mIoU on COCO-20$^i$ for one-shot semantic segmentation, surpassing the state-of-the-art specialist model by 1.6%. In addition, our visualization results show open-world generality and flexibility on images in the wild. The code shall be released at https://github.com/aim-uofa/Matcher.

- **Summary**: This work introduces Video Diffusion Transformer (VDT), which pioneers the use of transformers in diffusion-based video generation. It features transformer blocks with modularized temporal and spatial attention modules, allowing separate optimization of each component and leveraging the rich spatial-temporal representation inherited from transformers. VDT offers several appealing benefits. 1) It excels at capturing temporal dependencies to produce temporally consistent video frames and even simulate the dynamics of 3D objects over time. 2) It enables flexible conditioning information through simple concatenation in the token space, effectively unifying video generation and prediction tasks. 3) Its modularized design facilitates a spatial-temporal decoupled training strategy, leading to improved efficiency. Extensive experiments on video generation, prediction, and dynamics modeling (i.e., physics-based QA) tasks have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of VDT in various scenarios, including autonomous driving, human action, and physics-based simulation.   We hope our study on the capabilities of transformer-based video diffusion in capturing accurate temporal dependencies, handling conditioning information, and achieving efficient training will benefit future research and advance the field.

- **Summary**: Prior works have demonstrated that implicit representations trained only for reconstruction tasks typically generate encodings that are not useful for semantic tasks. In this work, we propose a method that contextualises the encodings of implicit representations, enabling their use in downstream tasks (e.g. semantic segmentation), without requiring access to the original training data or encoding network. Using an implicit representation trained for a reconstruction task alone, our contextualising module takes an encoding trained for reconstruction only and reveals meaningful semantic information that is hidden in the encodings, without compromising the reconstruction performance. With our proposed module, it becomes possible to pre-train implicit representations on larger datasets, improving their reconstruction performance compared to training on only a smaller labelled dataset, whilst maintaining their segmentation performance on the labelled dataset. Importantly, our method allows for future foundation implicit representation models to be fine-tuned on unseen tasks, regardless of encoder or dataset availability.

- **Summary**: Recently, contrastive self-supervised learning, where the proximity of representations is determined based on the identities of samples, has made remarkable progress in unsupervised representation learning. SimSiam is a well-known example in this area, known for its simplicity yet powerful performance. However, it is known to be sensitive to changes in training configurations, such as hyperparameters and augmentation settings, due to its structural characteristics. To address this issue, we focus on the similarity between contrastive learning and the teacher-student framework in knowledge distillation. Inspired by the ensemble-based knowledge distillation approach, the proposed method, EnSiam, aims to improve the contrastive learning procedure using ensemble representations. This can provide stable pseudo labels, providing better performance. Experiments demonstrate that EnSiam outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most cases, including the experiments on ImageNet, which shows that EnSiam is capable of learning high-quality representations.

- **Summary**: Intracranial aneurysms are a commonly occurring and life-threatening condition, affecting approximately 3.2% of the general population. Consequently, detecting these aneurysms plays a crucial role in their management. Lesion detection involves the simultaneous localization and categorization of abnormalities within medical images. In this study, we employed the nnDetection framework, a self-configuring framework specifically designed for 3D medical object detection, to detect and localize the 3D coordinates of aneurysms effectively. To capture and extract diverse features associated with aneurysms, we utilized TOF-MRA and structural MRI, both obtained from the ADAM dataset. The performance of our proposed deep learning model was assessed through the utilization of free-response receiver operative characteristics for evaluation purposes. The model's weights and 3D prediction of the bounding box of TOF-MRA are publicly available at https://github.com/orouskhani/AneurysmDetection.

- **Summary**: In response to the prevalent challenge of overfitting in deep neural networks, this paper introduces Simultaneous Learning, a regularization approach drawing on principles of Transfer Learning and Multi-task Learning. We leverage auxiliary datasets with the target dataset, the UFOP-HVD, to facilitate simultaneous classification guided by a customized loss function featuring an inter-group penalty. This experimental configuration allows for a detailed examination of model performance across similar (PlantNet) and dissimilar (ImageNet) domains, thereby enriching the generalizability of Convolutional Neural Network models. Remarkably, our approach demonstrates superior performance over models without regularization and those applying dropout regularization exclusively, enhancing accuracy by 5 to 22 percentage points. Moreover, when combined with dropout, the proposed approach improves generalization, securing state-of-the-art results for the UFOP-HVD challenge. The method also showcases efficiency with significantly smaller sample sizes, suggesting its broad applicability across a spectrum of related tasks. In addition, an interpretability approach is deployed to evaluate feature quality by analyzing class feature correlations within the network's convolutional layers. The findings of this study provide deeper insights into the efficacy of Simultaneous Learning, particularly concerning its interaction with the auxiliary and target datasets.

- **Summary**: Research in self-supervised learning (SSL) with natural images has progressed rapidly in recent years and is now increasingly being applied to and benchmarked with datasets containing remotely sensed imagery. A common benchmark case is to evaluate SSL pre-trained model embeddings on datasets of remotely sensed imagery with small patch sizes, e.g., 32x32 pixels, whereas standard SSL pre-training takes place with larger patch sizes, e.g., 224x224. Furthermore, pre-training methods tend to use different image normalization preprocessing steps depending on the dataset. In this paper, we show, across seven satellite and aerial imagery datasets of varying resolution, that by simply following the preprocessing steps used in pre-training (precisely, image sizing and normalization methods), one can achieve significant performance improvements when evaluating the extracted features on downstream tasks -- an important detail overlooked in previous work in this space. We show that by following these steps, ImageNet pre-training remains a competitive baseline for satellite imagery based transfer learning tasks -- for example we find that these steps give +32.28 to overall accuracy on the So2Sat random split dataset and +11.16 on the EuroSAT dataset. Finally, we report comprehensive benchmark results with a variety of simple baseline methods for each of the seven datasets, forming an initial benchmark suite for remote sensing imagery.

- **Summary**: 3DMM conditioned face generation has gained traction due to its well-defined controllability; however, the trade-off is lower sample quality: Previous works such as DiscoFaceGAN and 3D-FM GAN show a significant FID gap compared to the unconditional StyleGAN, suggesting that there is a quality tax to pay for controllability. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that quality and controllability cannot coexist. To pinpoint the previous issues, we mathematically formalize the problem of 3DMM conditioned face generation. Then, we devise simple solutions to the problem under our proposed framework. This results in a new model that effectively removes the quality tax between 3DMM conditioned face GANs and the unconditional StyleGAN.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant health threat, with no long-term cure currently available. Early detection is crucial, yet mammography interpretation is hindered by high false positives and negatives. With BC incidence projected to surpass lung cancer, improving early detection methods is vital. Thermography, using high-resolution infrared cameras, offers promise, especially when combined with artificial intelligence (AI). This work presents an attention-based convolutional neural network for segmentation, providing increased speed and precision in BC detection and classification. The system enhances images and performs cancer segmentation with explainable AI. We propose a transformer-attention-based convolutional architecture (UNet) for fault identification and employ Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to analyze areas of bias and weakness in the UNet architecture with IRT images. The superiority of our proposed framework is confirmed when compared with existing deep learning frameworks.

- **Summary**: In the rapidly evolving field of deep learning, the performance of model inference has become a pivotal aspect as models become more complex and are deployed in diverse applications. Among these, autoregressive models stand out due to their state-of-the-art performance in numerous generative tasks. These models, by design, harness a temporal dependency structure, where the current token's probability distribution is conditioned on preceding tokens. This inherently sequential characteristic, however, adheres to the Markov Chain assumption and lacks temporal parallelism, which poses unique challenges. Particularly in industrial contexts where inference requests, following a Poisson time distribution, necessitate diverse response lengths, this absence of parallelism is more profound. Existing solutions, such as dynamic batching and concurrent model instances, nevertheless, come with severe overheads and a lack of flexibility, these coarse-grained methods fall short of achieving optimal latency and throughput. To address these shortcomings, we propose Flavor -- a temporal fusion framework for efficient inference in autoregressive models, eliminating the need for heuristic settings and applies to a wide range of inference scenarios. By providing more fine-grained parallelism on the temporality of requests and employing an efficient memory shuffle algorithm, Flover achieves up to 11x faster inference on GPT models compared to the cutting-edge solutions provided by NVIDIA Triton FasterTransformer. Crucially, by leveraging the advanced tensor parallel technique, Flover proves efficacious across diverse computational landscapes, from single-GPU setups to multi-node scenarios, thereby offering robust performance optimization that transcends hardware boundaries.

- **Summary**: Monitoring plant health is crucial for maintaining agricultural productivity and food safety. Disruptions in the plant's normal state, caused by diseases, often interfere with essential plant activities, and timely detection of these diseases can significantly mitigate crop loss. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for efficient detection of plant diseases using drone-captured imagery. A comprehensive database of various plant species, exhibiting numerous diseases, was compiled from the Internet and utilized as the training and test dataset. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), renowned for its performance in image classification tasks, was employed as our primary predictive model. The CNN model, trained on this rich dataset, demonstrated superior proficiency in crop disease categorization and detection, even under challenging imaging conditions. For field implementation, we deployed a prototype drone model equipped with a high-resolution camera for live monitoring of extensive agricultural fields. The captured images served as the input for our trained model, enabling real-time identification of healthy and diseased plants. Our approach promises an efficient and scalable solution for improving crop health monitoring systems.

- **Summary**: One of the recent trends in vision problems is to use natural language captions to describe the objects of interest. This approach can overcome some limitations of traditional methods that rely on bounding boxes or category annotations. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for Multiple Object Tracking called Type-to-Track, which allows users to track objects in videos by typing natural language descriptions. We present a new dataset for that Grounded Multiple Object Tracking task, called GroOT, that contains videos with various types of objects and their corresponding textual captions describing their appearance and action in detail. Additionally, we introduce two new evaluation protocols and formulate evaluation metrics specifically for this task. We develop a new efficient method that models a transformer-based eMbed-ENcoDE-extRact framework (MENDER) using the third-order tensor decomposition. The experiments in five scenarios show that our MENDER approach outperforms another two-stage design in terms of accuracy and efficiency, up to 14.7% accuracy and 4$\times$ speed faster.

- **Summary**: Emotion understanding is an essential but highly challenging component of artificial general intelligence. The absence of extensively annotated datasets has significantly impeded advancements in this field. We present EmotionCLIP, the first pre-training paradigm to extract visual emotion representations from verbal and nonverbal communication using only uncurated data. Compared to numerical labels or descriptions used in previous methods, communication naturally contains emotion information. Furthermore, acquiring emotion representations from communication is more congruent with the human learning process. We guide EmotionCLIP to attend to nonverbal emotion cues through subject-aware context encoding and verbal emotion cues using sentiment-guided contrastive learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and transferability of EmotionCLIP. Using merely linear-probe evaluation protocol, EmotionCLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised visual emotion recognition methods and rivals many multimodal approaches across various benchmarks. We anticipate that the advent of EmotionCLIP will address the prevailing issue of data scarcity in emotion understanding, thereby fostering progress in related domains. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Xeaver/EmotionCLIP.

- **Summary**: The rapidly evolving fields of e-commerce and metaverse continue to seek innovative approaches to enhance the consumer experience. At the same time, recent advancements in the development of diffusion models have enabled generative networks to create remarkably realistic images. In this context, image-based virtual try-on, which consists in generating a novel image of a target model wearing a given in-shop garment, has yet to capitalize on the potential of these powerful generative solutions. This work introduces LaDI-VTON, the first Latent Diffusion textual Inversion-enhanced model for the Virtual Try-ON task. The proposed architecture relies on a latent diffusion model extended with a novel additional autoencoder module that exploits learnable skip connections to enhance the generation process preserving the model's characteristics. To effectively maintain the texture and details of the in-shop garment, we propose a textual inversion component that can map the visual features of the garment to the CLIP token embedding space and thus generate a set of pseudo-word token embeddings capable of conditioning the generation process. Experimental results on Dress Code and VITON-HD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the competitors by a consistent margin, achieving a significant milestone for the task.

- **Summary**: Misinformation, i.e. factually incorrect information, is often conveyed in multiple modalities, e.g. an image accompanied by a caption. It is perceived as more credible by humans, and spreads faster and wider than its text-only counterparts. While an increasing body of research investigates automated fact-checking (AFC), previous surveys mostly focus on textual misinformation. In this survey, we conceptualise a framework for AFC including subtasks unique to multimodal misinformation. Furthermore, we discuss related terminological developed in different communities in the context of our framework. We focus on four modalities prevalent in real-world fact-checking: text, image, audio, and video. We survey benchmarks and models, and discuss limitations and promising directions for future research.

- **Summary**: In the last decade, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transformer based object detectors have achieved high performance on a large variety of datasets. Though the majority of detection literature has developed this capability on datasets such as MS COCO, these detectors have still proven effective for remote sensing applications. Challenges in this particular domain, such as small numbers of annotated objects and low object density, hinder overall performance. In this work, we present a novel augmentation method, called collage pasting, for increasing the object density without a need for segmentation masks, thereby improving the detector performance. We demonstrate that collage pasting improves precision and recall beyond related methods, such as mosaic augmentation, and enables greater control of object density. However, we find that collage pasting is vulnerable to certain out-of-distribution shifts, such as image corruptions. To address this, we introduce two simple approaches for combining collage pasting with PixMix augmentation method, and refer to our combined techniques as ColMix. Through extensive experiments, we show that employing ColMix results in detectors with superior performance on aerial imagery datasets and robust to various corruptions.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation methods have played an important role in the recent advance of deep learning models, and have become an indispensable component of state-of-the-art models in semi-supervised, self-supervised, and supervised training for vision. Despite incurring no additional latency at test time, data augmentation often requires more epochs of training to be effective. For example, even the simple flips-and-crops augmentation requires training for more than 5 epochs to improve performance, whereas RandAugment requires more than 90 epochs. We propose a general framework called Tied-Augment, which improves the efficacy of data augmentation in a wide range of applications by adding a simple term to the loss that can control the similarity of representations under distortions. Tied-Augment can improve state-of-the-art methods from data augmentation (e.g. RandAugment, mixup), optimization (e.g. SAM), and semi-supervised learning (e.g. FixMatch). For example, Tied-RandAugment can outperform RandAugment by 2.0% on ImageNet. Notably, using Tied-Augment, data augmentation can be made to improve generalization even when training for a few epochs and when fine-tuning. We open source our code at https://github.com/ekurtulus/tied-augment/tree/main.

- **Summary**: The ability of living organisms to perform complex high speed manoeuvers in flight with a very small number of neurons and an incredibly low failure rate highlights the efficacy of these resource-constrained biological systems. Event-driven hardware has emerged, in recent years, as a promising avenue for implementing complex vision tasks in resource-constrained environments. Vision-based autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance consists of several independent but related tasks such as optical flow estimation, depth estimation, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), object detection, and recognition. To ensure coherence between these tasks, it is imperative that they be trained on a single dataset. However, most existing datasets provide only a selected subset of the required data. This makes inter-network coherence difficult to achieve. Another limitation of existing datasets is the limited temporal resolution they provide. To address these limitations, we present FEDORA, a first-of-its-kind fully synthetic dataset for vision-based tasks, with ground truths for depth, pose, ego-motion, and optical flow. FEDORA is the first dataset to provide optical flow at three different frequencies - 10Hz, 25Hz, and 50Hz

- **Summary**: Human activity recognition (HAR) is one of the core research themes in ubiquitous and wearable computing. With the shift to deep learning (DL) based analysis approaches, it has become possible to extract high-level features and perform classification in an end-to-end manner. Despite their promising overall capabilities, DL-based HAR may suffer from overfitting due to the notoriously small, often inadequate, amounts of labeled sample data that are available for typical HAR applications. In response to such challenges, we propose ConvBoost -- a novel, three-layer, structured model architecture and boosting framework for convolutional network based HAR. Our framework generates additional training data from three different perspectives for improved HAR, aiming to alleviate the shortness of labeled training data in the field. Specifically, with the introduction of three conceptual layers--Sampling Layer, Data Augmentation Layer, and Resilient Layer -- we develop three "boosters" -- R-Frame, Mix-up, and C-Drop -- to enrich the per-epoch training data by dense-sampling, synthesizing, and simulating, respectively. These new conceptual layers and boosters, that are universally applicable for any kind of convolutional network, have been designed based on the characteristics of the sensor data and the concept of frame-wise HAR. In our experimental evaluation on three standard benchmarks (Opportunity, PAMAP2, GOTOV) we demonstrate the effectiveness of our ConvBoost framework for HAR applications based on variants of convolutional networks: vanilla CNN, ConvLSTM, and Attention Models. We achieved substantial performance gains for all of them, which suggests that the proposed approach is generic and can serve as a practical solution for boosting the performance of existing ConvNet-based HAR models. This is an open-source project, and the code can be found at https://github.com/sshao2013/ConvBoost

- **Summary**: The increasingly pervasive facial recognition (FR) systems raise serious concerns about personal privacy, especially for billions of users who have publicly shared their photos on social media. Several attempts have been made to protect individuals from unauthorized FR systems utilizing adversarial attacks to generate encrypted face images to protect users from being identified by FR systems. However, existing methods suffer from poor visual quality or low attack success rates, which limit their usability in practice. In this paper, we propose Attribute Guided Encryption with Facial Texture Masking (AGE-FTM) that performs a dual manifold adversarial attack on FR systems to achieve both good visual quality and high black box attack success rates. In particular, AGE-FTM utilizes a high fidelity generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate natural on-manifold adversarial samples by modifying facial attributes, and performs the facial texture masking attack to generate imperceptible off-manifold adversarial samples. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ dataset demonstrate that our proposed method produces more natural-looking encrypted images than state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive attack performance. We further evaluate the effectiveness of AGE-FTM in the real world using a commercial FR API and validate its usefulness in practice through an user study.

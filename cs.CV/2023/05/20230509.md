- **Summary**: In AI-based histopathology, domain shifts are common and well-studied. However, this research focuses on stain and scanner variations, which do not show the full picture -- shifts may be combinations of other shifts, or "invisible" shifts that are not obvious but still damage performance of machine learning models. Furthermore, it is important for models to generalize to these shifts without expensive or scarce annotations, especially in the histopathology space and if wanting to deploy models on a larger scale. Thus, there is a need for "reactive" domain generalization techniques: ones that adapt to domain shifts at test-time rather than requiring predictions of or examples of the shifts at training time. We conduct a literature review and introduce techniques that react to domain shifts rather than requiring a prediction of them in advance. We investigate test time training, a technique for domain generalization that adapts model parameters at test-time through optimization of a secondary self-supervised task.

- **Summary**: In recent years the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems for automated medical image analysis has gained enormous momentum. At the same time, a large body of work has shown that AI systems can systematically and unfairly discriminate against certain populations in various application scenarios. These two facts have motivated the emergence of algorithmic fairness studies in this field. Most research on healthcare algorithmic fairness to date has focused on the assessment of biases in terms of classical discrimination metrics such as AUC and accuracy. Potential biases in terms of model calibration, however, have only recently begun to be evaluated. This is especially important when working with clinical decision support systems, as predictive uncertainty is key for health professionals to optimally evaluate and combine multiple sources of information. In this work we study discrimination and calibration biases in models trained for automatic detection of malignant dermatological conditions from skin lesions images. Importantly, we show how several typically employed calibration metrics are systematically biased with respect to sample sizes, and how this can lead to erroneous fairness analysis if not taken into consideration. This is of particular relevance to fairness studies, where data imbalance results in drastic sample size differences between demographic sub-groups, which, if not taken into account, can act as confounders.

- **Summary**: Maintaining high standards for user safety during daily railway operations is crucial for railway managers. To aid in this endeavor, top- or side-view cameras and GPS positioning systems have facilitated progress toward automating periodic inspections of defective features and assessing the deteriorating status of railway components. However, collecting data on deteriorated status can be time-consuming and requires repeated data acquisition because of the extreme temporal occurrence imbalance. In supervised learning, thousands of paired data sets containing defective raw images and annotated labels are required. However, the one-class classification approach offers the advantage of requiring fewer images to optimize parameters for training normal and anomalous features. The deeper fully-convolutional data descriptions (FCDDs) were applicable to several damage data sets of concrete/steel components in structures, and fallen tree, and wooden building collapse in disasters. However, it is not yet known to feasible to railway components. In this study, we devised a prognostic discriminator pipeline to automate one-class damage classification using the deeper FCDDs for defective railway components. We also performed ablation studies of the deeper backbone based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Furthermore, we visualized deterioration features by using transposed Gaussian upsampling. We demonstrated our application to railway inspection using a video acquisition dataset of railway track from backward view at a cloudy and sunny scene. Finally, we examined the usability of our approach for prognostics and future work on railway inspection.

- **Summary**: The existence of cracks and other damages pose a significant threat to the safe operation of transportation infrastructure. Traditional manual detection and ultrasound equipment testing consume a lot of time and resources. With the development of deep learning technology, many deep learning models have been widely applied to practical visual segmentation tasks. The detection method based on deep learning models has the advantages of high detection accuracy, fast detection speed, and simple operation. However, deep learning-based crack segmentation models are sensitive to background noise, have rough edges, and lack robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes a crack segmentation model based on the fusion of dual streams. The image is inputted simultaneously into two designed processing streams to independently extract long-distance dependence and local detail features. The adaptive prediction is achieved through the dual-headed mechanism. Meanwhile, a novel interaction fusion mechanism is proposed to guide the complementary of different feature layers to achieve crack location and recognition in complex backgrounds. Finally, an edge optimization method is proposed to improve the accuracy of segmentation. Experiments show that the F1 value of segmentation results on the DeepCrack[1] public dataset is 93.7% and the IOU value is 86.6%. The F1 value of segmentation results on the CRACK500[2] dataset is 78.1%, and the IOU value is 66.0%.

- **Summary**: Lip-to-Speech (Lip2Speech) synthesis, which predicts corresponding speech from talking face images, has witnessed significant progress with various models and training strategies in a series of independent studies. However, existing studies can not achieve voice control under zero-shot condition, because extra speaker embeddings need to be extracted from natural reference speech and are unavailable when only the silent video of an unseen speaker is given. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot personalized Lip2Speech synthesis method, in which face images control speaker identities. A variational autoencoder is adopted to disentangle the speaker identity and linguistic content representations, which enables speaker embeddings to control the voice characteristics of synthetic speech for unseen speakers. Furthermore, we propose associated cross-modal representation learning to promote the ability of face-based speaker embeddings (FSE) on voice control. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method whose synthetic utterances are more natural and matching with the personality of input video than the compared methods. To our best knowledge, this paper makes the first attempt on zero-shot personalized Lip2Speech synthesis with a face image rather than reference audio to control voice characteristics.

- **Summary**: Mammographic image analysis requires accurate localisation of salient mammographic masses. In mammographic computer-aided diagnosis, mass or Region of Interest (ROI) is often marked by physicians and features are extracted from the marked ROI. In this paper, we present a novel mammographic mass localisation framework, based on the maximal class activations of the stacked auto-encoders. We hypothesize that the image regions activating abnormal classes in mammographic images will be the breast masses which causes the anomaly. The experiment is conducted using randomly selected 200 mammographic images (100 normal and 100 abnormal) from IRMA mammographic dataset. Abnormal mass regions marked by an expert radiologist are used as the ground truth. The proposed method outperforms existing Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based techniques in terms of salient region detection accuracy. The proposed greedy backtracking method is more efficient and does not require a vast number of labelled training images as in DCNN based method. Such automatic localisation method will assist physicians to make accurate decisions on biopsy recommendations and treatment evaluations.

- **Summary**: Vision model have gained increasing attention due to their simplicity and efficiency in Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. However, due to lacking the perception of linguistic knowledge and information, recent vision models suffer from two problems: (1) the pure vision-based query results in attention drift, which usually causes poor recognition and is summarized as linguistic insensitive drift (LID) problem in this paper. (2) the visual feature is suboptimal for the recognition in some vision-missing cases (e.g. occlusion, etc.). To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{L}$inguistic $\textbf{P}$erception $\textbf{V}$ision model (LPV), which explores the linguistic capability of vision model for accurate text recognition. To alleviate the LID problem, we introduce a Cascade Position Attention (CPA) mechanism that obtains high-quality and accurate attention maps through step-wise optimization and linguistic information mining. Furthermore, a Global Linguistic Reconstruction Module (GLRM) is proposed to improve the representation of visual features by perceiving the linguistic information in the visual space, which gradually converts visual features into semantically rich ones during the cascade process. Different from previous methods, our method obtains SOTA results while keeping low complexity (92.4% accuracy with only 8.11M parameters).

- **Summary**: Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is challenging due to the cross-domain nature of sketches and photos, as well as the semantic gap between seen and unseen image distributions. Previous methods fine-tune pre-trained models with various side information and learning strategies to learn a compact feature space that is shared between the sketch and photo domains and bridges seen and unseen classes. However, these efforts are inadequate in adapting domains and transferring knowledge from seen to unseen classes. In this paper, we present an effective ``Adapt and Align'' approach to address the key challenges. Specifically, we insert simple and lightweight domain adapters to learn new abstract concepts of the sketch domain and improve cross-domain representation capabilities. Inspired by recent advances in image-text foundation models (e.g., CLIP) on zero-shot scenarios, we explicitly align the learned image embedding with a more semantic text embedding to achieve the desired knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two popular backbones demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of retrieval accuracy and flexibility.



### A Mountain-Shaped Single-Stage Network for Accurate Image Restoration

- **Summary**: Image restoration is the task of aiming to obtain a high-quality image from a corrupt input image, such as deblurring and deraining. In image restoration, it is typically necessary to maintain a complex balance between spatial details and contextual information. Although a multi-stage network can optimally balance these competing goals and achieve significant performance, this also increases the system's complexity. In this paper, we propose a mountain-shaped single-stage design base on a simple U-Net architecture, which removes or replaces unnecessary nonlinear activation functions to achieve the above balance with low system complexity. Specifically, we propose a feature fusion middleware (FFM) mechanism as an information exchange component between the encoder-decoder architectural levels. It seamlessly integrates upper-layer information into the adjacent lower layer, sequentially down to the lowest layer. Finally, all information is fused into the original image resolution manipulation level. This preserves spatial details and integrates contextual information, ensuring high-quality image restoration. In addition, we propose a multi-head attention middle block (MHAMB) as a bridge between the encoder and decoder to capture more global information and surpass the limitations of the receptive field of CNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach, named as M3SNet, outperforms previous state-of-the-art models while using less than half the computational costs, for several image restoration tasks, such as image deraining and deblurring.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose DeepTree, a novel method for modeling trees based on learning developmental rules for branching structures instead of manually defining them. We call our deep neural model situated latent because its behavior is determined by the intrinsic state -- encoded as a latent space of a deep neural model -- and by the extrinsic (environmental) data that is situated as the location in the 3D space and on the tree structure. We use a neural network pipeline to train a situated latent space that allows us to locally predict branch growth only based on a single node in the branch graph of a tree model. We use this representation to progressively develop new branch nodes, thereby mimicking the growth process of trees. Starting from a root node, a tree is generated by iteratively querying the neural network on the newly added nodes resulting in the branching structure of the whole tree. Our method enables generating a wide variety of tree shapes without the need to define intricate parameters that control their growth and behavior. Furthermore, we show that the situated latents can also be used to encode the environmental response of tree models, e.g., when trees grow next to obstacles. We validate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the similarity of our tree models and by procedurally generated ones based on a number of established metrics for tree form.



### Multi-Granularity Denoising and Bidirectional Alignment for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) models relying on class activation maps (CAMs) have achieved desirable performance comparing to the non-CAMs-based counterparts. However, to guarantee WSSS task feasible, we need to generate pseudo labels by expanding the seeds from CAMs which is complex and time-consuming, thus hindering the design of efficient end-to-end (single-stage) WSSS approaches. To tackle the above dilemma, we resort to the off-the-shelf and readily accessible saliency maps for directly obtaining pseudo labels given the image-level class labels. Nevertheless, the salient regions may contain noisy labels and cannot seamlessly fit the target objects, and saliency maps can only be approximated as pseudo labels for simple images containing single-class objects. As such, the achieved segmentation model with these simple images cannot generalize well to the complex images containing multi-class objects. To this end, we propose an end-to-end multi-granularity denoising and bidirectional alignment (MDBA) model, to alleviate the noisy label and multi-class generalization issues. Specifically, we propose the online noise filtering and progressive noise detection modules to tackle image-level and pixel-level noise, respectively. Moreover, a bidirectional alignment mechanism is proposed to reduce the data distribution gap at both input and output space with simple-to-complex image synthesis and complex-to-simple adversarial learning. MDBA can reach the mIoU of 69.5\% and 70.2\% on validation and test sets for the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.

- **Summary**: Effective distribution of nutritional and healthcare aid for children, particularly infants and toddlers, in some of the least developed and most impoverished countries of the world, is a major problem due to the lack of reliable identification documents. Biometric authentication technology has been investigated to address child recognition in the absence of reliable ID documents. We present a mobile-based contactless palmprint recognition system, called Child Palm-ID, which meets the requirements of usability, hygiene, cost, and accuracy for child recognition. Using a contactless child palmprint database, Child-PalmDB1, consisting of 19,158 images from 1,020 unique palms (in the age range of 6 mos. to 48 mos.), we report a TAR=94.11% @ FAR=0.1%. The proposed Child Palm-ID system is also able to recognize adults, achieving a TAR=99.4% on the CASIA contactless palmprint database and a TAR=100% on the COEP contactless adult palmprint database, both @ FAR=0.1%. These accuracies are competitive with the SOTA provided by COTS systems. Despite these high accuracies, we show that the TAR for time-separated child-palmprints is only 78.1% @ FAR=0.1%.

- **Summary**: Human intelligence gradually accepts new information and accumulates knowledge throughout the lifespan. However, deep learning models suffer from a catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, where they forget previous knowledge when acquiring new information. Class-Incremental Learning aims to create an integrated model that balances plasticity and stability to overcome this challenge. In this paper, we propose a selective regularization method that accepts new knowledge while maintaining previous knowledge. We first introduce an asymmetric feature distillation method for old and new classes inspired by cognitive science, using the gradient of classification and knowledge distillation losses to determine whether to perform pattern completion or pattern separation. We also propose a method to selectively interpolate the weight of the previous model for a balance between stability and plasticity, and we adjust whether to transfer through model confidence to ensure the performance of the previous class and enable exploratory learning. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which surpasses the performance of existing methods through extensive experimental protocols using CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full.

- **Summary**: Multi-stage strategies are frequently employed in image restoration tasks. While transformer-based methods have exhibited high efficiency in single-image super-resolution tasks, they have not yet shown significant advantages over CNN-based methods in stereo super-resolution tasks. This can be attributed to two key factors: first, current single-image super-resolution transformers are unable to leverage the complementary stereo information during the process; second, the performance of transformers is typically reliant on sufficient data, which is absent in common stereo-image super-resolution algorithms. To address these issues, we propose a Hybrid Transformer and CNN Attention Network (HTCAN), which utilizes a transformer-based network for single-image enhancement and a CNN-based network for stereo information fusion. Furthermore, we employ a multi-patch training strategy and larger window sizes to activate more input pixels for super-resolution. We also revisit other advanced techniques, such as data augmentation, data ensemble, and model ensemble to reduce overfitting and data bias. Finally, our approach achieved a score of 23.90dB and emerged as the winner in Track 1 of the NTIRE 2023 Stereo Image Super-Resolution Challenge.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models, which have emerged to become popular text-to-image generation models, can produce high-quality and content-rich images guided by textual prompts. However, there are limitations to semantic understanding and commonsense reasoning in existing models when the input prompts are concise narrative, resulting in low-quality image generation. To improve the capacities for narrative prompts, we propose a simple-yet-effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called the Semantic Understanding and Reasoning adapter (SUR-adapter) for pre-trained diffusion models. To reach this goal, we first collect and annotate a new dataset SURD which consists of more than 57,000 semantically corrected multi-modal samples. Each sample contains a simple narrative prompt, a complex keyword-based prompt, and a high-quality image. Then, we align the semantic representation of narrative prompts to the complex prompts and transfer knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to our SUR-adapter via knowledge distillation so that it can acquire the powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities to build a high-quality textual semantic representation for text-to-image generation. We conduct experiments by integrating multiple LLMs and popular pre-trained diffusion models to show the effectiveness of our approach in enabling diffusion models to understand and reason concise natural language without image quality degradation. Our approach can make text-to-image diffusion models easier to use with better user experience, which demonstrates our approach has the potential for further advancing the development of user-friendly text-to-image generation models by bridging the semantic gap between simple narrative prompts and complex keyword-based prompts. The code is released at https://github.com/Qrange-group/SUR-adapter.

- **Summary**: In computer vision, the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) is highly related to the feature extraction ability, i.e., the ability to recognize and focus on key pixel regions in an image. However, in this paper, we quantitatively and statistically illustrate that DNNs have a serious attention bias problem on many samples from some popular datasets: (1) Position bias: DNNs fully focus on label-independent regions; (2) Range bias: The focused regions from DNN are not completely contained in the ideal region. Moreover, we find that the existing self-attention modules can alleviate these biases to a certain extent, but the biases are still non-negligible. To further mitigate them, we propose a lightweight sub-attention strategy (LSAS), which utilizes high-order sub-attention modules to improve the original self-attention modules. The effectiveness of LSAS is demonstrated by extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets and popular attention networks. We release our code to help other researchers to reproduce the results of LSAS~\footnote{https://github.com/Qrange-group/LSAS}.

- **Summary**: Large vision and language models, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), are rapidly becoming the industry norm for matching images and texts. In order to improve its zero-shot recognition performance, current research either adds additional web-crawled image-text pairs or designs new training losses. However, the additional costs associated with training from scratch and data collection substantially hinder their deployment. In this paper, we present HELIP, a low-cost strategy for boosting the performance of well-trained CLIP models by finetuning them with hard samples over original training data. Mixing hard examples into each batch, the well-trained CLIP model is then fine-tuned using the conventional contrastive alignment objective and a margin loss to distinguish between normal and hard negative data. HELIP is deployed in a plug-and-play fashion to existing models. On a comprehensive zero-shot and retrieval benchmark, without training the model from scratch or utilizing additional data, HELIP consistently boosts existing models to achieve leading performance. In particular, HELIP boosts ImageNet zero-shot accuracy of SLIP by 3.05 and 4.47 when pretrained on CC3M and CC12M respectively. In addition, a systematic evaluation of zero-shot and linear probing experiments across fine-grained classification datasets demonstrates a consistent performance improvement and validates the efficacy of HELIP . When pretraining on CC3M, HELIP boosts zero-shot performance of CLIP and SLIP by 8.4\% and 18.6\% on average respectively, and linear probe performance by 9.5\% and 3.0\% on average respectively.

- **Summary**: We propose an end-to-end deep learning approach to rectify fisheye images and simultaneously calibrate camera intrinsic and distortion parameters. Our method consists of two parts: a Quick Image Rectification Module developed with a Pix2Pix GAN and Wasserstein GAN (W-Pix2PixGAN), and a Calibration Module with a CNN architecture. Our Quick Rectification Network performs robust rectification with good resolution, making it suitable for constant calibration in camera-based surveillance equipment. To achieve high-quality calibration, we use the straightened output from the Quick Rectification Module as a guidance-like semantic feature map for the Calibration Module to learn the geometric relationship between the straightened feature and the distorted feature. We train and validate our method with a large synthesized dataset labeled with well-simulated parameters applied to a perspective image dataset. Our solution has achieved robust performance in high-resolution with a significant PSNR value of 22.343.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained multi-label classification models have broad applications in e-commerce, such as visual based label predictions ranging from fashion attribute detection to brand recognition. One challenge to achieve satisfactory performance for those classification tasks in real world is the wild visual background signal that contains irrelevant pixels which confuses model to focus onto the region of interest and make prediction upon the specific region. In this paper, we introduce a generic semantic-embedding deep neural network to apply the spatial awareness semantic feature incorporating a channel-wise attention based model to leverage the localization guidance to boost model performance for multi-label prediction. We observed an Avg.relative improvement of 15.27% in terms of AUC score across all labels compared to the baseline approach. Core experiment and ablation studies involve multi-label fashion attribute classification performed on Instagram fashion apparels' image. We compared the model performances among our approach, baseline approach, and 3 alternative approaches to leverage semantic features. Results show favorable performance for our approach.

- **Summary**: The knowledge distillation uses a high-performance teacher network to guide the student network. However, the performance gap between the teacher and student networks can affect the student's training. This paper proposes a novel knowledge distillation algorithm based on dynamic entropy correction to reduce the gap by adjusting the student instead of the teacher. Firstly, the effect of changing the output entropy (short for output information entropy) in the student on the distillation loss is analyzed in theory. This paper shows that correcting the output entropy can reduce the gap. Then, a knowledge distillation algorithm based on dynamic entropy correction is created, which can correct the output entropy in real-time with an entropy controller updated dynamically by the distillation loss. The proposed algorithm is validated on the CIFAR100 and ImageNet. The comparison with various state-of-the-art distillation algorithms shows impressive results, especially in the experiment on the CIFAR100 regarding teacher-student pair resnet32x4-resnet8x4. The proposed algorithm raises 2.64 points over the traditional distillation algorithm and 0.87 points over the state-of-the-art algorithm CRD in classification accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Visual place recognition (VPR) enables autonomous systems to localize themselves within an environment using image information. While Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) currently dominate state-of-the-art VPR performance, their high computational requirements make them unsuitable for platforms with budget or size constraints. This has spurred the development of lightweight algorithms, such as DrosoNet, which employs a voting system based on multiple bio-inspired units. In this paper, we present a novel training approach for DrosoNet, wherein separate models are trained on distinct regions of a reference image, allowing them to specialize in the visual features of that specific section. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional-like prediction method, in which each DrosoNet unit generates a set of place predictions for each portion of the query image. These predictions are then combined using the previously introduced voting system. Our approach significantly improves upon the VPR performance of previous work while maintaining an extremely compact and lightweight algorithm, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms.

- **Summary**: Light field salient object detection (SOD) is an emerging research direction attributed to the richness of light field data. However, most existing methods lack effective handling of focal stacks, therefore making the latter involved in a lot of interfering information and degrade the performance of SOD. To address this limitation, we propose to utilize multi-modal features to refine focal stacks in a guided manner, resulting in a novel guided focal stack refinement network called GFRNet. To this end, we propose a guided refinement and fusion module (GRFM) to refine focal stacks and aggregate multi-modal features. In GRFM, all-in-focus (AiF) and depth modalities are utilized to refine focal stacks separately, leading to two novel sub-modules for different modalities, namely AiF-based refinement module (ARM) and depth-based refinement module (DRM). Such refinement modules enhance structural and positional information of salient objects in focal stacks, and are able to improve SOD accuracy. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GFRNet model against 12 state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: In this paper we address the rotation synchronization problem, where the objective is to recover absolute rotations starting from pairwise ones, where the unknowns and the measures are represented as nodes and edges of a graph, respectively. This problem is an essential task for structure from motion and simultaneous localization and mapping. We focus on the formulation of synchronization via neural networks, which has only recently begun to be explored in the literature. Inspired by deep matrix completion, we express rotation synchronization in terms of matrix factorization with a deep neural network. Our formulation exhibits implicit regularization properties and, more importantly, is unsupervised, whereas previous deep approaches are supervised. Our experiments show that we achieve comparable accuracy to the closest competitors in most scenes, while working under weaker assumptions.

- **Summary**: 3D point clouds are a crucial type of data collected by LiDAR sensors and widely used in transportation applications due to its concise descriptions and accurate localization. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing large amount of disordered and sparse 3D point clouds, especially in various computer vision tasks, such as pedestrian detection and vehicle recognition. Among all the learning paradigms, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), an unsupervised training paradigm that mines effective information from the data itself, is considered as an essential solution to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive data labelling problems via smart pre-training task design. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances on SSL for point clouds. We first present an innovative taxonomy, categorizing the existing SSL methods into four broad categories based on the pretexts' characteristics. Under each category, we then further categorize the methods into more fine-grained groups and summarize the strength and limitations of the representative methods. We also compare the performance of the notable SSL methods in literature on multiple downstream tasks on benchmark datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we propose a number of future research directions based on the identified limitations of existing SSL research on point clouds.

- **Summary**: The rising demand for networked embedded systems with machine intelligence has been a catalyst for sustained attempts by the research community to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based inferencing on embedded resource-limited devices. Redesigning a CNN by removing costly multiplication operations has already shown promising results in terms of reducing inference energy usage. This paper proposes a new method for replacing multiplications in a CNN by table look-ups. Unlike existing methods that completely modify the CNN operations, the proposed methodology preserves the semantics of the major CNN operations. Conforming to the existing mechanism of the CNN layer operations ensures that the reliability of a standard CNN is preserved. It is shown that the proposed multiplication-free CNN, based on a single activation codebook, can achieve 4.7x, 5.6x, and 3.5x reduction in energy per inference in an FPGA implementation of MNIST-LeNet-5, CIFAR10-VGG-11, and Tiny ImageNet-ResNet-18 respectively. Our results show that the DietCNN approach significantly improves the resource consumption and latency of deep inference for smaller models, often used in embedded systems.

- **Summary**: Due to the rising threat of deepfakes to security and privacy, it is most important to develop robust and reliable detectors. In this paper, we examine the need for high-quality samples in the training datasets of such detectors. Accordingly, we show that deepfake detectors proven to generalize well on multiple research datasets still struggle in real-world scenarios with well-crafted fakes. First, we propose a novel autoencoder for face swapping alongside an advanced face blending technique, which we utilize to generate 90 high-quality deepfakes. Second, we feed those fakes to a state-of-the-art detector, causing its performance to decrease drastically. Moreover, we fine-tune the detector on our fakes and demonstrate that they contain useful clues for the detection of manipulations. Overall, our results provide insights into the generalization of deepfake detectors and suggest that their training datasets should be complemented by high-quality fakes since training on mere research data is insufficient.

The suggested method makes use of the Mediapipe library for feature extraction and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for ASL gesture classification. The testing results show that the suggested system can detect all ASL alphabets with an accuracy of 99.95%, indicating its potential for use in communication devices for people with hearing impairments. The proposed approach can also be applied to additional sign languages with similar hand motions, potentially increasing the quality of life for people with hearing loss. Overall, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of using Mediapipe and CNN for real-time sign language recognition, making a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and machine learning.

- **Summary**: Visual localization plays an important role in the positioning and navigation of robotics systems within previously visited environments. When visits occur over long periods of time, changes in the environment related to seasons or day-night cycles present a major challenge. Under water, the sources of variability are due to other factors such as water conditions or growth of marine organisms. Yet it remains a major obstacle and a much less studied one, partly due to the lack of data. This paper presents a new deep-sea dataset to benchmark underwater long-term visual localization. The dataset is composed of images from four visits to the same hydrothermal vent edifice over the course of five years. Camera poses and a common geometry of the scene were estimated using navigation data and Structure-from-Motion. This serves as a reference when evaluating visual localization techniques. An analysis of the data provides insights about the major changes observed throughout the years. Furthermore, several well-established visual localization methods are evaluated on the dataset, showing there is still room for improvement in underwater long-term visual localization. The data is made publicly available at https://www.seanoe.org/data/00810/92226/.

- **Summary**: Cancer diagnoses typically involve human pathologists examining whole slide images (WSIs) of tissue section biopsies to identify tumor cells and their subtypes. However, artificial intelligence (AI)-based models, particularly weakly supervised approaches, have recently emerged as viable alternatives. Weakly supervised approaches often use image subsections or tiles as input, with the overall classification of the WSI based on attention scores assigned to each tile. However, this method overlooks the potential for false positives/negatives because tumors can be heterogeneous, with cancer and normal cells growing in patterns larger than a single tile. Such errors at the tile level could lead to misclassification at the tumor level. To address this limitation, we developed a novel deep learning pooling operator called CHARM (Contrastive Histopathology Attention Resolved Models). CHARM leverages the dependencies among single tiles within a WSI and imposes contextual constraints as prior knowledge to multiple instance learning models. We tested CHARM on the subtyping of non-small cell lung cancer (NSLC) and lymph node (LN) metastasis, and the results demonstrated its superiority over other state-of-the-art weakly supervised classification algorithms. Furthermore, CHARM facilitates interpretability by visualizing regions of attention.

- **Summary**: Starches are important energy sources found in plants with many uses in the pharmaceutical industry such as binders, disintegrants, bulking agents in drugs and thus require very careful physicochemical analysis for proper identification and verification which includes microscopy. In this work, we applied artificial intelligence techniques (using transfer learning and deep convolution neural network CNNs to microscopical images obtained from 9 starch samples of different botanical sources. Our approach obtained an accuracy of 61% when the machine learning model was pretrained on microscopic images from MicroNet dataset. However the accuracy jumped to 81% for model pretrained on random day to day images obtained from Imagenet dataset. The model pretrained on the imagenet dataset also showed a better precision, recall and f1 score than that pretrained on the imagenet dataset.

- **Summary**: Text irregularities pose significant challenges to scene text recognizers. Thin-Plate Spline (TPS)-based rectification is widely regarded as an effective means to deal with them. Currently, the calculation of TPS transformation parameters purely depends on the quality of regressed text borders. It ignores the text content and often leads to unsatisfactory rectified results for severely distorted text. In this work, we introduce TPS++, an attention-enhanced TPS transformation that incorporates the attention mechanism to text rectification for the first time. TPS++ formulates the parameter calculation as a joint process of foreground control point regression and content-based attention score estimation, which is computed by a dedicated designed gated-attention block. TPS++ builds a more flexible content-aware rectifier, generating a natural text correction that is easier to read by the subsequent recognizer. Moreover, TPS++ shares the feature backbone with the recognizer in part and implements the rectification at feature-level rather than image-level, incurring only a small overhead in terms of parameters and inference time. Experiments on public benchmarks show that TPS++ consistently improves the recognition and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Meanwhile, it generalizes well on different backbones and recognizers.

- **Summary**: Multi-phase liver contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images convey the complementary multi-phase information for liver tumor segmentation (LiTS), which are crucial to assist the diagnosis of liver cancer clinically. However, the performances of existing multi-phase liver tumor segmentation (MPLiTS)-based methods suffer from redundancy and weak interpretability, % of the fused result, resulting in the implicit unreliability of clinical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel trustworthy multi-phase liver tumor segmentation (TMPLiTS), which is a unified framework jointly conducting segmentation and uncertainty estimation. The trustworthy results could assist the clinicians to make a reliable diagnosis. Specifically, Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory (DST) is introduced to parameterize the segmentation and uncertainty as evidence following Dirichlet distribution. The reliability of segmentation results among multi-phase CECT images is quantified explicitly. Meanwhile, a multi-expert mixture scheme (MEMS) is proposed to fuse the multi-phase evidences, which can guarantee the effect of fusion procedure based on theoretical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TMPLiTS compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the robustness of TMPLiTS is verified, where the reliable performance can be guaranteed against the perturbations.

- **Summary**: Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have been re-introduced as a more compact and interpretable alternative to standard deep neural networks. While recent efforts have proved their compression capabilities, to date, their interpretability properties have not been fully assessed. Here, we conduct a systematic and principled study towards assessing the interpretability of these types of networks. Moreover, we pay special attention towards analyzing the level to which part-whole relationships are indeed encoded within the learned representation. Our analysis in the MNIST, SVHN, PASCAL-part and CelebA datasets suggest that the representations encoded in CapsNets might not be as disentangled nor strictly related to parts-whole relationships as is commonly stated in the literature.

- **Summary**: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as one of the effective methods to design the optimal neural network architecture automatically. Although neural architectures have achieved human-level performances in several tasks, few of them are obtained from the NAS method. The main reason is the huge search space of neural architectures, making NAS algorithms inefficient. This work presents a novel architecture search algorithm, called GPT-NAS, that optimizes neural architectures by Generative Pre-Trained (GPT) model with an evolutionary algorithm (EA) as the search strategy. In GPT-NAS, we assume that a generative model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus could learn the fundamental law of building neural architectures. Therefore, GPT-NAS leverages the GPT model to propose reasonable architecture components given the basic one and then utilizes EAs to search for the optimal solution. Such an approach can largely reduce the search space by introducing prior knowledge in the search process. Extensive experimental results show that our GPT-NAS method significantly outperforms seven manually designed neural architectures and thirteen architectures provided by competing NAS methods. In addition, our experiments also indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of finely tuned neural architectures by up to about 12% compared to those without GPT, further demonstrating its effectiveness in searching neural architectures.

- **Summary**: 3D dynamic point cloud (DPC) compression relies on mining its temporal context, which faces significant challenges due to DPC's sparsity and non-uniform structure. Existing methods are limited in capturing sufficient temporal dependencies. Therefore, this paper proposes a learning-based DPC compression framework via hierarchical block-matching-based inter-prediction module to compensate and compress the DPC geometry in latent space. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical motion estimation and motion compensation (Hie-ME/MC) framework for flexible inter-prediction, which dynamically selects the granularity of optical flow to encapsulate the motion information accurately. To improve the motion estimation efficiency of the proposed inter-prediction module, we further design a KNN-attention block matching (KABM) network that determines the impact of potential corresponding points based on the geometry and feature correlation. Finally, we compress the residual and the multi-scale optical flow with a fully-factorized deep entropy model. The experiment result on the MPEG-specified Owlii Dynamic Human Dynamic Point Cloud (Owlii) dataset shows that our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods and the MPEG standard V-PCC v18 in inter-frame low-delay mode.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an unsupervised approach for writer retrieval based on clustering SIFT descriptors detected at keypoint locations resulting in pseudo-cluster labels. With those cluster labels, a residual network followed by our proposed NetRVLAD, an encoding layer with reduced complexity compared to NetVLAD, is trained on 32x32 patches at keypoint locations. Additionally, we suggest a graph-based reranking algorithm called SGR to exploit similarities of the page embeddings to boost the retrieval performance. Our approach is evaluated on two historical datasets (Historical-WI and HisIR19). We include an evaluation of different backbones and NetRVLAD. It competes with related work on historical datasets without using explicit encodings. We set a new State-of-the-art on both datasets by applying our reranking scheme and show that our approach achieves comparable performance on a modern dataset as well.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised methods based on contrastive learning have achieved great success in unsupervised visual representation learning. However, most methods under this framework suffer from the problem of false negative samples. Inspired by mean shift for self-supervised learning, we propose a new simple framework, namely Multiple Sample Views and Queues (MSVQ). We jointly construct a soft label on-the-fly by introducing two complementary and symmetric ways: multiple augmented positive views and two momentum encoders forming various semantic features of negative samples. Two teacher networks perform similarity relationship calculations with negative samples and then transfer this knowledge to the student. Let the student mimic the similar relationship between the samples, thus giving the student a more flexible ability to identify false negative samples in the dataset. The classification results on four benchmark image datasets demonstrate the high effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared to some classical methods. Source code and pretrained models are available at $\href{https://github.com/pc-cp/MSVQ}{this~http~URL}$.

- **Summary**: Robustness is a fundamental property of machine learning classifiers to achieve safety and reliability. In the fields of adversarial robustness and formal robustness verification of image classification models, robustness is commonly defined as the stability to all input variations within an Lp-norm distance. However, robustness to random corruptions is usually improved and evaluated using variations observed in the real-world, while mathematically defined Lp-norm corruptions are rarely considered. This study investigates the use of random Lp-norm corruptions to augment the training and test data of image classifiers. We adapt an approach from the field of adversarial robustness to assess the model robustness to imperceptible random corruptions. We empirically and theoretically investigate whether robustness is transferable across different Lp-norms and derive conclusions on which Lp-norm corruptions a model should be trained and evaluated on. We find that training data augmentation with L0-norm corruptions improves corruption robustness while maintaining accuracy compared to standard training and when applied on top of selected state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques.

- **Summary**: In a constant evolving world, change detection is of prime importance to keep updated maps. To better sense areas with complex geometry (urban areas in particular), considering 3D data appears to be an interesting alternative to classical 2D images. In this context, 3D point clouds (PCs) obtained by LiDAR or photogrammetry are very interesting. While recent studies showed the considerable benefit of using deep learning-based methods to detect and characterize changes into raw 3D PCs, these studies rely on large annotated training data to obtain accurate results. The collection of these annotations are tricky and time-consuming. The availability of unsupervised or weakly supervised approaches is then of prime interest. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method, called DeepCluster 3D Change Detection (DC3DCD), to detect and categorize multiclass changes at point level. We classify our approach in the unsupervised family given the fact that we extract in a completely unsupervised way a number of clusters associated with potential changes. Let us precise that in the end of the process, the user has only to assign a label to each of these clusters to derive the final change map. Our method builds upon the DeepCluster approach, originally designed for image classification, to handle complex raw 3D PCs and perform change segmentation task. An assessment of the method on both simulated and real public dataset is provided. The proposed method allows to outperform fully-supervised traditional machine learning algorithm and to be competitive with fully-supervised deep learning networks applied on rasterization of 3D PCs with a mean of IoU over classes of change of 57.06% and 66.69% for the simulated and the real datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: We are interested in aligning how people think about objects and what machines perceive, meaning by this the fact that object recognition, as performed by a machine, should follow a process which resembles that followed by humans when thinking of an object associated with a certain concept. The ultimate goal is to build systems which can meaningfully interact with their users, describing what they perceive in the users' own terms. As from the field of Lexical Semantics, humans organize the meaning of words in hierarchies where the meaning of, e.g., a noun, is defined in terms of the meaning of a more general noun, its genus, and of one or more differentiating properties, its differentia. The main tenet of this paper is that object recognition should implement a hierarchical process which follows the hierarchical semantic structure used to define the meaning of words. We achieve this goal by implementing an algorithm which, for any object, recursively recognizes its visual genus and its visual differentia. In other words, the recognition of an object is decomposed in a sequence of steps where the locally relevant visual features are recognized. This paper presents the algorithm and a first evaluation.

- **Summary**: In this study, we propose a big data pipeline for cotton bloom detection using a Lambda architecture, which enables real-time and batch processing of data. Our proposed approach leverages Azure resources such as Data Factory, Event Grids, Rest APIs, and Databricks. This work is the first to develop and demonstrate the implementation of such a pipeline for plant phenotyping through Azure's cloud computing service. The proposed pipeline consists of data preprocessing, object detection using a YOLOv5 neural network model trained through Azure AutoML, and visualization of object detection bounding boxes on output images. The trained model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 0.96, demonstrating its high performance for cotton bloom classification. We evaluate our Lambda architecture pipeline using 9000 images yielding an optimized runtime of 34 minutes. The results illustrate the scalability of the proposed pipeline as a solution for deep learning object detection, with the potential for further expansion through additional Azure processing cores. This work advances the scientific research field by providing a new method for cotton bloom detection on a large dataset and demonstrates the potential of utilizing cloud computing resources, specifically Azure, for efficient and accurate big data processing in precision agriculture.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic ultrasound images via Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) guided by cardiac semantic label maps. We show that these synthetic images can serve as a viable substitute for real data in the training of deep-learning models for ultrasound image analysis tasks such as cardiac segmentation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we generated synthetic 2D echocardiograms and trained a neural network for segmenting the left ventricle and left atrium. The performance of the network trained on exclusively synthetic images was evaluated on an unseen dataset of real images and yielded mean Dice scores of 88.6 $\pm 4.91$ , 91.9 $\pm 4.22$, 85.2 $\pm 4.83$ \% for left ventricular endocardium, epicardium and left atrial segmentation respectively. This represents a relative increase of $9.2$, $3.3$ and $13.9$ \% in Dice scores compared to the previous state-of-the-art. The proposed pipeline has potential for application to a wide range of other tasks across various medical imaging modalities.

- **Summary**: Critical clinical decision points in haematology are influenced by the requirement of bone marrow cytology for a haematological diagnosis. Bone marrow cytology, however, is restricted to reference facilities with expertise, and linked to inter-observer variability which requires a long time to process that could result in a delayed or inaccurate diagnosis, leaving an unmet need for cutting-edge supporting technologies. This paper presents a novel transfer learning model for Bone Marrow Cell Detection to provide a solution to all the difficulties faced for the task along with considerable accuracy. The proposed model achieved 96.19\% accuracy which can be used in the future for analysis of other medical images in this domain.

- **Summary**: Webpages have been a rich resource for language and vision-language tasks. Yet only pieces of webpages are kept: image-caption pairs, long text articles, or raw HTML, never all in one place. Webpage tasks have resultingly received little attention and structured image-text data underused. To study multimodal webpage understanding, we introduce the Wikipedia Webpage 2M (WikiWeb2M) suite; the first to retain the full set of images, text, and structure data available in a page. WikiWeb2M can be used for tasks like page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in syncing lip movements with any audio waves, current methods still struggle to balance generation quality and the model's generalization ability. Previous studies either require long-term data for training or produce a similar movement pattern on all subjects with low quality. In this paper, we propose StyleSync, an effective framework that enables high-fidelity lip synchronization. We identify that a style-based generator would sufficiently enable such a charming property on both one-shot and few-shot scenarios. Specifically, we design a mask-guided spatial information encoding module that preserves the details of the given face. The mouth shapes are accurately modified by audio through modulated convolutions. Moreover, our design also enables personalized lip-sync by introducing style space and generator refinement on only limited frames. Thus the identity and talking style of a target person could be accurately preserved. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-fidelity results on a variety of scenes.

- **Summary**: Most learning-based image compression methods lack efficiency for high image quality due to their non-invertible design. The decoding function of the frequently applied compressive autoencoder architecture is only an approximated inverse of the encoding transform. This issue can be resolved by using invertible latent variable models, which allow a perfect reconstruction if no quantization is performed. Furthermore, many traditional image and video coders apply dynamic block partitioning to vary the compression of certain image regions depending on their content. Inspired by this approach, hierarchical latent spaces have been applied to learning-based compression networks. In this paper, we present a novel concept, which adapts the hierarchical latent space for augmented normalizing flows, an invertible latent variable model. Our best performing model achieved average rate savings of more than 7% over comparable single-scale models.

- **Summary**: This technical report presents our Restormer-Plus approach, which was submitted to the GT-RAIN Challenge (CVPR 2023 UG$^2$+ Track 3). Details regarding the challenge are available at http://cvpr2023.ug2challenge.org/track3.html. Restormer-Plus outperformed all other submitted solutions in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and ranked 4th in terms of structural similarity (SSIM). It was officially evaluated by the competition organizers as a runner-up solution. It consists of four main modules: the single-image de-raining module (Restormer-X), the median filtering module, the weighted averaging module, and the post-processing module. Restormer-X is applied to each rainy image and built on top of Restormer. The median filtering module is used as a median operator for rainy images associated with each scene. The weighted averaging module combines the median filtering results with those of Restormer-X to alleviate overfitting caused by using only Restormer-X. Finally, the post-processing module is utilized to improve the brightness restoration. These modules make Restormer-Plus one of the state-of-the-art solutions for the GT-RAIN Challenge.

- **Summary**: Large-scale text-to-video diffusion models have demonstrated an exceptional ability to synthesize diverse videos. However, due to the lack of extensive text-to-video datasets and the necessary computational resources for training, directly applying these models for video stylization remains difficult. Also, given that the noise addition process on the input content is random and destructive, fulfilling the style transfer task's content preservation criteria is challenging. This paper proposes a zero-shot video stylization method named Style-A-Video, which utilizes a generative pre-trained transformer with an image latent diffusion model to achieve a concise text-controlled video stylization. We improve the guidance condition in the denoising process, establishing a balance between artistic expression and structure preservation. Furthermore, to decrease inter-frame flicker and avoid the formation of additional artifacts, we employ a sampling optimization and a temporal consistency module. Extensive experiments show that we can attain superior content preservation and stylistic performance while incurring less consumption than previous solutions.

- **Summary**: Predicting a binary mask for an object is more accurate but also more computationally expensive than a bounding box. Polygonal masks as developed in CenterPoly can be a good compromise. In this paper, we improve over CenterPoly by enhancing the classical regression L1 loss with a novel region-based loss and a novel order loss, as well as with a new training process for the vertices prediction head. Moreover, the previous methods that predict polygonal masks use different coordinate systems, but it is not clear if one is better than another, if we abstract the architecture requirement. We therefore investigate their impact on the prediction. We also use a new evaluation protocol with oracle predictions for the detection head, to further isolate the segmentation process and better compare the polygonal masks with binary masks. Our instance segmentation method is trained and tested with challenging datasets containing urban scenes, with a high density of road users. Experiments show, in particular, that using a combination of a regression loss and a region-based loss allows significant improvements on the Cityscapes and IDD test set compared to CenterPoly. Moreover the inference stage remains fast enough to reach real-time performance with an average of 0.045 s per frame for 2048$\times$1024 images on a single RTX 2070 GPU. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/KatiaJDL/CenterPoly-v2}{\text{here}}$.

- **Summary**: The advancement of Image Processing has led to the widespread use of Object Recognition (OR) models in various applications, such as airport security and mail sorting. These models have become essential in signifying the capabilities of AI and supporting vital services like national postal operations. However, the performance of OR models can be impeded by real-life scenarios, such as traffic sign alteration. Therefore, this research investigates the effects of altered traffic signs on the accuracy and performance of object recognition models. To this end, a publicly available dataset was used to create different types of traffic sign alterations, including changes to size, shape, color, visibility, and angles. The impact of these alterations on the YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) model's detection and classification abilities were analyzed. It reveals that the accuracy of object detection models decreases significantly when exposed to modified traffic signs under unlikely conditions. This study highlights the significance of enhancing the robustness of object detection models in real-life scenarios and the need for further investigation in this area to improve their accuracy and reliability.

- **Summary**: The use of deep unfolding networks in compressive sensing (CS) has seen wide success as they provide both simplicity and interpretability. However, since most deep unfolding networks are iterative, this incurs significant redundancies in the network. In this work, we propose a novel recursion-based framework to enhance the efficiency of deep unfolding models. First, recursions are used to effectively eliminate the redundancies in deep unfolding networks. Secondly, we randomize the number of recursions during training to decrease the overall training time. Finally, to effectively utilize the power of recursions, we introduce a learnable unit to modulate the features of the model based on both the total number of iterations and the current iteration index. To evaluate the proposed framework, we apply it to both ISTA-Net+ and COAST. Extensive testing shows that our proposed framework allows the network to cut down as much as 75% of its learnable parameters while mostly maintaining its performance, and at the same time, it cuts around 21% and 42% from the training time for ISTA-Net+ and COAST respectively. Moreover, when presented with a limited training dataset, the recursive models match or even outperform their respective non-recursive baseline.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art object detection and segmentation methods for microscopy images rely on supervised machine learning, which requires laborious manual annotation of training data. Here we present a self-supervised method based on time arrow prediction pre-training that learns dense image representations from raw, unlabeled live-cell microscopy videos. Our method builds upon the task of predicting the correct order of time-flipped image regions via a single-image feature extractor followed by a time arrow prediction head that operates on the fused features. We show that the resulting dense representations capture inherently time-asymmetric biological processes such as cell divisions on a pixel-level. We furthermore demonstrate the utility of these representations on several live-cell microscopy datasets for detection and segmentation of dividing cells, as well as for cell state classification. Our method outperforms supervised methods, particularly when only limited ground truth annotations are available as is commonly the case in practice. We provide code at https://github.com/weigertlab/tarrow.

- **Summary**: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary and subtle facial expressions that are thought to reveal feelings people are trying to hide. ME spotting detects the temporal intervals containing MEs in videos. Detecting such quick and subtle motions from long videos is difficult. Recent works leverage detailed facial motion representations, such as the optical flow, and deep learning models, leading to high computational complexity. To reduce computational complexity and achieve real-time operation, we propose RMES, a real-time ME spotting framework. We represent motion using phase computed by Riesz Pyramid, and feed this motion representation into a three-stream shallow CNN, which predicts the likelihood of each frame belonging to an ME. In comparison to optical flow, phase provides more localized motion estimates, which are essential for ME spotting, resulting in higher performance. Using phase also reduces the required computation of the ME spotting pipeline by 77.8%. Despite its relative simplicity and low computational complexity, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets: CAS(ME)2 and SAMM Long Videos.

- **Summary**: Despite the recent development of learning-based gaze estimation methods, most methods require one or more eye or face region crops as inputs and produce a gaze direction vector as output. Cropping results in a higher resolution in the eye regions and having fewer confounding factors (such as clothing and hair) is believed to benefit the final model performance. However, this eye/face patch cropping process is expensive, erroneous, and implementation-specific for different methods. In this paper, we propose a frame-to-gaze network that directly predicts both 3D gaze origin and 3D gaze direction from the raw frame out of the camera without any face or eye cropping. Our method demonstrates that direct gaze regression from the raw downscaled frame, from FHD/HD to VGA/HVGA resolution, is possible despite the challenges of having very few pixels in the eye region. The proposed method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods in Point-of-Gaze (PoG) estimation on three public gaze datasets: GazeCapture, MPIIFaceGaze, and EVE, and generalizes well to extreme camera view changes.

- **Summary**: Video-based Emotional Reaction Intensity (ERI) estimation measures the intensity of subjects' reactions to stimuli along several emotional dimensions from videos of the subject as they view the stimuli. We propose a multi-modal architecture for video-based ERI combining video and audio information. Video input is encoded spatially first, frame-by-frame, combining features encoding holistic aspects of the subjects' facial expressions and features encoding spatially localized aspects of their expressions. Input is then combined across time: from frame-to-frame using gated recurrent units (GRUs), then globally by a transformer. We handle variable video length with a regression token that accumulates information from all frames into a fixed-dimensional vector independent of video length. Audio information is handled similarly: spectral information extracted within each frame is integrated across time by a cascade of GRUs and a transformer with regression token. The video and audio regression tokens' outputs are merged by concatenation, then input to a final fully connected layer producing intensity estimates. Our architecture achieved excellent performance on the Hume-Reaction dataset in the ERI Esimation Challenge of the Fifth Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW5). The Pearson Correlation Coefficients between estimated and subject self-reported scores, averaged across all emotions, were 0.455 on the validation dataset and 0.4547 on the test dataset, well above the baselines. The transformer's self-attention mechanism enables our architecture to focus on the most critical video frames regardless of length. Ablation experiments establish the advantages of combining holistic/local features and of multi-modal integration. Code available at https://github.com/HKUST-NISL/ABAW5.

- **Summary**: Mapping and localization in endoluminal cavities from colonoscopies or gastroscopies has to overcome the challenge of significant shape and illumination changes between reobservations of the same endoluminal location. Instead of geometrical maps that strongly rely on a fixed scene geometry, topological maps are more adequate because they focus on visual place recognition, i.e. the capability to determine if two video shots are imaging the same location. We propose a topological mapping and localization system able to operate on real human colonoscopies. The map is a graph where each node codes a colon location by a set of real images of that location. The edges represent traversability between two nodes. For close-in-time images, where scene changes are minor, place recognition can be successfully managed with the recent transformers-based image-matching algorithms. However, under long-term changes -- such as different colonoscopies of the same patient -- feature-based matching fails. To address this, we propose a GeM global descriptor able to achieve high recall with significant changes in the scene. The addition of a Bayesian filter processing the map graph boosts the accuracy of the long-term place recognition, enabling relocalization in a previously built map. In the experiments, we construct a map during the withdrawal phase of a first colonoscopy. Subsequently, we prove the ability to relocalize within this map during a second colonoscopy of the same patient two weeks later. Code and models will be available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Accurate product information is critical for e-commerce stores to allow customers to browse, filter, and search for products. Product data quality is affected by missing or incorrect information resulting in poor customer experience. While machine learning can be used to correct inaccurate or missing information, achieving high performance on fashion image classification tasks requires large amounts of annotated data, but it is expensive to generate due to labeling costs. One solution can be to generate synthetic data which requires no manual labeling. However, training a model with a dataset of solely synthetic images can lead to poor generalization when performing inference on real-world data because of the domain shift. We introduce a new unsupervised domain adaptation technique that converts images from the synthetic domain into the real-world domain. Our approach combines a generative neural network and a classifier that are jointly trained to produce realistic images while preserving the synthetic label information. We found that using real-world pseudo-labels during training helps the classifier to generalize in the real-world domain, reducing the synthetic bias. We successfully train a visual pattern classification model in the fashion domain without real-world annotations. Experiments show that our method outperforms other unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms.

- **Summary**: Previous group activity recognition approaches were limited to reasoning using human relations or finding important subgroups and tended to ignore indispensable group composition and human-object interactions. This absence makes a partial interpretation of the scene and increases the interference of irrelevant actions on the results. Therefore, we propose our DynamicFormer with Dynamic composition Module (DcM) and Dynamic interaction Module (DiM) to model relations and locations of persons and discriminate the contribution of participants, respectively. Our findings on group composition and human-object interaction inspire our core idea. Group composition tells us the location of people and their relations inside the group, while interaction reflects the relation between humans and objects outside the group. We utilize spatial and temporal encoders in DcM to model our dynamic composition and build DiM to explore interaction with a novel GCN, which has a transformer inside to consider the temporal neighbors of human/object. Also, a Multi-level Dynamic Integration is employed to integrate features from different levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: In a range of recent works, object-centric architectures have been shown to be suitable for unsupervised scene decomposition in the vision domain. Inspired by these methods we present AudioSlots, a slot-centric generative model for blind source separation in the audio domain. AudioSlots is built using permutation-equivariant encoder and decoder networks. The encoder network based on the Transformer architecture learns to map a mixed audio spectrogram to an unordered set of independent source embeddings. The spatial broadcast decoder network learns to generate the source spectrograms from the source embeddings. We train the model in an end-to-end manner using a permutation invariant loss function. Our results on Libri2Mix speech separation constitute a proof of concept that this approach shows promise. We discuss the results and limitations of our approach in detail, and further outline potential ways to overcome the limitations and directions for future work.

- **Summary**: A signed distance function (SDF) parametrized by an MLP is a common ingredient of neural surface reconstruction. We build on the successful recent method NeuS to extend it by three new components. The first component is to borrow the tri-plane representation from EG3D and represent signed distance fields as a mixture of tri-planes and MLPs instead of representing it with MLPs only. Using tri-planes leads to a more expressive data structure but will also introduce noise in the reconstructed surface. The second component is to use a new type of positional encoding with learnable weights to combat noise in the reconstruction process. We divide the features in the tri-plane into multiple frequency scales and modulate them with sin and cos functions of different frequencies. The third component is to use learnable convolution operations on the tri-plane features using self-attention convolution to produce features with different frequency bands. The experiments show that PET-NeuS achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction on standard datasets. Following previous work and using the Chamfer metric as the most important way to measure surface reconstruction quality, we are able to improve upon the NeuS baseline by 57% on Nerf-synthetic (0.84 compared to 1.97) and by 15.5% on DTU (0.71 compared to 0.84). The qualitative evaluation reveals how our method can better control the interference of high-frequency noise. Code available at \url{https://github.com/yiqun-wang/PET-NeuS}.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel Region-based contrastive pretraining for Medical Image Retrieval (RegionMIR) that demonstrates the feasibility of medical image retrieval with similar anatomical regions. RegionMIR addresses two major challenges for medical image retrieval i) standardization of clinically relevant searching criteria (e.g., anatomical, pathology-based), and ii) localization of anatomical area of interests that are semantically meaningful. In this work, we propose an ROI image retrieval image network that retrieves images with similar anatomy by extracting anatomical features (via bounding boxes) and evaluate similarity between pairwise anatomy-categorized features between the query and the database of images using contrastive learning. ROI queries are encoded using a contrastive-pretrained encoder that was fine-tuned for anatomy classification, which generates an anatomical-specific latent space for region-correlated image retrieval. During retrieval, we compare the anatomically encoded query to find similar features within a feature database generated from training samples, and retrieve images with similar regions from training samples. We evaluate our approach on both anatomy classification and image retrieval tasks using the Chest ImaGenome Dataset. Our proposed strategy yields an improvement over state-of-the-art pretraining and co-training strategies, from 92.24 to 94.12 (2.03%) classification accuracy in anatomies. We qualitatively evaluate the image retrieval performance demonstrating generalizability across multiple anatomies with different morphology.

- **Summary**: In Chinese text recognition, to compensate for the insufficient local data and improve the performance of local few-shot character recognition, it is often necessary for one organization to collect a large amount of data from similar organizations. However, due to the natural presence of private information in text data, such as addresses and phone numbers, different organizations are unwilling to share private data. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to design a privacy-preserving collaborative training framework for the Chinese text recognition task. In this paper, we introduce personalized federated learning (pFL) into the Chinese text recognition task and propose the pFedCR algorithm, which significantly improves the model performance of each client (organization) without sharing private data. Specifically, pFedCR comprises two stages: multiple rounds of global model training stage and the the local personalization stage. During stage 1, an attention mechanism is incorporated into the CRNN model to adapt to various client data distributions. Leveraging inherent character data characteristics, a balanced dataset is created on the server to mitigate character imbalance. In the personalization phase, the global model is fine-tuned for one epoch to create a local model. Parameter averaging between local and global models combines personalized and global feature extraction capabilities. Finally, we fine-tune only the attention layers to enhance its focus on local personalized features. The experimental results on three real-world industrial scenario datasets show that the pFedCR algorithm can improve the performance of local personalized models by about 20\% while also improving their generalization performance on other client data domains. Compared to other state-of-the-art personalized federated learning methods, pFedCR improves performance by 6\% $\sim$ 8\%.

- **Summary**: Statistical Shape Modeling (SSM) is a valuable tool for investigating and quantifying anatomical variations within populations of anatomies. However, traditional correspondence-based SSM generation methods have a prohibitive inference process and require complete geometric proxies (e.g., high-resolution binary volumes or surface meshes) as input shapes to construct the SSM. Unordered 3D point cloud representations of shapes are more easily acquired from various medical imaging practices (e.g., thresholded images and surface scanning). Point cloud deep networks have recently achieved remarkable success in learning permutation-invariant features for different point cloud tasks (e.g., completion, semantic segmentation, classification). However, their application to learning SSM from point clouds is to-date unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that existing point cloud encoder-decoder-based completion networks can provide an untapped potential for SSM, capturing population-level statistical representations of shapes while reducing the inference burden and relaxing the input requirement. We discuss the limitations of these techniques to the SSM application and suggest future improvements. Our work paves the way for further exploration of point cloud deep learning for SSM, a promising avenue for advancing shape analysis literature and broadening SSM to diverse use cases.

- **Summary**: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for a large proportion of premature deaths in low- and middle-income countries. Early CVD detection and intervention is critical in these populations, yet many existing CVD risk scores require a physical examination or lab measurements, which can be challenging in such health systems due to limited accessibility. Here we investigated the potential to use photoplethysmography (PPG), a sensing technology available on most smartphones that can potentially enable large-scale screening at low cost, for CVD risk prediction. We developed a deep learning PPG-based CVD risk score (DLS) to predict the probability of having major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death) within ten years, given only age, sex, smoking status and PPG as predictors. We compared the DLS with the office-based refit-WHO score, which adopts the shared predictors from WHO and Globorisk scores (age, sex, smoking status, height, weight and systolic blood pressure) but refitted on the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort. In UKB cohort, DLS's C-statistic (71.1%, 95% CI 69.9-72.4) was non-inferior to office-based refit-WHO score (70.9%, 95% CI 69.7-72.2; non-inferiority margin of 2.5%, p<0.01). The calibration of the DLS was satisfactory, with a 1.8% mean absolute calibration error. Adding DLS features to the office-based score increased the C-statistic by 1.0% (95% CI 0.6-1.4). DLS predicts ten-year MACE risk comparable with the office-based refit-WHO score. It provides a proof-of-concept and suggests the potential of a PPG-based approach strategies for community-based primary prevention in resource-limited regions.

- **Summary**: The essence of self-supervised image denoising is to restore the signal from the noisy image alone. State-of-the-art solutions for this task rely on the idea of masking pixels and training a fully-convolutional neural network to impute them. This most often requires multiple forward passes, information about the noise model, and intricate regularization functions. In this paper, we propose a Swin Transformer-based Image Autoencoder (SwinIA), the first convolution-free architecture for self-supervised denoising. It can be trained end-to-end with a simple mean squared error loss without masking and does not require any prior knowledge about clean data or noise distribution. Despite its simplicity, SwinIA establishes state-of-the-art on several common benchmarks.

- **Summary**: For a robot to personalize physical assistance effectively, it must learn user preferences that can be generally reapplied to future scenarios. In this work, we investigate personalization of household cleanup with robots that can tidy up rooms by picking up objects and putting them away. A key challenge is determining the proper place to put each object, as people's preferences can vary greatly depending on personal taste or cultural background. For instance, one person may prefer storing shirts in the drawer, while another may prefer them on the shelf. We aim to build systems that can learn such preferences from just a handful of examples via prior interactions with a particular person. We show that robots can combine language-based planning and perception with the few-shot summarization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to infer generalized user preferences that are broadly applicable to future interactions. This approach enables fast adaptation and achieves 91.2% accuracy on unseen objects in our benchmark dataset. We also demonstrate our approach on a real-world mobile manipulator called TidyBot, which successfully puts away 85.0% of objects in real-world test scenarios.

- **Summary**: Programs are an increasingly popular representation for visual data, exposing compact, interpretable structure that supports manipulation. Visual programs are usually written in domain-specific languages (DSLs). Finding "good" programs, that only expose meaningful degrees of freedom, requires access to a DSL with a "good" library of functions, both of which are typically authored by domain experts. We present ShapeCoder, the first system capable of taking a dataset of shapes, represented with unstructured primitives, and jointly discovering (i) useful abstraction functions and (ii) programs that use these abstractions to explain the input shapes. The discovered abstractions capture common patterns (both structural and parametric) across the dataset, so that programs rewritten with these abstractions are more compact, and expose fewer degrees of freedom. ShapeCoder improves upon previous abstraction discovery methods, finding better abstractions, for more complex inputs, under less stringent input assumptions. This is principally made possible by two methodological advancements: (a) a shape to program recognition network that learns to solve sub-problems and (b) the use of e-graphs, augmented with a conditional rewrite scheme, to determine when abstractions with complex parametric expressions can be applied, in a tractable manner. We evaluate ShapeCoder on multiple datasets of 3D shapes, where primitive decompositions are either parsed from manual annotations or produced by an unsupervised cuboid abstraction method. In all domains, ShapeCoder discovers a library of abstractions that capture high-level relationships, remove extraneous degrees of freedom, and achieve better dataset compression compared with alternative approaches. Finally, we investigate how programs rewritten to use discovered abstractions prove useful for downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: We present an interactive visual framework named InternGPT, or iGPT for short. The framework integrates chatbots that have planning and reasoning capabilities, such as ChatGPT, with non-verbal instructions like pointing movements that enable users to directly manipulate images or videos on the screen. Pointing (including gestures, cursors, etc.) movements can provide more flexibility and precision in performing vision-centric tasks that require fine-grained control, editing, and generation of visual content. The name InternGPT stands for \textbf{inter}action, \textbf{n}onverbal, and \textbf{chat}bots. Different from existing interactive systems that rely on pure language, by incorporating pointing instructions, the proposed iGPT significantly improves the efficiency of communication between users and chatbots, as well as the accuracy of chatbots in vision-centric tasks, especially in complicated visual scenarios where the number of objects is greater than 2. Additionally, in iGPT, an auxiliary control mechanism is used to improve the control capability of LLM, and a large vision-language model termed Husky is fine-tuned for high-quality multi-modal dialogue (impressing ChatGPT-3.5-turbo with 93.89\% GPT-4 Quality). We hope this work can spark new ideas and directions for future interactive visual systems. Welcome to watch the code at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternGPT.

- **Summary**: We present ImageBind, an approach to learn a joint embedding across six different modalities - images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. We show that all combinations of paired data are not necessary to train such a joint embedding, and only image-paired data is sufficient to bind the modalities together. ImageBind can leverage recent large scale vision-language models, and extends their zero-shot capabilities to new modalities just by using their natural pairing with images. It enables novel emergent applications 'out-of-the-box' including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation. The emergent capabilities improve with the strength of the image encoder and we set a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Finally, we show strong few-shot recognition results outperforming prior work, and that ImageBind serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks.

- **Summary**: Visual Place Recognition has recently seen a surge of endeavours utilizing different ensemble approaches to improve VPR performance. Ideas like multi-process fusion or switching involve combining different VPR techniques together, utilizing different strategies. One major aspect often common to many of these strategies is voting. Voting is widely used in many ensemble methods, so it is potentially a relevant subject to explore in terms of its application and significance for improving VPR performance. This paper attempts to looks into detail and analyze a variety of voting schemes to evaluate which voting technique is optimal for an ensemble VPR set up. We take inspiration from a variety of voting schemes that exist and are widely employed in other research fields such as politics and sociology. The idea is inspired by an observation that different voting methods result in different outcomes for the same type of data and each voting scheme is utilized for specific cases in different academic fields. Some of these voting schemes include Condorcet voting, Broda Count and Plurality voting. Voting employed in any aspect requires that a fair system be established, that outputs the best and most favourable results which in our case would involve improving VPR performance. We evaluate some of these voting techniques in a standardized testing of different VPR techniques, using a variety of VPR data sets. We aim to determine whether a single optimal voting scheme exists or, much like in other fields of research, the selection of a voting technique is relative to its application and environment. We also aim to propose a ranking of these different voting methods from best to worst according to our results as this will allow for better selection of voting schemes.

- **Summary**: To enable general-purpose robots, we will require the robot to operate daily articulated objects as humans do. Current robot manipulation has heavily relied on using a parallel gripper, which restricts the robot to a limited set of objects. On the other hand, operating with a multi-finger robot hand will allow better approximation to human behavior and enable the robot to operate on diverse articulated objects. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called DexArt, which involves Dexterous manipulation with Articulated objects in a physical simulator. In our benchmark, we define multiple complex manipulation tasks, and the robot hand will need to manipulate diverse articulated objects within each task. Our main focus is to evaluate the generalizability of the learned policy on unseen articulated objects. This is very challenging given the high degrees of freedom of both hands and objects. We use Reinforcement Learning with 3D representation learning to achieve generalization. Through extensive studies, we provide new insights into how 3D representation learning affects decision making in RL with 3D point cloud inputs.

- **Summary**: The remarkable achievements of ChatGPT and GPT-4 have sparked a wave of interest and research in the field of large language models for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). These models provide us with intelligent solutions that are more similar to human thinking, enabling us to use general artificial intelligence to solve problems in various applications. However, in the field of remote sensing, the scientific literature on the implementation of AGI remains relatively scant. Existing AI-related research primarily focuses on visual understanding tasks while neglecting the semantic understanding of the objects and their relationships. This is where vision-language models excel, as they enable reasoning about images and their associated textual descriptions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying semantics. Vision-language models can go beyond recognizing the objects in an image and can infer the relationships between them, as well as generate natural language descriptions of the image. This makes them better suited for tasks that require both visual and textual understanding, such as image captioning, text-based image retrieval, and visual question answering. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the research on vision-language models in remote sensing, summarizing the latest progress, highlighting the current challenges, and identifying potential research opportunities. Specifically, we review the application of vision-language models in several mainstream remote sensing tasks, including image captioning, text-based image generation, text-based image retrieval, visual question answering, scene classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. For each task, we briefly describe the task background and review some representative works. Finally, we summarize the limitations of existing work and provide some possible directions for future development.

- **Summary**: Spleen volumetry is primarily associated with patients suffering from chronic liver disease and portal hypertension, as they often have spleens with abnormal shapes and sizes. However, manually segmenting the spleen to obtain its volume is a time-consuming process. Deep learning algorithms have proven to be effective in automating spleen segmentation, but a suitable dataset is necessary for training such algorithms. To our knowledge, the few publicly available datasets for spleen segmentation lack confounding features such as ascites and abdominal varices. To address this issue, the Duke Spleen Data Set (DSDS) has been developed, which includes 109 CT and MRI volumes from patients with chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. The dataset includes a diverse range of image types, vendors, planes, and contrasts, as well as varying spleen shapes and sizes due to underlying disease states. The DSDS aims to facilitate the creation of robust spleen segmentation models that can take into account these variations and confounding factors.

- **Summary**: Instant on-device Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are in growing demand for unleashing the promise of immersive AR/VR experiences, but are still limited by their prohibitive training time. Our profiling analysis reveals a memory-bound inefficiency in NeRF training. To tackle this inefficiency, near-memory processing (NMP) promises to be an effective solution, but also faces challenges due to the unique workloads of NeRFs, including the random hash table lookup, random point processing sequence, and heterogeneous bottleneck steps. Therefore, we propose the first NMP framework, Instant-NeRF, dedicated to enabling instant on-device NeRF training. Experiments on eight datasets consistently validate the effectiveness of Instant-NeRF.

- **Summary**: Modern face recognition (FR) models excel in constrained scenarios, but often suffer from decreased performance when deployed in unconstrained (real-world) environments due to uncertainties surrounding the quality of the captured facial data. Face image quality assessment (FIQA) techniques aim to mitigate these performance degradations by providing FR models with sample-quality predictions that can be used to reject low-quality samples and reduce false match errors. However, despite steady improvements, ensuring reliable quality estimates across facial images with diverse characteristics remains challenging. In this paper, we present a powerful new FIQA approach, named DifFIQA, which relies on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and ensures highly competitive results. The main idea behind the approach is to utilize the forward and backward processes of DDPMs to perturb facial images and quantify the impact of these perturbations on the corresponding image embeddings for quality prediction. Because the diffusion-based perturbations are computationally expensive, we also distill the knowledge encoded in DifFIQA into a regression-based quality predictor, called DifFIQA(R), that balances performance and execution time. We evaluate both models in comprehensive experiments on 7 datasets, with 4 target FR models and against 10 state-of-the-art FIQA techniques with highly encouraging results. The source code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Images incorporate a wealth of information from a robot's surroundings. With the widespread availability of compact cameras, visual information has become increasingly popular for addressing the localisation problem, which is then termed as Visual Place Recognition (VPR). While many applications use high-resolution cameras and high-end systems to achieve optimal place-matching performance, low-end commercial systems face limitations due to resource constraints and relatively low-resolution and low-quality cameras. In this paper, we analyse the effects of image resolution on the accuracy and robustness of well-established handcrafted VPR pipelines. Handcrafted designs have low computational demands and can adapt to flexible image resolutions, making them a suitable approach to scale to any image source and to operate under resource limitations. This paper aims to help academic researchers and companies in the hardware and software industry co-design VPR solutions and expand the use of VPR algorithms in commercial products.

- **Summary**: We present a first of its kind dataset of overhead imagery for development and evaluation of forensic tools. Our dataset consists of real, fully synthetic and partially manipulated overhead imagery generated from a custom diffusion model trained on two sets of different zoom levels and on two sources of pristine data. We developed our model to support controllable generation of multiple manipulation categories including fully synthetic imagery conditioned on real and generated base maps, and location. We also support partial in-painted imagery with same conditioning options and with several types of manipulated content. The data consist of raw images and ground truth annotations describing the manipulation parameters. We also report benchmark performance on several tasks supported by our dataset including detection of fully and partially manipulated imagery, manipulation localization and classification.



### Regular Splitting Graph Network for 3D Human Pose Estimation

- **Summary**: In human pose estimation methods based on graph convolutional architectures, the human skeleton is usually modeled as an undirected graph whose nodes are body joints and edges are connections between neighboring joints. However, most of these methods tend to focus on learning relationships between body joints of the skeleton using first-order neighbors, ignoring higher-order neighbors and hence limiting their ability to exploit relationships between distant joints. In this paper, we introduce a higher-order regular splitting graph network (RS-Net) for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation using matrix splitting in conjunction with weight and adjacency modulation. The core idea is to capture long-range dependencies between body joints using multi-hop neighborhoods and also to learn different modulation vectors for different body joints as well as a modulation matrix added to the adjacency matrix associated to the skeleton. This learnable modulation matrix helps adjust the graph structure by adding extra graph edges in an effort to learn additional connections between body joints. Instead of using a shared weight matrix for all neighboring body joints, the proposed RS-Net model applies weight unsharing before aggregating the feature vectors associated to the joints in order to capture the different relations between them. Experiments and ablations studies performed on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods for 3D human pose estimation.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a critical step in automated image interpretation and analysis where pixels are classified into one or more predefined semantically meaningful classes. Deep learning approaches for semantic segmentation rely on harnessing the power of annotated images to learn features indicative of these semantic classes. Nonetheless, they often fail to generalize when there is a significant domain (i.e., distributional) shift between the training (i.e., source) data and the dataset(s) encountered when deployed (i.e., target), necessitating manual annotations for the target data to achieve acceptable performance. This is especially important in medical imaging because different image modalities have significant intra- and inter-site variations due to protocol and vendor variability. Current techniques are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning and target dataset size. This paper presents an unsupervised domain adaptation approach for semantic segmentation that alleviates the need for annotating target data. Using kernel density estimation, we match the target data distribution to the source in the feature space, particularly when the number of target samples is limited (3% of the target dataset size). We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach on 2 datasets, multisite prostate MRI and histopathology images.

- **Summary**: Statistical shape modeling (SSM) enables population-based quantitative analysis of anatomical shapes, informing clinical diagnosis. Deep learning approaches predict correspondence-based SSM directly from unsegmented 3D images but require calibrated uncertainty quantification, motivating Bayesian formulations. Variational information bottleneck DeepSSM (VIB-DeepSSM) is an effective, principled framework for predicting probabilistic shapes of anatomy from images with aleatoric uncertainty quantification. However, VIB is only half-Bayesian and lacks epistemic uncertainty inference. We derive a fully Bayesian VIB formulation and demonstrate the efficacy of two scalable implementation approaches: concrete dropout and batch ensemble. Additionally, we introduce a novel combination of the two that further enhances uncertainty calibration via multimodal marginalization. Experiments on synthetic shapes and left atrium data demonstrate that the fully Bayesian VIB network predicts SSM from images with improved uncertainty reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

- **Summary**: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with only image-level supervision has garnered increasing attention due to its low annotation cost compared to pixel-level annotation. Most existing methods rely on Class Activation Maps (CAM) to generate pixel-level pseudo labels for supervised training. However, it is well known that CAM often suffers from partial activation -- activating the most discriminative part instead of the entire object area, and false activation -- unnecessarily activating the background around the object. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach to address these limitations by harnessing the recently released Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate higher-quality pseudo labels with CAM. SAM is a segmentation foundation model that demonstrates strong zero-shot ability in partitioning images into segments but lacks semantic labels for these regions. To circumvent this, we employ pseudo labels for a specific class as the signal to select the most relevant masks and label them to generate the refined pseudo labels for this class. The segments generated by SAM are highly precise, leading to substantial improvements in partial and false activation. Moreover, existing post-processing modules for producing pseudo labels, such as AffinityNet, are often computationally heavy, with a significantly long training time. Surprisingly, we discovered that using the initial CAM with SAM can achieve on-par performance as the post-processed pseudo label generated from these modules with much less computational cost. Our approach is highly versatile and capable of seamless integration into existing WSSS models without modification to base networks or pipelines. Despite its simplicity, our approach improves the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of pseudo labels from five state-of-the-art WSSS methods by 6.2\% on average on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.

- **Summary**: Distribution shifts are common in real-world datasets and can affect the performance and reliability of deep learning models. In this paper, we study two types of distribution shifts: diversity shifts, which occur when test samples exhibit patterns unseen during training, and correlation shifts, which occur when test data present a different correlation between seen invariant and spurious features. We propose an integrated protocol to analyze both types of shifts using datasets where they co-exist in a controllable manner. Finally, we apply our approach to a real-world classification problem of skin cancer analysis, using out-of-distribution datasets and specialized bias annotations. Our protocol reveals three findings: 1) Models learn and propagate correlation shifts even with low-bias training; this poses a risk of accumulating and combining unaccountable weak biases; 2) Models learn robust features in high- and low-bias scenarios but use spurious ones if test samples have them; this suggests that spurious correlations do not impair the learning of robust features; 3) Diversity shift can reduce the reliance on spurious correlations; this is counter intuitive since we expect biased models to depend more on biases when invariant features are missing. Our work has implications for distribution shift research and practice, providing new insights into how models learn and rely on spurious correlations under different types of shifts.

- **Summary**: 2D texture maps and 3D voxel arrays are widely used to add rich detail to the surfaces and volumes of rendered scenes, and filtered texture lookups are integral to producing high-quality imagery. We show that filtering textures after evaluating lighting, rather than before BSDF evaluation as is current practice, gives a more accurate solution to the rendering equation. These benefits are not merely theoretical, but are apparent in common cases. We further show that stochastically sampling texture filters is crucial for enabling this approach, which has not been possible previously except in limited cases. Stochastic texture filtering offers additional benefits, including efficient implementation of high-quality texture filters and efficient filtering of textures stored in compressed and sparse data structures, including neural representations. We demonstrate applications in both real-time and offline rendering and show that the additional stochastic error is minimal. Furthermore, this error is handled well by either spatiotemporal denoising or moderate pixel sampling rates.

- **Summary**: Change detection is an essential and widely utilized task in remote sensing that aims to detect and analyze changes occurring in the same geographical area over time, which has broad applications in urban development, agricultural surveys, and land cover monitoring. Detecting changes in remote sensing images is a complex challenge due to various factors, including variations in image quality, noise, registration errors, illumination changes, complex landscapes, and spatial heterogeneity. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature extraction and addressing these challenges. Its versatility has resulted in its widespread adoption for numerous image-processing tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of significant advancements in change detection for remote sensing images over the past decade. We first introduce some preliminary knowledge for the change detection task, such as problem definition, datasets, evaluation metrics, and transformer basics, as well as provide a detailed taxonomy of existing algorithms from three different perspectives: algorithm granularity, supervision modes, and learning frameworks in the methodology section. This survey enables readers to gain systematic knowledge of change detection tasks from various angles. We then summarize the state-of-the-art performance on several dominant change detection datasets, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of existing algorithms. Based on our survey, some future research directions for change detection in remote sensing are well identified. This survey paper will shed some light on the community and inspire further research efforts in the change detection task.

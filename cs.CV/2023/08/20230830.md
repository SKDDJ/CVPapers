- **Summary**: We present 'CongNaMul', a comprehensive dataset designed for various tasks in soybean sprouts image analysis. The CongNaMul dataset is curated to facilitate tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, decomposition, and measurement of length and weight. The classification task provides four classes to determine the quality of soybean sprouts: normal, broken, spotted, and broken and spotted, for the development of AI-aided automatic quality inspection technology. For semantic segmentation, images with varying complexity, from single sprout images to images with multiple sprouts, along with human-labelled mask images, are included. The label has 4 different classes: background, head, body, tail. The dataset also provides images and masks for the image decomposition task, including two separate sprout images and their combined form. Lastly, 5 physical features of sprouts (head length, body length, body thickness, tail length, weight) are provided for image-based measurement tasks. This dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for a wide range of research and applications in the advanced analysis of images of soybean sprouts. Also, we hope that this dataset can assist researchers studying classification, semantic segmentation, decomposition, and physical feature measurement in other industrial fields, in evaluating their models. The dataset is available at the authors' repository. (https://bhban.kr/data)

- **Summary**: Denoising probabilistic diffusion models have shown breakthrough performance that can generate more photo-realistic images or human-level illustrations than the prior models such as GANs. This high image-generation capability has stimulated the creation of many downstream applications in various areas. However, we find that this technology is indeed a double-edged sword: We identify a new type of attack, called the Natural Denoising Diffusion (NDD) attack based on the finding that state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) models still hold their prediction even if we intentionally remove their robust features, which are essential to the human visual system (HVS), by text prompts. The NDD attack can generate low-cost, model-agnostic, and transferrable adversarial attacks by exploiting the natural attack capability in diffusion models. Motivated by the finding, we construct a large-scale dataset, Natural Denoising Diffusion Attack (NDDA) dataset, to systematically evaluate the risk of the natural attack capability of diffusion models with state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. We evaluate the natural attack capability by answering 6 research questions. Through a user study to confirm the validity of the NDD attack, we find that the NDD attack can achieve an 88% detection rate while being stealthy to 93% of human subjects. We also find that the non-robust features embedded by diffusion models contribute to the natural attack capability. To confirm the model-agnostic and transferrable attack capability, we perform the NDD attack against an AD vehicle and find that 73% of the physically printed attacks can be detected as a stop sign. We hope that our study and dataset can help our community to be aware of the risk of diffusion models and facilitate further research toward robust DNN models.

- **Summary**: Oral diseases such as periodontal (gum) diseases and dental caries (cavities) affect billions of people across the world today. However, previous state-of-the-art models have relied on X-ray images to detect oral diseases, making them inaccessible to remote monitoring, developing countries, and telemedicine. To combat this overuse of X-ray imagery, we propose a lightweight machine learning model capable of detecting calculus (also known as hardened plaque or tartar) in RGB images while running efficiently on low-end devices. The model, a modified MobileNetV3-Small neural network transfer learned from ImageNet, achieved an accuracy of 72.73% (which is comparable to state-of-the-art solutions) while still being able to run on mobile devices due to its reduced memory requirements and processing times. A ResNet34-based model was also constructed and achieved an accuracy of 81.82%. Both of these models were tested on a mobile app, demonstrating their potential to limit the number of serious oral disease cases as their predictions can help patients schedule appointments earlier without the need to go to the clinic.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have utilized deep learning (DL) techniques to automatically extract features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which shows great promise for enhancing the performance of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR). However, our research reveals a previously overlooked issue: SAR images to be recognized include not only the foreground (i.e., the target), but also a certain size of the background area. When a DL-model is trained exclusively on foreground data, its recognition performance is significantly superior to a model trained on original data that includes both foreground and background. This suggests that the presence of background impedes the ability of the DL-model to learn additional semantic information about the target. To address this issue, we construct a structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates the background as a confounder. Based on the constructed SCM, we propose a causal intervention based regularization method to eliminate the negative impact of background on feature semantic learning and achieve background debiased SAR-ATR. The proposed causal interventional regularizer can be integrated into any existing DL-based SAR-ATR models to mitigate the impact of background interference on the feature extraction and recognition accuracy. Experimental results on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset indicate that the proposed method can enhance the efficiency of existing DL-based methods in a plug-and-play manner.

- **Summary**: Neural rendering has garnered substantial attention owing to its capacity for creating realistic 3D scenes. However, its applicability to extensive scenes remains challenging, with limitations in effectiveness. In this work, we propose the Drone-NeRF framework to enhance the efficient reconstruction of unbounded large-scale scenes suited for drone oblique photography using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Our approach involves dividing the scene into uniform sub-blocks based on camera position and depth visibility. Sub-scenes are trained in parallel using NeRF, then merged for a complete scene. We refine the model by optimizing camera poses and guiding NeRF with a uniform sampler. Integrating chosen samples enhances accuracy. A hash-coded fusion MLP accelerates density representation, yielding RGB and Depth outputs. Our framework accounts for sub-scene constraints, reduces parallel-training noise, handles shadow occlusion, and merges sub-regions for a polished rendering result. This Drone-NeRF framework demonstrates promising capabilities in addressing challenges related to scene complexity, rendering efficiency, and accuracy in drone-obtained imagery.

- **Summary**: A person's facial hairstyle, such as presence and size of beard, can significantly impact face recognition accuracy. There are publicly-available deep networks that achieve reasonable accuracy at binary attribute classification, such as beard / no beard, but few if any that segment the facial hair region. To investigate the effect of facial hair in a rigorous manner, we first created a set of fine-grained facial hair annotations to train a segmentation model and evaluate its accuracy across African-American and Caucasian face images. We then use our facial hair segmentations to categorize image pairs according to the degree of difference or similarity in the facial hairstyle. We find that the False Match Rate (FMR) for image pairs with different categories of facial hairstyle varies by a factor of over 10 for African-American males and over 25 for Caucasian males. To reduce the bias across image pairs with different facial hairstyles, we propose a scheme for adaptive thresholding based on facial hairstyle similarity. Evaluation on a subject-disjoint set of images shows that adaptive similarity thresholding based on facial hairstyles of the image pair reduces the ratio between the highest and lowest FMR across facial hairstyle categories for African-American from 10.7 to 1.8 and for Caucasians from 25.9 to 1.3. Facial hair annotations and facial hair segmentation model will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: The scope of our study is all UNOS data of the USA organ donors since 2008. The data is not analyzable in a large scale in the past because it was captured in PDF documents known as "Attachments", whereby every donor is represented by dozens of PDF documents in heterogenous formats. To make the data analyzable, one needs to convert the content inside these PDFs to an analyzable data format, such as a standard SQL database. In this paper we will focus on 2022 UNOS data comprised of $\approx 400,000$ PDF documents spanning millions of pages. The totality of UNOS data covers 15 years (2008--20022) and our results will be quickly extended to the entire data. Our method captures a portion of the data in DCD flowsheets, kidney perfusion data, and data captured during patient hospital stay (e.g. vital signs, ventilator settings, etc.). The current paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the content of the UNOS data. The overview of the types of data and challenges they present is a subject of another paper. Here we focus on demonstrating that the goal of building a comprehensive, analyzable database from UNOS documents is an attainable task, and we provide an overview of our methodology. The project resulted in datasets by far larger than previously available even in this preliminary phase.



### Neural Video Compression with Temporal Layer-Adaptive Hierarchical B-frame Coding

- **Summary**: Neural video compression (NVC) is a rapidly evolving video coding research area, with some models achieving superior coding efficiency compared to the latest video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC). In conventional video coding standards, the hierarchical B-frame coding, which utilizes a bidirectional prediction structure for higher compression, had been well-studied and exploited. In NVC, however, limited research has investigated the hierarchical B scheme. In this paper, we propose an NVC model exploiting hierarchical B-frame coding with temporal layer-adaptive optimization. We first extend an existing unidirectional NVC model to a bidirectional model, which achieves -21.13% BD-rate gain over the unidirectional baseline model. However, this model faces challenges when applied to sequences with complex or large motions, leading to performance degradation. To address this, we introduce temporal layer-adaptive optimization, incorporating methods such as temporal layer-adaptive quality scaling (TAQS) and temporal layer-adaptive latent scaling (TALS). The final model with the proposed methods achieves an impressive BD-rate gain of -39.86% against the baseline. It also resolves the challenges in sequences with large or complex motions with up to -49.13% more BD-rate gains than the simple bidirectional extension. This improvement is attributed to the allocation of more bits to lower temporal layers, thereby enhancing overall reconstruction quality with smaller bits. Since our method has little dependency on a specific NVC model architecture, it can serve as a general tool for extending unidirectional NVC models to the ones with hierarchical B-frame coding.

- **Summary**: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a crucial computer vision task that aims to predict the bounding boxes and identities of objects simultaneously. While state-of-the-art methods have made remarkable progress by jointly optimizing the multi-task problems of detection and Re-ID feature learning, yet, few approaches explore to tackle the occlusion issue, which is a long-standing challenge in the MOT field. Generally, occluded objects may hinder the detector from estimating the bounding boxes, resulting in fragmented trajectories. And the learned occluded Re-ID embeddings are less distinct since they contain interferer. To this end, we propose an occlusion-aware detection and Re-ID calibrated network for multi-object tracking, termed as ORCTrack. Specifically, we propose an Occlusion-Aware Attention (OAA) module in the detector that highlights the object features while suppressing the occluded background regions. OAA can serve as a modulator that enhances the detector for some potentially occluded objects. Furthermore, we design a Re-ID embedding matching block based on the optimal transport problem, which focuses on enhancing and calibrating the Re-ID representations through different adjacent frames complementarily. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on two challenging VisDrone2021-MOT and KITTI benchmarks. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach, which can achieve new state-of-the-art performance and enjoy high run-time efficiency.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-driven superresolution (SR) outperforms traditional techniques but also faces the challenge of high complexity and memory bandwidth. This challenge leads many accelerators to opt for simpler and shallow models like FSRCNN, compromising performance for real-time needs, especially for resource-limited edge devices. This paper proposes an energy-efficient SR accelerator, ACNPU, to tackle this challenge. The ACNPU enhances image quality by 0.34dB with a 27-layer model, but needs 36\% less complexity than FSRCNN, while maintaining a similar model size, with the \textit{decoupled asymmetric convolution and split-bypass structure}. The hardware-friendly 17K-parameter model enables \textit{holistic model fusion} instead of localized layer fusion to remove external DRAM access of intermediate feature maps. The on-chip memory bandwidth is further reduced with the \textit{input stationary flow} and \textit{parallel-layer execution} to reduce power consumption. Hardware is regular and easy to control to support different layers by \textit{processing elements (PEs) clusters with reconfigurable input and uniform data flow}. The implementation in the 40 nm CMOS process consumes 2333 K gate counts and 198KB SRAMs. The ACNPU achieves 31.7 FPS and 124.4 FPS for x2 and x4 scales Full-HD generation, respectively, which attains 4.75 TOPS/W energy efficiency.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new dataset and general tracker enhancement method for Underwater Visual Object Tracking (UVOT). Despite its significance, underwater tracking has remained unexplored due to data inaccessibility. It poses distinct challenges; the underwater environment exhibits non-uniform lighting conditions, low visibility, lack of sharpness, low contrast, camouflage, and reflections from suspended particles. Performance of traditional tracking methods designed primarily for terrestrial or open-air scenarios drops in such conditions. We address the problem by proposing a novel underwater image enhancement algorithm designed specifically to boost tracking quality. The method has resulted in a significant performance improvement, of up to 5.0% AUC, of state-of-the-art (SOTA) visual trackers. To develop robust and accurate UVOT methods, large-scale datasets are required. To this end, we introduce a large-scale UVOT benchmark dataset consisting of 400 video segments and 275,000 manually annotated frames enabling underwater training and evaluation of deep trackers. The videos are labelled with several underwater-specific tracking attributes including watercolor variation, target distractors, camouflage, target relative size, and low visibility conditions. The UVOT400 dataset, tracking results, and the code are publicly available on: https://github.com/BasitAlawode/UWVOT400.

- **Summary**: In light of the expanding population, an automated framework of disease detection can assist doctors in the diagnosis of ocular diseases, yields accurate, stable, rapid outcomes, and improves the success rate of early detection. The work initially intended the enhancing the quality of fundus images by employing an adaptive contrast enhancement algorithm (CLAHE) and Gamma correction. In the preprocessing techniques, CLAHE elevates the local contrast of the fundus image and gamma correction increases the intensity of relevant features. This study operates on a AMDNet23 system of deep learning that combined the neural networks made up of convolutions (CNN) and short-term and long-term memory (LSTM) to automatically detect aged macular degeneration (AMD) disease from fundus ophthalmology. In this mechanism, CNN is utilized for extracting features and LSTM is utilized to detect the extracted features. The dataset of this research is collected from multiple sources and afterward applied quality assessment techniques, 2000 experimental fundus images encompass four distinct classes equitably. The proposed hybrid deep AMDNet23 model demonstrates to detection of AMD ocular disease and the experimental result achieved an accuracy 96.50%, specificity 99.32%, sensitivity 96.5%, and F1-score 96.49.0%. The system achieves state-of-the-art findings on fundus imagery datasets to diagnose AMD ocular disease and findings effectively potential of our method.

- **Summary**: Continual Learning aims to learn a single model on a sequence of tasks without having access to data from previous tasks. The biggest challenge in the domain still remains catastrophic forgetting: a loss in performance on seen classes of earlier tasks. Some existing methods rely on an expensive replay buffer to store a chunk of data from previous tasks. This, while promising, becomes expensive when the number of tasks becomes large or data can not be stored for privacy reasons. As an alternative, prompt-based methods have been proposed that store the task information in a learnable prompt pool. This prompt pool instructs a frozen image encoder on how to solve each task. While the model faces a disjoint set of classes in each task in this setting, we argue that these classes can be encoded to the same embedding space of a pre-trained language encoder. In this work, we propose Language Guidance for Prompt-based Continual Learning (LGCL) as a plug-in for prompt-based methods. LGCL is model agnostic and introduces language guidance at the task level in the prompt pool and at the class level on the output feature of the vision encoder. We show with extensive experimentation that LGCL consistently improves the performance of prompt-based continual learning methods to set a new state-of-the art. LGCL achieves these performance improvements without needing any additional learnable parameters.

- **Summary**: The Red Palm Weevil (RPW), also known as the palm weevil, is considered among the world's most damaging insect pests of palms. Current detection techniques include the detection of symptoms of RPW using visual or sound inspection and chemical detection of volatile signatures generated by infested palm trees. However, efficient detection of RPW diseases at an early stage is considered one of the most challenging issues for cultivating date palms. In this paper, an efficient approach to the early detection of RPW is proposed. The proposed approach is based on RPW sound activities being recorded and analyzed. The first step involves the conversion of sound data into images based on a selected set of features. The second step involves the combination of images from the same sound file but computed by different features into a single image. The third step involves the application of different Deep Learning (DL) techniques to classify resulting images into two classes: infested and not infested. Experimental results show good performances of the proposed approach for RPW detection using different DL techniques, namely MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, ResNet152V2, VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, DenseNet201, Xception, and InceptionV3. The proposed approach outperformed existing techniques for public datasets.

- **Summary**: The most popular type of devices used to track a user's posture in a virtual reality experience consists of a head-mounted display and two controllers held in both hands. However, due to the limited number of tracking sensors (three in total), faithfully recovering the user in full-body is challenging, limiting the potential for interactions among simulated user avatars within the virtual world. Therefore, recent studies have attempted to reconstruct full-body poses using neural networks that utilize previously learned human poses or accept a series of past poses over a short period. In this paper, we propose a method that utilizes information from a neural motion prior to improve the accuracy of reconstructed user's motions. Our approach aims to reconstruct user's full-body poses by predicting the latent representation of the user's overall motion from limited input signals and integrating this information with tracking sensor inputs. This is based on the premise that the ultimate goal of pose reconstruction is to reconstruct the motion, which is a series of poses. Our results show that this integration enables more accurate reconstruction of the user's full-body motion, particularly enhancing the robustness of lower body motion reconstruction from impoverished signals.

- **Summary**: Due to the mutual occlusion, severe scale variation, and complex spatial distribution, the current multi-person mesh recovery methods cannot produce accurate absolute body poses and shapes in large-scale crowded scenes. To address the obstacles, we fully exploit crowd features for reconstructing groups of people from a monocular image. A novel hypergraph relational reasoning network is proposed to formulate the complex and high-order relation correlations among individuals and groups in the crowd. We first extract compact human features and location information from the original high-resolution image. By conducting the relational reasoning on the extracted individual features, the underlying crowd collectiveness and interaction relationship can provide additional group information for the reconstruction. Finally, the updated individual features and the localization information are used to regress human meshes in camera coordinates. To facilitate the network training, we further build pseudo ground-truth on two crowd datasets, which may also promote future research on pose estimation and human behavior understanding in crowded scenes. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms other baseline methods both in crowded and common scenarios. The code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/boycehbz/GroupRec.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we for the first time explore helpful multi-modal contextual knowledge to understand novel categories for open-vocabulary object detection (OVD). The multi-modal contextual knowledge stands for the joint relationship across regions and words. However, it is challenging to incorporate such multi-modal contextual knowledge into OVD. The reason is that previous detection frameworks fail to jointly model multi-modal contextual knowledge, as object detectors only support vision inputs and no caption description is provided at test time. To this end, we propose a multi-modal contextual knowledge distillation framework, MMC-Det, to transfer the learned contextual knowledge from a teacher fusion transformer with diverse multi-modal masked language modeling (D-MLM) to a student detector. The diverse multi-modal masked language modeling is realized by an object divergence constraint upon traditional multi-modal masked language modeling (MLM), in order to extract fine-grained region-level visual contexts, which are vital to object detection. Extensive experiments performed upon various detection datasets show the effectiveness of our multi-modal context learning strategy, where our approach well outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion models have shown outstanding performance in image editing. Existing works tend to use either image-guided methods, which provide a visual reference but lack control over semantic coherence, or text-guided methods, which ensure faithfulness to text guidance but lack visual quality. To address the problem, we propose the Zero-shot Inversion Process (ZIP), a framework that injects a fusion of generated visual reference and text guidance into the semantic latent space of a \textit{frozen} pre-trained diffusion model. Only using a tiny neural network, the proposed ZIP produces diverse content and attributes under the intuitive control of the text prompt. Moreover, ZIP shows remarkable robustness for both in-domain and out-of-domain attribute manipulation on real images. We perform detailed experiments on various benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, ZIP produces images of equivalent quality while providing a realistic editing effect.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in semantic segmentation, an inevitable challenge is the performance degradation caused by the domain shift in real application. Current dominant approach to solve this problem is unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). However, the absence of labeled target data in UDA is overly restrictive and limits performance. To overcome this limitation, a more practical scenario called semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) has been proposed. Existing SSDA methods are derived from the UDA paradigm and primarily focus on leveraging the unlabeled target data and source data. In this paper, we highlight the significance of exploiting the intra-domain information between the limited labeled target data and unlabeled target data, as it greatly benefits domain adaptation. Instead of solely using the scarce labeled data for supervision, we propose a novel SSDA framework that incorporates both inter-domain mixing and intra-domain mixing, where inter-domain mixing mitigates the source-target domain gap and intra-domain mixing enriches the available target domain information. By simultaneously learning from inter-domain mixing and intra-domain mixing, the network can capture more domain-invariant features and promote its performance on the target domain. We also explore different domain mixing operations to better exploit the target domain information. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the GTA5toCityscapes and SYNTHIA2Cityscapes benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Underwater image processing and analysis have been a hotspot of study in recent years, as more emphasis has been focused to underwater monitoring and usage of marine resources. Compared with the open environment, underwater image encountered with more complicated conditions such as light abortion, scattering, turbulence, nonuniform illumination and color diffusion. Although considerable advances and enhancement techniques achieved in resolving these issues, they treat low-frequency information equally across the entire channel, which results in limiting the network's representativeness. We propose a deep learning and feature-attention-based end-to-end network (FA-Net) to solve this problem. In particular, we propose a Residual Feature Attention Block (RFAB), containing the channel attention, pixel attention, and residual learning mechanism with long and short skip connections. RFAB allows the network to focus on learning high-frequency information while skipping low-frequency information on multi-hop connections. The channel and pixel attention mechanism considers each channel's different features and the uneven distribution of haze over different pixels in the image. The experimental results shows that the FA-Net propose by us provides higher accuracy, quantitatively and qualitatively and superiority to previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Multi-centre colonoscopy images from various medical centres exhibit distinct complicating factors and overlays that impact the image content, contingent on the specific acquisition centre. Existing Deep Segmentation networks struggle to achieve adequate generalizability in such data sets, and the currently available data augmentation methods do not effectively address these sources of data variability. As a solution, we introduce an innovative data augmentation approach centred on interpretability saliency maps, aimed at enhancing the generalizability of Deep Learning models within the realm of multi-centre colonoscopy image segmentation. The proposed augmentation technique demonstrates increased robustness across different segmentation models and domains. Thorough testing on a publicly available multi-centre dataset for polyp detection demonstrates the effectiveness and versatility of our approach, which is observed both in quantitative and qualitative results.

To that end, we formalize our terms and give a geometric analysis of how embeddings in CLIP's latent space would need to be configured in order for the system to be logically coherent. Our main conclusion is that, as usually configured, CLIP cannot perform such reasoning.

- **Summary**: In the field of parallel imaging (PI), alongside image-domain regularization methods, substantial research has been dedicated to exploring $k$-space interpolation. However, the interpretability of these methods remains an unresolved issue. Furthermore, these approaches currently face acceleration limitations that are comparable to those experienced by image-domain methods. In order to enhance interpretability and overcome the acceleration limitations, this paper introduces an interpretable framework that unifies both $k$-space interpolation techniques and image-domain methods, grounded in the physical principles of heat diffusion equations. Building upon this foundational framework, a novel $k$-space interpolation method is proposed. Specifically, we model the process of high-frequency information attenuation in $k$-space as a heat diffusion equation, while the effort to reconstruct high-frequency information from low-frequency regions can be conceptualized as a reverse heat equation. However, solving the reverse heat equation poses a challenging inverse problem. To tackle this challenge, we modify the heat equation to align with the principles of magnetic resonance PI physics and employ the score-based generative method to precisely execute the modified reverse heat diffusion. Finally, experimental validation conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional $k$-space interpolation methods, deep learning-based $k$-space interpolation methods, and conventional diffusion models in terms of reconstruction accuracy, particularly in high-frequency regions.

- **Summary**: Small liver lesions common to colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) are challenging for convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation models, especially when we have a wide range of slice thicknesses in the computed tomography (CT) scans. Slice thickness of CT images may vary by clinical indication. For example, thinner slices are used for presurgical planning when fine anatomic details of small vessels are required. While keeping the effective radiation dose in patients as low as possible, various slice thicknesses are employed in CRLMs due to their limitations. However, differences in slice thickness across CTs lead to significant performance degradation in CT segmentation models based on CNNs. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised attention-based interpolation model to generate intermediate slices from consecutive triplet slices in CT scans. We integrate segmentation loss during the interpolation model's training to leverage segmentation labels in existing slices to generate middle ones. Unlike common interpolation techniques in CT volumes, our model highlights the regions of interest (liver and lesions) inside the abdominal CT scans in the interpolated slice. Moreover, our model's outputs are consistent with the original input slices while increasing the segmentation performance in two cutting-edge 3D segmentation pipelines. We tested the proposed model on the CRLM dataset to upsample subjects with thick slices and create isotropic volume for our segmentation model. The produced isotropic dataset increases the Dice score in the segmentation of lesions and outperforms other interpolation approaches in terms of interpolation metrics.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have shown promising performance on zero-shot visual recognition tasks by learning visual representations under natural language supervision. Recent studies attempt the use of CLIP to tackle zero-shot anomaly detection by matching images with normal and abnormal state prompts. However, since CLIP focuses on building correspondence between paired text prompts and global image-level representations, the lack of patch-level vision to text alignment limits its capability on precise visual anomaly localization. In this work, we introduce a training-free adaptation (TFA) framework of CLIP for zero-shot anomaly localization. In the visual encoder, we innovate a training-free value-wise attention mechanism to extract intrinsic local tokens of CLIP for patch-level local description. From the perspective of text supervision, we particularly design a unified domain-aware contrastive state prompting template. On top of the proposed TFA, we further introduce a test-time adaptation (TTA) mechanism to refine anomaly localization results, where a layer of trainable parameters in the adapter is optimized using TFA's pseudo-labels and synthetic noise-corrupted tokens. With both TFA and TTA adaptation, we significantly exploit the potential of CLIP for zero-shot anomaly localization and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on various datasets.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as potential tools to tackle the challenge of sparse-view CT reconstruction, displaying superior performance compared to conventional methods. Nevertheless, these prevailing diffusion models predominantly focus on the sinogram or image domains, which can lead to instability during model training, potentially culminating in convergence towards local minimal solutions. The wavelet trans-form serves to disentangle image contents and features into distinct frequency-component bands at varying scales, adeptly capturing diverse directional structures. Employing the Wavelet transform as a guiding sparsity prior significantly enhances the robustness of diffusion models. In this study, we present an innovative approach named the Stage-by-stage Wavelet Optimization Refinement Diffusion (SWORD) model for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we establish a unified mathematical model integrating low-frequency and high-frequency generative models, achieving the solution with optimization procedure. Furthermore, we perform the low-frequency and high-frequency generative models on wavelet's decomposed components rather than sinogram or image domains, ensuring the stability of model training. Our method rooted in established optimization theory, comprising three distinct stages, including low-frequency generation, high-frequency refinement and domain transform. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Dynamic computation has emerged as a promising avenue to enhance the inference efficiency of deep networks. It allows selective activation of computational units, leading to a reduction in unnecessary computations for each input sample. However, the actual efficiency of these dynamic models can deviate from theoretical predictions. This mismatch arises from: 1) the lack of a unified approach due to fragmented research; 2) the focus on algorithm design over critical scheduling strategies, especially in CUDA-enabled GPU contexts; and 3) challenges in measuring practical latency, given that most libraries cater to static operations. Addressing these issues, we unveil the Latency-Aware Unified Dynamic Networks (LAUDNet), a framework that integrates three primary dynamic paradigms-spatially adaptive computation, dynamic layer skipping, and dynamic channel skipping. To bridge the theoretical and practical efficiency gap, LAUDNet merges algorithmic design with scheduling optimization, guided by a latency predictor that accurately gauges dynamic operator latency. We've tested LAUDNet across multiple vision tasks, demonstrating its capacity to notably reduce the latency of models like ResNet-101 by over 50% on platforms such as V100, RTX3090, and TX2 GPUs. Notably, LAUDNet stands out in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Code is available at: https://www.github.com/LeapLabTHU/LAUDNet.

- **Summary**: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have made significant strides, capitalizing on computer vision to enhance perception and decision-making capabilities. Nonetheless, the adaptation of these systems to diverse traffic scenarios poses challenges due to shifts in data distribution stemming from factors such as location, weather, and road infrastructure. To tackle this, we introduce a weakly-supervised label unification pipeline that amalgamates pseudo labels from a multitude of object detection models trained on heterogeneous datasets. Our pipeline engenders a unified label space through the amalgamation of labels from disparate datasets, rectifying bias and enhancing generalization. We fine-tune multiple object detection models on individual datasets, subsequently crafting a unified dataset featuring pseudo labels, meticulously validated for precision. Following this, we retrain a solitary object detection model using the merged label space, culminating in a resilient model proficient in dynamic traffic scenarios. We put forth a comprehensive evaluation of our approach, employing diverse datasets originating from varied Asian countries, effectively demonstrating its efficacy in challenging road conditions. Notably, our method yields substantial enhancements in object detection performance, culminating in a model with heightened resistance against domain shifts.

- **Summary**: The task of radiology reporting comprises describing and interpreting the medical findings in radiographic images, including description of their location and appearance. Automated approaches to radiology reporting require the image to be encoded into a suitable token representation for input to the language model. Previous methods commonly use convolutional neural networks to encode an image into a series of image-level feature map representations. However, the generated reports often exhibit realistic style but imperfect accuracy. Inspired by recent works for image captioning in the general domain in which each visual token corresponds to an object detected in an image, we investigate whether using local tokens corresponding to anatomical structures can improve the quality of the generated reports. We introduce a novel adaptation of Faster R-CNN in which finding detection is performed for the candidate bounding boxes extracted during anatomical structure localisation. We use the resulting bounding box feature representations as our set of finding-aware anatomical tokens. This encourages the extracted anatomical tokens to be informative about the findings they contain (required for the final task of radiology reporting). Evaluating on the MIMIC-CXR dataset of chest X-Ray images, we show that task-aware anatomical tokens give state-of-the-art performance when integrated into an automated reporting pipeline, yielding generated reports with improved clinical accuracy.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in geometric Deep Learning (DL) and the availability of large Computer-Aided Design (CAD) datasets have advanced the research on learning CAD modeling processes and relating them to real objects. In this context, 3D reverse engineering of CAD models from 3D scans is considered to be one of the most sought-after goals for the CAD industry. However, recent efforts assume multiple simplifications limiting the applications in real-world settings. The SHARP Challenge 2023 aims at pushing the research a step closer to the real-world scenario of CAD reverse engineering through dedicated datasets and tracks. In this paper, we define the proposed SHARP 2023 tracks, describe the provided datasets, and propose a set of baseline methods along with suitable evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the track solutions. All proposed datasets along with useful routines and the evaluation metrics are publicly available.

- **Summary**: For robots to be useful outside labs and specialized factories we need a way to teach them new useful behaviors quickly. Current approaches lack either the generality to onboard new tasks without task-specific engineering, or else lack the data-efficiency to do so in an amount of time that enables practical use. In this work we explore dense tracking as a representational vehicle to allow faster and more general learning from demonstration. Our approach utilizes Track-Any-Point (TAP) models to isolate the relevant motion in a demonstration, and parameterize a low-level controller to reproduce this motion across changes in the scene configuration. We show this results in robust robot policies that can solve complex object-arrangement tasks such as shape-matching, stacking, and even full path-following tasks such as applying glue and sticking objects together, all from demonstrations that can be collected in minutes.

- **Summary**: In this paper we tackle the problem of learning Structure-from-Motion (SfM) through the use of graph attention networks. SfM is a classic computer vision problem that is solved though iterative minimization of reprojection errors, referred to as Bundle Adjustment (BA), starting from a good initialization. In order to obtain a good enough initialization to BA, conventional methods rely on a sequence of sub-problems (such as pairwise pose estimation, pose averaging or triangulation) which provides an initial solution that can then be refined using BA. In this work we replace these sub-problems by learning a model that takes as input the 2D keypoints detected across multiple views, and outputs the corresponding camera poses and 3D keypoint coordinates. Our model takes advantage of graph neural networks to learn SfM-specific primitives, and we show that it can be used for fast inference of the reconstruction for new and unseen sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms competing learning-based methods, and challenges COLMAP while having lower runtime.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching is a significant part in many computer vision tasks and driving-based applications. Recently cost volume-based methods have achieved great success benefiting from the rich geometry information in paired images. However, the redundancy of cost volume also interferes with the model training and limits the performance. To construct a more precise cost volume, we pioneeringly apply the diffusion model to stereo matching. Our method, termed DiffuVolume, considers the diffusion model as a cost volume filter, which will recurrently remove the redundant information from the cost volume. Two main designs make our method not trivial. Firstly, to make the diffusion model more adaptive to stereo matching, we eschew the traditional manner of directly adding noise into the image but embed the diffusion model into a task-specific module. In this way, we outperform the traditional diffusion stereo matching method by 22% EPE improvement and 240 times inference acceleration. Secondly, DiffuVolume can be easily embedded into any volume-based stereo matching network with boost performance but slight parameters rise (only 2%). By adding the DiffuVolume into well-performed methods, we outperform all the published methods on Scene Flow, KITTI2012, KITTI2015 benchmarks and zero-shot generalization setting. It is worth mentioning that the proposed model ranks 1st on KITTI 2012 leader board, 2nd on KITTI 2015 leader board since 15, July 2023.

- **Summary**: Typical text recognition methods rely on an encoder-decoder structure, in which the encoder extracts features from an image, and the decoder produces recognized text from these features. In this study, we propose a simpler and more effective method for text recognition, known as the Decoder-only Transformer for Optical Character Recognition (DTrOCR). This method uses a decoder-only Transformer to take advantage of a generative language model that is pre-trained on a large corpus. We examined whether a generative language model that has been successful in natural language processing can also be effective for text recognition in computer vision. Our experiments demonstrated that DTrOCR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the recognition of printed, handwritten, and scene text in both English and Chinese.

- **Summary**: Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable performance in skeleton-based action recognition. However, existing previous GCN-based methods have relied excessively on elaborate human body priors and constructed complex feature aggregation mechanisms, which limits the generalizability of networks. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Spatial Topology Gating Unit (STGU), which is an MLP-based variant without extra priors, to capture the co-occurrence topology features that encode the spatial dependency across all joints. In STGU, to model the sample-specific and completely independent point-wise topology attention, a new gate-based feature interaction mechanism is introduced to activate the features point-to-point by the attention map generated from the input. Based on the STGU, in this work, we propose the first topology-aware MLP-based model, Ta-MLP, for skeleton-based action recognition. In comparison with existing previous methods on three large-scale datasets, Ta-MLP achieves competitive performance. In addition, Ta-MLP reduces the parameters by up to 62.5% with favorable results. Compared with previous state-of-the-art (SOAT) approaches, Ta-MLP pushes the frontier of real-time action recognition. The code will be available at https://github.com/BUPTSJZhang/Ta-MLP.

- **Summary**: In semantic image synthesis, the state of the art is dominated by methods that use spatially-adaptive normalization layers, which allow for excellent visual generation quality and editing versatility. Granted their efficacy, recent research efforts have focused toward finer-grained local style control and multi-modal generation. By construction though, such layers tend to overlook global image statistics leading to unconvincing local style editing and causing global inconsistencies such as color or illumination distribution shifts. Also, the semantic layout is required for mapping styles in the generator, putting a strict alignment constraint over the features. In response, we designed a novel architecture where cross-attention layers are used in place of de-normalization ones for conditioning the image generation. Our model inherits the advantages of both solutions, retaining state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, as well as improved global and local style transfer.

- **Summary**: The study investigates the effectiveness of utilizing multimodal information in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). While prior research focused on using multimodal data in low-resource scenarios, this study examines how image features impact translation when added to a large-scale, pre-trained unimodal NMT system. Surprisingly, the study finds that images might be redundant in this context. Additionally, the research introduces synthetic noise to assess whether images help the model deal with textual noise. Multimodal models slightly outperform text-only models in noisy settings, even with random images. The study's experiments translate from English to Hindi, Bengali, and Malayalam, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks significantly. Interestingly, the effect of visual context varies with source text noise: no visual context works best for non-noisy translations, cropped image features are optimal for low noise, and full image features work better in high-noise scenarios. This sheds light on the role of visual context, especially in noisy settings, opening up a new research direction for Noisy Neural Machine Translation in multimodal setups. The research emphasizes the importance of combining visual and textual information for improved translation in various environments.

- **Summary**: The field of Sign Language Production (SLP) lacked a large-scale, pre-trained model based on deep learning for continuous American Sign Language (ASL) production in the past decade. This limitation hampers communication for all individuals with disabilities relying on ASL. To address this issue, we undertook the secondary development and utilization of How2Sign, one of the largest publicly available ASL datasets. Despite its significance, prior researchers in the field of sign language have not effectively employed this corpus due to the intricacies involved in American Sign Language Production (ASLP).   To conduct large-scale ASLP, we propose SignDiff based on the latest work in related fields, which is a dual-condition diffusion pre-training model that can generate human sign language speakers from a skeleton pose. SignDiff has a novel Frame Reinforcement Network called FR-Net, similar to dense human pose estimation work, which enhances the correspondence between text lexical symbols and sign language dense pose frames reduce the occurrence of multiple fingers in the diffusion model. In addition, our ASLP method proposes two new improved modules and a new loss function to improve the accuracy and quality of sign language skeletal posture and enhance the ability of the model to train on large-scale data.   We propose the first baseline for ASL production and report the scores of 17.19 and 12.85 on BLEU-4 on the How2Sign dev/test sets. We also evaluated our model on the previous mainstream dataset called PHOENIX14T, and the main experiments achieved the results of SOTA. In addition, our image quality far exceeds all previous results by 10 percentage points on the SSIM indicator. Finally, we conducted ablation studies and qualitative evaluations for discussion.

- **Summary**: The success of deep neural networks for pan-sharpening is commonly in a form of black box, lacking transparency and interpretability. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel model-driven deep unfolding framework with image reasoning prior tailored for the pan-sharpening task. Different from existing unfolding solutions that deliver the proximal operator networks as the uncertain and vague priors, our framework is motivated by the content reasoning ability of masked autoencoders (MAE) with insightful designs. Specifically, the pre-trained MAE with spatial masking strategy, acting as intrinsic reasoning prior, is embedded into unfolding architecture. Meanwhile, the pre-trained MAE with spatial-spectral masking strategy is treated as the regularization term within loss function to constrain the spatial-spectral consistency. Such designs penetrate the image reasoning prior into deep unfolding networks while improving its interpretability and representation capability. The uniqueness of our framework is that the holistic learning process is explicitly integrated with the inherent physical mechanism underlying the pan-sharpening task. Extensive experiments on multiple satellite datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Few-shot image generation, which aims to produce plausible and diverse images for one category given a few images from this category, has drawn extensive attention. Existing approaches either globally interpolate different images or fuse local representations with pre-defined coefficients. However, such an intuitive combination of images/features only exploits the most relevant information for generation, leading to poor diversity and coarse-grained semantic fusion. To remedy this, this paper proposes a novel textural modulation (TexMod) mechanism to inject external semantic signals into internal local representations. Parameterized by the feedback from the discriminator, our TexMod enables more fined-grained semantic injection while maintaining the synthesis fidelity. Moreover, a global structural discriminator (StructD) is developed to explicitly guide the model to generate images with reasonable layout and outline. Furthermore, the frequency awareness of the model is reinforced by encouraging the model to distinguish frequency signals. Together with these techniques, we build a novel and effective model for few-shot image generation. The effectiveness of our model is identified by extensive experiments on three popular datasets and various settings. Besides achieving state-of-the-art synthesis performance on these datasets, our proposed techniques could be seamlessly integrated into existing models for a further performance boost.

- **Summary**: Detecting visually similar images is a particularly useful attribute to look to when calculating product recommendations. Embedding similarity, which utilizes pre-trained computer vision models to extract high-level image features, has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in identifying images with similar compositions. However, there is a lack of methods for evaluating the embeddings generated by these models, as conventional loss and performance metrics do not adequately capture their performance in image similarity search tasks.   In this paper, we evaluate the viability of the image embeddings from numerous pre-trained computer vision models using a novel approach named CorrEmbed. Our approach computes the correlation between distances in image embeddings and distances in human-generated tag vectors. We extensively evaluate numerous pre-trained Torchvision models using this metric, revealing an intuitive relationship of linear scaling between ImageNet1k accuracy scores and tag-correlation scores. Importantly, our method also identifies deviations from this pattern, providing insights into how different models capture high-level image features.   By offering a robust performance evaluation of these pre-trained models, CorrEmbed serves as a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop effective, data-driven approaches to similar item recommendations in fashion retail.

- **Summary**: Lossy video compression is commonly used when transmitting and storing video data. Unified video codecs (e.g., H.264 or H.265) remain the \emph{de facto} standard, despite the availability of advanced (neural) compression approaches. Transmitting videos in the face of dynamic network bandwidth conditions requires video codecs to adapt to vastly different compression strengths. Rate control modules augment the codec's compression such that bandwidth constraints are satisfied and video distortion is minimized. While, both standard video codes and their rate control modules are developed to minimize video distortion w.r.t. human quality assessment, preserving the downstream performance of deep vision models is not considered. In this paper, we present the first end-to-end learnable deep video codec control considering both bandwidth constraints and downstream vision performance, while not breaking existing standardization. We demonstrate for two common vision tasks (semantic segmentation and optical flow estimation) and on two different datasets that our deep codec control better preserves downstream performance than using 2-pass average bit rate control while meeting dynamic bandwidth constraints and adhering to standardizations.

- **Summary**: We present MedShapeNet, a large collection of anatomical shapes (e.g., bones, organs, vessels) and 3D surgical instrument models. Prior to the deep learning era, the broad application of statistical shape models (SSMs) in medical image analysis is evidence that shapes have been commonly used to describe medical data. Nowadays, however, state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms in medical imaging are predominantly voxel-based. In computer vision, on the contrary, shapes (including, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, point clouds and implicit surface models) are preferred data representations in 3D, as seen from the numerous shape-related publications in premier vision conferences, such as the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), as well as the increasing popularity of ShapeNet (about 51,300 models) and Princeton ModelNet (127,915 models) in computer vision research. MedShapeNet is created as an alternative to these commonly used shape benchmarks to facilitate the translation of data-driven vision algorithms to medical applications, and it extends the opportunities to adapt SOTA vision algorithms to solve critical medical problems. Besides, the majority of the medical shapes in MedShapeNet are modeled directly on the imaging data of real patients, and therefore it complements well existing shape benchmarks comprising of computer-aided design (CAD) models. MedShapeNet currently includes more than 100,000 medical shapes, and provides annotations in the form of paired data. It is therefore also a freely available repository of 3D models for extended reality (virtual reality - VR, augmented reality - AR, mixed reality - MR) and medical 3D printing. This white paper describes in detail the motivations behind MedShapeNet, the shape acquisition procedures, the use cases, as well as the usage of the online shape search portal: https://medshapenet.ikim.nrw/

- **Summary**: Both CNN-based and Transformer-based object detection with bounding box representation have been extensively studied in computer vision and medical image analysis, but circular object detection in medical images is still underexplored. Inspired by the recent anchor free CNN-based circular object detection method (CircleNet) for ball-shape glomeruli detection in renal pathology, in this paper, we present CircleFormer, a Transformer-based circular medical object detection with dynamic anchor circles. Specifically, queries with circle representation in Transformer decoder iteratively refine the circular object detection results, and a circle cross attention module is introduced to compute the similarity between circular queries and image features. A generalized circle IoU (gCIoU) is proposed to serve as a new regression loss of circular object detection as well. Moreover, our approach is easy to generalize to the segmentation task by adding a simple segmentation branch to CircleFormer. We evaluate our method in circular nuclei detection and segmentation on the public MoNuSeg dataset, and the experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well. Our code is released at https://github.com/zhanghx-iim-ahu/CircleFormer.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised anomaly segmentation aims to detect patterns that are distinct from any patterns processed during training, commonly called abnormal or out-of-distribution patterns, without providing any associated manual segmentations. Since anomalies during deployment can lead to model failure, detecting the anomaly can enhance the reliability of models, which is valuable in high-risk domains like medical imaging. This paper introduces Masked Modality Cycles with Conditional Diffusion (MMCCD), a method that enables segmentation of anomalies across diverse patterns in multimodal MRI. The method is based on two fundamental ideas. First, we propose the use of cyclic modality translation as a mechanism for enabling abnormality detection. Image-translation models learn tissue-specific modality mappings, which are characteristic of tissue physiology. Thus, these learned mappings fail to translate tissues or image patterns that have never been encountered during training, and the error enables their segmentation. Furthermore, we combine image translation with a masked conditional diffusion model, which attempts to `imagine' what tissue exists under a masked area, further exposing unknown patterns as the generative model fails to recreate them. We evaluate our method on a proxy task by training on healthy-looking slices of BraTS2021 multi-modality MRIs and testing on slices with tumors. We show that our method compares favorably to previous unsupervised approaches based on image reconstruction and denoising with autoencoders and diffusion models.

- **Summary**: A central challenge of video prediction lies where the system has to reason the objects' future motions from image frames while simultaneously maintaining the consistency of their appearances across frames. This work introduces an end-to-end trainable two-stream video prediction framework, Motion-Matrix-based Video Prediction (MMVP), to tackle this challenge. Unlike previous methods that usually handle motion prediction and appearance maintenance within the same set of modules, MMVP decouples motion and appearance information by constructing appearance-agnostic motion matrices. The motion matrices represent the temporal similarity of each and every pair of feature patches in the input frames, and are the sole input of the motion prediction module in MMVP. This design improves video prediction in both accuracy and efficiency, and reduces the model size. Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that MMVP outperforms state-of-the-art systems on public data sets by non-negligible large margins (about 1 db in PSNR, UCF Sports) in significantly smaller model sizes (84% the size or smaller).

- **Summary**: The objective of Classic Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is to produce a bounding box corresponding to the object mentioned in a given textual description. Commonly, existing datasets and techniques in classic REC are tailored for expressions that pertain to a single target, meaning a sole expression is linked to one specific object. Expressions that refer to multiple targets or involve no specific target have not been taken into account. This constraint hinders the practical applicability of REC. This study introduces a new benchmark termed as Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension (GREC). This benchmark extends the classic REC by permitting expressions to describe any number of target objects. To achieve this goal, we have built the first large-scale GREC dataset named gRefCOCO. This dataset encompasses a range of expressions: those referring to multiple targets, expressions with no specific target, and the single-target expressions. The design of GREC and gRefCOCO ensures smooth compatibility with classic REC. The proposed gRefCOCO dataset, a GREC method implementation code, and GREC evaluation code are available at https://github.com/henghuiding/gRefCOCO.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a state-of-the-art research advancement in natural image segmentation, achieving impressive results with input prompts such as points and bounding boxes. However, our evaluation and recent research indicate that directly applying the pretrained SAM to medical image segmentation does not yield satisfactory performance. This limitation primarily arises from significant domain gap between natural images and medical images. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM-Med2D, the most comprehensive studies on applying SAM to medical 2D images. Specifically, we first collect and curate approximately 4.6M images and 19.7M masks from public and private datasets, constructing a large-scale medical image segmentation dataset encompassing various modalities and objects. Then, we comprehensively fine-tune SAM on this dataset and turn it into SAM-Med2D. Unlike previous methods that only adopt bounding box or point prompts as interactive segmentation approach, we adapt SAM to medical image segmentation through more comprehensive prompts involving bounding boxes, points, and masks. We additionally fine-tune the encoder and decoder of the original SAM to obtain a well-performed SAM-Med2D, leading to the most comprehensive fine-tuning strategies to date. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation and analysis to investigate the performance of SAM-Med2D in medical image segmentation across various modalities, anatomical structures, and organs. Concurrently, we validated the generalization capability of SAM-Med2D on 9 datasets from MICCAI 2023 challenge. Overall, our approach demonstrated significantly superior performance and generalization capability compared to SAM.

- **Summary**: Detection-based methods have been viewed unfavorably in crowd analysis due to their poor performance in dense crowds. However, we argue that the potential of these methods has been underestimated, as they offer crucial information for crowd analysis that is often ignored. Specifically, the area size and confidence score of output proposals and bounding boxes provide insight into the scale and density of the crowd. To leverage these underutilized features, we propose Crowd Hat, a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with existing detection models. This module uses a mixed 2D-1D compression technique to refine the output features and obtain the spatial and numerical distribution of crowd-specific information. Based on these features, we further propose region-adaptive NMS thresholds and a decouple-then-align paradigm that address the major limitations of detection-based methods. Our extensive evaluations on various crowd analysis tasks, including crowd counting, localization, and detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing output features and the potential of detection-based methods in crowd analysis.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of active mapping with a continually-learned neural scene representation, namely Active Neural Mapping. The key lies in actively finding the target space to be explored with efficient agent movement, thus minimizing the map uncertainty on-the-fly within a previously unseen environment. In this paper, we examine the weight space of the continually-learned neural field, and show empirically that the neural variability, the prediction robustness against random weight perturbation, can be directly utilized to measure the instant uncertainty of the neural map. Together with the continuous geometric information inherited in the neural map, the agent can be guided to find a traversable path to gradually gain knowledge of the environment. We present for the first time an active mapping system with a coordinate-based implicit neural representation for online scene reconstruction. Experiments in the visually-realistic Gibson and Matterport3D environment demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Our research aims to unify existing works' diverging opinions on how architectural components affect the adversarial robustness of CNNs. To accomplish our goal, we synthesize a suite of three generalizable robust architectural design principles: (a) optimal range for depth and width configurations, (b) preferring convolutional over patchify stem stage, and (c) robust residual block design through adopting squeeze and excitation blocks and non-parametric smooth activation functions. Through extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of dataset scales, adversarial training methods, model parameters, and network design spaces, our principles consistently and markedly improve AutoAttack accuracy: 1-3 percentage points (pp) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and 4-9 pp on ImageNet.

- **Summary**: Radiology report generation aims to automatically provide clinically meaningful descriptions of radiology images such as MRI and X-ray. Although great success has been achieved in natural scene image captioning tasks, radiology report generation remains challenging and requires prior medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose PromptRRG, a method that utilizes prompt learning to activate a pretrained model and incorporate prior knowledge. Since prompt learning for radiology report generation has not been explored before, we begin with investigating prompt designs and categorise them based on varying levels of knowledge: common, domain-specific and disease-enriched prompts. Additionally, we propose an automatic prompt learning mechanism to alleviate the burden of manual prompt engineering. This is the first work to systematically examine the effectiveness of prompt learning for radiology report generation. Experimental results on the largest radiology report generation benchmark, MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be available upon the acceptance.

- **Summary**: Transformer-like models for vision tasks have recently proven effective for a wide range of downstream applications such as segmentation and detection. Previous works have shown that segmentation properties emerge in vision transformers (ViTs) trained using self-supervised methods such as DINO, but not in those trained on supervised classification tasks. In this study, we probe whether segmentation emerges in transformer-based models solely as a result of intricate self-supervised learning mechanisms, or if the same emergence can be achieved under much broader conditions through proper design of the model architecture. Through extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that when employing a white-box transformer-like architecture known as CRATE, whose design explicitly models and pursues low-dimensional structures in the data distribution, segmentation properties, at both the whole and parts levels, already emerge with a minimalistic supervised training recipe. Layer-wise finer-grained analysis reveals that the emergent properties strongly corroborate the designed mathematical functions of the white-box network. Our results suggest a path to design white-box foundation models that are simultaneously highly performant and mathematically fully interpretable.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models often rely only on a small set of features even when there is a rich set of predictive signals in the training data. This makes models brittle and sensitive to distribution shifts. In this work, we first examine vision transformers (ViTs) and find that they tend to extract robust and spurious features with distinct attention heads. As a result of this modularity, their performance under distribution shifts can be significantly improved at test time by pruning heads corresponding to spurious features, which we demonstrate using an "oracle selection" on validation data. Second, we propose a method to further enhance the diversity and complementarity of the learned features by encouraging orthogonality of the attention heads' input gradients. We observe improved out-of-distribution performance on diagnostic benchmarks (MNIST-CIFAR, Waterbirds) as a consequence of the enhanced diversity of features and the pruning of undesirable heads.

- **Summary**: Structural columns are the crucial load-carrying components of buildings and bridges. Early detection of column damage is important for the assessment of the residual performance and the prevention of system-level collapse. This research proposes an innovative end-to-end micro aerial vehicles (MAVs)-based approach to automatically scan and inspect columns. First, an MAV-based automatic image collection method is proposed. The MAV is programmed to sense the structural columns and their surrounding environment. During the navigation, the MAV first detects and approaches the structural columns. Then, it starts to collect image data at multiple viewpoints around every detected column. Second, the collected images will be used to assess the damage types and damage locations. Third, the damage state of the structural column will be determined by fusing the evaluation outcomes from multiple camera views. In this study, reinforced concrete (RC) columns are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MAV-based inspection approach can effectively collect images from multiple viewing angles, and accurately assess critical RC column damages. The approach improves the level of autonomy during the inspection. In addition, the evaluation outcomes are more comprehensive than the existing 2D vision methods. The concept of the proposed inspection approach can be extended to other structural columns such as bridge piers.

- **Summary**: After an earthquake, it is particularly important to provide the necessary resources on site because a large number of infrastructures need to be repaired or newly constructed. Due to the complex construction environment after the disaster, there are potential safety hazards for human labors working in this environment. With the advancement of robotic technology and artificial intelligent (AI) algorithms, smart robotic technology is the potential solution to provide construction resources after an earthquake. In this paper, the robotic crane with advanced AI algorithms is proposed to provide resources for infrastructure reconstruction after an earthquake. The proximal policy optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, is implemented for 3D lift path planning when transporting the construction materials. The state and reward function are designed in detail for RL model training. Two models are trained through a loading task in different environments by using PPO algorithm, one considering the influence of obstacles and the other not considering obstacles. Then, the two trained models are compared and evaluated through an unloading task and a loading task in simulation environments. For each task, two different cases are considered. One is that there is no obstacle between the initial position where the construction material is lifted and the target position, and the other is that there are obstacles between the initial position and the target position. The results show that the model that considering the obstacles during training can generate proper actions for the robotic crane to execute so that the crane can automatically transport the construction materials to the desired location with swing suppression, short time consumption and collision avoidance.

- **Summary**: Since their inception in 2014, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have rapidly emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic and diverse data across various domains, including computer vision and other applied areas. Consisting of a discriminative network and a generative network engaged in a Minimax game, GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modeling. In February 2018, GAN secured the leading spot on the ``Top Ten Global Breakthrough Technologies List'' issued by the Massachusetts Science and Technology Review. Over the years, numerous advancements have been proposed, leading to a rich array of GAN variants, such as conditional GAN, Wasserstein GAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN, among many others. This survey aims to provide a general overview of GANs, summarizing the latent architecture, validation metrics, and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. We also delve into recent theoretical developments, exploring the profound connection between the adversarial principle underlying GAN and Jensen-Shannon divergence, while discussing the optimality characteristics of the GAN framework. The efficiency of GAN variants and their model architectures will be evaluated along with training obstacles as well as training solutions. In addition, a detailed discussion will be provided, examining the integration of GANs with newly developed deep learning frameworks such as Transformers, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Large Language models, and Diffusion models. Finally, we reveal several issues as well as future research outlines in this field.

- **Summary**: In this work, we utilize image segmentation to visually identify blood vessels in retinal examination images. This process is typically carried out manually. However, we can employ heuristic methods and machine learning to automate or at least expedite the process. In this context, we propose a cross-platform, open-source, and responsive software that allows users to manually segment a retinal image. The purpose is to use the user-segmented image to retrain machine learning algorithms, thereby enhancing future automated segmentation results. Moreover, the software also incorporates and applies certain image filters established in the literature to improve vessel visualization. We propose the first solution of this kind in the literature. This is the inaugural integrated software that embodies the aforementioned attributes: open-source, responsive, and cross-platform. It offers a comprehensive solution encompassing manual vessel segmentation, as well as the automated execution of classification algorithms to refine predictive models.

- **Summary**: This study introduces an innovative violence detection framework tailored to the unique requirements of smart airports, where prompt responses to violent situations are crucial. The proposed framework harnesses the power of ViTPose for human pose estimation. It employs a CNN - BiLSTM network to analyse spatial and temporal information within keypoints sequences, enabling the accurate classification of violent behaviour in real time. Seamlessly integrated within the SAFE (Situational Awareness for Enhanced Security framework of SAAB, the solution underwent integrated testing to ensure robust performance in real world scenarios. The AIRTLab dataset, characterized by its high video quality and relevance to surveillance scenarios, is utilized in this study to enhance the model's accuracy and mitigate false positives. As airports face increased foot traffic in the post pandemic era, implementing AI driven violence detection systems, such as the one proposed, is paramount for improving security, expediting response times, and promoting data informed decision making. The implementation of this framework not only diminishes the probability of violent events but also assists surveillance teams in effectively addressing potential threats, ultimately fostering a more secure and protected aviation sector.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present Catalog Phrase Grounding (CPG), a model that can associate product textual data (title, brands) into corresponding regions of product images (isolated product region, brand logo region) for e-commerce vision-language applications. We use a state-of-the-art modulated multimodal transformer encoder-decoder architecture unifying object detection and phrase-grounding. We train the model in self-supervised fashion with 2.3 million image-text pairs synthesized from an e-commerce site. The self-supervision data is annotated with high-confidence pseudo-labels generated with a combination of teacher models: a pre-trained general domain phrase grounding model (e.g. MDETR) and a specialized logo detection model. This allows CPG, as a student model, to benefit from transfer knowledge from these base models combining general-domain knowledge and specialized knowledge. Beyond immediate catalog phrase grounding tasks, we can benefit from CPG representations by incorporating them as ML features into downstream catalog applications that require deep semantic understanding of products. Our experiments on product-brand matching, a challenging e-commerce application, show that incorporating CPG representations into the existing production ensemble system leads to on average 5% recall improvement across all countries globally (with the largest lift of 11% in a single country) at fixed 95% precision, outperforming other alternatives including a logo detection teacher model and ResNet50.



### A Recycling Training Strategy for Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Denoising Models

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion models have found applications in image segmentation by generating segmented masks conditioned on images. Existing studies predominantly focus on adjusting model architecture or improving inference such as test-time sampling strategies. In this work, we focus on training strategy improvements and propose a novel recycling method. During each training step, a segmentation mask is first predicted given an image and a random noise. This predicted mask, replacing the conventional ground truth mask, is used for denoising task during training. This approach can be interpreted as aligning the training strategy with inference by eliminating the dependence on ground truth masks for generating noisy samples. Our proposed method significantly outperforms standard diffusion training, self-conditioning, and existing recycling strategies across multiple medical imaging data sets: muscle ultrasound, abdominal CT, prostate MR, and brain MR. This holds true for two widely adopted sampling strategies: denoising diffusion probabilistic model and denoising diffusion implicit model. Importantly, existing diffusion models often display a declining or unstable performance during inference, whereas our novel recycling consistently enhances or maintains performance. Furthermore, we show for the first time that, under a fair comparison with the same network architectures and computing budget, the proposed recycling-based diffusion models achieved on-par performance with non-diffusion-based supervised training. This paper summarises these quantitative results and discusses their values, with a fully reproducible JAX-based implementation, released at https://github.com/mathpluscode/ImgX-DiffSeg.

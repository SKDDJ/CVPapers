- **Summary**: Bloodstain pattern analysis plays a crucial role in crime scene investigations by providing valuable information through the study of unique blood patterns. Conventional image analysis methods, like Thresholding and Contrast, impose stringent requirements on the image background and is labor-intensive in the context of droplet image segmentation. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a recently proposed method for extensive image recognition, is yet to be adequately assessed for its accuracy and efficiency on bloodstain image segmentation. This paper explores the application of pre-trained SAM and fine-tuned SAM on bloodstain image segmentation with diverse image backgrounds. Experiment results indicate that both pre-trained and fine-tuned SAM perform the bloodstain image segmentation task with satisfactory accuracy and efficiency, while fine-tuned SAM achieves an overall 2.2\% accuracy improvement than pre-trained SAM and 4.70\% acceleration in terms of speed for image recognition. Analysis of factors that influence bloodstain recognition is carried out. This research demonstrates the potential application of SAM on bloodstain image segmentation, showcasing the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence application in criminology research.

- **Summary**: Compression technology is essential for efficient image transmission and storage. With the rapid advances in deep learning, images are beginning to be used for image recognition as well as for human vision. For this reason, research has been conducted on image coding for image recognition, and this field is called Image Coding for Machines (ICM). There are two main approaches in ICM: the ROI-based approach and the task-loss-based approach. The former approach has the problem of requiring an ROI-map as input in addition to the input image. The latter approach has the problems of difficulty in learning the task-loss, and lack of robustness because the specific image recognition model is used to compute the loss function. To solve these problems, we propose an image compression model that learns object regions. Our model does not require additional information as input, such as an ROI-map, and does not use task-loss. Therefore, it is possible to compress images for various image recognition models. In the experiments, we demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method by using three different image recognition models and three different datasets. In addition, we verify the effectiveness of our model by comparing it with previous methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce LDL, a fast and robust algorithm that localizes a panorama to a 3D map using line segments. LDL focuses on the sparse structural information of lines in the scene, which is robust to illumination changes and can potentially enable efficient computation. While previous line-based localization approaches tend to sacrifice accuracy or computation time, our method effectively observes the holistic distribution of lines within panoramic images and 3D maps. Specifically, LDL matches the distribution of lines with 2D and 3D line distance functions, which are further decomposed along principal directions of lines to increase the expressiveness. The distance functions provide coarse pose estimates by comparing the distributional information, where the poses are further optimized using conventional local feature matching. As our pipeline solely leverages line geometry and local features, it does not require costly additional training of line-specific features or correspondence matching. Nevertheless, our method demonstrates robust performance on challenging scenarios including object layout changes, illumination shifts, and large-scale scenes, while exhibiting fast pose search terminating within a matter of milliseconds. We thus expect our method to serve as a practical solution for line-based localization, and complement the well-established point-based paradigm. The code for LDL is available through the following link: https://github.com/82magnolia/panoramic-localization.

- **Summary**: To overcome difficulties in classifying large dimensionality data with a large number of classes, we propose a novel approach called JLSPCADL. This paper uses the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma to select the dimensionality of a transformed space in which a discriminative dictionary can be learned for signal classification. Rather than reducing dimensionality via random projections, as is often done with JL, we use a projection transformation matrix derived from Modified Supervised PC Analysis (M-SPCA) with the JL-prescribed dimension.   JLSPCADL provides a heuristic to deduce suitable distortion levels and the corresponding Suitable Description Length (SDL) of dictionary atoms to derive an optimal feature space and thus the SDL of dictionary atoms for better classification. Unlike state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction-based dictionary learning methods, a projection transformation matrix derived in a single step from M-SPCA provides maximum feature-label consistency of the transformed space while preserving the cluster structure of the original data. Despite confusing pairs, the dictionary for the transformed space generates discriminative sparse coefficients, with fewer training samples. Experimentation demonstrates that JLSPCADL scales well with an increasing number of classes and dimensionality. Improved label consistency of features due to M-SPCA helps to classify better. Further, the complexity of training a discriminative dictionary is significantly reduced by using SDL. Experimentation on OCR and face recognition datasets shows relatively better classification performance than other supervised dictionary learning algorithms.

- **Summary**: The most common type of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), has been increasingly detected since the advent of low-dose computed tomography screening technology. In clinical practice, pre-invasive LUAD (Pre-IAs) should only require regular follow-up care, while invasive LUAD (IAs) should receive immediate treatment with appropriate lung cancer resection, based on the cancer subtype. However, prior research on diagnosing LUAD has mainly focused on classifying Pre-IAs/IAs, as techniques for distinguishing different subtypes of IAs have been lacking. In this study, we proposed a multi-head attentional feature fusion (MHA-FF) model for not only distinguishing IAs from Pre-IAs, but also for distinguishing the different subtypes of IAs. To predict the subtype of each nodule accurately, we leveraged both radiomics and deep features extracted from computed tomography images. Furthermore, those features were aggregated through an adaptive fusion module that can learn attention-based discriminative features. The utility of our proposed method is demonstrated here by means of real-world data collected from a multi-center cohort.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, deep learning models have exhibited considerable advancements, reaching or even exceeding human-level performance in a range of visual perception tasks. This remarkable progress has sparked interest in applying deep networks to real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, mobile devices, robotics, and edge computing. However, the challenge remains that state-of-the-art models usually demand significant computational resources, leading to impractical power consumption, latency, or carbon emissions in real-world scenarios. This trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency has catalyzed the emergence of a new research focus: computationally efficient deep learning, which strives to achieve satisfactory performance while minimizing the computational cost during inference. This review offers an extensive analysis of this rapidly evolving field by examining four key areas: 1) the development of static or dynamic light-weighted backbone models for the efficient extraction of discriminative deep representations; 2) the specialized network architectures or algorithms tailored for specific computer vision tasks; 3) the techniques employed for compressing deep learning models; and 4) the strategies for deploying efficient deep networks on hardware platforms. Additionally, we provide a systematic discussion on the critical challenges faced in this domain, such as network architecture design, training schemes, practical efficiency, and more realistic model compression approaches, as well as potential future research directions.

- **Summary**: Lung cancer, particularly in its advanced stages, remains a leading cause of death globally. Though early detection via low-dose computed tomography (CT) is promising, the identification of high-risk factors crucial for surgical mode selection remains a challenge. Addressing this, our study introduces an Attention-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (AE-GCN) model to classify whether there are high-risk factors in stage I lung cancer based on the preoperative CT images. This will aid surgeons in determining the optimal surgical method before the operation. Unlike previous studies that relied on 3D patch techniques to represent nodule spatial features, our method employs a GCN model to capture the spatial characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Specifically, we regard each slice of the nodule as a graph vertex, and the inherent spatial relationships between slices form the edges. Then, to enhance the expression of nodule features, we integrated both channel and spatial attention mechanisms with a pre-trained VGG model for adaptive feature extraction from pulmonary nodules. Lastly, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using real-world data collected from the hospitals, thereby emphasizing its potential utility in the clinical practice.

- **Summary**: The absolute depth values of surrounding environments provide crucial cues for various assistive technologies, such as localization, navigation, and 3D structure estimation. We propose that accurate depth estimated from panoramic images can serve as a powerful and light-weight input for a wide range of downstream tasks requiring 3D information. While panoramic images can easily capture the surrounding context from commodity devices, the estimated depth shares the limitations of conventional image-based depth estimation; the performance deteriorates under large domain shifts and the absolute values are still ambiguous to infer from 2D observations. By taking advantage of the holistic view, we mitigate such effects in a self-supervised way and fine-tune the network with geometric consistency during the test phase. Specifically, we construct a 3D point cloud from the current depth prediction and project the point cloud at various viewpoints or apply stretches on the current input image to generate synthetic panoramas. Then we minimize the discrepancy of the 3D structure estimated from synthetic images without collecting additional data. We empirically evaluate our method in robot navigation and map-free localization where our method shows large performance enhancements. Our calibration method can therefore widen the applicability under various external conditions, serving as a key component for practical panorama-based machine vision systems.

- **Summary**: Image-text retrieval requires the system to bridge the heterogenous gap between vision and language for accurate retrieval while keeping the network lightweight-enough for efficient retrieval. Existing trade-off solutions mainly study from the view of incorporating cross-modal interactions with the independent-embedding framework or leveraging stronger pretrained encoders, which still demand time-consuming similarity measurement or heavyweight model structure in the retrieval stage. In this work, we propose an image-text alignment module SelfAlign on top of the independent-embedding framework, which improves the retrieval accuracy while maintains the retrieval efficiency without extra supervision. SelfAlign contains two collaborative sub-modules that force image-text alignment at both concept level and context level by self-supervised contrastive learning. It does not require cross-modal embedding interactions during training while maintaining independent image and text encoders during retrieval. With comparable time cost, SelfAlign consistently boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art non-pretraining independent-embedding models respectively by 9.1%, 4.2% and 6.6% in terms of R@sum score on Flickr30K, MSCOCO 1K and MS-COCO 5K datasets. The retrieval accuracy also outperforms most existing interactive-embedding models with orders of magnitude decrease in retrieval time.

- **Summary**: Few-shot font generation is challenging, as it needs to capture the fine-grained stroke styles from a limited set of reference glyphs, and then transfer to other characters, which are expected to have similar styles. However, due to the diversity and complexity of Chinese font styles, the synthesized glyphs of existing methods usually exhibit visible artifacts, such as missing details and distorted strokes. In this paper, we propose a VQGAN-based framework (i.e., VQ-Font) to enhance glyph fidelity through token prior refinement and structure-aware enhancement. Specifically, we pre-train a VQGAN to encapsulate font token prior within a codebook. Subsequently, VQ-Font refines the synthesized glyphs with the codebook to eliminate the domain gap between synthesized and real-world strokes. Furthermore, our VQ-Font leverages the inherent design of Chinese characters, where structure components such as radicals and character components are combined in specific arrangements, to recalibrate fine-grained styles based on references. This process improves the matching and fusion of styles at the structure level. Both modules collaborate to enhance the fidelity of the generated fonts. Experiments on a collected font dataset show that our VQ-Font outperforms the competing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially in generating challenging styles.

- **Summary**: Conventional Domain Adaptation (DA) methods aim to learn domain-invariant feature representations to improve the target adaptation performance. However, we motivate that domain-specificity is equally important since in-domain trained models hold crucial domain-specific properties that are beneficial for adaptation. Hence, we propose to build a framework that supports disentanglement and learning of domain-specific factors and task-specific factors in a unified model. Motivated by the success of vision transformers in several multi-modal vision problems, we find that queries could be leveraged to extract the domain-specific factors. Hence, we propose a novel Domain-specificity-inducing Transformer (DSiT) framework for disentangling and learning both domain-specific and task-specific factors. To achieve disentanglement, we propose to construct novel Domain-Representative Inputs (DRI) with domain-specific information to train a domain classifier with a novel domain token. We are the first to utilize vision transformers for domain adaptation in a privacy-oriented source-free setting, and our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-source, multi-source, and multi-target benchmarks

- **Summary**: Skeleton-based action recognition has recently made significant progress. However, data imbalance is still a great challenge in real-world scenarios. The performance of current action recognition algorithms declines sharply when training data suffers from heavy class imbalance. The imbalanced data actually degrades the representations learned by these methods and becomes the bottleneck for action recognition. How to learn unbiased representations from imbalanced action data is the key to long-tailed action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel balanced representation learning method to address the long-tailed problem in action recognition. Firstly, a spatial-temporal action exploration strategy is presented to expand the sample space effectively, generating more valuable samples in a rebalanced manner. Secondly, we design a detached action-aware learning schedule to further mitigate the bias in the representation space. The schedule detaches the representation learning of tail classes from training and proposes an action-aware loss to impose more effective constraints. Additionally, a skip-modal representation is proposed to provide complementary structural information. The proposed method is validated on four skeleton datasets, NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA, and Kinetics. It not only achieves consistently large improvement compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also demonstrates a superior generalization capacity through extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: Forensic pathology is critical in analyzing death manner and time from the microscopic aspect to assist in the establishment of reliable factual bases for criminal investigation. In practice, even the manual differentiation between different postmortem organ tissues is challenging and relies on expertise, considering that changes like putrefaction and autolysis could significantly change typical histopathological appearance. Developing AI-based computational pathology techniques to assist forensic pathologists is practically meaningful, which requires reliable discriminative representation learning to capture tissues' fine-grained postmortem patterns. To this end, we propose a framework called FPath, in which a dedicated self-supervised contrastive learning strategy and a context-aware multiple-instance learning (MIL) block are designed to learn discriminative representations from postmortem histopathological images acquired at varying magnification scales. Our self-supervised learning step leverages multiple complementary contrastive losses and regularization terms to train a double-tier backbone for fine-grained and informative patch/instance embedding. Thereafter, the context-aware MIL adaptively distills from the local instances a holistic bag/image-level representation for the recognition task. On a large-scale database of $19,607$ experimental rat postmortem images and $3,378$ real-world human decedent images, our FPath led to state-of-the-art accuracy and promising cross-domain generalization in recognizing seven different postmortem tissues. The source code will be released on \href{https://github.com/ladderlab-xjtu/forensic_pathology}{https://github.com/ladderlab-xjtu/forensic\_pathology}.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Transformer networks are beginning to replace pure convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the field of computer vision due to their global receptive field and adaptability to input. However, the quadratic computational complexity of softmax-attention limits the wide application in image dehazing task, especially for high-resolution images. To address this issue, we propose a new Transformer variant, which applies the Taylor expansion to approximate the softmax-attention and achieves linear computational complexity. A multi-scale attention refinement module is proposed as a complement to correct the error of the Taylor expansion. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-branch architecture with multi-scale patch embedding to the proposed Transformer, which embeds features by overlapping deformable convolution of different scales. The design of multi-scale patch embedding is based on three key ideas: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field. Our model, named Multi-branch Transformer expanded by Taylor formula (MB-TaylorFormer), can embed coarse to fine features more flexibly at the patch embedding stage and capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost. Experimental results on several dehazing benchmarks show that MB-TaylorFormer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a light computational burden. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/FVL2020/ICCV-2023-MB-TaylorFormer.

- **Summary**: Deep learning based localization and mapping approaches have recently emerged as a new research direction and receive significant attentions from both industry and academia. Instead of creating hand-designed algorithms based on physical models or geometric theories, deep learning solutions provide an alternative to solve the problem in a data-driven way. Benefiting from the ever-increasing volumes of data and computational power on devices, these learning methods are fast evolving into a new area that shows potentials to track self-motion and estimate environmental model accurately and robustly for mobile agents. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey, and propose a taxonomy for the localization and mapping methods using deep learning. This survey aims to discuss two basic questions: whether deep learning is promising to localization and mapping; how deep learning should be applied to solve this problem. To this end, a series of localization and mapping topics are investigated, from the learning based visual odometry, global relocalization, to mapping, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). It is our hope that this survey organically weaves together the recent works in this vein from robotics, computer vision and machine learning communities, and serves as a guideline for future researchers to apply deep learning to tackle the problem of visual localization and mapping.

- **Summary**: Point clouds are collected nowadays from a plethora of sensors, some having higher accuracies and higher costs, some having lower accuracies but also lower costs. Not only there is a large choice for different sensors, but also these can be transported by different platforms, which can provide different scan geometries. In this work we test the extraction of four different keypoint detectors and three feature descriptors. We benchmark performance in terms of calculation time and we assess their performance in terms of accuracy in their ability in coarse automatic co-registration of two clouds that are collected with different sensors, platforms and scan geometries. One, which we define as having the higher accuracy, and thus will be used as reference, was surveyed via a UAV flight with a Riegl MiniVUX-3, the other on a bicycle with a Livox Horizon over a walking path with un-even ground.The novelty in this work consists in comparing several strategies for fast alignment of point clouds from very different surveying geometries, as the drone has a bird's eye view and the bicycle a ground-based view. An added challenge is related to the lower cost of the bicycle sensor ensemble that, together with the rough terrain, reasonably results in lower accuracy of the survey. The main idea is to use range images to capture a simplified version of the geometry of the surveyed area and then find the best features to match keypoints. Results show that NARF features detected more keypoints and resulted in a faster co-registration procedure in this scenariowhereas the accuracy of the co-registration is similar to all the combinations of keypoint detectors and features.

- **Summary**: Previous deep learning efforts have focused on improving the performance of Pulmonary Embolism(PE) diagnosis from Computed Tomography (CT) scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, the features from CT scans alone are not always sufficient for the diagnosis of PE. CT scans along with electronic heath records (EHR) can provide a better insight into the patients condition and can lead to more accurate PE diagnosis. In this paper, we propose Pulmonary Embolism Detection using Contrastive Learning (PECon), a supervised contrastive pretraining strategy that employs both the patients CT scans as well as the EHR data, aiming to enhance the alignment of feature representations between the two modalities and leverage information to improve the PE diagnosis. In order to achieve this, we make use of the class labels and pull the sample features of the same class together, while pushing away those of the other class. Results show that the proposed work outperforms the existing techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RadFusion dataset with an F1-score of 0.913, accuracy of 0.90 and an AUROC of 0.943. Furthermore, we also explore the explainability of our approach in comparison to other methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/PECon.

- **Summary**: Advertisement videos (ads) play an integral part in the domain of Internet e-commerce as they amplify the reach of particular products to a broad audience or can serve as a medium to raise awareness about specific issues through concise narrative structures. The narrative structures of advertisements involve several elements like reasoning about the broad content (topic and the underlying message) and examining fine-grained details involving the transition of perceived tone due to the specific sequence of events and interaction among characters. In this work, to facilitate the understanding of advertisements along the three important dimensions of topic categorization, perceived tone transition, and social message detection, we introduce a multimodal multilingual benchmark called MM-AU composed of over 8.4K videos (147 hours) curated from multiple web sources. We explore multiple zero-shot reasoning baselines through the application of large language models on the ads transcripts. Further, we demonstrate that leveraging signals from multiple modalities, including audio, video, and text, in multimodal transformer-based supervised models leads to improved performance compared to unimodal approaches.

- **Summary**: In the domain of semi-supervised learning (SSL), the conventional approach involves training a learner with a limited amount of labeled data alongside a substantial volume of unlabeled data, both drawn from the same underlying distribution. However, for deep learning models, this standard practice may not yield optimal results. In this research, we propose an alternative perspective, suggesting that distributions that are more readily separable could offer superior benefits to the learner as compared to the original distribution. To achieve this, we present PruneSSL, a practical technique for selectively removing examples from the original unlabeled dataset to enhance its separability. We present an empirical study, showing that although PruneSSL reduces the quantity of available training data for the learner, it significantly improves the performance of various competitive SSL algorithms, thereby achieving state-of-the-art results across several image classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Effective image restoration with large-size corruptions, such as blind image inpainting, entails precise detection of corruption region masks which remains extremely challenging due to diverse shapes and patterns of corruptions. In this work, we present a novel method for automatic corruption detection, which allows for blind corruption restoration without known corruption masks. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical contrastive learning framework to detect corrupted regions by capturing the intrinsic semantic distinctions between corrupted and uncorrupted regions. In particular, our model detects the corrupted mask in a coarse-to-fine manner by first predicting a coarse mask by contrastive learning in low-resolution feature space and then refines the uncertain area of the mask by high-resolution contrastive learning. A specialized hierarchical interaction mechanism is designed to facilitate the knowledge propagation of contrastive learning in different scales, boosting the modeling performance substantially. The detected multi-scale corruption masks are then leveraged to guide the corruption restoration. Detecting corrupted regions by learning the contrastive distinctions rather than the semantic patterns of corruptions, our model has well generalization ability across different corruption patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate following merits of our model: 1) the superior performance over other methods on both corruption detection and various image restoration tasks including blind inpainting and watermark removal, and 2) strong generalization across different corruption patterns such as graffiti, random noise or other image content.

- **Summary**: Drones have been widely used in many areas of our daily lives. It relieves people of the burden of holding a controller all the time and makes drone control easier to use for people with disabilities or occupied hands. However, the control of aerial robots is more complicated compared to normal robots due to factors such as uncontrollable height. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an intelligent UAV that has the ability to talk to humans and follow natural language commands. In this report, we present an aerial navigation task for the 2023 ICCV Conversation History. Based on the AVDN dataset containing more than 3k recorded navigation trajectories and asynchronous human-robot conversations, we propose an effective method of fusion training of Human Attention Aided Transformer model (HAA-Transformer) and Human Attention Aided LSTM (HAA-LSTM) model, which achieves the prediction of the navigation routing points and human attention. The method not only achieves high SR and SPL metrics, but also shows a 7% improvement in GP metrics compared to the baseline model.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a bi-modality medical image synthesis approach based on sequential generative adversarial network (GAN) and semi-supervised learning. Our approach consists of two generative modules that synthesize images of the two modalities in a sequential order. A method for measuring the synthesis complexity is proposed to automatically determine the synthesis order in our sequential GAN. Images of the modality with a lower complexity are synthesized first, and the counterparts with a higher complexity are generated later. Our sequential GAN is trained end-to-end in a semi-supervised manner. In supervised training, the joint distribution of bi-modality images are learned from real paired images of the two modalities by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between the real and synthetic images. To avoid overfitting limited training images, in unsupervised training, the marginal distribution of each modality is learned based on unpaired images by minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of real and fake images. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed model using two synthesis tasks based on three types of evaluate metrics and user studies. Visual and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state-of-the-art methods, and reasonable visual quality and clinical significance.

- **Summary**: The field of dentistry is in the era of digital transformation. Particularly, artificial intelligence is anticipated to play a significant role in digital dentistry. AI holds the potential to significantly assist dental practitioners and elevate diagnostic accuracy. In alignment with this vision, the 2023 MICCAI DENTEX challenge aims to enhance the performance of dental panoramic X-ray diagnosis and enumeration through technological advancement. In response, we introduce DETDet, a Dual Ensemble Teeth Detection network. DETDet encompasses two distinct modules dedicated to enumeration and diagnosis. Leveraging the advantages of teeth mask data, we employ Mask-RCNN for the enumeration module. For the diagnosis module, we adopt an ensemble model comprising DiffusionDet and DINO. To further enhance precision scores, we integrate a complementary module to harness the potential of unlabeled data. The code for our approach will be made accessible at https://github.com/Bestever-choi/Evident

- **Summary**: Acquiring contact patterns between hands and nonrigid objects is a common concern in the vision and robotics community. However, existing learning-based methods focus more on contact with rigid ones from monocular images. When adopting them for nonrigid contact, a major problem is that the existing contact representation is restricted by the geometry of the object. Consequently, contact neighborhoods are stored in an unordered manner and contact features are difficult to align with image cues. At the core of our approach lies a novel hand-object contact representation called RUPs (Region Unwrapping Profiles), which unwrap the roughly estimated hand-object surfaces as multiple high-resolution 2D regional profiles. The region grouping strategy is consistent with the hand kinematic bone division because they are the primitive initiators for a composite contact pattern. Based on this representation, our Regional Unwrapping Transformer (RUFormer) learns the correlation priors across regions from monocular inputs and predicts corresponding contact and deformed transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can robustly estimate the deformed degrees and deformed transformations, which makes it suitable for both nonrigid and rigid contact.

- **Summary**: In set-based face recognition, we aim to compute the most discriminative descriptor from an unbounded set of images and videos showing a single person. A discriminative descriptor balances two policies when aggregating information from a given set. The first is a quality-based policy: emphasizing high-quality and down-weighting low-quality images. The second is a diversity-based policy: emphasizing unique images in the set and down-weighting multiple occurrences of similar images as found in video clips which can overwhelm the set representation. This work frames face-set representation as a differentiable coreset selection problem. Our model learns how to select a small coreset of the input set that balances quality and diversity policies using a learned metric parameterized by the face quality, optimized end-to-end. The selection process is a differentiable farthest-point sampling (FPS) realized by approximating the non-differentiable Argmax operation with differentiable sampling from the Gumbel-Softmax distribution of distances. The small coreset is later used as queries in a self and cross-attention architecture to enrich the descriptor with information from the whole set. Our model is order-invariant and linear in the input set size. We set a new SOTA to set face verification on the IJB-B and IJB-C datasets. Our code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Classification of very high-resolution (VHR) aerial remote sensing (RS) images is a well-established research area in the remote sensing community as it provides valuable spatial information for decision-making. Existing works on VHR aerial RS image classification produce an excellent classification performance; nevertheless, they have a limited capability to well-represent VHR RS images having complex and small objects, thereby leading to performance instability. As such, we propose a novel plug-and-play multi-scale attention feature extraction block (MSAFEB) based on multi-scale convolution at two levels with skip connection, producing discriminative/salient information at a deeper/finer level. The experimental study on two benchmark VHR aerial RS image datasets (AID and NWPU) demonstrates that our proposal achieves a stable/consistent performance (minimum standard deviation of $0.002$) and competent overall classification performance (AID: 95.85\% and NWPU: 94.09\%).

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D objects from extremely sparse views is a long-standing and challenging problem. While recent techniques employ image diffusion models for generating plausible images at novel viewpoints or for distilling pre-trained diffusion priors into 3D representations using score distillation sampling (SDS), these methods often struggle to simultaneously achieve high-quality, consistent, and detailed results for both novel-view synthesis (NVS) and geometry. In this work, we present Sparse3D, a novel 3D reconstruction method tailored for sparse view inputs. Our approach distills robust priors from a multiview-consistent diffusion model to refine a neural radiance field. Specifically, we employ a controller that harnesses epipolar features from input views, guiding a pre-trained diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion, to produce novel-view images that maintain 3D consistency with the input. By tapping into 2D priors from powerful image diffusion models, our integrated model consistently delivers high-quality results, even when faced with open-world objects. To address the blurriness introduced by conventional SDS, we introduce the category-score distillation sampling (C-SDS) to enhance detail. We conduct experiments on CO3DV2 which is a multi-view dataset of real-world objects. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art works on the metrics regarding NVS and geometry reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Utilizing deep learning (DL) models to improve the early diagnosis of nasal diseases from nasal endoscopic images holds paramount importance. However, the lack of available datasets stymies advancements in this field. Furthermore, existing models fail to strike a good trade-off between model diagnosis performance, model complexity and parameter size, rendering them unsuitable for practical application. To bridge these gaps, we created the first large-scale nasal endoscopy dataset, named 7-NasEID, comprising 11,352 images that span six nasal diseases and normal samples. Building on this, we proposed U-SEANNet, an innovative architecture, underpinned by depth-wise separable convolutions. Additionally, to augment its discernment capabilities for subtle variations in input images, we further proposed the Global-Local Channel Feature Fusion Module, enabling the U-SEANNet to focus salient channel features from both global and local contexts. Notably, U-SEANNet's parameter size and GFLOPs are only 0.78M and 0.21, respectively. Employing the 7-NasalEID, we conducted the five-fold cross-validation on U-SEANNet, juxtaposing its performance against seventeen renowned architectures. The experimental results suggest U-SEANNet as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, achieves an accuracy of 93.58%, sensitivity of 90.17%, and specificity of 91.27%. These findings demonstrate U-SEANNet's prodigious potential for diagnosing nasal diseases in practical use, providing the development of efficacy nasal diseases diagnosis tools with a new insight.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing interacting hands from monocular images is indispensable in AR/VR applications. Most existing solutions rely on the accurate localization of each skeleton joint. However, these methods tend to be unreliable due to the severe occlusion and confusing similarity among adjacent hand parts. This also defies human perception because humans can quickly imitate an interaction pattern without localizing all joints. Our key idea is to first construct a two-hand interaction prior and recast the interaction reconstruction task as the conditional sampling from the prior. To expand more interaction states, a large-scale multimodal dataset with physical plausibility is proposed. Then a VAE is trained to further condense these interaction patterns as latent codes in a prior distribution. When looking for image cues that contribute to interaction prior sampling, we propose the interaction adjacency heatmap (IAH). Compared with a joint-wise heatmap for localization, IAH assigns denser visible features to those invisible joints. Compared with an all-in-one visible heatmap, it provides more fine-grained local interaction information in each interaction region. Finally, the correlations between the extracted features and corresponding interaction codes are linked by the ViT module. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness of this framework. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/binghui-z/InterPrior_pytorch

- **Summary**: Estimating the shape and motion state of the myocardium is essential in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases.However, cine magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is dominated by 2D slices, whose large slice spacing challenges inter-slice shape reconstruction and motion acquisition.To address this problem, we propose a 4D reconstruction method that decouples motion and shape, which can predict the inter-/intra- shape and motion estimation from a given sparse point cloud sequence obtained from limited slices. Our framework comprises a neural motion model and an end-diastolic (ED) shape model. The implicit ED shape model can learn a continuous boundary and encourage the motion model to predict without the supervision of ground truth deformation, and the motion model enables canonical input of the shape model by deforming any point from any phase to the ED phase. Additionally, the constructed ED-space enables pre-training of the shape model, thereby guiding the motion model and addressing the issue of data scarcity. We propose the first 4D myocardial dataset as we know and verify our method on the proposed, public, and cross-modal datasets, showing superior reconstruction performance and enabling various clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Edge detection, as a core component in a wide range of visionoriented tasks, is to identify object boundaries and prominent edges in natural images. An edge detector is desired to be both efficient and accurate for practical use. To achieve the goal, two key issues should be concerned: 1) How to liberate deep edge models from inefficient pre-trained backbones that are leveraged by most existing deep learning methods, for saving the computational cost and cutting the model size; and 2) How to mitigate the negative influence from noisy or even wrong labels in training data, which widely exist in edge detection due to the subjectivity and ambiguity of annotators, for the robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we attempt to simultaneously address the above problems via developing a collaborative learning based model, termed PEdger. The principle behind our PEdger is that, the information learned from different training moments and heterogeneous (recurrent and non recurrent in this work) architectures, can be assembled to explore robust knowledge against noisy annotations, even without the help of pre-training on extra data. Extensive ablation studies together with quantitative and qualitative experimental comparisons on the BSDS500 and NYUD datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our design, and demonstrate its superiority over other competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and model size.

- **Summary**: Leaf disease is a common fatal disease for plants. Early diagnosis and detection is necessary in order to improve the prognosis of leaf diseases affecting plant. For predicting leaf disease, several automated systems have already been developed using different plant pathology imaging modalities. This paper provides a systematic review of the literature on leaf disease-based models for the diagnosis of various plant leaf diseases via deep learning. The advantages and limitations of different deep learning models including Vision Transformer (ViT), Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), Convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual Skip Network-based Super-Resolution for Leaf Disease Detection (RSNSR-LDD), Disease Detection Network (DDN), and YOLO (You only look once) are described in this review. The review also shows that the studies related to leaf disease detection applied different deep learning models to a number of publicly available datasets. For comparing the performance of the models, different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. were used in the existing studies.



### Rethinking Exemplars for Continual Semantic Segmentation in Endoscopy Scenes: Entropy-based Mini-Batch Pseudo-Replay

- **Summary**: Endoscopy is a widely used technique for the early detection of diseases or robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS). Numerous deep learning (DL)-based research works have been developed for automated diagnosis or processing of endoscopic view. However, existing DL models may suffer from catastrophic forgetting. When new target classes are introduced over time or cross institutions, the performance of old classes may suffer severe degradation. More seriously, data privacy and storage issues may lead to the unavailability of old data when updating the model. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a continual learning (CL) methodology to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting in endoscopic image segmentation. To tackle this, we propose a Endoscopy Continual Semantic Segmentation (EndoCSS) framework that does not involve the storage and privacy issues of exemplar data. The framework includes a mini-batch pseudo-replay (MB-PR) mechanism and a self-adaptive noisy cross-entropy (SAN-CE) loss. The MB-PR strategy circumvents privacy and storage issues by generating pseudo-replay images through a generative model. Meanwhile, the MB-PR strategy can also correct the model deviation to the replay data and current training data, which is aroused by the significant difference in the amount of current and replay images. Therefore, the model can perform effective representation learning on both new and old tasks. SAN-CE loss can help model fitting by adjusting the model's output logits, and also improve the robustness of training. Extensive continual semantic segmentation (CSS) experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method can robustly and effectively address the catastrophic forgetting brought by class increment in endoscopy scenes. The results show that our framework holds excellent potential for real-world deployment in a streaming learning manner.

- **Summary**: Community detection is a powerful tool from complex networks analysis that finds applications in various research areas. Several image segmentation methods rely for instance on community detection algorithms as a black box in order to compute undersegmentations, i.e. a small number of regions that represent areas of interest of the image. However, to the best of our knowledge, the efficiency of such an approach w.r.t. superpixels, that aim at representing the image at a smaller level while preserving as much as possible original information, has been neglected so far. The only related work seems to be the one by Liu et. al. (IET Image Processing, 2022) that developed a superpixels algorithm using a so-called modularity maximization approach, leading to relevant results. We follow this line of research by studying the efficiency of superpixels computed by state-of-the-art community detection algorithms on a 4-connected pixel graph, so-called pixel-grid. We first detect communities on such a graph and then apply a simple merging procedure that allows to obtain the desired number of superpixels. As we shall see, such methods result in the computation of relevant superpixels as emphasized by both qualitative and quantitative experiments, according to different widely-used metrics based on ground-truth comparison or on superpixels only. We observe that the choice of the community detection algorithm has a great impact on the number of communities and hence on the merging procedure. Similarly, small variations on the pixel-grid may provide different results from both qualitative and quantitative viewpoints. For the sake of completeness, we compare our results with those of several state-of-the-art superpixels algorithms as computed by Stutz et al. (Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 2018).

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a simple, flexible and effective vision-language (VL) tracking pipeline, termed \textbf{MMTrack}, which casts VL tracking as a token generation task. Traditional paradigms address VL tracking task indirectly with sophisticated prior designs, making them over-specialize on the features of specific architectures or mechanisms. In contrast, our proposed framework serializes language description and bounding box into a sequence of discrete tokens. In this new design paradigm, all token queries are required to perceive the desired target and directly predict spatial coordinates of the target in an auto-regressive manner. The design without other prior modules avoids multiple sub-tasks learning and hand-designed loss functions, significantly reducing the complexity of VL tracking modeling and allowing our tracker to use a simple cross-entropy loss as unified optimization objective for VL tracking task. Extensive experiments on TNL2K, LaSOT, LaSOT$_{\rm{ext}}$ and OTB99-Lang benchmarks show that our approach achieves promising results, compared to other state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Video temporal character grouping locates appearing moments of major characters within a video according to their identities. To this end, recent works have evolved from unsupervised clustering to graph-based supervised clustering. However, graph methods are built upon the premise of fixed affinity graphs, bringing many inexact connections. Besides, they extract multi-modal features with kinds of models, which are unfriendly to deployment. In this paper, we present a unified and dynamic graph (UniDG) framework for temporal character grouping. This is accomplished firstly by a unified representation network that learns representations of multiple modalities within the same space and still preserves the modality's uniqueness simultaneously. Secondly, we present a dynamic graph clustering where the neighbors of different quantities are dynamically constructed for each node via a cyclic matching strategy, leading to a more reliable affinity graph. Thirdly, a progressive association method is introduced to exploit spatial and temporal contexts among different modalities, allowing multi-modal clustering results to be well fused. As current datasets only provide pre-extracted features, we evaluate our UniDG method on a collected dataset named MTCG, which contains each character's appearing clips of face and body and speaking voice tracks. We also evaluate our key components on existing clustering and retrieval datasets to verify the generalization ability. Experimental results manifest that our method can achieve promising results and outperform several state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we tackle the problem of generating a novel image from an arbitrary viewpoint given a single frame as input. While existing methods operating in this setup aim at predicting the target view depth map to guide the synthesis, without explicit supervision over such a task, we jointly optimize our framework for both novel view synthesis and depth estimation to unleash the synergy between the two at its best. Specifically, a shared depth decoder is trained in a self-supervised manner to predict depth maps that are consistent across the source and target views. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of both tasks allowing for higher-quality generated images, as well as more accurate depth for the target viewpoint.

- **Summary**: Cloth-changing Person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve the target person across multiple surveillance cameras when clothing changes might happen. Despite recent progress in CC-ReID, existing approaches are still hindered by the interference of clothing variations since they lack effective constraints to keep the model consistently focused on clothing-irrelevant regions. To address this issue, we present a Semantic-aware Consistency Network (SCNet) to learn identity-related semantic features by proposing effective consistency constraints. Specifically, we generate the black-clothing image by erasing pixels in the clothing area, which explicitly mitigates the interference from clothing variations. In addition, to fully exploit the fine-grained identity information, a head-enhanced attention module is introduced, which learns soft attention maps by utilizing the proposed part-based matching loss to highlight head information. We further design a semantic consistency loss to facilitate the learning of high-level identity-related semantic features, forcing the model to focus on semantically consistent cloth-irrelevant regions. By using the consistency constraint, our model does not require any extra auxiliary segmentation module to generate the black-clothing image or locate the head region during the inference stage. Extensive experiments on four cloth-changing person Re-ID datasets (LTCC, PRCC, Vc-Clothes, and DeepChange) demonstrate that our proposed SCNet makes significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance. Traditional SSL methods assume that labeled and unlabeled data share the same label space. However, in real-world applications, especially when the labeled training set is small, there may be classes that are missing from the labeled set. Existing frameworks aim to either reject all unseen classes (open-set SSL) or to discover unseen classes by partitioning an unlabeled set during training (open-world SSL). In our work, we construct a classifier for points from both seen and unseen classes. Our approach is based on extending an existing SSL method, such as FlexMatch, by incorporating an additional entropy loss. This enhancement allows our method to improve the performance of any existing SSL method in the classification of both seen and unseen classes. We demonstrate large improvement gains over state-of-the-art SSL, open-set SSL, and open-world SSL methods, on two benchmark image classification data sets, CIFAR-100 and STL-10. The gains are most pronounced when the labeled data is severely limited (1-25 labeled examples per class).

- **Summary**: Recently, the fundamental problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on 3D point clouds has been motivated by a wide variety of applications in robotics, virtual reality, and scene understanding, to name a few. The point cloud data acquisition procedures manifest themselves as significant domain discrepancies and geometric variations among both similar and dissimilar classes. The standard domain adaptation methods developed for images do not directly translate to point cloud data because of their complex geometric nature. To address this challenge, we leverage the idea of multimodality and alignment between distributions. We propose a new UDA architecture for point cloud classification that benefits from multimodal contrastive learning to get better class separation in both domains individually. Further, the use of optimal transport (OT) aims at learning source and target data distributions jointly to reduce the cross-domain shift and provide a better alignment. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on PointDA-10 and GraspNetPC-10 and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on GraspNetPC-10 (with approx 4-12% margin) and best average performance on PointDA-10. Our ablation studies and decision boundary analysis also validate the significance of our contrastive learning module and OT alignment.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of scaled-up segmentation models, enabling zero-shot generalization across a variety of domains. By leveraging large-scale foundational models as pre-trained models, it is a natural progression to fine-tune SAM for specific domains to further enhance performances. However, the adoption of foundational models in the medical domain presents a challenge due to the difficulty and expense of labeling sufficient data for adaptation within hospital systems. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and practical approach for fine-tuning SAM using a limited number of exemplars, making it suitable for such scenarios. Our approach combines two established techniques from the literature: an exemplar-guided synthesis module and the widely recognized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning strategy, serving as data-level and model-level attempts respectively. Interestingly, our empirical findings suggest that SAM can be effectively aligned within the medical domain even with few labeled data. We validate our approach through experiments on brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) and multi-organ CT segmentation (Synapse). The comprehensive results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of such an approach, paving the way for the practical application of SAM in the medical domain.

- **Summary**: Generating 3D images of complex objects conditionally from a few 2D views is a difficult synthesis problem, compounded by issues such as domain gap and geometric misalignment. For instance, a unified framework such as Generative Adversarial Networks cannot achieve this unless they explicitly define both a domain-invariant and geometric-invariant joint latent distribution, whereas Neural Radiance Fields are generally unable to handle both issues as they optimize at the pixel level. By contrast, we propose a simple and novel 2D to 3D synthesis approach based on conditional diffusion with vector-quantized codes. Operating in an information-rich code space enables high-resolution 3D synthesis via full-coverage attention across the views. Specifically, we generate the 3D codes (e.g. for CT images) conditional on previously generated 3D codes and the entire codebook of two 2D views (e.g. 2D X-rays). Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over specialized methods across varied evaluation criteria, including fidelity metrics such as density, coverage, and distortion metrics for two complex volumetric imagery datasets from in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: In the real world, image degradations caused by rain often exhibit a combination of rain streaks and raindrops, thereby increasing the challenges of recovering the underlying clean image. Note that the rain streaks and raindrops have diverse shapes, sizes, and locations in the captured image, and thus modeling the correlation relationship between irregular degradations caused by rain artifacts is a necessary prerequisite for image deraining. This paper aims to present an efficient and flexible mechanism to learn and model degradation relationships in a global view, thereby achieving a unified removal of intricate rain scenes. To do so, we propose a Sparse Sampling Transformer based on Uncertainty-Driven Ranking, dubbed UDR-S2Former. Compared to previous methods, our UDR-S2Former has three merits. First, it can adaptively sample relevant image degradation information to model underlying degradation relationships. Second, explicit application of the uncertainty-driven ranking strategy can facilitate the network to attend to degradation features and understand the reconstruction process. Finally, experimental results show that our UDR-S2Former clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for all benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The development of transformer-based models has resulted in significant advances in addressing various vision and NLP-based research challenges. However, the progress made in transformer-based methods has not been effectively applied to biosensing research. This paper presents a novel Unified Biosensor-Vision Multi-modal Transformer-based (UBVMT) method to classify emotions in an arousal-valence space by combining a 2D representation of an ECG/PPG signal with the face information. To achieve this goal, we first investigate and compare the unimodal emotion recognition performance of three image-based representations of the ECG/PPG signal. We then present our UBVMT network which is trained to perform emotion recognition by combining the 2D image-based representation of the ECG/PPG signal and the facial expression features. Our unified transformer model consists of homogeneous transformer blocks that take as an input the 2D representation of the ECG/PPG signal and the corresponding face frame for emotion representation learning with minimal modality-specific design. Our UBVMT model is trained by reconstructing masked patches of video frames and 2D images of ECG/PPG signals, and contrastive modeling to align face and ECG/PPG data. Extensive experiments on the MAHNOB-HCI and DEAP datasets show that our Unified UBVMT-based model produces comparable results to the state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: AI-generated content (AIGC) methods aim to produce text, images, videos, 3D assets, and other media using AI algorithms. Due to its wide range of applications and the demonstrated potential of recent works, AIGC developments have been attracting a lot of attention recently, and AIGC methods have been developed for various data modalities, such as image, video, text, 3D shape (as voxels, point clouds, meshes, and neural implicit fields), 3D scene, 3D human avatar (body and head), 3D motion, and audio -- each presenting different characteristics and challenges. Furthermore, there have also been many significant developments in cross-modality AIGC methods, where generative methods can receive conditioning input in one modality and produce outputs in another. Examples include going from various modalities to image, video, 3D shape, 3D scene, 3D avatar (body and head), 3D motion (skeleton and avatar), and audio modalities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of AIGC methods across different data modalities, including both single-modal and cross-modality methods, highlighting the various challenges, representative works, and recent technical directions in each setting. We also present comparative results on several benchmark datasets in various modalities. Moreover, we also discuss the challenges and potential future research directions.

- **Summary**: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to understand the neural mechanisms that enable specific behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging causality-based methods. While these approaches have identified neural circuits that copy spans of text, capture factual knowledge, and more, they remain unusable for multimodal models since adapting these tools to the vision-language domain requires considerable architectural changes. In this work, we adapt a unimodal causal tracing tool to BLIP to enable the study of the neural mechanisms underlying image-conditioned text generation. We demonstrate our approach on a visual question answering dataset, highlighting the causal relevance of later layer representations for all tokens. Furthermore, we release our BLIP causal tracing tool as open source to enable further experimentation in vision-language mechanistic interpretability by the community. Our code is available at https://github.com/vedantpalit/Towards-Vision-Language-Mechanistic-Interpretability.

- **Summary**: Score-based generative models have demonstrated highly promising results for medical image reconstruction tasks in magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. However, their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is still largely unexplored. PET image reconstruction involves a variety of challenges, including Poisson noise with high variance and a wide dynamic range. To address these challenges, we propose several PET-specific adaptations of score-based generative models. The proposed framework is developed for both 2D and 3D PET. In addition, we provide an extension to guided reconstruction using magnetic resonance images. We validate the approach through extensive 2D and 3D $\textit{in-silico}$ experiments with a model trained on patient-realistic data without lesions, and evaluate on data without lesions as well as out-of-distribution data with lesions. This demonstrates the proposed method's robustness and significant potential for improved PET reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has shown remarkable progress in generating realistic images. However, in this paper, we take a step "backward" and address AIGC for the most rudimentary visual modality of human sketches. Our objective is on the creative nature of sketches, and that creative sketching should take the form of an interactive process. We further enable text to drive the sketch ideation process, allowing creativity to be freely defined, while simultaneously tackling the challenge of "I can't sketch". We present a method to generate controlled sketches using a text-conditioned diffusion model trained on pixel representations of images. Our proposed approach, referred to as SketchDreamer, integrates a differentiable rasteriser of Bezier curves that optimises an initial input to distil abstract semantic knowledge from a pretrained diffusion model. We utilise Score Distillation Sampling to learn a sketch that aligns with a given caption, which importantly enable both text and sketch to interact with the ideation process. Our objective is to empower non-professional users to create sketches and, through a series of optimisation processes, transform a narrative into a storyboard by expanding the text prompt while making minor adjustments to the sketch input. Through this work, we hope to aspire the way we create visual content, democratise the creative process, and inspire further research in enhancing human creativity in AIGC.

- **Summary**: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment, requires early detection and treatment. Developing robust AI models for DR classification holds substantial potential, but a key challenge is ensuring their generalization in unfamiliar domains with varying data distributions. To address this, our paper investigates cross-domain generalization, also known as domain generalization (DG), within the context of DR classification. DG, a challenging problem in the medical domain, is complicated by the difficulty of gathering labeled data across different domains, such as patient demographics and disease stages. Some recent studies have shown the effectiveness of using CLIP to handle the DG problem in natural images. In this study, we investigate CLIP's transfer learning capabilities and its potential for cross-domain generalization in diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification. We carry out comprehensive experiments to assess the efficacy and potential of CLIP in addressing DG for DR classification. Further, we introduce a multi-modal fine-tuning strategy named Context Optimization with Learnable Visual Tokens (CoOpLVT), which enhances context optimization by conditioning on visual features. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method increases the F1-score by 1.8% over the baseline, thus underlining its promise for effective DG in DR classification.

- **Summary**: Despite recent medical advancements, breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadly diseases among women. Although machine learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have shown potential to assist radiologists in analyzing medical images, the opaque nature of the best-performing CAD systems has raised concerns about their trustworthiness and interpretability. This paper proposes MT-BI-RADS, a novel explainable deep learning approach for tumor detection in Breast Ultrasound (BUS) images. The approach offers three levels of explanations to enable radiologists to comprehend the decision-making process in predicting tumor malignancy. Firstly, the proposed model outputs the BI-RADS categories used for BUS image analysis by radiologists. Secondly, the model employs multi-task learning to concurrently segment regions in images that correspond to tumors. Thirdly, the proposed approach outputs quantified contributions of each BI-RADS descriptor toward predicting the benign or malignant class using post-hoc explanations with Shapley Values.

- **Summary**: Shadows often occur when we capture the documents with casual equipment, which influences the visual quality and readability of the digital copies. Different from the algorithms for natural shadow removal, the algorithms in document shadow removal need to preserve the details of fonts and figures in high-resolution input. Previous works ignore this problem and remove the shadows via approximate attention and small datasets, which might not work in real-world situations. We handle high-resolution document shadow removal directly via a larger-scale real-world dataset and a carefully designed frequency-aware network. As for the dataset, we acquire over 7k couples of high-resolution (2462 x 3699) images of real-world document pairs with various samples under different lighting circumstances, which is 10 times larger than existing datasets. As for the design of the network, we decouple the high-resolution images in the frequency domain, where the low-frequency details and high-frequency boundaries can be effectively learned via the carefully designed network structure. Powered by our network and dataset, the proposed method clearly shows a better performance than previous methods in terms of visual quality and numerical results.

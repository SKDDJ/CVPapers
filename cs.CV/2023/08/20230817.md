- **Summary**: We introduce a learning-based depth map fusion framework that accepts a set of depth and confidence maps generated by a Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithm as input and improves them. This is accomplished by integrating volumetric visibility constraints that encode long-range surface relationships across different views into an end-to-end trainable architecture. We also introduce a depth search window estimation sub-network trained jointly with the larger fusion sub-network to reduce the depth hypothesis search space along each ray. Our method learns to model depth consensus and violations of visibility constraints directly from the data; effectively removing the necessity of fine-tuning fusion parameters. Extensive experiments on MVS datasets show substantial improvements in the accuracy of the output fused depth and confidence maps.

- **Summary**: Real-time video analytics on edge devices for changing scenes remains a difficult task. As edge devices are usually resource-constrained, edge deep neural networks (DNNs) have fewer weights and shallower architectures than general DNNs. As a result, they only perform well in limited scenarios and are sensitive to data drift. In this paper, we introduce EdgeMA, a practical and efficient video analytics system designed to adapt models to shifts in real-world video streams over time, addressing the data drift problem. EdgeMA extracts the gray level co-occurrence matrix based statistical texture feature and uses the Random Forest classifier to detect the domain shift. Moreover, we have incorporated a method of model adaptation based on importance weighting, specifically designed to update models to cope with the label distribution shift. Through rigorous evaluation of EdgeMA on a real-world dataset, our results illustrate that EdgeMA significantly improves inference accuracy.

- **Summary**: Thriving underwater applications demand efficient extreme compression technology to realize the transmission of underwater images (UWIs) in very narrow underwater bandwidth. However, existing image compression methods achieve inferior performance on UWIs because they do not consider the characteristics of UWIs: (1) Multifarious underwater styles of color shift and distance-dependent clarity, caused by the unique underwater physical imaging; (2) Massive redundancy between different UWIs, caused by the fact that different UWIs contain several common ocean objects, which have plenty of similarities in structures and semantics. To remove redundancy among UWIs, we first construct an exhaustive underwater multi-scale feature dictionary to provide coarse-to-fine reference features for UWI compression. Subsequently, an extreme UWI compression network with reference to the feature dictionary (RFD-ECNet) is creatively proposed, which utilizes feature match and reference feature variant to significantly remove redundancy among UWIs. To align the multifarious underwater styles and improve the accuracy of feature match, an underwater style normalized block (USNB) is proposed, which utilizes underwater physical priors extracted from the underwater physical imaging model to normalize the underwater styles of dictionary features toward the input. Moreover, a reference feature variant module (RFVM) is designed to adaptively morph the reference features, improving the similarity between the reference and input features. Experimental results on four UWI datasets show that our RFD-ECNet is the first work that achieves a significant BD-rate saving of 31% over the most advanced VVC.

- **Summary**: Learned image compression methods have shown superior rate-distortion performance and remarkable potential compared to traditional compression methods. Most existing learned approaches use stacked convolution or window-based self-attention for transform coding, which aggregate spatial information in a fixed range. In this paper, we focus on extending spatial aggregation capability and propose a dynamic kernel-based transform coding. The proposed adaptive aggregation generates kernel offsets to capture valid information in the content-conditioned range to help transform. With the adaptive aggregation strategy and the sharing weights mechanism, our method can achieve promising transform capability with acceptable model complexity. Besides, according to the recent progress of entropy model, we define a generalized coarse-to-fine entropy model, considering the coarse global context, the channel-wise, and the spatial context. Based on it, we introduce dynamic kernel in hyper-prior to generate more expressive global context. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric spatial-channel entropy model according to the investigation of the spatial characteristics of the grouped latents. The asymmetric entropy model aims to reduce statistical redundancy while maintaining coding efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance on three benchmarks compared to the state-of-the-art learning-based methods.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, transformer networks have demonstrated superior performance in many computer vision tasks. In a multi-view 3D reconstruction algorithm following this paradigm, self-attention processing has to deal with intricate image tokens including massive information when facing heavy amounts of view input. The curse of information content leads to the extreme difficulty of model learning. To alleviate this problem, recent methods compress the token number representing each view or discard the attention operations between the tokens from different views. Obviously, they give a negative impact on performance. Therefore, we propose long-range grouping attention (LGA) based on the divide-and-conquer principle. Tokens from all views are grouped for separate attention operations. The tokens in each group are sampled from all views and can provide macro representation for the resided view. The richness of feature learning is guaranteed by the diversity among different groups. An effective and efficient encoder can be established which connects inter-view features using LGA and extract intra-view features using the standard self-attention layer. Moreover, a novel progressive upsampling decoder is also designed for voxel generation with relatively high resolution. Hinging on the above, we construct a powerful transformer-based network, called LRGT. Experimental results on ShapeNet verify our method achieves SOTA accuracy in multi-view reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed the remarkable performance of diffusion models in various vision tasks. However, for image restoration that aims to recover clear images with sharper details from given degraded observations, diffusion-based methods may fail to recover promising results due to inaccurate noise estimation. Moreover, simple constraining noises cannot effectively learn complex degradation information, which subsequently hinders the model capacity. To solve the above problems, we propose a coarse-to-fine diffusion Transformer (C2F-DFT) for image restoration. Specifically, our C2F-DFT contains diffusion self-attention (DFSA) and diffusion feed-forward network (DFN) within a new coarse-to-fine training scheme. The DFSA and DFN respectively capture the long-range diffusion dependencies and learn hierarchy diffusion representation to facilitate better restoration. In the coarse training stage, our C2F-DFT estimates noises and then generates the final clean image by a sampling algorithm. To further improve the restoration quality, we propose a simple yet effective fine training scheme. It first exploits the coarse-trained diffusion model with fixed steps to generate restoration results, which then would be constrained with corresponding ground-truth ones to optimize the models to remedy the unsatisfactory results affected by inaccurate noise estimation. Extensive experiments show that C2F-DFT significantly outperforms diffusion-based restoration method IR-SDE and achieves competitive performance compared with Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods on $3$ tasks, including deraining, deblurring, and real denoising.

- **Summary**: Endoscopy plays a major role in identifying any underlying abnormalities within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are multiple GI tract diseases that are life-threatening, such as precancerous lesions and other intestinal cancers. In the usual process, a diagnosis is made by a medical expert which can be prone to human errors and the accuracy of the test is also entirely dependent on the expert's level of experience. Deep learning, specifically Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) which are designed to perform automatic feature learning without any prior feature engineering, has recently reported great benefits for GI endoscopy image analysis. Previous research has developed models that focus only on improving performance, as such, the majority of introduced models contain complex deep network architectures with a large number of parameters that require longer training times. However, there is a lack of focus on developing lightweight models which can run in low-resource environments, which are typically encountered in medical clinics. We investigate three KD-based learning frameworks, response-based, feature-based, and relation-based mechanisms, and introduce a novel multi-head attention-based feature fusion mechanism to support relation-based learning. Compared to the existing relation-based methods that follow simplistic aggregation techniques of multi-teacher response/feature-based knowledge, we adopt the multi-head attention technique to provide flexibility towards localising and transferring important details from each teacher to better guide the student. We perform extensive evaluations on two widely used public datasets, KVASIR-V2 and Hyper-KVASIR, and our experimental results signify the merits of our proposed relation-based framework in achieving an improved lightweight model (only 51.8k trainable parameters) that can run in a resource-limited environment.

- **Summary**: In this study, we present a computational framework tailored for the precise detection and comprehensive analysis of nanoparticles within scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The primary objective of this framework revolves around the accurate localization of nanoparticle coordinates, accompanied by secondary objectives encompassing the extraction of pertinent morphological attributes including area, orientation, brightness, and length.   Constructed leveraging the robust image processing capabilities of Python, particularly harnessing libraries such as OpenCV, SciPy, and Scikit-Image, the framework employs an amalgamation of techniques, including thresholding, dilating, and eroding, to enhance the fidelity of image processing outcomes.   The ensuing nanoparticle data is seamlessly integrated into the RStudio environment to facilitate meticulous post-processing analysis. This encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of model accuracy, discernment of feature distribution patterns, and the identification of intricate particle arrangements. The finalized framework exhibits high nanoparticle identification within the primary sample image and boasts 97\% accuracy in detecting particles across five distinct test images drawn from a SEM nanoparticle dataset. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates the capability to discern nanoparticles of faint intensity, eluding manual labeling within the control group.

- **Summary**: We introduce MIPS-Fusion, a robust and scalable online RGB-D reconstruction method based on a novel neural implicit representation -- multi-implicit-submap. Different from existing neural RGB-D reconstruction methods lacking either flexibility with a single neural map or scalability due to extra storage of feature grids, we propose a pure neural representation tackling both difficulties with a divide-and-conquer design. In our method, neural submaps are incrementally allocated alongside the scanning trajectory and efficiently learned with local neural bundle adjustments. The submaps can be refined individually in a back-end optimization and optimized jointly to realize submap-level loop closure. Meanwhile, we propose a hybrid tracking approach combining randomized and gradient-based pose optimizations. For the first time, randomized optimization is made possible in neural tracking with several key designs to the learning process, enabling efficient and robust tracking even under fast camera motions. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our method attains higher reconstruction quality than the state of the arts for large-scale scenes and under fast camera motions.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful foundation model that has revolutionised image segmentation. To apply SAM to surgical instrument segmentation, a common approach is to locate precise points or boxes of instruments and then use them as prompts for SAM in a zero-shot manner. However, we observe two problems with this naive pipeline: (1) the domain gap between natural objects and surgical instruments leads to poor generalisation of SAM; and (2) SAM relies on precise point or box locations for accurate segmentation, requiring either extensive manual guidance or a well-performing specialist detector for prompt preparation, which leads to a complex multi-stage pipeline. To address these problems, we introduce SurgicalSAM, a novel end-to-end efficient-tuning approach for SAM to effectively integrate surgical-specific information with SAM's pre-trained knowledge for improved generalisation. Specifically, we propose a lightweight prototype-based class prompt encoder for tuning, which directly generates prompt embeddings from class prototypes and eliminates the use of explicit prompts for improved robustness and a simpler pipeline. In addition, to address the low inter-class variance among surgical instrument categories, we propose contrastive prototype learning, further enhancing the discrimination of the class prototypes for more accurate class prompting. The results of extensive experiments on both EndoVis2018 and EndoVis2017 datasets demonstrate that SurgicalSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance while only requiring a small number of tunable parameters.

- **Summary**: Tracking 3D objects is an important task in autonomous driving. Classical Kalman Filtering based methods are still the most popular solutions. However, these methods require handcrafted designs in motion modeling and can not benefit from the growing data amounts. In this paper, Box Only Transformer Tracker (BOTT) is proposed to learn to link 3D boxes of the same object from the different frames, by taking all the 3D boxes in a time window as input. Specifically, transformer self-attention is applied to exchange information between all the boxes to learn global-informative box embeddings. The similarity between these learned embeddings can be used to link the boxes of the same object. BOTT can be used for both online and offline tracking modes seamlessly. Its simplicity enables us to significantly reduce engineering efforts required by traditional Kalman Filtering based methods. Experiments show BOTT achieves competitive performance on two largest 3D MOT benchmarks: 69.9 and 66.7 AMOTA on nuScenes validation and test splits, respectively, 56.45 and 59.57 MOTA L2 on Waymo Open Dataset validation and test splits, respectively. This work suggests that tracking 3D objects by learning features directly from 3D boxes using transformers is a simple yet effective way.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on the recently popular task of point cloud completion guided by multimodal information. Although existing methods have achieved excellent performance by fusing auxiliary images, there are still some deficiencies, including the poor generalization ability of the model and insufficient fine-grained semantic information for extracted features. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal fusion network for point cloud completion, which can simultaneously fuse visual and textual information to predict the semantic and geometric characteristics of incomplete shapes effectively. Specifically, to overcome the lack of prior information caused by the small-scale dataset, we employ a pre-trained vision-language model that is trained with a large amount of image-text pairs. Therefore, the textual and visual encoders of this large-scale model have stronger generalization ability. Then, we propose a multi-stage feature fusion strategy to fuse the textual and visual features into the backbone network progressively. Meanwhile, to further explore the effectiveness of fine-grained text descriptions for point cloud completion, we also build a text corpus with fine-grained descriptions, which can provide richer geometric details for 3D shapes. The rich text descriptions can be used for training and evaluating our network. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art point cloud completion networks.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction with uncertainty is a critical and challenging task for autonomous driving. Nowadays, we can easily access sensor data represented in multiple views. However, cross-view consistency has not been evaluated by the existing models, which might lead to divergences between the multimodal predictions from different views. It is not practical and effective when the network does not comprehend the 3D scene, which could cause the downstream module in a dilemma. Instead, we predicts multimodal trajectories while maintaining cross-view consistency. We presented a cross-view trajectory prediction method using shared 3D Queries (XVTP3D). We employ a set of 3D queries shared across views to generate multi-goals that are cross-view consistent. We also proposed a random mask method and coarse-to-fine cross-attention to capture robust cross-view features. As far as we know, this is the first work that introduces the outstanding top-down paradigm in BEV detection field to a trajectory prediction problem. The results of experiments on two publicly available datasets show that XVTP3D achieved state-of-the-art performance with consistent cross-view predictions.

- **Summary**: 3D scene understanding has gained significant attention due to its wide range of applications. However, existing methods for 3D scene understanding are limited to specific downstream tasks, which hinders their practicality in real-world applications. This paper presents Chat-3D, which combines the 3D visual perceptual ability of pre-trained 3D representations and the impressive reasoning and conversation capabilities of advanced LLMs to achieve the first universal dialogue systems for 3D scenes. Specifically, we align 3D representations into the feature space of LLMs, thus enabling LLMs to perceive the 3D world. Given the scarcity of 3D scene-text data, we propose a three-stage training strategy to efficiently utilize the available data for better alignment. To enhance the reasoning ability and develop a user-friendly interaction scheme, we further construct a high-quality object-centric 3D instruction dataset and design an associated object-centric prompt. Our experiments show that Chat-3D achieves an impressive ability to comprehend diverse instructions for 3D scenes, engage in intricate spatial reasoning, and incorporate external knowledge into its responses. Chat-3D achieves a 75.6% relative score compared with GPT-4 on the constructed instruction dataset.



### URL: Combating Label Noise for Lung Nodule Malignancy Grading

- **Summary**: Due to the complexity of annotation and inter-annotator variability, most lung nodule malignancy grading datasets contain label noise, which inevitably degrades the performance and generalizability of models. Although researchers adopt the label-noise-robust methods to handle label noise for lung nodule malignancy grading, they do not consider the inherent ordinal relation among classes of this task. To model the ordinal relation among classes to facilitate tackling label noise in this task, we propose a Unimodal-Regularized Label-noise-tolerant (URL) framework. Our URL contains two stages, the Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) stage and the Memory pseudo-labels generation and Unimodal regularization (MU) stage. In the SCL stage, we select reliable samples and adopt supervised contrastive learning to learn better representations. In the MU stage, we split samples with multiple annotations into multiple samples with a single annotation and shuffle them into different batches. To handle label noise, pseudo-labels are generated using the similarity between each sample and the central feature of each class, and temporal ensembling is used to obtain memory pseudo-labels that supervise the model training. To model the ordinal relation, we introduce unimodal regularization to keep the ordinal relation among classes in the predictions. Moreover, each lung nodule is characterized by three orthographic views. Experiments conducted on the LIDC-IDRI dataset indicate the superiority of our URL over other competing methods.

- **Summary**: Sensor fusion is critical to perception systems for task domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recently, the Transformer integrated with CNN has demonstrated high performance in sensor fusion for various perception tasks. In this work, we introduce a method for fusing data from camera and LiDAR. By employing Transformer modules at multiple resolutions, proposed method effectively combines local and global contextual relationships. The performance of the proposed method is validated by extensive experiments with two adversarial benchmarks with lengthy routes and high-density traffics. The proposed method outperforms previous approaches with the most challenging benchmarks, achieving significantly higher driving and infraction scores. Compared with TransFuser, it achieves 8% and 19% improvement in driving scores for the Longest6 and Town05 Long benchmarks, respectively.

- **Summary**: We aim at incorporating explicit shape information into current 3D organ segmentation models. Different from previous works, we formulate shape learning as an in-painting task, which is named Masked Label Mask Modeling (MLM). Through MLM, learnable mask tokens are fed into transformer blocks to complete the label mask of organ. To transfer MLM shape knowledge to target, we further propose a novel shape-aware self-distillation with both in-painting reconstruction loss and pseudo loss. Extensive experiments on five public organ segmentation datasets show consistent improvements over prior arts with at least 1.2 points gain in the Dice score, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in challenging unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios including: (1) In-domain organ segmentation; (2) Unseen domain segmentation and (3) Unseen organ segmentation. We hope this work will advance shape analysis and geometric learning in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Neural networks are often trained with empirical risk minimization; however, it has been shown that a shift between training and testing distributions can cause unpredictable performance degradation. On this issue, a research direction, invariant learning, has been proposed to extract invariant features insensitive to the distributional changes. This work proposes EDNIL, an invariant learning framework containing a multi-head neural network to absorb data biases. We show that this framework does not require prior knowledge about environments or strong assumptions about the pre-trained model. We also reveal that the proposed algorithm has theoretical connections to recent studies discussing properties of variant and invariant features. Finally, we demonstrate that models trained with EDNIL are empirically more robust against distributional shifts.

- **Summary**: Human gender classification based on biometric features is a major concern for computer vision due to its vast variety of applications. The human ear is popular among researchers as a soft biometric trait, because it is less affected by age or changing circumstances, and is non-intrusive. In this study, we have developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for automatic gender classification using the samples of ear images. The performance is evaluated using four cutting-edge pre-trained CNN models. In terms of trainable parameters, the proposed technique requires significantly less computational complexity. The proposed model has achieved 93% accuracy on the EarVN1.0 ear dataset.

- **Summary**: Text recognition methods are gaining rapid development. Some advanced techniques, e.g., powerful modules, language models, and un- and semi-supervised learning schemes, consecutively push the performance on public benchmarks forward. However, the problem of how to better optimize a text recognition model from the perspective of loss functions is largely overlooked. CTC-based methods, widely used in practice due to their good balance between performance and inference speed, still grapple with accuracy degradation. This is because CTC loss emphasizes the optimization of the entire sequence target while neglecting to learn individual characters. We propose a self-distillation scheme for CTC-based model to address this issue. It incorporates a framewise regularization term in CTC loss to emphasize individual supervision, and leverages the maximizing-a-posteriori of latent alignment to solve the inconsistency problem that arises in distillation between CTC-based models. We refer to the regularized CTC loss as Distillation Connectionist Temporal Classification (DCTC) loss. DCTC loss is module-free, requiring no extra parameters, longer inference lag, or additional training data or phases. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DCTC can boost text recognition model accuracy by up to 2.6%, without any of these drawbacks.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model to the target domain in a batch-by-batch manner during inference. While label distributions often exhibit imbalances in real-world scenarios, most previous TTA approaches typically assume that both source and target domain datasets have balanced label distribution. Due to the fact that certain classes appear more frequently in certain domains (e.g., buildings in cities, trees in forests), it is natural that the label distribution shifts as the domain changes. However, we discover that the majority of existing TTA methods fail to address the coexistence of covariate and label shifts. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel label shift adapter that can be incorporated into existing TTA approaches to deal with label shifts during the TTA process effectively. Specifically, we estimate the label distribution of the target domain to feed it into the label shift adapter. Subsequently, the label shift adapter produces optimal parameters for the target label distribution. By predicting only the parameters for a part of the pre-trained source model, our approach is computationally efficient and can be easily applied, regardless of the model architectures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that integrating our strategy with TTA approaches leads to substantial performance improvements under the joint presence of label and covariate shifts.

- **Summary**: Single-image 3D reconstruction is a research challenge focused on predicting 3D object shapes from single-view images. This task requires significant data acquisition to predict both visible and occluded portions of the shape. Furthermore, learning-based methods face the difficulty of creating a comprehensive training dataset for all possible classes. To this end, we propose a continual learning-based 3D reconstruction method where our goal is to design a model using Variational Priors that can still reconstruct the previously seen classes reasonably even after training on new classes. Variational Priors represent abstract shapes and combat forgetting, whereas saliency maps preserve object attributes with less memory usage. This is vital due to resource constraints in storing extensive training data. Additionally, we introduce saliency map-based experience replay to capture global and distinct object features. Thorough experiments show competitive results compared to established methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Blind Super-Resolution (SR) usually involves two sub-problems: 1) estimating the degradation of the given low-resolution (LR) image; 2) super-resolving the LR image to its high-resolution (HR) counterpart. Both problems are ill-posed due to the information loss in the degrading process. Most previous methods try to solve the two problems independently, but often fall into a dilemma: a good super-resolved HR result requires an accurate degradation estimation, which however, is difficult to be obtained without the help of original HR information. To address this issue, instead of considering these two problems independently, we adopt an alternating optimization algorithm, which can estimate the degradation and restore the SR image in a single model. Specifically, we design two convolutional neural modules, namely \textit{Restorer} and \textit{Estimator}. \textit{Restorer} restores the SR image based on the estimated degradation, and \textit{Estimator} estimates the degradation with the help of the restored SR image. We alternate these two modules repeatedly and unfold this process to form an end-to-end trainable network. In this way, both \textit{Restorer} and \textit{Estimator} could get benefited from the intermediate results of each other, and make each sub-problem easier. Moreover, \textit{Restorer} and \textit{Estimator} are optimized in an end-to-end manner, thus they could get more tolerant of the estimation deviations of each other and cooperate better to achieve more robust and accurate final results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world images show that the proposed method can largely outperform state-of-the-art methods and produce more visually favorable results.

- **Summary**: Learning from label proportions (LLP) is a promising weakly supervised learning problem. In LLP, a set of instances (bag) has label proportions, but no instance-level labels are given. LLP aims to train an instance-level classifier by using the label proportions of the bag. In this paper, we propose a bag-level data augmentation method for LLP called MixBag, based on the key observation from our preliminary experiments; that the instance-level classification accuracy improves as the number of labeled bags increases even though the total number of instances is fixed. We also propose a confidence interval loss designed based on statistical theory to use the augmented bags effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose bag-level data augmentation for LLP. The advantage of MixBag is that it can be applied to instance-level data augmentation techniques and any LLP method that uses the proportion loss. Experimental results demonstrate this advantage and the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and social robots require fast computation and accurate probability density estimation on trajectory prediction. To address both requirements, this paper presents a new normalizing flow-based trajectory prediction model named FlowChain. FlowChain is a stack of conditional continuously-indexed flows (CIFs) that are expressive and allow analytical probability density computation. This analytical computation is faster than the generative models that need additional approximations such as kernel density estimation. Moreover, FlowChain is more accurate than the Gaussian mixture-based models due to fewer assumptions on the estimated density. FlowChain also allows a rapid update of estimated probability densities. This update is achieved by adopting the \textit{newest observed position} and reusing the flow transformations and its log-det-jacobians that represent the \textit{motion trend}. This update is completed in less than one millisecond because this reuse greatly omits the computational cost. Experimental results showed our FlowChain achieved state-of-the-art trajectory prediction accuracy compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our FlowChain demonstrated superiority in the accuracy and speed of density estimation. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/meaten/FlowChain-ICCV2023}

- **Summary**: Motion-resolved reconstruction for abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a challenge due to the trade-off between residual motion blurring caused by discretized motion states and undersampling artefacts. In this work, we propose to generate blurring-free motion-resolved abdominal reconstructions by learning a neural implicit representation directly in k-space (NIK). Using measured sampling points and a data-derived respiratory navigator signal, we train a network to generate continuous signal values. To aid the regularization of sparsely sampled regions, we introduce an additional informed correction layer (ICo), which leverages information from neighboring regions to correct NIK's prediction. Our proposed generative reconstruction methods, NIK and ICoNIK, outperform standard motion-resolved reconstruction techniques and provide a promising solution to address motion artefacts in abdominal MRI.

- **Summary**: Body language (BL) refers to the non-verbal communication expressed through physical movements, gestures, facial expressions, and postures. It is a form of communication that conveys information, emotions, attitudes, and intentions without the use of spoken or written words. It plays a crucial role in interpersonal interactions and can complement or even override verbal communication. Deep multi-modal learning techniques have shown promise in understanding and analyzing these diverse aspects of BL. The survey emphasizes their applications to BL generation and recognition. Several common BLs are considered i.e., Sign Language (SL), Cued Speech (CS), Co-speech (CoS), and Talking Head (TH), and we have conducted an analysis and established the connections among these four BL for the first time. Their generation and recognition often involve multi-modal approaches. Benchmark datasets for BL research are well collected and organized, along with the evaluation of SOTA methods on these datasets. The survey highlights challenges such as limited labeled data, multi-modal learning, and the need for domain adaptation to generalize models to unseen speakers or languages. Future research directions are presented, including exploring self-supervised learning techniques, integrating contextual information from other modalities, and exploiting large-scale pre-trained multi-modal models. In summary, this survey paper provides a comprehensive understanding of deep multi-modal learning for various BL generations and recognitions for the first time. By analyzing advancements, challenges, and future directions, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in advancing this field. n addition, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for deep multi-modal learning for BL recognition and generation: https://github.com/wentaoL86/awesome-body-language.

- **Summary**: Clinical classification of chest radiography is particularly challenging for standard machine learning algorithms due to its inherent long-tailed and multi-label nature. However, few attempts take into account the coupled challenges posed by both the class imbalance and label co-occurrence, which hinders their value to boost the diagnosis on chest X-rays (CXRs) in the real-world scenarios. Besides, with the prevalence of pretraining techniques, how to incorporate these new paradigms into the current framework lacks of the systematical study. This technical report presents a brief description of our solution in the ICCV CVAMD 2023 CXR-LT Competition. We empirically explored the effectiveness for CXR diagnosis with the integration of several advanced designs about data augmentation, feature extractor, classifier design, loss function reweighting, exogenous data replenishment, etc. In addition, we improve the performance through simple test-time data augmentation and ensemble. Our framework finally achieves 0.349 mAP on the competition test set, ranking in the top five.

- **Summary**: We present Le-RNR-Map, a Language-enhanced Renderable Neural Radiance map for Visual Navigation with natural language query prompts. The recently proposed RNR-Map employs a grid structure comprising latent codes positioned at each pixel. These latent codes, which are derived from image observation, enable: i) image rendering given a camera pose, since they are converted to Neural Radiance Field; ii) image navigation and localization with astonishing accuracy. On top of this, we enhance RNR-Map with CLIP-based embedding latent codes, allowing natural language search without additional label data. We evaluate the effectiveness of this map in single and multi-object searches. We also investigate its compatibility with a Large Language Model as an "affordance query resolver".

- **Summary**: To bridge the physical and virtual worlds for rapidly developed VR/AR applications, the ability to realistically drive 3D full-body avatars is of great significance. Although real-time body tracking with only the head-mounted displays (HMDs) and hand controllers is heavily under-constrained, a carefully designed end-to-end neural network is of great potential to solve the problem by learning from large-scale motion data. To this end, we propose a two-stage framework that can obtain accurate and smooth full-body motions with the three tracking signals of head and hands only. Our framework explicitly models the joint-level features in the first stage and utilizes them as spatiotemporal tokens for alternating spatial and temporal transformer blocks to capture joint-level correlations in the second stage. Furthermore, we design a set of loss terms to constrain the task of a high degree of freedom, such that we can exploit the potential of our joint-level modeling. With extensive experiments on the AMASS motion dataset and real-captured data, we validate the effectiveness of our designs and show our proposed method can achieve more accurate and smooth motion compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework for RGB-based category-level 6D object pose and size estimation. Our approach relies on the prediction of normalized object coordinate space (NOCS), which serves as an efficient and effective object canonical representation that can be extracted from RGB images. Unlike previous approaches that heavily relied on additional depth readings as input, our novelty lies in leveraging multi-view information, which is commonly available in practical scenarios where a moving camera continuously observes the environment. By introducing multi-view constraints, we can obtain accurate camera pose and depth estimation from a monocular dense SLAM framework. Additionally, by incorporating constraints on the camera relative pose, we can apply trimming strategies and robust pose averaging on the multi-view object poses, resulting in more accurate and robust estimations of category-level object poses even in the absence of direct depth readings. Furthermore, we introduce a novel NOCS prediction network that significantly improves performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of our proposed method, even comparable to state-of-the-art RGB-D methods across public dataset sequences. Additionally, we showcase the generalization ability of our method by evaluating it on self-collected datasets.

- **Summary**: Realistic virtual humans play a crucial role in numerous industries, such as metaverse, intelligent healthcare, and self-driving simulation. But creating them on a large scale with high levels of realism remains a challenge. The utilization of deep implicit function sparks a new era of image-based 3D clothed human reconstruction, enabling pixel-aligned shape recovery with fine details. Subsequently, the vast majority of works locate the surface by regressing the deterministic implicit value for each point. However, should all points be treated equally regardless of their proximity to the surface? In this paper, we propose replacing the implicit value with an adaptive uncertainty distribution, to differentiate between points based on their distance to the surface. This simple ``value to distribution'' transition yields significant improvements on nearly all the baselines. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate that the models trained using our uncertainty distribution loss, can capture more intricate wrinkles, and realistic limbs.

- **Summary**: Cycle consistency has long been exploited as a powerful prior for jointly optimizing maps within a collection of shapes. In this paper, we investigate its utility in the approaches of Deep Functional Maps, which are considered state-of-the-art in non-rigid shape matching. We first justify that under certain conditions, the learned maps, when represented in the spectral domain, are already cycle consistent. Furthermore, we identify the discrepancy that spectrally consistent maps are not necessarily spatially, or point-wise, consistent. In light of this, we present a novel design of unsupervised Deep Functional Maps, which effectively enforces the harmony of learned maps under the spectral and the point-wise representation. By taking advantage of cycle consistency, our framework produces state-of-the-art results in mapping shapes even under significant distortions. Beyond that, by independently estimating maps in both spectral and spatial domains, our method naturally alleviates over-fitting in network training, yielding superior generalization performance and accuracy within an array of challenging tests for both near-isometric and non-isometric datasets.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) tackles the label missing problem by enabling the effective usage of unlabeled data. While existing SSL methods focus on the traditional setting, a practical and challenging scenario called label Missing Not At Random (MNAR) is usually ignored. In MNAR, the labeled and unlabeled data fall into different class distributions resulting in biased label imputation, which deteriorates the performance of SSL models. In this work, class transition tracking based Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) is devised for MNAR. We explore the class-level guidance information obtained by the Markov random walk, which is modeled on a dynamically created graph built over the class tracking matrix. PRG unifies the historical information of class distribution and class transitions caused by the pseudo-rectifying procedure to maintain the model's unbiased enthusiasm towards assigning pseudo-labels to all classes, so as the quality of pseudo-labels on both popular classes and rare classes in MNAR could be improved. Finally, we show the superior performance of PRG across a variety of MNAR scenarios, outperforming the latest SSL approaches combining bias removal solutions by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Visual storytelling aims to generate a narrative based on a sequence of images, necessitating both vision-language alignment and coherent story generation. Most existing solutions predominantly depend on paired image-text training data, which can be costly to collect and challenging to scale. To address this, we formulate visual storytelling as a visual-conditioned story generation problem and propose a text-only training method that separates the learning of cross-modality alignment and story generation. Our approach specifically leverages the cross-modality pre-trained CLIP model to integrate visual control into a story generator, trained exclusively on text data. Moreover, we devise a training-free visual condition planner that accounts for the temporal structure of the input image sequence while balancing global and local visual content. The distinctive advantage of requiring only text data for training enables our method to learn from external text story data, enhancing the generalization capability of visual storytelling. We conduct extensive experiments on the VIST benchmark, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.

- **Summary**: Due to the prevalence of scale variance in nature images, we propose to use image scale as a self-supervised signal for Masked Image Modeling (MIM). Our method involves selecting random patches from the input image and downsampling them to a low-resolution format. Our framework utilizes the latest advances in super-resolution (SR) to design the prediction head, which reconstructs the input from low-resolution clues and other patches. After 400 epochs of pre-training, our Super Resolution Masked Autoencoders (SRMAE) get an accuracy of 82.1% on the ImageNet-1K task. Image scale signal also allows our SRMAE to capture scale invariance representation. For the very low resolution (VLR) recognition task, our model achieves the best performance, surpassing DeriveNet by 1.3%. Our method also achieves an accuracy of 74.84% on the task of recognizing low-resolution facial expressions, surpassing the current state-of-the-art FMD by 9.48%.

- **Summary**: In this work, we focus on the task of procedure planning from instructional videos with text supervision, where a model aims to predict an action sequence to transform the initial visual state into the goal visual state. A critical challenge of this task is the large semantic gap between observed visual states and unobserved intermediate actions, which is ignored by previous works. Specifically, this semantic gap refers to that the contents in the observed visual states are semantically different from the elements of some action text labels in a procedure. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose a novel event-guided paradigm, which first infers events from the observed states and then plans out actions based on both the states and predicted events. Our inspiration comes from that planning a procedure from an instructional video is to complete a specific event and a specific event usually involves specific actions. Based on the proposed paradigm, we contribute an Event-guided Prompting-based Procedure Planning (E3P) model, which encodes event information into the sequential modeling process to support procedure planning. To further consider the strong action associations within each event, our E3P adopts a mask-and-predict approach for relation mining, incorporating a probabilistic masking scheme for regularization. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to learn a domain-generalizable (DG) person re-identification (ReID) representation from large-scale videos \textbf{without any annotation}. Prior DG ReID methods employ limited labeled data for training due to the high cost of annotation, which restricts further advances. To overcome the barriers of data and annotation, we propose to utilize large-scale unsupervised data for training. The key issue lies in how to mine identity information. To this end, we propose an Identity-seeking Self-supervised Representation learning (ISR) method. ISR constructs positive pairs from inter-frame images by modeling the instance association as a maximum-weight bipartite matching problem. A reliability-guided contrastive loss is further presented to suppress the adverse impact of noisy positive pairs, ensuring that reliable positive pairs dominate the learning process. The training cost of ISR scales approximately linearly with the data size, making it feasible to utilize large-scale data for training. The learned representation exhibits superior generalization ability. \textbf{Without human annotation and fine-tuning, ISR achieves 87.0\% Rank-1 on Market-1501 and 56.4\% Rank-1 on MSMT17}, outperforming the best supervised domain-generalizable method by 5.0\% and 19.5\%, respectively. In the pre-training$\rightarrow$fine-tuning scenario, ISR achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 88.4\% Rank-1 on MSMT17. The code is at \url{https://github.com/dcp15/ISR_ICCV2023_Oral}.

- **Summary**: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to accurately detect objects hidden in the surrounding environment. However, the existing COD methods mainly locate camouflaged objects in the RGB domain, their performance has not been fully exploited in many challenging scenarios. Considering that the features of the camouflaged object and the background are more discriminative in the frequency domain, we propose a novel learnable and separable frequency perception mechanism driven by the semantic hierarchy in the frequency domain. Our entire network adopts a two-stage model, including a frequency-guided coarse localization stage and a detail-preserving fine localization stage. With the multi-level features extracted by the backbone, we design a flexible frequency perception module based on octave convolution for coarse positioning. Then, we design the correction fusion module to step-by-step integrate the high-level features through the prior-guided correction and cross-layer feature channel association, and finally combine them with the shallow features to achieve the detailed correction of the camouflaged objects. Compared with the currently existing models, our proposed method achieves competitive performance in three popular benchmark datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of white-box false positive adversarial attacks on contrastive loss-based offline handwritten signature verification models. We propose a novel attack method that treats the attack as a style transfer between closely related but distinct writing styles. To guide the generation of deceptive images, we introduce two new loss functions that enhance the attack success rate by perturbing the Euclidean distance between the embedding vectors of the original and synthesized samples, while ensuring minimal perturbations by reducing the difference between the generated image and the original image. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in white-box attacks on contrastive loss-based offline handwritten signature verification models, as evidenced by our experiments. The key contributions of this paper include a novel false positive attack method, two new loss functions, effective style transfer in handwriting styles, and superior performance in white-box false positive attacks compared to other white-box attack methods.

- **Summary**: By integrating complementary information from RGB image and depth map, the ability of salient object detection (SOD) for complex and challenging scenes can be improved. In recent years, the important role of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in feature extraction and cross-modality interaction has been fully explored, but it is still insufficient in modeling global long-range dependencies of self-modality and cross-modality. To this end, we introduce CNNs-assisted Transformer architecture and propose a novel RGB-D SOD network with Point-aware Interaction and CNN-induced Refinement (PICR-Net). On the one hand, considering the prior correlation between RGB modality and depth modality, an attention-triggered cross-modality point-aware interaction (CmPI) module is designed to explore the feature interaction of different modalities with positional constraints. On the other hand, in order to alleviate the block effect and detail destruction problems brought by the Transformer naturally, we design a CNN-induced refinement (CNNR) unit for content refinement and supplementation. Extensive experiments on five RGB-D SOD datasets show that the proposed network achieves competitive results in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.

- **Summary**: Despite significant progress in shadow detection, current methods still struggle with the adverse impact of background color, which may lead to errors when shadows are present on complex backgrounds. Drawing inspiration from the human visual system, we treat the input shadow image as a composition of a background layer and a shadow layer, and design a Style-guided Dual-layer Disentanglement Network (SDDNet) to model these layers independently. To achieve this, we devise a Feature Separation and Recombination (FSR) module that decomposes multi-level features into shadow-related and background-related components by offering specialized supervision for each component, while preserving information integrity and avoiding redundancy through the reconstruction constraint. Moreover, we propose a Shadow Style Filter (SSF) module to guide the feature disentanglement by focusing on style differentiation and uniformization. With these two modules and our overall pipeline, our model effectively minimizes the detrimental effects of background color, yielding superior performance on three public datasets with a real-time inference speed of 32 FPS.

- **Summary**: An essential requirement for driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technology is implementing a robust system for detecting and recognizing traffic signs. This system enables the vehicle to autonomously analyze the environment and make appropriate decisions regarding its movement, even when operating at higher frame rates. However, traffic sign images captured in inadequate lighting and adverse weather conditions are poorly visible, blurred, faded, and damaged. Consequently, the recognition of traffic signs in such circumstances becomes inherently difficult. This paper addressed the challenges of recognizing traffic signs from images captured in low light, noise, and blurriness. To achieve this goal, a two-step methodology has been employed. The first step involves enhancing traffic sign images by applying a modified MIRNet model and producing enhanced images. In the second step, the Yolov4 model recognizes the traffic signs in an unconstrained environment. The proposed method has achieved 5.40% increment in mAP@0.5 for low quality images on Yolov4. The overall mAP@0.5 of 96.75% has been achieved on the GTSRB dataset. It has also attained mAP@0.5 of 100% on the GTSDB dataset for the broad categories, comparable with the state-of-the-art work.

- **Summary**: Exploring spatial-temporal dependencies from observed motions is one of the core challenges of human motion prediction. Previous methods mainly focus on dedicated network structures to model the spatial and temporal dependencies. This paper considers a new direction by introducing a model learning framework with auxiliary tasks. In our auxiliary tasks, partial body joints' coordinates are corrupted by either masking or adding noise and the goal is to recover corrupted coordinates depending on the rest coordinates. To work with auxiliary tasks, we propose a novel auxiliary-adapted transformer, which can handle incomplete, corrupted motion data and achieve coordinate recovery via capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Through auxiliary tasks, the auxiliary-adapted transformer is promoted to capture more comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies among body joints' coordinates, leading to better feature learning. Extensive experimental results have shown that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins of 7.2%, 3.7%, and 9.4% in terms of 3D mean per joint position error (MPJPE) on the Human3.6M, CMU Mocap, and 3DPW datasets, respectively. We also demonstrate that our method is more robust under data missing cases and noisy data cases. Code is available at https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/AuxFormer.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation and editing. We present a method to localize the desired edit region implicit in a text instruction. We leverage InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) and identify the discrepancy between IP2P predictions with and without the instruction. This discrepancy is referred to as the relevance map. The relevance map conveys the importance of changing each pixel to achieve the edits, and is used to to guide the modifications. This guidance ensures that the irrelevant pixels remain unchanged. Relevance maps are further used to enhance the quality of text-guided editing of 3D scenes in the form of neural radiance fields. A field is trained on relevance maps of training views, denoted as the relevance field, defining the 3D region within which modifications should be made. We perform iterative updates on the training views guided by rendered relevance maps from the relevance field. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and NeRF editing tasks.

- **Summary**: We introduce a simple yet effective early fusion method for crop yield prediction that handles multiple input modalities with different temporal and spatial resolutions. We use high-resolution crop yield maps as ground truth data to train crop and machine learning model agnostic methods at the sub-field level. We use Sentinel-2 satellite imagery as the primary modality for input data with other complementary modalities, including weather, soil, and DEM data. The proposed method uses input modalities available with global coverage, making the framework globally scalable. We explicitly highlight the importance of input modalities for crop yield prediction and emphasize that the best-performing combination of input modalities depends on region, crop, and chosen model.

- **Summary**: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic and relapsing disease characterized by esophageal inflammation. Symptoms of EoE include difficulty swallowing, food impaction, and chest pain which significantly impact the quality of life, resulting in nutritional impairments, social limitations, and psychological distress. The diagnosis of EoE is typically performed with a threshold (15 to 20) of eosinophils (Eos) per high-power field (HPF). Since the current counting process of Eos is a resource-intensive process for human pathologists, automatic methods are desired. Circle representation has been shown as a more precise, yet less complicated, representation for automatic instance cell segmentation such as CircleSnake approach. However, the CircleSnake was designed as a single-label model, which is not able to deal with multi-label scenarios. In this paper, we propose the multi-label CircleSnake model for instance segmentation on Eos. It extends the original CircleSnake model from a single-label design to a multi-label model, allowing segmentation of multiple object types. Experimental results illustrate the CircleSnake model's superiority over the traditional Mask R-CNN model and DeepSnake model in terms of average precision (AP) in identifying and segmenting eosinophils, thereby enabling enhanced characterization of EoE. This automated approach holds promise for streamlining the assessment process and improving diagnostic accuracy in EoE analysis.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we demonstrate that the concept of Semantic Consistency and the ensuing method of Knowledge-Aware Re-Optimization can be adapted for the problem of object detection in intricate traffic scenes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for extracting a knowledge graph from a dataset of images provided with instance-level annotations, and integrate this new knowledge graph with the existing semantic consistency model. Combining both this novel hybrid knowledge graph and the preexisting methods of frequency analysis and external knowledge graph as sources for semantic information, we investigate the effectiveness of knowledge-aware re-optimization on the Faster-RCNN and DETR object detection models. We find that limited but consistent improvements in precision and or recall can be achieved using this method for all combinations of model and method studied.

- **Summary**: Benefiting from the strong view-consistent information mining capacity, multi-view contrastive clustering has attracted plenty of attention in recent years. However, we observe the following drawback, which limits the clustering performance from further improvement. The existing multi-view models mainly focus on the consistency of the same samples in different views while ignoring the circumstance of similar but different samples in cross-view scenarios. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Dual contrastive calibration network for Multi-View Clustering (DealMVC). Specifically, we first design a fusion mechanism to obtain a global cross-view feature. Then, a global contrastive calibration loss is proposed by aligning the view feature similarity graph and the high-confidence pseudo-label graph. Moreover, to utilize the diversity of multi-view information, we propose a local contrastive calibration loss to constrain the consistency of pair-wise view features. The feature structure is regularized by reliable class information, thus guaranteeing similar samples have similar features in different views. During the training procedure, the interacted cross-view feature is jointly optimized at both local and global levels. In comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, the comprehensive experimental results obtained from eight benchmark datasets provide substantial validation of the effectiveness and superiority of our algorithm. We release the code of DealMVC at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/DealMVC on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Logo embedding plays a crucial role in various e-commerce applications by facilitating image retrieval or recognition, such as intellectual property protection and product search. However, current methods treat logo embedding as a purely visual problem, which may limit their performance in real-world scenarios. A notable issue is that the textual knowledge embedded in logo images has not been adequately explored. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that leverages textual knowledge as an auxiliary to improve the robustness of logo embedding. The emerging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both visual and textual understanding and could become valuable visual assistants in understanding logo images. Inspired by this observation, our proposed method, FashionLOGO, aims to utilize MLLMs to enhance fashion logo embedding. We explore how MLLMs can improve logo embedding by prompting them to generate explicit textual knowledge through three types of prompts, including image OCR, brief captions, and detailed descriptions prompts, in a zero-shot setting. We adopt a cross-attention transformer to enable image embedding queries to learn supplementary knowledge from textual embeddings automatically. To reduce computational costs, we only use the image embedding model in the inference stage, similar to traditional inference pipelines. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FashionLOGO learns generalized and robust logo embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the performance improvements resulting from the introduction of MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Multi-View Stereo~(MVS) is a fundamental problem in geometric computer vision which aims to reconstruct a scene using multi-view images with known camera parameters. However, the mainstream approaches represent the scene with a fixed all-pixel depth range and equal depth interval partition, which will result in inadequate utilization of depth planes and imprecise depth estimation. In this paper, we present a novel multi-stage coarse-to-fine framework to achieve adaptive all-pixel depth range and depth interval. We predict a coarse depth map in the first stage, then an Adaptive Depth Range Prediction module is proposed in the second stage to zoom in the scene by leveraging the reference image and the obtained depth map in the first stage and predict a more accurate all-pixel depth range for the following stages. In the third and fourth stages, we propose an Adaptive Depth Interval Adjustment module to achieve adaptive variable interval partition for pixel-wise depth range. The depth interval distribution in this module is normalized by Z-score, which can allocate dense depth hypothesis planes around the potential ground truth depth value and vice versa to achieve more accurate depth estimation. Extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets~(DTU, TnT, BlendedMVS, ETH 3D) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and yields competitive generalization ability. Particularly, our method achieves the highest Acc and Overall on the DTU dataset, while attaining the highest Recall and $F_{1}$-score on the Tanks and Temples intermediate and advanced dataset. Moreover, our method also achieves the lowest $e_{1}$ and $e_{3}$ on the BlendedMVS dataset and the highest Acc and $F_{1}$-score on the ETH 3D dataset, surpassing all listed methods.Project website: https://github.com/zs670980918/ARAI-MVSNet

- **Summary**: We study single-image super-resolution algorithms for photons at collider experiments based on generative adversarial networks. We treat the energy depositions of simulated electromagnetic showers of photons and neutral-pion decays in a toy electromagnetic calorimeter as 2D images and we train super-resolution networks to generate images with an artificially increased resolution by a factor of four in each dimension. The generated images are able to reproduce features of the electromagnetic showers that are not obvious from the images at nominal resolution. Using the artificially-enhanced images for the reconstruction of shower-shape variables and of the position of the shower center results in significant improvements. We additionally investigate the utilization of the generated images as a pre-processing step for deep-learning photon-identification algorithms and observe improvements in the case of low training statistics.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation has become a de facto component of deep learning-based medical image segmentation methods. Most data augmentation techniques used in medical imaging focus on spatial and intensity transformations to improve the diversity of training images. They are often designed at the image level, augmenting the full image, and do not pay attention to specific abnormalities within the image. Here, we present LesionMix, a novel and simple lesion-aware data augmentation method. It performs augmentation at the lesion level, increasing the diversity of lesion shape, location, intensity and load distribution, and allowing both lesion populating and inpainting. Experiments on different modalities and different lesion datasets, including four brain MR lesion datasets and one liver CT lesion dataset, demonstrate that LesionMix achieves promising performance in lesion image segmentation, outperforming several recent Mix-based data augmentation methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/dogabasaran/lesionmix.

- **Summary**: Natural Language Explanations (NLE) aim at supplementing the prediction of a model with human-friendly natural text. Existing NLE approaches involve training separate models for each downstream task. In this work, we propose Uni-NLX, a unified framework that consolidates all NLE tasks into a single and compact multi-task model using a unified training objective of text generation. Additionally, we introduce two new NLE datasets: 1) ImageNetX, a dataset of 144K samples for explaining ImageNet categories, and 2) VQA-ParaX, a dataset of 123K samples for explaining the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA). Both datasets are derived leveraging large language models (LLMs). By training on the 1M combined NLE samples, our single unified framework is capable of simultaneously performing seven NLE tasks including VQA, visual recognition and visual reasoning tasks with 7X fewer parameters, demonstrating comparable performance to the independent task-specific models in previous approaches, and in certain tasks even outperforming them.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing physically plausible human motions in 3D scenes is a challenging problem. Kinematics-based methods cannot avoid inherent artifacts (e.g., penetration and foot skating) due to the lack of physical constraints. Meanwhile, existing physics-based methods cannot generalize to multi-object scenarios since the policy trained with reinforcement learning has limited modeling capacity. In this work, we present a framework that enables physically simulated characters to perform long-term interaction tasks in diverse, cluttered, and unseen scenes. The key idea is to decompose human-scene interactions into two fundamental processes, Interacting and Navigating, which motivates us to construct two reusable Controller, i.e., InterCon and NavCon. Specifically, InterCon contains two complementary policies that enable characters to enter and leave the interacting state (e.g., sitting on a chair and getting up). To generate interaction with objects at different places, we further design NavCon, a trajectory following policy, to keep characters' locomotion in the free space of 3D scenes. Benefiting from the divide and conquer strategy, we can train the policies in simple environments and generalize to complex multi-object scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can synthesize physically plausible long-term human motions in complex 3D scenes. Code will be publicly released at https://github.com/liangpan99/InterScene.

- **Summary**: We introduce MarginMatch, a new SSL approach combining consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, with its main novelty arising from the use of unlabeled data training dynamics to measure pseudo-label quality. Instead of using only the model's confidence on an unlabeled example at an arbitrary iteration to decide if the example should be masked or not, MarginMatch also analyzes the behavior of the model on the pseudo-labeled examples as the training progresses, to ensure low quality predictions are masked out. MarginMatch brings substantial improvements on four vision benchmarks in low data regimes and on two large-scale datasets, emphasizing the importance of enforcing high-quality pseudo-labels. Notably, we obtain an improvement in error rate over the state-of-the-art of 3.25% on CIFAR-100 with only 25 labels per class and of 3.78% on STL-10 using as few as 4 labels per class. We make our code available at https://github.com/tsosea2/MarginMatch.

- **Summary**: In fisheye images, rich distinct distortion patterns are regularly distributed in the image plane. These distortion patterns are independent of the visual content and provide informative cues for rectification. To make the best of such rectification cues, we introduce SimFIR, a simple framework for fisheye image rectification based on self-supervised representation learning. Technically, we first split a fisheye image into multiple patches and extract their representations with a Vision Transformer (ViT). To learn fine-grained distortion representations, we then associate different image patches with their specific distortion patterns based on the fisheye model, and further subtly design an innovative unified distortion-aware pretext task for their learning. The transfer performance on the downstream rectification task is remarkably boosted, which verifies the effectiveness of the learned representations. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art algorithms as well as its strong generalization ability on real-world fisheye images.

- **Summary**: Uncertainty quantification is critical for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications. An Auxiliary Uncertainty Estimator (AuxUE) is one of the most effective means to estimate the uncertainty of the main task prediction without modifying the main task model. To be considered robust, an AuxUE must be capable of maintaining its performance and triggering higher uncertainties while encountering Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs, i.e., to provide robust aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. However, for vision regression tasks, current AuxUE designs are mainly adopted for aleatoric uncertainty estimates, and AuxUE robustness has not been explored. In this work, we propose a generalized AuxUE scheme for more robust uncertainty quantification on regression tasks. Concretely, to achieve a more robust aleatoric uncertainty estimation, different distribution assumptions are considered for heteroscedastic noise, and Laplace distribution is finally chosen to approximate the prediction error. For epistemic uncertainty, we propose a novel solution named Discretization-Induced Dirichlet pOsterior (DIDO), which models the Dirichlet posterior on the discretized prediction error. Extensive experiments on age estimation, monocular depth estimation, and super-resolution tasks show that our proposed method can provide robust uncertainty estimates in the face of noisy inputs and that it can be scalable to both image-level and pixel-wise tasks.

- **Summary**: Besides interacting correctly with other vehicles, automated vehicles should also be able to react in a safe manner to vulnerable road users like pedestrians or cyclists. For a safe interaction between pedestrians and automated vehicles, the vehicle must be able to interpret the pedestrian's behavior. Common environment models do not contain information like body poses used to understand the pedestrian's intent. In this work, we propose an environment model that includes the position of the pedestrians as well as their pose information. We only use images from a monocular camera and the vehicle's localization data as input to our pedestrian environment model. We extract the skeletal information with a neural network human pose estimator from the image. Furthermore, we track the skeletons with a simple tracking algorithm based on the Hungarian algorithm and an ego-motion compensation. To obtain the 3D information of the position, we aggregate the data from consecutive frames in conjunction with the vehicle position. We demonstrate our pedestrian environment model on data generated with the CARLA simulator and the nuScenes dataset. Overall, we reach a relative position error of around 16% on both datasets.

- **Summary**: We present MovePose, an optimized lightweight convolutional neural network designed specifically for real-time body pose estimation on CPU-based mobile devices. The current solutions do not provide satisfactory accuracy and speed for human posture estimation, and MovePose addresses this gap. It aims to maintain real-time performance while improving the accuracy of human posture estimation for mobile devices. The network produces 17 keypoints for each individual at a rate exceeding 11 frames per second, making it suitable for real-time applications such as fitness tracking, sign language interpretation, and advanced mobile human posture estimation. Our MovePose algorithm has attained an Mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 67.7 on the COCO \cite{cocodata} validation dataset. The MovePose algorithm displayed efficiency with a performance of 69+ frames per second (fps) when run on an Intel i9-10920x CPU. Additionally, it showcased an increased performance of 452+ fps on an NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU. On an Android phone equipped with a Snapdragon 8 + 4G processor, the fps reached above 11. To enhance accuracy, we incorporated three techniques: deconvolution, large kernel convolution, and coordinate classification methods. Compared to basic upsampling, deconvolution is trainable, improves model capacity, and enhances the receptive field. Large kernel convolution strengthens these properties at a decreased computational cost. In summary, MovePose provides high accuracy and real-time performance, marking it a potential tool for a variety of applications, including those focused on mobile-side human posture estimation. The code and models for this algorithm will be made publicly accessible.

- **Summary**: Finding the right sound effects (SFX) to match moments in a video is a difficult and time-consuming task, and relies heavily on the quality and completeness of text metadata. Retrieving high-quality (HQ) SFX using a video frame directly as the query is an attractive alternative, removing the reliance on text metadata and providing a low barrier to entry for non-experts. Due to the lack of HQ audio-visual training data, previous work on audio-visual retrieval relies on YouTube (in-the-wild) videos of varied quality for training, where the audio is often noisy and the video of amateur quality. As such it is unclear whether these systems would generalize to the task of matching HQ audio to production-quality video. To address this, we propose a multimodal framework for recommending HQ SFX given a video frame by (1) leveraging large language models and foundational vision-language models to bridge HQ audio and video to create audio-visual pairs, resulting in a highly scalable automatic audio-visual data curation pipeline; and (2) using pre-trained audio and visual encoders to train a contrastive learning-based retrieval system. We show that our system, trained using our automatic data curation pipeline, significantly outperforms baselines trained on in-the-wild data on the task of HQ SFX retrieval for video. Furthermore, while the baselines fail to generalize to this task, our system generalizes well from clean to in-the-wild data, outperforming the baselines on a dataset of YouTube videos despite only being trained on the HQ audio-visual pairs. A user study confirms that people prefer SFX retrieved by our system over the baseline 67% of the time both for HQ and in-the-wild data. Finally, we present ablations to determine the impact of model and data pipeline design choices on downstream retrieval performance.

- **Summary**: Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have been extended for text-guided video editing, yielding impressive zero-shot video editing performance. Nonetheless, the generated videos usually show spatial irregularities and temporal inconsistencies as the temporal characteristics of videos have not been faithfully modeled. In this paper, we propose an elegant yet effective Temporal-Consistent Video Editing (TCVE) method, to mitigate the temporal inconsistency challenge for robust text-guided video editing. In addition to the utilization of a pretrained 2D Unet for spatial content manipulation, we establish a dedicated temporal Unet architecture to faithfully capture the temporal coherence of the input video sequences. Furthermore, to establish coherence and interrelation between the spatial-focused and temporal-focused components, a cohesive joint spatial-temporal modeling unit is formulated. This unit effectively interconnects the temporal Unet with the pretrained 2D Unet, thereby enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated video output while simultaneously preserving the capacity for video content manipulation. Quantitative experimental results and visualization results demonstrate that TCVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video temporal consistency and video editing capability, surpassing existing benchmarks in the field.

- **Summary**: Character re-identification, recognizing characters consistently across different panels in comics, presents significant challenges due to limited annotated data and complex variations in character appearances. To tackle this issue, we introduce a robust semi-supervised framework that combines metric learning with a novel 'Identity-Aware' self-supervision method by contrastive learning of face and body pairs of characters. Our approach involves processing both facial and bodily features within a unified network architecture, facilitating the extraction of identity-aligned character embeddings that capture individual identities while preserving the effectiveness of face and body features. This integrated character representation enhances feature extraction and improves character re-identification compared to re-identification by face or body independently, offering a parameter-efficient solution. By extensively validating our method using in-series and inter-series evaluation metrics, we demonstrate its effectiveness in consistently re-identifying comic characters. Compared to existing methods, our approach not only addresses the challenge of character re-identification but also serves as a foundation for downstream tasks since it can produce character embeddings without restrictions of face and body availability, enriching the comprehension of comic books. In our experiments, we leverage two newly curated datasets: the 'Comic Character Instances Dataset', comprising over a million character instances and the 'Comic Sequence Identity Dataset', containing annotations of identities within more than 3000 sets of four consecutive comic panels that we collected.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose ImGeoNet, a multi-view image-based 3D object detection framework that models a 3D space by an image-induced geometry-aware voxel representation. Unlike previous methods which aggregate 2D features into 3D voxels without considering geometry, ImGeoNet learns to induce geometry from multi-view images to alleviate the confusion arising from voxels of free space, and during the inference phase, only images from multiple views are required. Besides, a powerful pre-trained 2D feature extractor can be leveraged by our representation, leading to a more robust performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of ImGeoNet, we conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on three indoor datasets, namely ARKitScenes, ScanNetV2, and ScanNet200. The results demonstrate that ImGeoNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art multi-view image-based method, ImVoxelNet, on all three datasets in terms of detection accuracy. In addition, ImGeoNet shows great data efficiency by achieving results comparable to ImVoxelNet with 100 views while utilizing only 40 views. Furthermore, our studies indicate that our proposed image-induced geometry-aware representation can enable image-based methods to attain superior detection accuracy than the seminal point cloud-based method, VoteNet, in two practical scenarios: (1) scenarios where point clouds are sparse and noisy, such as in ARKitScenes, and (2) scenarios involve diverse object classes, particularly classes of small objects, as in the case in ScanNet200.

- **Summary**: Resource-constrained perception systems such as edge computing and vision-for-robotics require vision models to be both accurate and lightweight in computation and memory usage. While knowledge distillation is a proven strategy to enhance the performance of lightweight classification models, its application to structured outputs like object detection and instance segmentation remains a complicated task, due to the variability in outputs and complex internal network modules involved in the distillation process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effective sequential approach to knowledge distillation that progressively transfers the knowledge of a set of teacher detectors to a given lightweight student. To distill knowledge from a highly accurate but complex teacher model, we construct a sequence of teachers to help the student gradually adapt. Our progressive strategy can be easily combined with existing detection distillation mechanisms to consistently maximize student performance in various settings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully distill knowledge from Transformer-based teacher detectors to convolution-based students, and unprecedentedly boost the performance of ResNet-50 based RetinaNet from 36.5% to 42.0% AP and Mask R-CNN from 38.2% to 42.5% AP on the MS COCO benchmark.

- **Summary**: Learning generalized face anti-spoofing (FAS) models against presentation attacks is essential for the security of face recognition systems. Previous FAS methods usually encourage models to extract discriminative features, of which the distances within the same class (bonafide or attack) are pushed close while those between bonafide and attack are pulled away. However, these methods are designed based on Euclidean distance, which lacks generalization ability for unseen attack detection due to poor hierarchy embedding ability. According to the evidence that different spoofing attacks are intrinsically hierarchical, we propose to learn richer hierarchical and discriminative spoofing cues in hyperbolic space. Specifically, for unimodal FAS learning, the feature embeddings are projected into the Poincar\'e ball, and then the hyperbolic binary logistic regression layer is cascaded for classification. To further improve generalization, we conduct hyperbolic contrastive learning for the bonafide only while relaxing the constraints on diverse spoofing attacks. To alleviate the vanishing gradient problem in hyperbolic space, a new feature clipping method is proposed to enhance the training stability of hyperbolic models. Besides, we further design a multimodal FAS framework with Euclidean multimodal feature decomposition and hyperbolic multimodal feature fusion & classification. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (i.e., WMCA, PADISI-Face, and SiW-M) with diverse attack types demonstrate that the proposed method can bring significant improvement compared to the Euclidean baselines on unseen attack detection. In addition, the proposed framework is also generalized well on four benchmark datasets (i.e., MSU-MFSD, IDIAP REPLAY-ATTACK, CASIA-FASD, and OULU-NPU) with a limited number of attack types.

- **Summary**: JPEG compression adopts the quantization of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients for effective bit-rate reduction, whilst the quantization could lead to a significant loss of important image details. Recovering compressed JPEG images in the frequency domain has attracted more and more attention recently, in addition to numerous restoration approaches developed in the pixel domain. However, the current DCT domain methods typically suffer from limited effectiveness in handling a wide range of compression quality factors, or fall short in recovering sparse quantized coefficients and the components across different colorspace. To address these challenges, we propose a DCT domain spatial-frequential Transformer, named as DCTransformer. Specifically, a dual-branch architecture is designed to capture both spatial and frequential correlations within the collocated DCT coefficients. Moreover, we incorporate the operation of quantization matrix embedding, which effectively allows our single model to handle a wide range of quality factors, and a luminance-chrominance alignment head that produces a unified feature map to align different-sized luminance and chrominance components. Our proposed DCTransformer outperforms the current state-of-the-art JPEG artifact removal techniques, as demonstrated by our extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: Scene-aware Complementary Item Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging task which requires to generate a set of compatible items across domains. Due to the subjectivity, it is difficult to set up a rigorous standard for both data collection and learning objectives. To address this challenging task, we propose a visual compatibility concept, composed of similarity (resembling in color, geometry, texture, and etc.) and complementarity (different items like table vs chair completing a group). Based on this notion, we propose a compatibility learning framework, a category-aware Flexible Bidirectional Transformer (FBT), for visual "scene-based set compatibility reasoning" with the cross-domain visual similarity input and auto-regressive complementary item generation. We introduce a "Flexible Bidirectional Transformer (FBT)" consisting of an encoder with flexible masking, a category prediction arm, and an auto-regressive visual embedding prediction arm. And the inputs for FBT are cross-domain visual similarity invariant embeddings, making this framework quite generalizable. Furthermore, our proposed FBT model learns the inter-object compatibility from a large set of scene images in a self-supervised way. Compared with the SOTA methods, this approach achieves up to 5.3% and 9.6% in FITB score and 22.3% and 31.8% SFID improvement on fashion and furniture, respectively.

- **Summary**: We introduce EgoSchema, a very long-form video question-answering dataset, and benchmark to evaluate long video understanding capabilities of modern vision and language systems. Derived from Ego4D, EgoSchema consists of over 5000 human curated multiple choice question answer pairs, spanning over 250 hours of real video data, covering a very broad range of natural human activity and behavior. For each question, EgoSchema requires the correct answer to be selected between five given options based on a three-minute-long video clip. While some prior works have proposed video datasets with long clip lengths, we posit that merely the length of the video clip does not truly capture the temporal difficulty of the video task that is being considered. To remedy this, we introduce temporal certificate sets, a general notion for capturing the intrinsic temporal understanding length associated with a broad range of video understanding tasks & datasets. Based on this metric, we find EgoSchema to have intrinsic temporal lengths over 5.7x longer than the second closest dataset and 10x to 100x longer than any other video understanding dataset. Further, our evaluation of several current state-of-the-art video and language models shows them to be severely lacking in long-term video understanding capabilities. Even models with several billions of parameters achieve QA accuracy less than 33% (random is 20%) on the EgoSchema multi-choice question answering task, while humans achieve about 76% accuracy. We posit that \name{}{}, with its long intrinsic temporal structures and diverse complexity, would serve as a valuable evaluation probe for developing effective long-term video understanding systems in the future.

- **Summary**: Source-Free Video Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFVUDA) task consists in adapting an action recognition model, trained on a labelled source dataset, to an unlabelled target dataset, without accessing the actual source data. The previous approaches have attempted to address SFVUDA by leveraging self-supervision (e.g., enforcing temporal consistency) derived from the target data itself. In this work, we take an orthogonal approach by exploiting "web-supervision" from Large Language-Vision Models (LLVMs), driven by the rationale that LLVMs contain a rich world prior surprisingly robust to domain-shift. We showcase the unreasonable effectiveness of integrating LLVMs for SFVUDA by devising an intuitive and parameter-efficient method, which we name Domain Adaptation with Large Language-Vision models (DALL-V), that distills the world prior and complementary source model information into a student network tailored for the target. Despite the simplicity, DALL-V achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art SFVUDA methods.

- **Summary**: Image structure-texture decomposition is a long-standing and fundamental problem in both image processing and computer vision fields. In this paper, we propose a generalized semi-sparse regularization framework for image structural analysis and extraction, which allows us to decouple the underlying image structures from complicated textural backgrounds. Combining with different textural analysis models, such a regularization receives favorable properties differing from many traditional methods. We demonstrate that it is not only capable of preserving image structures without introducing notorious staircase artifacts in polynomial-smoothing surfaces but is also applicable for decomposing image textures with strong oscillatory patterns. Moreover, we also introduce an efficient numerical solution based on an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which gives rise to a simple and maneuverable way for image structure-texture decomposition. The versatility of the proposed method is finally verified by a series of experimental results with the capability of producing comparable or superior image decomposition results against cutting-edge methods.

- **Summary**: The rapid expansion of foundation pre-trained models and their fine-tuned counterparts has significantly contributed to the advancement of machine learning. Leveraging pre-trained models to extract knowledge and expedite learning in real-world tasks, known as "Model Reuse", has become crucial in various applications. Previous research focuses on reusing models within a certain aspect, including reusing model weights, structures, and hypothesis spaces. This paper introduces ZhiJian, a comprehensive and user-friendly toolbox for model reuse, utilizing the PyTorch backend. ZhiJian presents a novel paradigm that unifies diverse perspectives on model reuse, encompassing target architecture construction with PTM, tuning target model with PTM, and PTM-based inference. This empowers deep learning practitioners to explore downstream tasks and identify the complementary advantages among different methods. ZhiJian is readily accessible at https://github.com/zhangyikaii/lamda-zhijian facilitating seamless utilization of pre-trained models and streamlining the model reuse process for researchers and developers.

- **Summary**: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) represents a promising solution for decentralized learning in heterogeneous data environments. Partial model personalization has been proposed to improve the efficiency of PFL by selectively updating local model parameters instead of aggregating all of them. However, previous work on partial model personalization has mainly focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leaving a gap in understanding how it can be applied to other popular models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs). In this work, we investigate where and how to partially personalize a ViT model. Specifically, we empirically evaluate the sensitivity to data distribution of each type of layer. Based on the insights that the self-attention layer and the classification head are the most sensitive parts of a ViT, we propose a novel approach called FedPerfix, which leverages plugins to transfer information from the aggregated model to the local client as a personalization. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach on CIFAR-100, OrganAMNIST, and Office-Home datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the model's performance compared to several advanced PFL methods.

- **Summary**: Pruning has emerged as a powerful technique for compressing deep neural networks, reducing memory usage and inference time without significantly affecting overall performance. However, the nuanced ways in which pruning impacts model behavior are not well understood, particularly for long-tailed, multi-label datasets commonly found in clinical settings. This knowledge gap could have dangerous implications when deploying a pruned model for diagnosis, where unexpected model behavior could impact patient well-being. To fill this gap, we perform the first analysis of pruning's effect on neural networks trained to diagnose thorax diseases from chest X-rays (CXRs). On two large CXR datasets, we examine which diseases are most affected by pruning and characterize class "forgettability" based on disease frequency and co-occurrence behavior. Further, we identify individual CXRs where uncompressed and heavily pruned models disagree, known as pruning-identified exemplars (PIEs), and conduct a human reader study to evaluate their unifying qualities. We find that radiologists perceive PIEs as having more label noise, lower image quality, and higher diagnosis difficulty. This work represents a first step toward understanding the impact of pruning on model behavior in deep long-tailed, multi-label medical image classification.

- **Summary**: Training deep neural networks using backpropagation is very memory and computationally intensive. This makes it difficult to run on-device learning or fine-tune neural networks on tiny, embedded devices such as low-power micro-controller units (MCUs). Sparse backpropagation algorithms try to reduce the computational load of on-device learning by training only a subset of the weights and biases. Existing approaches use a static number of weights to train. A poor choice of this so-called backpropagation ratio limits either the computational gain or can lead to severe accuracy losses. In this paper we present TinyProp, the first sparse backpropagation method that dynamically adapts the back-propagation ratio during on-device training for each training step. TinyProp induces a small calculation overhead to sort the elements of the gradient, which does not significantly impact the computational gains. TinyProp works particularly well on fine-tuning trained networks on MCUs, which is a typical use case for embedded applications. For typical datasets from three datasets MNIST, DCASE2020 and CIFAR10, we are 5 times faster compared to non-sparse training with an accuracy loss of on average 1%. On average, TinyProp is 2.9 times faster than existing, static sparse backpropagation algorithms and the accuracy loss is reduced on average by 6 % compared to a typical static setting of the back-propagation ratio.

- **Summary**: Traditional image stitching focuses on a single panorama frame without considering the spatial-temporal consistency in videos. The straightforward image stitching approach will cause temporal flicking and color inconstancy when it is applied to the video stitching task. Besides, inaccurate camera parameters will cause artifacts in the image warping. In this paper, we propose a real-time system to stitch multiple video sequences into a panoramic video, which is based on GPU accelerated color correction and frame warping without accurate camera parameters. We extend the traditional 2D-Matrix (2D-M) color correction approach and a present spatio-temporal 3D-Matrix (3D-M) color correction method for the overlap local regions with online color balancing using a piecewise function on global frames. Furthermore, we use pairwise homography matrices given by coarse camera calibration for global warping followed by accurate local warping based on the optical flow. Experimental results show that our system can generate highquality panorama videos in real time.

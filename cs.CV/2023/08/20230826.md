- **Summary**: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are popular likelihood-based generative models which can be efficiently trained by maximizing an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). There has been much progress in improving the expressiveness of the variational distribution to obtain tighter variational bounds and increased generative performance. Whilst previous work has leveraged Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for the construction of variational densities, gradient-based methods for adapting the proposal distributions for deep latent variable models have received less attention. This work suggests an entropy-based adaptation for a short-run Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA) or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) chain while optimising a tighter variational bound to the log-evidence. Experiments show that this approach yields higher held-out log-likelihoods as well as improved generative metrics. Our implicit variational density can adapt to complicated posterior geometries of latent hierarchical representations arising in hierarchical VAEs.

- **Summary**: Binary neural networks (BNNs) have been widely adopted to reduce the computational cost and memory storage on edge-computing devices by using one-bit representation for activations and weights. However, as neural networks become wider/deeper to improve accuracy and meet practical requirements, the computational burden remains a significant challenge even on the binary version. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method called Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) compression that learns to compress and accelerate BNNs. The proposed architecture leverages an observation from previous works that an output channel in a binary convolution can be computed using another output channel and XNOR operations with weights that differ from the weights of the reused channel. We first construct a fully connected graph with vertices corresponding to output channels, where the distance between two vertices is the number of different values between the weight sets used for these outputs. Then, the MST of the graph with the minimum depth is proposed to reorder output calculations, aiming to reduce computational cost and latency. Moreover, we propose a new learning algorithm to reduce the total MST distance during training. Experimental results on benchmark models demonstrate that our method achieves significant compression ratios with negligible accuracy drops, making it a promising approach for resource-constrained edge-computing devices.

- **Summary**: Vignetting commonly occurs as a degradation in images resulting from factors such as lens design, improper lens hood usage, and limitations in camera sensors. This degradation affects image details, color accuracy, and presents challenges in computational photography. Existing vignetting removal algorithms predominantly rely on ideal physics assumptions and hand-crafted parameters, resulting in ineffective removal of irregular vignetting and suboptimal results. Moreover, the substantial lack of real-world vignetting datasets hinders the objective and comprehensive evaluation of vignetting removal. To address these challenges, we present Vigset, a pioneering dataset for vignette removal. Vigset includes 983 pairs of both vignetting and vignetting-free high-resolution ($5340\times3697$) real-world images under various conditions. In addition, We introduce DeVigNet, a novel frequency-aware Transformer architecture designed for vignetting removal. Through the Laplacian Pyramid decomposition, we propose the Dual Aggregated Fusion Transformer to handle global features and remove vignetting in the low-frequency domain. Additionally, we introduce the Adaptive Channel Expansion Module to enhance details in the high-frequency domain. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Interactive medical image segmentation refers to the accurate segmentation of the target of interest through interaction (e.g., click) between the user and the image. It has been widely studied in recent years as it is less dependent on abundant annotated data and more flexible than fully automated segmentation. However, current studies have not fully explored user-provided prompt information (e.g., points), including the knowledge mined in one interaction, and the relationship between multiple interactions. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework equipped with prompt enhancement, called PE-MED, for interactive medical image segmentation. First, we introduce a Self-Loop strategy to generate warm initial segmentation results based on the first prompt. It can prevent the highly unfavorable scenarios, such as encountering a blank mask as the initial input after the first interaction. Second, we propose a novel Prompt Attention Learning Module (PALM) to mine useful prompt information in one interaction, enhancing the responsiveness of the network to user clicks. Last, we build a Time Series Information Propagation (TSIP) mechanism to extract the temporal relationships between multiple interactions and increase the model stability. Comparative experiments with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation algorithms show that our method exhibits better segmentation accuracy and stability.

- **Summary**: Patent retrieval has been attracting tremendous interest from researchers in intellectual property and information retrieval communities in the past decades. However, most existing approaches rely on textual and metadata information of the patent, and content-based image-based patent retrieval is rarely investigated. Based on traits of patent drawing images, we present a simple and lightweight model for this task. Without bells and whistles, this approach significantly outperforms other counterparts on a large-scale benchmark and noticeably improves the state-of-the-art by 33.5% with the mean average precision (mAP) score. Further experiments reveal that this model can be elaborately scaled up to achieve a surprisingly high mAP of 93.5%. Our method ranks first in the ECCV 2022 Patent Diagram Image Retrieval Challenge.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits a capability to segment a wide array of objects in natural images, serving as a versatile perceptual tool for various downstream image segmentation tasks. In contrast, medical image segmentation tasks often rely on domain-specific knowledge (DSK). In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines the segmentation foundation model (i.e., SAM) with domain-specific knowledge for reliable utilization of unlabeled images in building a medical image segmentation model. Our new method is iterative and consists of two main stages: (1) segmentation model training; (2) expanding the labeled set by using the trained segmentation model, an unlabeled set, SAM, and domain-specific knowledge. These two stages are repeated until no more samples are added to the labeled set. A novel optimal-matching-based method is developed for combining the SAM-generated segmentation proposals and pixel-level and image-level DSK for constructing annotations of unlabeled images in the iterative stage (2). In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for breast cancer segmentation in ultrasound images, polyp segmentation in endoscopic images, and skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images. Our work initiates a new direction of semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation: the segmentation foundation model can be harnessed as a valuable tool for label-efficient segmentation learning in medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Most existing RGB-T tracking networks extract modality features in a separate manner, which lacks interaction and mutual guidance between modalities. This limits the network's ability to adapt to the diverse dual-modality appearances of targets and the dynamic relationships between the modalities. Additionally, the three-stage fusion tracking paradigm followed by these networks significantly restricts the tracking speed. To overcome these problems, we propose a unified single-stage Transformer RGB-T tracking network, namely USTrack, which unifies the above three stages into a single ViT (Vision Transformer) backbone with a dual embedding layer through self-attention mechanism. With this structure, the network can extract fusion features of the template and search region under the mutual interaction of modalities. Simultaneously, relation modeling is performed between these features, efficiently obtaining the search region fusion features with better target-background discriminability for prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a novel feature selection mechanism based on modality reliability to mitigate the influence of invalid modalities for prediction, further improving the tracking performance. Extensive experiments on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the fastest inference speed 84.2FPS. In particular, MPR/MSR on the short-term and long-term subsets of VTUAV dataset increased by 11.1$\%$/11.7$\%$ and 11.3$\%$/9.7$\%$.

- **Summary**: The Diffusion Model (DM) has emerged as the SOTA approach for image synthesis. However, the existing DM cannot perform well on some image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks. Different from image synthesis, some I2I tasks, such as super-resolution, require generating results in accordance with GT images. Traditional DMs for image synthesis require extensive iterations and large denoising models to estimate entire images, which gives their strong generative ability but also leads to artifacts and inefficiency for I2I. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple, efficient, and powerful DM framework for I2I, called DiffI2I. Specifically, DiffI2I comprises three key components: a compact I2I prior extraction network (CPEN), a dynamic I2I transformer (DI2Iformer), and a denoising network. We train DiffI2I in two stages: pretraining and DM training. For pretraining, GT and input images are fed into CPEN$_{S1}$ to capture a compact I2I prior representation (IPR) guiding DI2Iformer. In the second stage, the DM is trained to only use the input images to estimate the same IRP as CPEN$_{S1}$. Compared to traditional DMs, the compact IPR enables DiffI2I to obtain more accurate outcomes and employ a lighter denoising network and fewer iterations. Through extensive experiments on various I2I tasks, we demonstrate that DiffI2I achieves SOTA performance while significantly reducing computational burdens.

- **Summary**: Document digitization is vital for preserving historical records, efficient document management, and advancing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) research. Document Layout Analysis (DLA) involves segmenting documents into meaningful units like text boxes, paragraphs, images, and tables. Challenges arise when dealing with diverse layouts, historical documents, and unique scripts like Bengali, hindered by the lack of comprehensive Bengali DLA datasets. We improved the accuracy of the DLA model for Bengali documents by utilizing advanced Mask R-CNN models available in the Detectron2 library. Our evaluation involved three variants: Mask R-CNN R-50, R-101, and X-101, both with and without pretrained weights from PubLayNet, on the BaDLAD dataset, which contains human-annotated Bengali documents in four categories: text boxes, paragraphs, images, and tables. Results show the effectiveness of these models in accurately segmenting Bengali documents. We discuss speed-accuracy tradeoffs and underscore the significance of pretrained weights. Our findings expand the applicability of Mask R-CNN in document layout analysis, efficient document management, and OCR research while suggesting future avenues for fine-tuning and data augmentation.

- **Summary**: Recent research understands the residual networks from a new perspective of the implicit ensemble model. From this view, previous methods such as stochastic depth and stimulative training have further improved the performance of the residual network by sampling and training of its subnets. However, they both use the same supervision for all subnets of different capacities and neglect the valuable knowledge generated by subnets during training. In this manuscript, we mitigate the significant knowledge distillation gap caused by using the same kind of supervision and advocate leveraging the subnets to provide diverse knowledge. Based on this motivation, we propose a group knowledge based training framework for boosting the performance of residual networks. Specifically, we implicitly divide all subnets into hierarchical groups by subnet-in-subnet sampling, aggregate the knowledge of different subnets in each group during training, and exploit upper-level group knowledge to supervise lower-level subnet groups. Meanwhile, We also develop a subnet sampling strategy that naturally samples larger subnets, which are found to be more helpful than smaller subnets in boosting performance for hierarchical groups. Compared with typical subnet training and other methods, our method achieves the best efficiency and performance trade-offs on multiple datasets and network structures. The code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Hash representation learning of multi-view heterogeneous data is the key to improving the accuracy of multimedia retrieval. However, existing methods utilize local similarity and fall short of deeply fusing the multi-view features, resulting in poor retrieval accuracy. Current methods only use local similarity to train their model. These methods ignore global similarity. Furthermore, most recent works fuse the multi-view features via a weighted sum or concatenation. We contend that these fusion methods are insufficient for capturing the interaction between various views. We present a novel Central Similarity Multi-View Hashing (CSMVH) method to address the mentioned problems. Central similarity learning is used for solving the local similarity problem, which can utilize the global similarity between the hash center and samples. We present copious empirical data demonstrating the superiority of gate-based fusion over conventional approaches. On the MS COCO and NUS-WIDE, the proposed CSMVH performs better than the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (up to 11.41% mean Average Precision (mAP) improvement).

- **Summary**: Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising tool for reducing sampling costs. Current deep neural network (NN)-based CS methods face challenges in collecting labeled measurement-ground truth (GT) data and generalizing to real applications. This paper proposes a novel $\mathbf{S}$elf-supervised s$\mathbf{C}$alable deep CS method, comprising a $\mathbf{L}$earning scheme called $\mathbf{SCL}$ and a family of $\mathbf{Net}$works named $\mathbf{SCNet}$, which does not require GT and can handle arbitrary sampling ratios and matrices once trained on a partial measurement set. Our SCL contains a dual-domain loss and a four-stage recovery strategy. The former encourages a cross-consistency on two measurement parts and a sampling-reconstruction cycle-consistency regarding arbitrary ratios and matrices to maximize data/information utilization. The latter can progressively leverage common signal prior in external measurements and internal characteristics of test samples and learned NNs to improve accuracy. SCNet combines the explicit guidance from optimization algorithms with implicit regularization from advanced NN blocks to learn a collaborative signal representation. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 1-/2-/3-D natural and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, superior performance, flexibility, and generalization ability of our method over existing self-supervised methods and its significant potential in competing against state-of-the-art supervised methods.



### Zero-Shot Edge Detection with SCESAME: Spectral Clustering-based Ensemble for Segment Anything Model Estimation

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel zero-shot edge detection with SCESAME, which stands for Spectral Clustering-based Ensemble for Segment Anything Model Estimation, based on the recently proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM is a foundation model for segmentation tasks, and one of the interesting applications of SAM is Automatic Mask Generation (AMG), which generates zero-shot segmentation masks of an entire image. AMG can be applied to edge detection, but suffers from the problem of overdetecting edges. Edge detection with SCESAME overcomes this problem by three steps: (1) eliminating small generated masks, (2) combining masks by spectral clustering, taking into account mask positions and overlaps, and (3) removing artifacts after edge detection. We performed edge detection experiments on two datasets, BSDS500 and NYUDv2. Although our zero-shot approach is simple, the experimental results on BSDS500 showed almost identical performance to human performance and CNN-based methods from seven years ago. In the NYUDv2 experiments, it performed almost as well as recent CNN-based methods. These results indicate that our method has the potential to be a strong baseline for future zero-shot edge detection methods. Furthermore, SCESAME is not only applicable to edge detection, but also to other downstream zero-shot tasks.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Lightness adaptation is vital to the success of image processing to avoid unexpected visual deterioration, which covers multiple aspects, e.g., low-light image enhancement, image retouching, and inverse tone mapping. Existing methods typically work well on their trained lightness conditions but perform poorly in unknown ones due to their limited generalization ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generalized lightness adaptation algorithm that extends conventional normalization techniques through a channel filtering design, dubbed Channel Selective Normalization (CSNorm). The proposed CSNorm purposely normalizes the statistics of lightness-relevant channels and keeps other channels unchanged, so as to improve feature generalization and discrimination. To optimize CSNorm, we propose an alternating training strategy that effectively identifies lightness-relevant channels. The model equipped with our CSNorm only needs to be trained on one lightness condition and can be well generalized to unknown lightness conditions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CSNorm in enhancing the generalization ability for the existing lightness adaptation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mdyao/CSNorm.

- **Summary**: Avoiding synthesizing specific visual concepts is an essential challenge in responsible visual synthesis. However, the visual concept that needs to be avoided for responsible visual synthesis tends to be diverse, depending on the region, context, and usage scenarios. In this work, we formalize a new task, Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (ORES), where the synthesis model is able to avoid forbidden visual concepts while allowing users to input any desired content. To address this problem, we present a Two-stage Intervention (TIN) framework. By introducing 1) rewriting with learnable instruction through a large-scale language model (LLM) and 2) synthesizing with prompt intervention on a diffusion synthesis model, it can effectively synthesize images avoiding any concepts but following the user's query as much as possible. To evaluate on ORES, we provide a publicly available dataset, baseline models, and benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing risks of image generation. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs in responsible visual synthesis. Our code and dataset is public available.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound (US) image segmentation is an active research area that requires real-time and highly accurate analysis in many scenarios. The detect-to-segment (DTS) frameworks have been recently proposed to balance accuracy and efficiency. However, existing approaches may suffer from inadequate contour encoding or fail to effectively leverage the encoded results. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fourier-anchor-based DTS framework called Fourier Feature Pyramid Network (FFPN) to address the aforementioned issues. The contributions of this paper are two fold. First, the FFPN utilizes Fourier Descriptors to adequately encode contours. Specifically, it maps Fourier series with similar amplitudes and frequencies into the same layer of the feature map, thereby effectively utilizing the encoded Fourier information. Second, we propose a Contour Sampling Refinement (CSR) module based on the contour proposals and refined features produced by the FFPN. This module extracts rich features around the predicted contours to further capture detailed information and refine the contours. Extensive experimental results on three large and challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other DTS methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, our framework can generalize well to other detection or segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Handwritten augmentation, a new data augmentation for handwritten character images. This method focuses on augmenting handwritten image data by altering the shape of input characters in training. The proposed handwritten augmentation is similar to position augmentation, color augmentation for images but a deeper focus on handwritten characters. Handwritten augmentation is data-driven, easy to implement, and can be integrated with CNN-based optical character recognition models. Handwritten augmentation can be implemented along with commonly used data augmentation techniques such as cropping, rotating, and yields better performance of models for handwritten image datasets developed using optical character recognition methods.

Normalizing flows are likelihood-based generative models providing a tractable density estimation via dimension-preserving invertible transformations. Conventional normalizing flows are prone to fail in out-of-distribution detection, because of the well-known curse of dimensionality problem of the likelihood-based models. According to the manifold hypothesis, real-world data often lie on a low-dimensional manifold. This study investigates the effect of manifold learning using normalizing flows on out-of-distribution detection. We proceed by estimating the density on a low-dimensional manifold, coupled with measuring the distance from the manifold, as criteria for out-of-distribution detection. However, individually, each of them is insufficient for this task. The extensive experimental results show that manifold learning improves the out-of-distribution detection ability of a class of likelihood-based models known as normalizing flows. This improvement is achieved without modifying the model structure or using auxiliary out-of-distribution data during training.

- **Summary**: In the field of autonomous driving, accurate and comprehensive perception of the 3D environment is crucial. Bird's Eye View (BEV) based methods have emerged as a promising solution for 3D object detection using multi-view images as input. However, existing 3D object detection methods often ignore the physical context in the environment, such as sidewalk and vegetation, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called SOGDet (Semantic-Occupancy Guided Multi-view 3D Object Detection), that leverages a 3D semantic-occupancy branch to improve the accuracy of 3D object detection. In particular, the physical context modeled by semantic occupancy helps the detector to perceive the scenes in a more holistic view. Our SOGDet is flexible to use and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing BEV-based methods. To evaluate its effectiveness, we apply this approach to several state-of-the-art baselines and conduct extensive experiments on the exclusive nuScenes dataset. Our results show that SOGDet consistently enhance the performance of three baseline methods in terms of nuScenes Detection Score (NDS) and mean Average Precision (mAP). This indicates that the combination of 3D object detection and 3D semantic occupancy leads to a more comprehensive perception of the 3D environment, thereby aiding build more robust autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: Interior design is crucial in creating aesthetically pleasing and functional indoor spaces. However, developing and editing interior design concepts requires significant time and expertise. We propose Virtual Interior DESign (VIDES) system in response to this challenge. Leveraging cutting-edge technology in generative AI, our system can assist users in generating and editing indoor scene concepts quickly, given user text description and visual guidance. Using both visual guidance and language as the conditional inputs significantly enhances the accuracy and coherence of the generated scenes, resulting in visually appealing designs. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VIDES in developing new indoor concepts, changing indoor styles, and replacing and removing interior objects. The system successfully captures the essence of users' descriptions while providing flexibility for customization. Consequently, this system can potentially reduce the entry barrier for indoor design, making it more accessible to users with limited technical skills and reducing the time required to create high-quality images. Individuals who have a background in design can now easily communicate their ideas visually and effectively present their design concepts. https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/VIDES

- **Summary**: The fashion e-commerce industry has witnessed significant growth in recent years, prompting exploring image-based virtual try-on techniques to incorporate Augmented Reality (AR) experiences into online shopping platforms. However, existing research has primarily overlooked a crucial aspect - the runtime of the underlying machine-learning model. While existing methods prioritize enhancing output quality, they often disregard the execution time, which restricts their applications on a limited range of devices. To address this gap, we propose Distilled Mobile Real-time Virtual Try-On (DM-VTON), a novel virtual try-on framework designed to achieve simplicity and efficiency. Our approach is based on a knowledge distillation scheme that leverages a strong Teacher network as supervision to guide a Student network without relying on human parsing. Notably, we introduce an efficient Mobile Generative Module within the Student network, significantly reducing the runtime while ensuring high-quality output. Additionally, we propose Virtual Try-on-guided Pose for Data Synthesis to address the limited pose variation observed in training images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 40 frames per second on a single Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU and only take up 37 MB of memory while producing almost the same output quality as other state-of-the-art methods. DM-VTON stands poised to facilitate the advancement of real-time AR applications, in addition to the generation of lifelike attired human figures tailored for diverse specialized training tasks. https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/DMVTON

- **Summary**: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has gained increasing attention in the community, in which the recently emerged diffusion models (DMs) have promisingly shown stronger performance than the past approaches. While existing state-of-the-art DMs are competent to achieve high-resolution video generation, they may largely suffer from key limitations (e.g., action occurrence disorders, crude video motions) with respect to the intricate temporal dynamics modeling, one of the crux of video synthesis. In this work, we investigate strengthening the awareness of video dynamics for DMs, for high-quality T2V generation. Inspired by human intuition, we design an innovative dynamic scene manager (dubbed as Dysen) module, which includes (step-1) extracting from input text the key actions with proper time-order arrangement, (step-2) transforming the action schedules into the dynamic scene graph (DSG) representations, and (step-3) enriching the scenes in the DSG with sufficient and reasonable details. Taking advantage of the existing powerful LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) via in-context learning, Dysen realizes (nearly) human-level temporal dynamics understanding. Finally, the resulting video DSG with rich action scene details is encoded as fine-grained spatio-temporal features, integrated into the backbone T2V DM for video generating. Experiments on popular T2V datasets suggest that our framework consistently outperforms prior arts with significant margins, especially in the scenario with complex actions.

- **Summary**: We show that crowd counting can be viewed as a decomposable point querying process. This formulation enables arbitrary points as input and jointly reasons whether the points are crowd and where they locate. The querying processing, however, raises an underlying problem on the number of necessary querying points. Too few imply underestimation; too many increase computational overhead. To address this dilemma, we introduce a decomposable structure, i.e., the point-query quadtree, and propose a new counting model, termed Point quEry Transformer (PET). PET implements decomposable point querying via data-dependent quadtree splitting, where each querying point could split into four new points when necessary, thus enabling dynamic processing of sparse and dense regions. Such a querying process yields an intuitive, universal modeling of crowd as both the input and output are interpretable and steerable. We demonstrate the applications of PET on a number of crowd-related tasks, including fully-supervised crowd counting and localization, partial annotation learning, and point annotation refinement, and also report state-of-the-art performance. For the first time, we show that a single counting model can address multiple crowd-related tasks across different learning paradigms. Code is available at https://github.com/cxliu0/PET.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound (US) imaging provides a safe and accessible solution to procedural guidance and diagnostic imaging. The effective usage of conventional 2D US for interventional guidance requires extensive experience to project the image plane onto the patient, and the interpretation of images in diagnostics suffers from high intra- and inter-user variability. 3D US reconstruction allows for more consistent diagnosis and interpretation, but existing solutions are limited in terms of equipment and applicability in real-time navigation. To address these issues, we propose HoloPOCUS - a mixed reality US system (MR-US) that overlays rich US information onto the user's vision in a point-of-care setting. HoloPOCUS extends existing MR-US methods beyond placing a US plane in the user's vision to include a 3D reconstruction and projection that can aid in procedural guidance using conventional probes. We validated a tracking pipeline that demonstrates higher accuracy compared to existing MR-US works. Furthermore, user studies conducted via a phantom task showed significant improvements in navigation duration when using our proposed methods.

- **Summary**: In marine aquaculture, inspecting sea cages is an essential activity for managing both the facilities' environmental impact and the quality of the fish development process. Fish escape from fish farms into the open sea due to net damage, which can result in significant financial losses and compromise the nearby marine ecosystem. The traditional inspection system in use relies on visual inspection by expert divers or ROVs, which is not only laborious, time-consuming, and inaccurate but also largely dependent on the level of knowledge of the operator and has a poor degree of verifiability. This article presents a robotic-based automatic net defect detection system for aquaculture net pens oriented to on-ROV processing and real-time detection. The proposed system takes a video stream from an onboard camera of the ROV, employs a deep learning detector, and segments the defective part of the image from the background under different underwater conditions. The system was first tested using a set of collected images for comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches and then using the ROV inspection sequences to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Results show that our approach presents high levels of accuracy even for adverse scenarios and is adequate for real-time processing on embedded platforms.

- **Summary**: Aquaculture is a thriving food-producing sector producing over half of the global fish consumption. However, these aquafarms pose significant challenges such as biofouling, vegetation, and holes within their net pens and have a profound effect on the efficiency and sustainability of fish production. Currently, divers and/or remotely operated vehicles are deployed for inspecting and maintaining aquafarms; this approach is expensive and requires highly skilled human operators. This work aims to develop a robotic-based automatic net defect detection system for aquaculture net pens oriented to on- ROV processing and real-time detection of different aqua-net defects such as biofouling, vegetation, net holes, and plastic. The proposed system integrates both deep learning-based methods for aqua-net defect detection and feedback control law for the vehicle movement around the aqua-net to obtain a clear sequence of net images and inspect the status of the net via performing the inspection tasks. This work contributes to the area of aquaculture inspection, marine robotics, and deep learning aiming to reduce cost, improve quality, and ease of operation.



### Beyond One-to-One: Rethinking the Referring Image Segmentation

- **Summary**: Referring image segmentation aims to segment the target object referred by a natural language expression. However, previous methods rely on the strong assumption that one sentence must describe one target in the image, which is often not the case in real-world applications. As a result, such methods fail when the expressions refer to either no objects or multiple objects. In this paper, we address this issue from two perspectives. First, we propose a Dual Multi-Modal Interaction (DMMI) Network, which contains two decoder branches and enables information flow in two directions. In the text-to-image decoder, text embedding is utilized to query the visual feature and localize the corresponding target. Meanwhile, the image-to-text decoder is implemented to reconstruct the erased entity-phrase conditioned on the visual feature. In this way, visual features are encouraged to contain the critical semantic information about target entity, which supports the accurate segmentation in the text-to-image decoder in turn. Secondly, we collect a new challenging but realistic dataset called Ref-ZOM, which includes image-text pairs under different settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, and the Ref-ZOM-trained model performs well on various types of text inputs.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for joint gaze location detection (GL-D) and gaze object detection (GO-D), \emph{i.e.}, gaze following detection. Current approaches frame GL-D and GO-D as two separate tasks, employing a multi-stage framework where human head crops must first be detected and then be fed into a subsequent GL-D sub-network, which is further followed by an additional object detector for GO-D. In contrast, we reframe the gaze following detection task as detecting human head locations and their gaze followings simultaneously, aiming at jointly detect human gaze location and gaze object in a unified and single-stage pipeline. To this end, we propose GTR, short for \underline{G}aze following detection \underline{TR}ansformer, streamlining the gaze following detection pipeline by eliminating all additional components, leading to the first unified paradigm that unites GL-D and GO-D in a fully end-to-end manner. GTR enables an iterative interaction between holistic semantics and human head features through a hierarchical structure, inferring the relations of salient objects and human gaze from the global image context and resulting in an impressive accuracy. Concretely, GTR achieves a 12.1 mAP gain ($\mathbf{25.1}\%$) on GazeFollowing and a 18.2 mAP gain ($\mathbf{43.3\%}$) on VideoAttentionTarget for GL-D, as well as a 19 mAP improvement ($\mathbf{45.2\%}$) on GOO-Real for GO-D. Meanwhile, unlike existing systems detecting gaze following sequentially due to the need for a human head as input, GTR has the flexibility to comprehend any number of people's gaze followings simultaneously, resulting in high efficiency. Specifically, GTR introduces over a $\times 9$ improvement in FPS and the relative gap becomes more pronounced as the human number grows.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised anomaly detection methods offer a promising and flexible alternative to supervised approaches, holding the potential to revolutionize medical scan analysis and enhance diagnostic performance.   In the current landscape, it is commonly assumed that differences between a test case and the training distribution are attributed solely to pathological conditions, implying that any disparity indicates an anomaly. However, the presence of other potential sources of distributional shift, including scanner, age, sex, or race, is frequently overlooked. These shifts can significantly impact the accuracy of the anomaly detection task. Prominent instances of such failures have sparked concerns regarding the bias, credibility, and fairness of anomaly detection.   This work presents a novel analysis of biases in unsupervised anomaly detection. By examining potential non-pathological distributional shifts between the training and testing distributions, we shed light on the extent of these biases and their influence on anomaly detection results. Moreover, this study examines the algorithmic limitations that arise due to biases, providing valuable insights into the challenges encountered by anomaly detection algorithms in accurately learning and capturing the entire range of variability present in the normative distribution. Through this analysis, we aim to enhance the understanding of these biases and pave the way for future improvements in the field. Here, we specifically investigate Alzheimer's disease detection from brain MR imaging as a case study, revealing significant biases related to sex, race, and scanner variations that substantially impact the results. These findings align with the broader goal of improving the reliability, fairness, and effectiveness of anomaly detection in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Sample selection is a prevalent method in learning with noisy labels, where small-loss data are typically considered as correctly labeled data. However, this method may not effectively identify clean hard examples with large losses, which are critical for achieving the model's close-to-optimal generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Late Stopping, which leverages the intrinsic robust learning ability of DNNs through a prolonged training process. Specifically, Late Stopping gradually shrinks the noisy dataset by removing high-probability mislabeled examples while retaining the majority of clean hard examples in the training set throughout the learning process. We empirically observe that mislabeled and clean examples exhibit differences in the number of epochs required for them to be consistently and correctly classified, and thus high-probability mislabeled examples can be removed. Experimental results on benchmark-simulated and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has proved to be very effective in video action recognition. Video violence recognition attempts to learn the human multi-dynamic behaviours in more complex scenarios. In this work, we develop a method for video violence recognition from a new perspective of skeleton points. Unlike the previous works, we first formulate 3D skeleton point clouds from human skeleton sequences extracted from videos and then perform interaction learning on these 3D skeleton point clouds. Specifically, we propose two types of Skeleton Points Interaction Learning (SPIL) strategies: (i) Local-SPIL: by constructing a specific weight distribution strategy between local regional points, Local-SPIL aims to selectively focus on the most relevant parts of them based on their features and spatial-temporal position information. In order to capture diverse types of relation information, a multi-head mechanism is designed to aggregate different features from independent heads to jointly handle different types of relationships between points. (ii) Global-SPIL: to better learn and refine the features of the unordered and unstructured skeleton points, Global-SPIL employs the self-attention layer that operates directly on the sampled points, which can help to make the output more permutation-invariant and well-suited for our task. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our model outperforms the existing networks and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on video violence datasets.

- **Summary**: Representational straightening refers to a decrease in curvature of visual feature representations of a sequence of frames taken from natural movies. Prior work established straightening in neural representations of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) and perceptual straightening in human behavior as a hallmark of biological vision in contrast to artificial feedforward neural networks which did not demonstrate this phenomenon as they were not explicitly optimized to produce temporally predictable movie representations. Here, we show robustness to noise in the input image can produce representational straightening in feedforward neural networks. Both adversarial training (AT) and base classifiers for Random Smoothing (RS) induced remarkably straightened feature codes. Demonstrating their utility within the domain of natural movies, these codes could be inverted to generate intervening movie frames by linear interpolation in the feature space even though they were not trained on these trajectories. Demonstrating their biological utility, we found that AT and RS training improved predictions of neural data in primate V1 over baseline models providing a parsimonious, bio-plausible mechanism -- noise in the sensory input stages -- for generating representations in early visual cortex. Finally, we compared the geometric properties of frame representations in these networks to better understand how they produced representations that mimicked the straightening phenomenon from biology. Overall, this work elucidating emergent properties of robust neural networks demonstrates that it is not necessary to utilize predictive objectives or train directly on natural movie statistics to achieve models supporting straightened movie representations similar to human perception that also predict V1 neural responses.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation (HPE) has attracted a significant amount of attention from the computer vision community in the past decades. Moreover, HPE has been applied to various domains, such as human-computer interaction, sports analysis, and human tracking via images and videos. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have shown state-of-the-art performance in HPE-based applications. Although deep learning-based approaches have achieved remarkable performance in HPE, a comprehensive review of deep learning-based HPE methods remains lacking in the literature. In this article, we provide an up-to-date and in-depth overview of the deep learning approaches in vision-based HPE. We summarize these methods of 2-D and 3-D HPE, and their applications, discuss the challenges and the research trends through bibliometrics, and provide insightful recommendations for future research. This article provides a meaningful overview as introductory material for beginners to deep learning-based HPE, as well as supplementary material for advanced researchers.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of brain tumours is a fundamental task in medical image analysis that can help clinicians in diagnosing the patient and tracking the progression of any malignant entities. Accurate segmentation of brain lesions is essential for medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, failure to acquire specific MRI imaging modalities can prevent applications from operating in critical situations, raising concerns about their reliability and overall trustworthiness. This paper presents a novel multi-modal approach for brain lesion segmentation that leverages information from four distinct imaging modalities while being robust to real-world scenarios of missing modalities, such as T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR MRI of brains. Our proposed method can help address the challenges posed by artifacts in medical imagery due to data acquisition errors (such as patient motion) or a reconstruction algorithm's inability to represent the anatomy while ensuring a trade-off in accuracy.

- **Summary**: Face morphing is one of the seminal problems in computer graphics, with numerous artistic and forensic applications. It is notoriously challenging due to pose, lighting, gender, and ethnicity variations. Generally, this task consists of a warping for feature alignment and a blending for a seamless transition between the warped images.   We propose to leverage coordinate-based neural networks to represent such warpings and blendings of face images. During training, we exploit the smoothness and flexibility of such networks, by combining energy functionals employed in classical approaches without discretizations. Additionally, our method is time-dependent, allowing a continuous warping, and blending of the target images.   During warping inference, we need both direct and inverse transformations of the time-dependent warping. The first is responsible for morphing the target image into the source image, while the inverse is used for morphing in the opposite direction. Our neural warping stores those maps in a single network due to its inversible property, dismissing the hard task of inverting them.   The results of our experiments indicate that our method is competitive with both classical and data-based neural techniques under the lens of face-morphing detection approaches. Aesthetically, the resulting images present a seamless blending of diverse faces not yet usual in the literature.

- **Summary**: In recent years, image captioning and segmentation have emerged as crucial tasks in computer vision, with applications ranging from autonomous driving to content analysis. Although multiple solutions have emerged to help blind and visually impaired people move around their environment, few are applications that help them understand and rebuild a scene in their minds through text. Most built models focus on helping users move and avoid obstacles, restricting the number of environments blind and visually impaired people can be in.   In this paper, we will propose an approach that helps them understand their surroundings using image captioning. The particularity of our research is that we offer them descriptions with positions of regions and objects regarding them (left, right, front), as well as positional relationships between regions, while we aim to give them access to theatre plays by applying the solution to our TS-RGBD dataset.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is quite challenging due to the large distribution discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain. Inspired by diffusion models which have strong capability to gradually convert data distributions across a large gap, we consider to explore the diffusion technique to handle the challenging UDA task. However, using diffusion models to convert data distribution across different domains is a non-trivial problem as the standard diffusion models generally perform conversion from the Gaussian distribution instead of from a specific domain distribution. Besides, during the conversion, the semantics of the source-domain data needs to be preserved for classification in the target domain. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Domain-Adaptive Diffusion (DAD) module accompanied by a Mutual Learning Strategy (MLS), which can gradually convert data distribution from the source domain to the target domain while enabling the classification model to learn along the domain transition process. Consequently, our method successfully eases the challenge of UDA by decomposing the large domain gap into small ones and gradually enhancing the capacity of classification model to finally adapt to the target domain. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-arts by a large margin on three widely used UDA datasets.

- **Summary**: Generalizing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to new scenes is a significant challenge that existing approaches struggle to address without extensive modifications to vanilla NeRF framework. We introduce InsertNeRF, a method for INStilling gEneRalizabiliTy into NeRF. By utilizing multiple plug-and-play HyperNet modules, InsertNeRF dynamically tailors NeRF's weights to specific reference scenes, transforming multi-scale sampling-aware features into scene-specific representations. This novel design allows for more accurate and efficient representations of complex appearances and geometries. Experiments show that this method not only achieves superior generalization performance but also provides a flexible pathway for integration with other NeRF-like systems, even in sparse input settings. Code will be available https://github.com/bbbbby-99/InsertNeRF.

- **Summary**: We present a novel confidence refinement scheme that enhances pseudo-labels in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Unlike current leading methods, which filter pixels with low-confidence predictions in isolation, our approach leverages the spatial correlation of labels in segmentation maps by grouping neighboring pixels and considering their pseudo-labels collectively. With this contextual information, our method, named S4MC, increases the amount of unlabeled data used during training while maintaining the quality of the pseudo-labels, all with negligible computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that S4MC outperforms existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approaches, offering a promising solution for reducing the cost of acquiring dense annotations. For example, S4MC achieves a 1.29 mIoU improvement over the prior state-of-the-art method on PASCAL VOC 12 with 366 annotated images. The code to reproduce our experiments is available at https://s4mcontext.github.io/

- **Summary**: Existing methods for 3D face reconstruction from a few casually captured images employ deep learning based models along with a 3D Morphable Model(3DMM) as face geometry prior. Structure From Motion(SFM), followed by Multi-View Stereo (MVS), on the other hand, uses dozens of high-resolution images to reconstruct accurate 3D faces.However, it produces noisy and stretched-out results with only two views available. In this paper, taking inspiration from both these methods, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that disjointly solves for pose and shape to make the optimization stable and accurate. We use a face shape prior to estimate face pose and use stereo matching followed by a 3DMM to solve for the shape. The proposed method achieves end-to-end topological consistency, enables iterative face pose refinement procedure, and show remarkable improvement on both quantitative and qualitative results over existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Computer vision and machine learning have brought revolutionary shifts in perception for researchers, scientists, and the general populace. Once thought to be unattainable, these technologies have achieved the seemingly impossible. Their exceptional applications in diverse fields like security, agriculture, and education are a testament to their impact. However, the full potential of computer vision remains untapped. This paper explores computer vision's potential in security and surveillance, presenting a novel approach to track motion in videos. By categorizing motion into Arcs, Lanes, Converging/Diverging, and Random/Block motions using Motion Information Images and Blockwise dominant motion data, the paper examines different optical flow techniques, CNN models, and machine learning models.

- **Summary**: Transfer learning improves the performance of deep learning models by initializing them with parameters pre-trained on larger datasets. Intuitively, transfer learning is more effective when pre-training is on the in-domain datasets. A recent study by NASA has demonstrated that the microstructure segmentation with encoder-decoder algorithms benefits more from CNN encoders pre-trained on microscopy images than from those pre-trained on natural images. However, CNN models only capture the local spatial relations in images. In recent years, attention networks such as Transformers are increasingly used in image analysis to capture the long-range relations between pixels. In this study, we compare the segmentation performance of Transformer and CNN models pre-trained on microscopy images with those pre-trained on natural images. Our result partially confirms the NASA study that the segmentation performance of out-of-distribution images (taken under different imaging and sample conditions) is significantly improved when pre-training on microscopy images. However, the performance gain for one-shot and few-shot learning is more modest with Transformers. We also find that for image segmentation, the combination of pre-trained Transformers and CNN encoders are consistently better than pre-trained CNN encoders alone. Our dataset (of about 50,000 images) combines the public portion of the NASA dataset with additional images we collected. Even with much less training data, our pre-trained models have significantly better performance for image segmentation. This result suggests that Transformers and CNN complement each other and when pre-trained on microscopy images, they are more beneficial to the downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation methods for 2D human pose estimation typically require continuous access to the source data during adaptation, which can be challenging due to privacy, memory, or computational constraints. To address this limitation, we focus on the task of source-free domain adaptation for pose estimation, where a source model must adapt to a new target domain using only unlabeled target data. Although recent advances have introduced source-free methods for classification tasks, extending them to the regression task of pose estimation is non-trivial. In this paper, we present Prior-guided Self-training (POST), a pseudo-labeling approach that builds on the popular Mean Teacher framework to compensate for the distribution shift. POST leverages prediction-level and feature-level consistency between a student and teacher model against certain image transformations. In the absence of source data, POST utilizes a human pose prior that regularizes the adaptation process by directing the model to generate more accurate and anatomically plausible pose pseudo-labels. Despite being simple and intuitive, our framework can deliver significant performance gains compared to applying the source model directly to the target data, as demonstrated in our extensive experiments and ablation studies. In fact, our approach achieves comparable performance to recent state-of-the-art methods that use source data for adaptation.

- **Summary**: One of the major drawbacks of deep learning models for computer vision has been their inability to retain multiple sources of information in a modular fashion. For instance, given a network that has been trained on a source task, we would like to re-train this network on a similar, yet different, target task while maintaining its performance on the source task. Simultaneously, researchers have extensively studied modularization of network weights to localize and identify the set of weights culpable for eliciting the observed performance on a given task. One set of works studies the modularization induced in the weights of a neural network by learning and analysing weight masks. In this work, we combine these fields to study three such weight masking methods and analyse their ability to mitigate "forgetting'' on the source task while also allowing for efficient finetuning on the target task. We find that different masking techniques have trade-offs in retaining knowledge in the source task without adversely affecting target task performance.

- **Summary**: The sparse modeling is an evident manifestation capturing the parsimony principle just described, and sparse models are widespread in statistics, physics, information sciences, neuroscience, computational mathematics, and so on. In statistics the many applications of sparse modeling span regression, classification tasks, graphical model selection, sparse M-estimators and sparse dimensionality reduction. It is also particularly effective in many statistical and machine learning areas where the primary goal is to discover predictive patterns from data which would enhance our understanding and control of underlying physical, biological, and other natural processes, beyond just building accurate outcome black-box predictors. Common examples include selecting biomarkers in biological procedures, finding relevant brain activity locations which are predictive about brain states and processes based on fMRI data, and identifying network bottlenecks best explaining end-to-end performance. Moreover, the research and applications of efficient recovery of high-dimensional sparse signals from a relatively small number of observations, which is the main focus of compressed sensing or compressive sensing, have rapidly grown and became an extremely intense area of study beyond classical signal processing. Likewise interestingly, sparse modeling is directly related to various artificial vision tasks, such as image denoising, segmentation, restoration and superresolution, object or face detection and recognition in visual scenes, and action recognition.   In this manuscript, we provide a brief introduction of the basic theory underlying sparse representation and compressive sensing, and then discuss some methods for recovering sparse solutions to optimization problems in effective way, together with some applications of sparse recovery in a machine learning problem known as sparse dictionary learning.

- **Summary**: Modern transformer-based models designed for computer vision have outperformed humans across a spectrum of visual tasks. However, critical tasks, such as medical image interpretation or autonomous driving, still require reliance on human judgments. This work demonstrates how human visual input, specifically fixations collected from an eye-tracking device, can be integrated into transformer models to improve accuracy across multiple driving situations and datasets. First, we establish the significance of fixation regions in left-right driving decisions, as observed in both human subjects and a Vision Transformer (ViT). By comparing the similarity between human fixation maps and ViT attention weights, we reveal the dynamics of overlap across individual heads and layers. This overlap is exploited for model pruning without compromising accuracy. Thereafter, we incorporate information from the driving scene with fixation data, employing a "joint space-fixation" (JSF) attention setup. Lastly, we propose a "fixation-attention intersection" (FAX) loss to train the ViT model to attend to the same regions that humans fixated on. We find that the ViT performance is improved in accuracy and number of training epochs when using JSF and FAX. These results hold significant implications for human-guided artificial intelligence.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a fast adaptive federated meta-learning (FAM) framework for collaboratively learning a single global model, which can then be personalized locally on individual clients. Federated learning enables multiple clients to collaborate to train a model without sharing data. Clients with insufficient data or data diversity participate in federated learning to learn a model with superior performance. Nonetheless, learning suffers when data distributions diverge. There is a need to learn a global model that can be adapted using client's specific information to create personalised models on clients is required. MRI data suffers from this problem, wherein, one, due to data acquisition challenges, local data at a site is sufficient for training an accurate model and two, there is a restriction of data sharing due to privacy concerns and three, there is a need for personalization of a learnt shared global model on account of domain shift across client sites. The global model is sparse and captures the common features in the MRI. This skeleton network is grown on each client to train a personalised model by learning additional client-specific parameters from local data. Experimental results show that the personalization process at each client quickly converges using a limited number of epochs. The personalized client models outperformed the locally trained models, demonstrating the efficacy of the FAM mechanism. Additionally, the sparse parameter set to be communicated during federated learning drastically reduced communication overhead, which makes the scheme viable for networks with limited resources.

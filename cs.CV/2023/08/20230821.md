- **Summary**: To date, the majority of video retrieval systems have been optimized for a "single-shot" scenario in which the user submits a query in isolation, ignoring previous interactions with the system. Recently, there has been renewed interest in interactive systems to enhance retrieval, but existing approaches are complex and deliver limited gains in performance. In this work, we revisit this topic and propose several simple yet effective baselines for interactive video retrieval via question-answering. We employ a VideoQA model to simulate user interactions and show that this enables the productive study of the interactive retrieval task without access to ground truth dialogue data. Experiments on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and AVSD show that our framework using question-based interaction significantly improves the performance of text-based video retrieval systems.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have recently demonstrated impressive results on various generative tasks.Despite its promises, the learned representations of pre-trained DPMs, however, have not been fully understood. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the representation power of DPMs, and propose a novel knowledge transfer method that leverages the knowledge acquired by generative DPMs for recognition tasks. Our study begins by examining the feature space of DPMs, revealing that DPMs are inherently denoising autoencoders that balance the representation learning with regularizing model capacity. To this end, we introduce a novel knowledge transfer paradigm named RepFusion. Our paradigm extracts representations at different time steps from off-the-shelf DPMs and dynamically employs them as supervision for student networks, in which the optimal time is determined through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach on several image classification, semantic segmentation, and landmark detection benchmarks, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our results uncover the potential of DPMs as a powerful tool for representation learning and provide insights into the usefulness of generative models beyond sample generation.

- **Summary**: We exploit the potential of the large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model to enhance scene text detection and spotting tasks, transforming it into a robust backbone, FastTCM-CR50. This backbone utilizes visual prompt learning and cross-attention in CLIP to extract image and text-based prior knowledge. Using predefined and learnable prompts, FastTCM-CR50 introduces an instance-language matching process to enhance the synergy between image and text embeddings, thereby refining text regions. Our Bimodal Similarity Matching (BSM) module facilitates dynamic language prompt generation, enabling offline computations and improving performance. FastTCM-CR50 offers several advantages: 1) It can enhance existing text detectors and spotters, improving performance by an average of 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. 2) It outperforms the previous TCM-CR50 backbone, yielding an average improvement of 0.2% and 0.56% in text detection and spotting tasks, along with a 48.5% increase in inference speed. 3) It showcases robust few-shot training capabilities. Utilizing only 10% of the supervised data, FastTCM-CR50 improves performance by an average of 26.5% and 5.5% for text detection and spotting tasks, respectively. 4) It consistently enhances performance on out-of-distribution text detection and spotting datasets, particularly the NightTime-ArT subset from ICDAR2019-ArT and the DOTA dataset for oriented object detection.

- **Summary**: Accurate robotic manipulation of test tubes in biology and medical industries is becoming increasingly important to address workforce shortages and improve worker safety. The detection and localization of test tubes are essential for the robots to successfully manipulate test tubes. In this paper, we present a framework to detect and estimate poses for the in-rack test tubes using color and depth data. The methodology involves the utilization of a YOLO object detector to effectively classify and localize both the test tubes and the tube racks within the provided image data. Subsequently, the pose of the tube rack is estimated through point cloud registration techniques. During the process of estimating the poses of the test tubes, we capitalize on constraints derived from the arrangement of rack slots. By employing an optimization-based algorithm, we effectively evaluate and refine the pose of the test tubes. This strategic approach ensures the robustness of pose estimation, even when confronted with noisy and incomplete point cloud data.

- **Summary**: The goal of this paper is to detect what has changed, if anything, between two "in the wild" images of the same 3D scene acquired from different camera positions and at different temporal instances. The open-set nature of this problem, occlusions/dis-occlusions due to the shift in viewpoint, and the lack of suitable training datasets, presents substantial challenges in devising a solution.   To address this problem, we contribute a change detection model that is trained entirely on synthetic data and is class-agnostic, yet it is performant out-of-the-box on real world images without requiring fine-tuning. Our solution entails a "register and difference" approach that leverages self-supervised frozen embeddings and feature differences, which allows the model to generalise to a wide variety of scenes and domains. The model is able to operate directly on two RGB images, without requiring access to ground truth camera intrinsics, extrinsics, depth maps, point clouds, or additional before-after images. Finally, we collect and release a new evaluation dataset consisting of real-world image pairs with human-annotated differences and demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

- **Summary**: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) play a pivotal role in learning potent representations, delivering outstanding results across various 3D perception tasks essential for autonomous driving. In real-world driving scenarios, it's commonplace to deploy multiple sensors for comprehensive environment perception. While integrating multi-modal features from these sensors can produce rich and powerful features, there is a noticeable gap in MAE methods addressing this integration. This research delves into multi-modal Masked Autoencoders tailored for a unified representation space in autonomous driving, aiming to pioneer a more efficient fusion of two distinct modalities. To intricately marry the semantics inherent in images with the geometric intricacies of LiDAR point clouds, the UniM$^2$AE is proposed. This model stands as a potent yet straightforward, multi-modal self-supervised pre-training framework, mainly consisting of two designs. First, it projects the features from both modalities into a cohesive 3D volume space, ingeniously expanded from the bird's eye view (BEV) to include the height dimension. The extension makes it possible to back-project the informative features, obtained by fusing features from both modalities, into their native modalities to reconstruct the multiple masked inputs. Second, the Multi-modal 3D Interactive Module (MMIM) is invoked to facilitate the efficient inter-modal interaction during the interaction process. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes Dataset attest to the efficacy of UniM$^2$AE, indicating enhancements in 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation by 1.2\%(NDS) and 6.5\% (mIoU), respectively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel layer-adaptive weight-pruning approach for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that addresses the challenge of optimizing the output distortion minimization while adhering to a target pruning ratio constraint. Our approach takes into account the collective influence of all layers to design a layer-adaptive pruning scheme. We discover and utilize a very important additivity property of output distortion caused by pruning weights on multiple layers. This property enables us to formulate the pruning as a combinatorial optimization problem and efficiently solve it through dynamic programming. By decomposing the problem into sub-problems, we achieve linear time complexity, making our optimization algorithm fast and feasible to run on CPUs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves remarkable improvements, outperforming others by up to 1.0% for ResNet-32, 0.5% for VGG-16, and 0.7% for DenseNet-121 in terms of top-1 accuracy. On ImageNet, we achieve up to 4.7% and 4.6% higher top-1 accuracy compared to other methods for VGG-16 and ResNet-50, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness and practicality of our approach for enhancing DNN performance through layer-adaptive weight pruning.

- **Summary**: Intuitive physics is pivotal for human understanding of the physical world, enabling prediction and interpretation of events even in infancy. Nonetheless, replicating this level of intuitive physics in artificial intelligence (AI) remains a formidable challenge. This study introduces X-VoE, a comprehensive benchmark dataset, to assess AI agents' grasp of intuitive physics. Built on the developmental psychology-rooted Violation of Expectation (VoE) paradigm, X-VoE establishes a higher bar for the explanatory capacities of intuitive physics models. Each VoE scenario within X-VoE encompasses three distinct settings, probing models' comprehension of events and their underlying explanations. Beyond model evaluation, we present an explanation-based learning system that captures physics dynamics and infers occluded object states solely from visual sequences, without explicit occlusion labels. Experimental outcomes highlight our model's alignment with human commonsense when tested against X-VoE. A remarkable feature is our model's ability to visually expound VoE events by reconstructing concealed scenes. Concluding, we discuss the findings' implications and outline future research directions. Through X-VoE, we catalyze the advancement of AI endowed with human-like intuitive physics capabilities.

- **Summary**: Incremental learning aims to overcome catastrophic forgetting when learning deep networks from sequential tasks. With impressive learning efficiency and performance, prompt-based methods adopt a fixed backbone to sequential tasks by learning task-specific prompts. However, existing prompt-based methods heavily rely on strong pretraining (typically trained on ImageNet-21k), and we find that their models could be trapped if the potential gap between the pretraining task and unknown future tasks is large. In this work, we develop a learnable Adaptive Prompt Generator (APG). The key is to unify the prompt retrieval and prompt learning processes into a learnable prompt generator. Hence, the whole prompting process can be optimized to reduce the negative effects of the gap between tasks effectively. To make our APG avoid learning ineffective knowledge, we maintain a knowledge pool to regularize APG with the feature distribution of each class. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms advanced methods in exemplar-free incremental learning without (strong) pretraining. Besides, under strong retraining, our method also has comparable performance to existing prompt-based models, showing that our method can still benefit from pretraining.

- **Summary**: Histopathological images are the gold standard for diagnosing liver cancer. However, the accuracy of fully digital diagnosis in computational pathology needs to be improved. In this paper, in order to solve the problem of multi-label and low classification accuracy of histopathology images, we propose a locally deep convolutional Swim framework (LDCSF) to classify multi-label histopathology images. In order to be able to provide local field of view diagnostic results, we propose the LDCSF model, which consists of a Swin transformer module, a local depth convolution (LDC) module, a feature reconstruction (FR) module, and a ResNet module. The Swin transformer module reduces the amount of computation generated by the attention mechanism by limiting the attention to each window. The LDC then reconstructs the attention map and performs convolution operations in multiple channels, passing the resulting feature map to the next layer. The FR module uses the corresponding weight coefficient vectors obtained from the channels to dot product with the original feature map vector matrix to generate representative feature maps. Finally, the residual network undertakes the final classification task. As a result, the classification accuracy of LDCSF for interstitial area, necrosis, non-tumor and tumor reached 0.9460, 0.9960, 0.9808, 0.9847, respectively. Finally, we use the results of multi-label pathological image classification to calculate the tumor-to-stromal ratio, which lays the foundation for the analysis of the microenvironment of liver cancer histopathological images. Second, we released a multilabel histopathology image of liver cancer, our code and data are available at https://github.com/panliangrui/LSF.

- **Summary**: While current visual captioning models have achieved impressive performance, they often assume that the image is well-captured and provides a complete view of the scene. In real-world scenarios, however, a single image may not offer a good viewpoint, hindering fine-grained scene understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel task called Embodied Captioning, which equips visual captioning models with navigation capabilities, enabling them to actively explore the scene and reduce visual ambiguity from suboptimal viewpoints. Specifically, starting at a random viewpoint, an agent must navigate the environment to gather information from different viewpoints and generate a comprehensive paragraph describing all objects in the scene. To support this task, we build the ET-Cap dataset with Kubric simulator, consisting of 10K 3D scenes with cluttered objects and three annotated paragraphs per scene. We propose a Cascade Embodied Captioning model (CaBOT), which comprises of a navigator and a captioner, to tackle this task. The navigator predicts which actions to take in the environment, while the captioner generates a paragraph description based on the whole navigation trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms other carefully designed baselines. Our dataset, codes and models are available at https://aim3-ruc.github.io/ExploreAndTell.

- **Summary**: Histopathology image segmentation is the gold standard for diagnosing cancer, and can indicate cancer prognosis. However, histopathology image segmentation requires high-quality masks, so many studies now use imagelevel labels to achieve pixel-level segmentation to reduce the need for fine-grained annotation. To solve this problem, we propose an attention-based cross-view feature consistency end-to-end pseudo-mask generation framework named CVFC based on the attention mechanism. Specifically, CVFC is a three-branch joint framework composed of two Resnet38 and one Resnet50, and the independent branch multi-scale integrated feature map to generate a class activation map (CAM); in each branch, through down-sampling and The expansion method adjusts the size of the CAM; the middle branch projects the feature matrix to the query and key feature spaces, and generates a feature space perception matrix through the connection layer and inner product to adjust and refine the CAM of each branch; finally, through the feature consistency loss and feature cross loss to optimize the parameters of CVFC in co-training mode. After a large number of experiments, An IoU of 0.7122 and a fwIoU of 0.7018 are obtained on the WSSS4LUAD dataset, which outperforms HistoSegNet, SEAM, C-CAM, WSSS-Tissue, and OEEM, respectively.

- **Summary**: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) aims to distinguish common and private classes between the source and target domains where domain shift exists. Recently, due to more stringent data restrictions, researchers have introduced Source-Free UniDA (SF-UniDA) in more realistic scenarios. SF-UniDA methods eliminate the need for direct access to source samples when performing adaptation to the target domain. However, existing SF-UniDA methods still require an extensive quantity of labeled source samples to train a source model, resulting in significant labeling costs. To tackle this issue, we present a novel Classifier-Oriented Calibration (COCA) method. This method, which leverages textual prototypes, is formulated for the source model based on few-shot learning. Specifically, we propose studying few-shot learning, usually explored for closed-set scenarios, to identify common and domain-private classes despite a significant domain shift between source and target domains. Essentially, we present a novel paradigm based on the vision-language model to learn SF-UniDA and hugely reduce the labeling costs on the source domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art UniDA and SF-UniDA models.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization poses a serious challenge for modern deep learning (DL). OOD data consists of test data that is significantly different from the model's training data. DL models that perform well on in-domain test data could struggle on OOD data. Overcoming this discrepancy is essential to the reliable deployment of DL. Proper model calibration decreases the number of spurious connections that are made between model features and class outputs. Hence, calibrated DL can improve OOD generalization by only learning features that are truly indicative of the respective classes. Previous work proposed domain-aware model calibration (DOMINO) to improve DL calibration, but it lacks designs for model generalizability to OOD data. In this work, we propose DOMINO++, a dual-guidance and dynamic domain-aware loss regularization focused on OOD generalizability. DOMINO++ integrates expert-guided and data-guided knowledge in its regularization. Unlike DOMINO which imposed a fixed scaling and regularization rate, DOMINO++ designs a dynamic scaling factor and an adaptive regularization rate. Comprehensive evaluations compare DOMINO++ with DOMINO and the baseline model for head tissue segmentation from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) on OOD data. The OOD data consists of synthetic noisy and rotated datasets, as well as real data using a different MRI scanner from a separate site. DOMINO++'s superior performance demonstrates its potential to improve the trustworthy deployment of DL on real clinical data.

- **Summary**: The ubiquitous use of face recognition has sparked increasing privacy concerns, as unauthorized access to sensitive face images could compromise the information of individuals. This paper presents an in-depth study of the privacy protection of face images' visual information and against recovery. Drawing on the perceptual disparity between humans and models, we propose to conceal visual information by pruning human-perceivable low-frequency components. For impeding recovery, we first elucidate the seeming paradox between reducing model-exploitable information and retaining high recognition accuracy. Based on recent theoretical insights and our observation on model attention, we propose a solution to the dilemma, by advocating for the training and inference of recognition models on randomly selected frequency components. We distill our findings into a novel privacy-preserving face recognition method, PartialFace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PartialFace effectively balances privacy protection goals and recognition accuracy. Code is available at: https://github.com/Tencent/TFace.

- **Summary**: Scale variation is a deep-rooted problem in object counting, which has not been effectively addressed by existing scale-aware algorithms. An important factor is that they typically involve cooperative learning across multi-resolutions, which could be suboptimal for learning the most discriminative features from each scale. In this paper, we propose a novel method termed STEERER (\textbf{S}elec\textbf{T}iv\textbf{E} inh\textbf{ER}itance l\textbf{E}a\textbf{R}ning) that addresses the issue of scale variations in object counting. STEERER selects the most suitable scale for patch objects to boost feature extraction and only inherits discriminative features from lower to higher resolution progressively. The main insights of STEERER are a dedicated Feature Selection and Inheritance Adaptor (FSIA), which selectively forwards scale-customized features at each scale, and a Masked Selection and Inheritance Loss (MSIL) that helps to achieve high-quality density maps across all scales. Our experimental results on nine datasets with counting and localization tasks demonstrate the unprecedented scale generalization ability of STEERER.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we revisit the limitations of anchor-based lane detection methods, which have predominantly focused on fixed anchors that stem from the edges of the image, disregarding their versatility and quality. To overcome the inflexibility of anchors, we decompose them into learning the heat map of starting points and their associated directions. This decomposition removes the limitations on the starting point of anchors, making our algorithm adaptable to different lane types in various datasets. To enhance the quality of anchors, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA) for Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). This significantly increases the receptive field, which is crucial in capturing the sufficient context as lane lines typically run throughout the entire image. We have named our proposed system the Anchor Decomposition Network (ADNet). Additionally, we propose the General Lane IoU (GLIoU) loss, which significantly improves the performance of ADNet in complex scenarios. Experimental results on three widely used lane detection benchmarks, VIL-100, CULane, and TuSimple, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on VIL-100 and exhibits competitive accuracy on CULane and TuSimple. Code and models will be released on https://github.com/ Sephirex-X/ADNet.

- **Summary**: The task of medical image segmentation presents unique challenges, necessitating both localized and holistic semantic understanding to accurately delineate areas of interest, such as critical tissues or aberrant features. This complexity is heightened in medical image segmentation due to the high degree of inter-class similarities, intra-class variations, and possible image obfuscation. The segmentation task further diversifies when considering the study of histopathology slides for autoimmune diseases like dermatomyositis. The analysis of cell inflammation and interaction in these cases has been less studied due to constraints in data acquisition pipelines. Despite the progressive strides in medical science, we lack a comprehensive collection of autoimmune diseases. As autoimmune diseases globally escalate in prevalence and exhibit associations with COVID-19, their study becomes increasingly essential. While there is existing research that integrates artificial intelligence in the analysis of various autoimmune diseases, the exploration of dermatomyositis remains relatively underrepresented. In this paper, we present a deep-learning approach tailored for Medical image segmentation. Our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques by an average of 12.26% for U-Net and 12.04% for U-Net++ across the ResNet family of encoders on the dermatomyositis dataset. Furthermore, we probe the importance of optimizing loss function weights and benchmark our methodology on three challenging medical image segmentation tasks

- **Summary**: In this work, we focus on synthesizing high-quality textures on 3D meshes. We present Point-UV diffusion, a coarse-to-fine pipeline that marries the denoising diffusion model with UV mapping to generate 3D consistent and high-quality texture images in UV space. We start with introducing a point diffusion model to synthesize low-frequency texture components with our tailored style guidance to tackle the biased color distribution. The derived coarse texture offers global consistency and serves as a condition for the subsequent UV diffusion stage, aiding in regularizing the model to generate a 3D consistent UV texture image. Then, a UV diffusion model with hybrid conditions is developed to enhance the texture fidelity in the 2D UV space. Our method can process meshes of any genus, generating diversified, geometry-compatible, and high-fidelity textures. Code is available at https://cvmi-lab.github.io/Point-UV-Diffusion

- **Summary**: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) imagery heavily relies on the availability of annotated high-resolution aerial data. However, the scarcity of large-scale real datasets with pixel-level annotations poses a significant challenge to researchers as the limited number of images in existing datasets hinders the effectiveness of deep learning models that require a large amount of training data. In this paper, we propose a multimodal synthetic dataset containing both images and 3D data taken at multiple flying heights to address these limitations. In addition to object-level annotations, the provided data also include pixel-level labeling in 28 classes, enabling exploration of the potential advantages in tasks like semantic segmentation. In total, our dataset contains 72k labeled samples that allow for effective training of deep architectures showing promising results in synthetic-to-real adaptation. The dataset will be made publicly available to support the development of novel computer vision methods targeting UAV applications.

- **Summary**: Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) has attracted extensive attention recently. However, current methods cannot explicitly study the interactions between different symbols, which may fail when faced similar symbols. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple but efficient method to enhance semantic interaction learning (SIL). Specifically, we firstly construct a semantic graph based on the statistical symbol co-occurrence probabilities. Then we design a semantic aware module (SAM), which projects the visual and classification feature into semantic space. The cosine distance between different projected vectors indicates the correlation between symbols. And jointly optimizing HMER and SIL can explicitly enhances the model's understanding of symbol relationships. In addition, SAM can be easily plugged into existing attention-based models for HMER and consistently bring improvement. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed module can effectively enhance the recognition performance. Our method achieves better recognition performance than prior arts on both CROHME and HME100K datasets.

- **Summary**: With the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), a surge of Generative Vision-Language Models (GVLMs) have been constructed via multimodal instruction tuning. The tuning recipe substantially deviates from the common contrastive vision-language learning. However, the performance of GVLMs in multimodal compositional reasoning remains largely unexplored, as existing evaluation metrics and benchmarks focus predominantly on assessing contrastive models like CLIP. In this paper, we examine the potential evaluation metrics to assess the GVLMs and hypothesize generative score methods are suitable for evaluating compositionality. In addition, current benchmarks tend to prioritize syntactic correctness over semantics. The presence of morphological bias in these benchmarks can be exploited by GVLMs, leading to ineffective evaluations. To combat this, we define a MorphoBias Score to quantify the morphological bias and propose a novel LLM-based strategy to calibrate the bias. Moreover, a challenging task is added to evaluate the robustness of GVLMs against inherent inclination toward syntactic correctness. We include the calibrated dataset and the task into a new benchmark, namely MOrphologicall De-biased Benchmark (MODE). Our study provides the first unbiased benchmark for the compositionality of GVLMs, facilitating future research in this direction. We will release our code and datasets.

- **Summary**: Due to distribution shift, deep learning based methods for image dehazing suffer from performance degradation when applied to real-world hazy images. In this paper, we consider a dehazing framework based on conditional diffusion models for improved generalization to real haze. First, we find that optimizing the training objective of diffusion models, i.e., Gaussian noise vectors, is non-trivial. The spectral bias of deep networks hinders the higher frequency modes in Gaussian vectors from being learned and hence impairs the reconstruction of image details. To tackle this issue, we design a network unit, named Frequency Compensation block (FCB), with a bank of filters that jointly emphasize the mid-to-high frequencies of an input signal. We demonstrate that diffusion models with FCB achieve significant gains in both perceptual and distortion metrics. Second, to further boost the generalization performance, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline, HazeAug, to augment haze in terms of degree and diversity. Within the framework, a solid baseline for blind dehazing is set up where models are trained on synthetic hazy-clean pairs, and directly generalize to real data. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed dehazing diffusion model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

- **Summary**: Understanding digital documents is like solving a puzzle, especially historical ones. Document Layout Analysis (DLA) helps with this puzzle by dividing documents into sections like paragraphs, images, and tables. This is crucial for machines to read and understand these documents. In the DL Sprint 2.0 competition, we worked on understanding Bangla documents. We used a dataset called BaDLAD with lots of examples. We trained a special model called Mask R-CNN to help with this understanding. We made this model better by step-by-step hyperparameter tuning, and we achieved a good dice score of 0.889. However, not everything went perfectly. We tried using a model trained for English documents, but it didn't fit well with Bangla. This showed us that each language has its own challenges. Our solution for the DL Sprint 2.0 is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dlsprint2/discussion/432201 along with notebooks, weights, and inference notebook.

- **Summary**: Multi-view 3D detection based on BEV (bird-eye-view) has recently achieved significant improvements. However, the huge memory consumption of state-of-the-art models makes it hard to deploy them on vehicles, and the non-trivial latency will affect the real-time perception of streaming applications. Despite the wide application of quantization to lighten models, we show in our paper that directly applying quantization in BEV tasks will 1) make the training unstable, and 2) lead to intolerable performance degradation. To solve these issues, our method QD-BEV enables a novel view-guided distillation (VGD) objective, which can stabilize the quantization-aware training (QAT) while enhancing the model performance by leveraging both image features and BEV features. Our experiments show that QD-BEV achieves similar or even better accuracy than previous methods with significant efficiency gains. On the nuScenes datasets, the 4-bit weight and 6-bit activation quantized QD-BEV-Tiny model achieves 37.2% NDS with only 15.8 MB model size, outperforming BevFormer-Tiny by 1.8% with an 8x model compression. On the Small and Base variants, QD-BEV models also perform superbly and achieve 47.9% NDS (28.2 MB) and 50.9% NDS (32.9 MB), respectively.

- **Summary**: Intracerebral hemorrhage is one of the diseases with the highest mortality and poorest prognosis worldwide. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) typically presents acutely, prompt and expedited radiological examination is crucial for diagnosis, localization, and quantification of the hemorrhage. Early detection and accurate segmentation of perihematomal edema (PHE) play a critical role in guiding appropriate clinical intervention and enhancing patient prognosis. However, the progress and assessment of computer-aided diagnostic methods for PHE segmentation and detection face challenges due to the scarcity of publicly accessible brain CT image datasets. This study establishes a publicly available CT dataset named PHE-SICH-CT-IDS for perihematomal edema in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. The dataset comprises 120 brain CT scans and 7,022 CT images, along with corresponding medical information of the patients. To demonstrate its effectiveness, classical algorithms for semantic segmentation, object detection, and radiomic feature extraction are evaluated. The experimental results confirm the suitability of PHE-SICH-CT-IDS for assessing the performance of segmentation, detection and radiomic feature extraction methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset for PHE in SICH, comprising various data formats suitable for applications across diverse medical scenarios. We believe that PHE-SICH-CT-IDS will allure researchers to explore novel algorithms, providing valuable support for clinicians and patients in the clinical setting.

- **Summary**: Multi-view representation learning aims to capture comprehensive information from multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive learning to different views in a pairwise manner, which is still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are coequally treated; evenly measuring the similarities between terms might interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works study the theoretical framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning paradigm from the perspective of information theory and then propose a novel information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive architecture, namely Information theory-guided hierarchical Progressive Multi-view Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC constructs self-adjusted contrasting pools, which are adaptively modified by a view filter. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn representations and reduce the gradient interference. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art deep neural networks are trained with large amounts (millions or even billions) of data. The expensive computation and memory costs make it difficult to train them on limited hardware resources, especially for recent popular large language models (LLM) and computer vision models (CV). Recent popular dataset distillation methods are thus developed, aiming to reduce the number of training samples via synthesizing small-scale datasets via gradient matching. However, as the gradient calculation is coupled with the specific network architecture, the synthesized dataset is biased and performs poorly when used for training unseen architectures. To address these limitations, we present dataset quantization (DQ), a new framework to compress large-scale datasets into small subsets which can be used for training any neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DQ is able to generate condensed small datasets for training unseen network architectures with state-of-the-art compression ratios for lossless model training. To the best of our knowledge, DQ is the first method that can successfully distill large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1k with a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, with 60% data from ImageNet and 20% data from Alpaca's instruction tuning data, the models can be trained with negligible or no performance drop for both vision tasks (including classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) as well as language tasks (including instruction tuning tasks such as BBH and DROP).

- **Summary**: Single-view depth estimation can be remarkably effective if there is enough ground-truth depth data for supervised training. However, there are scenarios, especially in medicine in the case of endoscopies, where such data cannot be obtained. In such cases, multi-view self-supervision and synthetic-to-real transfer serve as alternative approaches, however, with a considerable performance reduction in comparison to supervised case. Instead, we propose a single-view self-supervised method that achieves a performance similar to the supervised case. In some medical devices, such as endoscopes, the camera and light sources are co-located at a small distance from the target surfaces. Thus, we can exploit that, for any given albedo and surface orientation, pixel brightness is inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the surface, providing a strong single-view self-supervisory signal. In our experiments, our self-supervised models deliver accuracies comparable to those of fully supervised ones, while being applicable without depth ground-truth data.

- **Summary**: Existing techniques for text detection can be broadly classified into two primary groups: segmentation-based methods and regression-based methods. Segmentation models offer enhanced robustness to font variations but require intricate post-processing, leading to high computational overhead. Regression-based methods undertake instance-aware prediction but face limitations in robustness and data efficiency due to their reliance on high-level representations. In our academic pursuit, we propose SRFormer, a unified DETR-based model with amalgamated Segmentation and Regression, aiming at the synergistic harnessing of the inherent robustness in segmentation representations, along with the straightforward post-processing of instance-level regression. Our empirical analysis indicates that favorable segmentation predictions can be obtained at the initial decoder layers. In light of this, we constrain the incorporation of segmentation branches to the first few decoder layers and employ progressive regression refinement in subsequent layers, achieving performance gains while minimizing additional computational load from the mask. Furthermore, we propose a Mask-informed Query Enhancement module. We take the segmentation result as a natural soft-ROI to pool and extract robust pixel representations, which are then employed to enhance and diversify instance queries. Extensive experimentation across multiple benchmarks has yielded compelling findings, highlighting our method's exceptional robustness, superior training and data efficiency, as well as its state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: The development of ubiquitous computing and sensing devices has brought about novel interaction scenarios such as mixed reality and IoT (e.g., smart home), which pose new demands for the next generation of natural user interfaces (NUI). Human hand, benefit for the large degree-of-freedom, serves as a medium through which people interact with the external world in their daily lives, thus also being regarded as the main entry of NUI. Unfortunately, current hand tracking system is largely confined on first perspective vision-based solutions, which suffer from optical artifacts and are not practical in ubiquitous environments. In my thesis, I rethink this problem by analyzing the underlying logic in terms of sensor, behavior, and semantics, constituting a research framework for achieving ubiquitous intelligent hand interaction. Then I summarize my previous research topics and illustrated the future research directions based on my research framework.

- **Summary**: We propose to learn non-convex regularizers with a prescribed upper bound on their weak-convexity modulus. Such regularizers give rise to variational denoisers that minimize a convex energy. They rely on few parameters (less than 15,000) and offer a signal-processing interpretation as they mimic handcrafted sparsity-promoting regularizers. Through numerical experiments, we show that such denoisers outperform convex-regularization methods as well as the popular BM3D denoiser. Additionally, the learned regularizer can be deployed to solve inverse problems with iterative schemes that provably converge. For both CT and MRI reconstruction, the regularizer generalizes well and offers an excellent tradeoff between performance, number of parameters, guarantees, and interpretability when compared to other data-driven approaches.

- **Summary**: Training deep generative models usually requires a large amount of data. To alleviate the data collection cost, the task of zero-shot GAN adaptation aims to reuse well-trained generators to synthesize images of an unseen target domain without any further training samples. Due to the data absence, the textual description of the target domain and the vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, are utilized to effectively guide the generator. However, with only a single representative text feature instead of real images, the synthesized images gradually lose diversity as the model is optimized, which is also known as mode collapse. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel method to find semantic variations of the target text in the CLIP space. Specifically, we explore diverse semantic variations based on the informative text feature of the target domain while regularizing the uncontrolled deviation of the semantic information. With the obtained variations, we design a novel directional moment loss that matches the first and second moments of image and text direction distributions. Moreover, we introduce elastic weight consolidation and a relation consistency loss to effectively preserve valuable content information from the source domain, e.g., appearances. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods in ensuring sample diversity in various scenarios of zero-shot GAN adaptation. We also conduct ablation studies to validate the effect of each proposed component. Notably, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art on zero-shot GAN adaptation in terms of both diversity and quality.

- **Summary**: Hand action recognition is essential. Communication, human-robot interactions, and gesture control are dependent on it. Skeleton-based action recognition traditionally includes hands, which belong to the classes which remain challenging to correctly recognize to date. We propose a method specifically designed for hand action recognition which uses relative angular embeddings and local Spherical Harmonics to create novel hand representations. The use of Spherical Harmonics creates rotation-invariant representations which make hand action recognition even more robust against inter-subject differences and viewpoint changes. We conduct extensive experiments on the hand joints in the First-Person Hand Action Benchmark with RGB-D Videos and 3D Hand Pose Annotations, and on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset, demonstrating the benefit of using Local Spherical Harmonics Representations.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision tasks. However, their potential in rotation-sensitive scenarios has not been fully explored, and this limitation may be inherently attributed to the lack of spatial invariance in the data-forwarding process. In this study, we present a novel approach, termed Spatial Transform Decoupling (STD), providing a simple-yet-effective solution for oriented object detection with ViTs. Built upon stacked ViT blocks, STD utilizes separate network branches to predict the position, size, and angle of bounding boxes, effectively harnessing the spatial transform potential of ViTs in a divide-and-conquer fashion. Moreover, by aggregating cascaded activation masks (CAMs) computed upon the regressed parameters, STD gradually enhances features within regions of interest (RoIs), which complements the self-attention mechanism. Without bells and whistles, STD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets including DOTA-v1.0 (82.24% mAP) and HRSC2016 (98.55% mAP), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: The field of Computer Vision (CV) was born with the single grand goal of complete image understanding: providing a complete semantic interpretation of an input image. What exactly this goal entails is not immediately straightforward, but theoretical hierarchies of visual understanding point towards a top level of full semantics, within which sits the most complex and subjective information humans can detect from visual data. In particular, non-concrete concepts including emotions, social values and ideologies seem to be protagonists of this "high-level" visual semantic understanding. While such "abstract concepts" are critical tools for image management and retrieval, their automatic recognition is still a challenge, exactly because they rest at the top of the "semantic pyramid": the well-known semantic gap problem is worsened given their lack of unique perceptual referents, and their reliance on more unspecific features than concrete concepts. Given that there seems to be very scarce explicit work within CV on the task of abstract social concept (ASC) detection, and that many recent works seem to discuss similar non-concrete entities by using different terminology, in this survey we provide a systematic review of CV work that explicitly or implicitly approaches the problem of abstract (specifically social) concept detection from still images. Specifically, this survey performs and provides: (1) A study and clustering of high level visual understanding semantic elements from a multidisciplinary perspective (computer science, visual studies, and cognitive perspectives); (2) A study and clustering of high level visual understanding computer vision tasks dealing with the identified semantic elements, so as to identify current CV work that implicitly deals with AC detection.

- **Summary**: Depth sensing is a crucial function of unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous vehicles. Due to the small size and simple structure of monocular cameras, there has been a growing interest in depth estimation from a single RGB image. However, state-of-the-art monocular CNN-based depth estimation methods using fairly complex deep neural networks are too slow for real-time inference on embedded platforms. This paper addresses the problem of real-time depth estimation on embedded systems. We propose two efficient and lightweight encoder-decoder network architectures, RT-MonoDepth and RT-MonoDepth-S, to reduce computational complexity and latency. Our methodologies demonstrate that it is possible to achieve similar accuracy as prior state-of-the-art works on depth estimation at a faster inference speed. Our proposed networks, RT-MonoDepth and RT-MonoDepth-S, runs at 18.4\&30.5 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson Nano and 253.0\&364.1 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin on a single RGB image of resolution 640$\times$192, and achieve relative state-of-the-art accuracy on the KITTI dataset. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper achieves the best accuracy and fastest inference speed compared with existing fast monocular depth estimation methods.

- **Summary**: Temporal Action Detection (TAD) is challenging but fundamental for real-world video applications. Recently, DETR-based models have been devised for TAD but have not performed well yet. In this paper, we point out the problem in the self-attention of DETR for TAD; the attention modules focus on a few key elements, called temporal collapse problem. It degrades the capability of the encoder and decoder since their self-attention modules play no role. To solve the problem, we propose a novel framework, Self-DETR, which utilizes cross-attention maps of the decoder to reactivate self-attention modules. We recover the relationship between encoder features by simple matrix multiplication of the cross-attention map and its transpose. Likewise, we also get the information within decoder queries. By guiding collapsed self-attention maps with the guidance map calculated, we settle down the temporal collapse of self-attention modules in the encoder and decoder. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Self-DETR resolves the temporal collapse problem by keeping high diversity of attention over all layers.

- **Summary**: In daily life, humans utilize hands to manipulate objects. Modeling the shape of objects that are manipulated by the hand is essential for AI to comprehend daily tasks and to learn manipulation skills. However, previous approaches have encountered difficulties in reconstructing the precise shapes of hand-held objects, primarily owing to a deficiency in prior shape knowledge and inadequate data for training. As illustrated, given a particular type of tool, such as a mug, despite its infinite variations in shape and appearance, humans have a limited number of 'effective' modes and poses for its manipulation. This can be attributed to the fact that humans have mastered the shape prior of the 'mug' category, and can quickly establish the corresponding relations between different mug instances and the prior, such as where the rim and handle are located. In light of this, we propose a new method, CHORD, for Category-level Hand-held Object Reconstruction via shape Deformation. CHORD deforms a categorical shape prior for reconstructing the intra-class objects. To ensure accurate reconstruction, we empower CHORD with three types of awareness: appearance, shape, and interacting pose. In addition, we have constructed a new dataset, COMIC, of category-level hand-object interaction. COMIC contains a rich array of object instances, materials, hand interactions, and viewing directions. Extensive evaluation shows that CHORD outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative and qualitative measures.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning models achieve remarkable results on image classification for samples from classes that were not seen during training. However, such models must be trained from scratch with specialised methods: therefore, access to a training dataset is required when the need for zero-shot classification arises. In this paper, we aim to equip pre-trained models with zero-shot classification capabilities without the use of image data. We achieve this with our proposed Image-free Classifier Injection with Semantics (ICIS) that injects classifiers for new, unseen classes into pre-trained classification models in a post-hoc fashion without relying on image data. Instead, the existing classifier weights and simple class-wise descriptors, such as class names or attributes, are used. ICIS has two encoder-decoder networks that learn to reconstruct classifier weights from descriptors (and vice versa), exploiting (cross-)reconstruction and cosine losses to regularise the decoding process. Notably, ICIS can be cheaply trained and applied directly on top of pre-trained classification models. Experiments on benchmark ZSL datasets show that ICIS produces unseen classifier weights that achieve strong (generalised) zero-shot classification performance.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by applying human-imperceptible perturbations on clean inputs. Although many attack methods can achieve high success rates in the white-box setting, they also exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting. Recently, various methods have been proposed to improve adversarial transferability, in which the input transformation is one of the most effective methods. In this work, we notice that existing input transformation-based works mainly adopt the transformed data in the same domain for augmentation. Inspired by domain generalization, we aim to further improve the transferability using the data augmented from different domains. Specifically, a style transfer network can alter the distribution of low-level visual features in an image while preserving semantic content for humans. Hence, we propose a novel attack method named Style Transfer Method (STM) that utilizes a proposed arbitrary style transfer network to transform the images into different domains. To avoid inconsistent semantic information of stylized images for the classification network, we fine-tune the style transfer network and mix up the generated images added by random noise with the original images to maintain semantic consistency and boost input diversity. Extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-compatible dataset show that our proposed method can significantly improve the adversarial transferability on either normally trained models or adversarially trained models than state-of-the-art input transformation-based attacks.

- **Summary**: A number of computer vision deep regression approaches report improved results when adding a classification loss to the regression loss. Here, we explore why this is useful in practice and when it is beneficial. To do so, we start from precisely controlled dataset variations and data samplings and find that the effect of adding a classification loss is the most pronounced for regression with imbalanced data. We explain these empirical findings by formalizing the relation between the balanced and imbalanced regression losses. Finally, we show that our findings hold on two real imbalanced image datasets for depth estimation (NYUD2-DIR), and age estimation (IMDB-WIKI-DIR), and on the problem of imbalanced video progress prediction (Breakfast). Our main takeaway is: for a regression task, if the data sampling is imbalanced, then add a classification loss.

- **Summary**: Variations of target appearance such as deformations, illumination variance, occlusion, etc., are the major challenges of visual object tracking that negatively impact the performance of a tracker. An effective method to tackle these challenges is template update, which updates the template to reflect the change of appearance in the target object during tracking. However, with template updates, inadequate quality of new templates or inappropriate timing of updates may induce a model drift problem, which severely degrades the tracking performance. Here, we propose BackTrack, a robust and reliable method to quantify the confidence of the candidate template by backward tracking it on the past frames. Based on the confidence score of candidates from BackTrack, we can update the template with a reliable candidate at the right time while rejecting unreliable candidates. BackTrack is a generic template update scheme and is applicable to any template-based trackers. Extensive experiments on various tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of BackTrack over existing template update algorithms, as it achieves SOTA performance on various tracking benchmarks.

- **Summary**: While text-3D editing has made significant strides in leveraging score distillation sampling, emerging approaches still fall short in delivering separable, precise and consistent outcomes that are vital to content creation. In response, we introduce FocalDreamer, a framework that merges base shape with editable parts according to text prompts for fine-grained editing within desired regions. Specifically, equipped with geometry union and dual-path rendering, FocalDreamer assembles independent 3D parts into a complete object, tailored for convenient instance reuse and part-wise control. We propose geometric focal loss and style consistency regularization, which encourage focal fusion and congruent overall appearance. Furthermore, FocalDreamer generates high-fidelity geometry and PBR textures which are compatible with widely-used graphics engines. Extensive experiments have highlighted the superior editing capabilities of FocalDreamer in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Traditional ear disease diagnosis heavily depends on experienced specialists and specialized equipment, frequently resulting in misdiagnoses, treatment delays, and financial burdens for some patients. Utilizing deep learning models for efficient ear disease diagnosis has proven effective and affordable. However, existing research overlooked model inference speed and parameter size required for deployment. To tackle these challenges, we constructed a large-scale dataset comprising eight ear disease categories and normal ear canal samples from two hospitals. Inspired by ShuffleNetV2, we developed Best-EarNet, an ultrafast and ultralight network enabling real-time ear disease diagnosis. Best-EarNet incorporates the novel Local-Global Spatial Feature Fusion Module which can capture global and local spatial information simultaneously and guide the network to focus on crucial regions within feature maps at various levels, mitigating low accuracy issues. Moreover, our network uses multiple auxiliary classification heads for efficient parameter optimization. With 0.77M parameters, Best-EarNet achieves an average frames per second of 80 on CPU. Employing transfer learning and five-fold cross-validation with 22,581 images from Hospital-1, the model achieves an impressive 95.23% accuracy. External testing on 1,652 images from Hospital-2 validates its performance, yielding 92.14% accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art networks, Best-EarNet establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in practical applications. Most importantly, we developed an intelligent diagnosis system called Ear Keeper, which can be deployed on common electronic devices. By manipulating a compact electronic otoscope, users can perform comprehensive scanning and diagnosis of the ear canal using real-time video. This study provides a novel paradigm for ear endoscopy and other medical endoscopic image recognition applications.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the limitations of current datasets for 3D vision tasks in terms of accuracy, size, realism, and suitable imaging modalities for photometrically challenging objects. We propose a novel annotation and acquisition pipeline that enhances existing 3D perception and 6D object pose datasets. Our approach integrates robotic forward-kinematics, external infrared trackers, and improved calibration and annotation procedures. We present a multi-modal sensor rig, mounted on a robotic end-effector, and demonstrate how it is integrated into the creation of highly accurate datasets. Additionally, we introduce a freehand procedure for wider viewpoint coverage. Both approaches yield high-quality 3D data with accurate object and camera pose annotations. Our methods overcome the limitations of existing datasets and provide valuable resources for 3D vision research.

- **Summary**: The analysis of patterns of walking is an important area of research that has numerous applications in security, healthcare, sports and human-computer interaction. Lately, walking patterns have been regarded as a unique fingerprinting method for automatic person identification at a distance. In this work, we propose a novel gait recognition architecture called Gait Pyramid Transformer (GaitPT) that leverages pose estimation skeletons to capture unique walking patterns, without relying on appearance information. GaitPT adopts a hierarchical transformer architecture that effectively extracts both spatial and temporal features of movement in an anatomically consistent manner, guided by the structure of the human skeleton. Our results show that GaitPT achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other skeleton-based gait recognition works, in both controlled and in-the-wild scenarios. GaitPT obtains 82.6% average accuracy on CASIA-B, surpassing other works by a margin of 6%. Moreover, it obtains 52.16% Rank-1 accuracy on GREW, outperforming both skeleton-based and appearance-based approaches.

- **Summary**: 6D pose estimation pipelines that rely on RGB-only or RGB-D data show limitations for photometrically challenging objects with e.g. textureless surfaces, reflections or transparency. A supervised learning-based method utilising complementary polarisation information as input modality is proposed to overcome such limitations. This supervised approach is then extended to a self-supervised paradigm by leveraging physical characteristics of polarised light, thus eliminating the need for annotated real data. The methods achieve significant advancements in pose estimation by leveraging geometric information from polarised light and incorporating shape priors and invertible physical constraints.

- **Summary**: Psychological trait estimation from external factors such as movement and appearance is a challenging and long-standing problem in psychology, and is principally based on the psychological theory of embodiment. To date, attempts to tackle this problem have utilized private small-scale datasets with intrusive body-attached sensors. Potential applications of an automated system for psychological trait estimation include estimation of occupational fatigue and psychology, and marketing and advertisement. In this work, we propose PsyMo (Psychological traits from Motion), a novel, multi-purpose and multi-modal dataset for exploring psychological cues manifested in walking patterns. We gathered walking sequences from 312 subjects in 7 different walking variations and 6 camera angles. In conjunction with walking sequences, participants filled in 6 psychological questionnaires, totalling 17 psychometric attributes related to personality, self-esteem, fatigue, aggressiveness and mental health. We propose two evaluation protocols for psychological trait estimation. Alongside the estimation of self-reported psychological traits from gait, the dataset can be used as a drop-in replacement to benchmark methods for gait recognition. We anonymize all cues related to the identity of the subjects and publicly release only silhouettes, 2D / 3D human skeletons and 3D SMPL human meshes.

- **Summary**: Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable performance over finite datasets, yet whether the scores over the fixed benchmarks can sufficiently indicate the model's performance in the real world is still in discussion. In reality, an ideal robust model will probably behave similarly to the oracle (e.g., the human users), thus a good evaluation protocol is probably to evaluate the models' behaviors in comparison to the oracle. In this paper, we introduce a new robustness measurement that directly measures the image classification model's performance compared with a surrogate oracle (i.e., a foundation model). Besides, we design a simple method that can accomplish the evaluation beyond the scope of the benchmarks. Our method extends the image datasets with new samples that are sufficiently perturbed to be distinct from the ones in the original sets, but are still bounded within the same image-label structure the original test image represents, constrained by a foundation model pretrained with a large amount of samples. As a result, our new method will offer us a new way to evaluate the models' robustness performance, free of limitations of fixed benchmarks or constrained perturbations, although scoped by the power of the oracle. In addition to the evaluation results, we also leverage our generated data to understand the behaviors of the model and our new evaluation strategies.

- **Summary**: Automated organ at risk (OAR) segmentation is crucial for radiation therapy planning in CT scans, but the generated contours by automated models can be inaccurate, potentially leading to treatment planning issues. The reasons for these inaccuracies could be varied, such as unclear organ boundaries or inaccurate ground truth due to annotation errors. To improve the model's performance, it is necessary to identify these failure cases during the training process and to correct them with some potential post-processing techniques. However, this process can be time-consuming, as traditionally it requires manual inspection of the predicted output. This paper proposes a method to automatically identify failure cases by setting a threshold for the combination of Dice and Hausdorff distances. This approach reduces the time-consuming task of visually inspecting predicted outputs, allowing for faster identification of failure case candidates. The method was evaluated on 20 cases of six different organs in CT images from clinical expert curated datasets. By setting the thresholds for the Dice and Hausdorff distances, the study was able to differentiate between various states of failure cases and evaluate over 12 cases visually. This thresholding approach could be extended to other organs, leading to faster identification of failure cases and thereby improving the quality of radiation therapy planning.

- **Summary**: We present SCULPT, a novel 3D generative model for clothed and textured 3D meshes of humans. Specifically, we devise a deep neural network that learns to represent the geometry and appearance distribution of clothed human bodies. Training such a model is challenging, as datasets of textured 3D meshes for humans are limited in size and accessibility. Our key observation is that there exist medium-sized 3D scan datasets like CAPE, as well as large-scale 2D image datasets of clothed humans and multiple appearances can be mapped to a single geometry. To effectively learn from the two data modalities, we propose an unpaired learning procedure for pose-dependent clothed and textured human meshes. Specifically, we learn a pose-dependent geometry space from 3D scan data. We represent this as per vertex displacements w.r.t. the SMPL model. Next, we train a geometry conditioned texture generator in an unsupervised way using the 2D image data. We use intermediate activations of the learned geometry model to condition our texture generator. To alleviate entanglement between pose and clothing type, and pose and clothing appearance, we condition both the texture and geometry generators with attribute labels such as clothing types for the geometry, and clothing colors for the texture generator. We automatically generated these conditioning labels for the 2D images based on the visual question answering model BLIP and CLIP. We validate our method on the SCULPT dataset, and compare to state-of-the-art 3D generative models for clothed human bodies. We will release the codebase for research purposes.

- **Summary**: Despite the existence of numerous Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools, the lack of comprehensive open-source systems hampers the progress of document digitization in various low-resource languages, including Bengali. Low-resource languages, especially those with an alphasyllabary writing system, suffer from the lack of large-scale datasets for various document OCR components such as word-level OCR, document layout extraction, and distortion correction; which are available as individual modules in high-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce Bengali$.$AI-BRACU-OCR (bbOCR): an open-source scalable document OCR system that can reconstruct Bengali documents into a structured searchable digitized format that leverages a novel Bengali text recognition model and two novel synthetic datasets. We present extensive component-level and system-level evaluation: both use a novel diversified evaluation dataset and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation suggests that our proposed solution is preferable over the current state-of-the-art Bengali OCR systems.

- **Summary**: Motivated by the superior performance of image diffusion models, more and more researchers strive to extend these models to the text-based video editing task. Nevertheless, current video editing tasks mainly suffer from the dilemma between the high fine-tuning cost and the limited generation capacity. Compared with images, we conjecture that videos necessitate more constraints to preserve the temporal consistency during editing. Towards this end, we propose EVE, a robust and efficient zero-shot video editing method. Under the guidance of depth maps and temporal consistency constraints, EVE derives satisfactory video editing results with an affordable computational and time cost. Moreover, recognizing the absence of a publicly available video editing dataset for fair comparisons, we construct a new benchmark ZVE-50 dataset. Through comprehensive experimentation, we validate that EVE could achieve a satisfactory trade-off between performance and efficiency. We will release our dataset and codebase to facilitate future researchers.

- **Summary**: Long-Term Person Re-Identification (LT-ReID) has become increasingly crucial in computer vision and biometrics. In this work, we aim to extend LT-ReID beyond pedestrian recognition to include a wider range of real-world human activities while still accounting for cloth-changing scenarios over large time gaps. This setting poses additional challenges due to the geometric misalignment and appearance ambiguity caused by the diversity of human pose and clothing. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach 3DInvarReID for (i) disentangling identity from non-identity components (pose, clothing shape, and texture) of 3D clothed humans, and (ii) reconstructing accurate 3D clothed body shapes and learning discriminative features of naked body shapes for person ReID in a joint manner. To better evaluate our study of LT-ReID, we collect a real-world dataset called CCDA, which contains a wide variety of human activities and clothing changes. Experimentally, we show the superior performance of our approach for person ReID.

- **Summary**: Gestures are integral components of face-to-face communication. They unfold over time, often following predictable movement phases of preparation, stroke, and retraction. Yet, the prevalent approach to automatic gesture detection treats the problem as binary classification, classifying a segment as either containing a gesture or not, thus failing to capture its inherently sequential and contextual nature. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that reframes the task as a multi-phase sequence labeling problem rather than binary classification. Our model processes sequences of skeletal movements over time windows, uses Transformer encoders to learn contextual embeddings, and leverages Conditional Random Fields to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our proposal on a large dataset of diverse co-speech gestures in task-oriented face-to-face dialogues. The results consistently demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong baseline models in detecting gesture strokes. Furthermore, applying Transformer encoders to learn contextual embeddings from movement sequences substantially improves gesture unit detection. These results highlight our framework's capacity to capture the fine-grained dynamics of co-speech gesture phases, paving the way for more nuanced and accurate gesture detection and analysis.

- **Summary**: Cloth-changing person Re-IDentification (Re-ID) is a particularly challenging task, suffering from two limitations of inferior identity-relevant features and limited training samples. Existing methods mainly leverage auxiliary information to facilitate discriminative feature learning, including soft-biometrics features of shapes and gaits, and additional labels of clothing. However, these information may be unavailable in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel FIne-grained Representation and Recomposition (FIRe$^{2}$) framework to tackle both limitations without any auxiliary information. Specifically, we first design a Fine-grained Feature Mining (FFM) module to separately cluster images of each person. Images with similar so-called fine-grained attributes (e.g., clothes and viewpoints) are encouraged to cluster together. An attribute-aware classification loss is introduced to perform fine-grained learning based on cluster labels, which are not shared among different people, promoting the model to learn identity-relevant features. Furthermore, by taking full advantage of the clustered fine-grained attributes, we present a Fine-grained Attribute Recomposition (FAR) module to recompose image features with different attributes in the latent space. It can significantly enhance representations for robust feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIRe$^{2}$ can achieve state-of-the-art performance on five widely-used cloth-changing person Re-ID benchmarks.

- **Summary**: We tackle the problem of estimating a Manhattan frame, i.e. three orthogonal vanishing points, and the unknown focal length of the camera, leveraging a prior vertical direction. The direction can come from an Inertial Measurement Unit that is a standard component of recent consumer devices, e.g., smartphones. We provide an exhaustive analysis of minimal line configurations and derive two new 2-line solvers, one of which does not suffer from singularities affecting existing solvers. Additionally, we design a new non-minimal method, running on an arbitrary number of lines, to boost the performance in local optimization. Combining all solvers in a hybrid robust estimator, our method achieves increased accuracy even with a rough prior. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method compared to the state of the art, while having comparable runtimes. We further demonstrate the applicability of our solvers for relative rotation estimation. The code is available at https://github.com/cvg/VP-Estimation-with-Prior-Gravity.

- **Summary**: In this study, we focus on sampling from the latent space of generative models built upon autoencoders so as the reconstructed samples are lifelike images. To do to, we introduce a novel post-training sampling algorithm rooted in the concept of probability mass functions, coupled with a quantization process. Our proposed algorithm establishes a vicinity around each latent vector from the input data and then proceeds to draw samples from these defined neighborhoods. This strategic approach ensures that the sampled latent vectors predominantly inhabit high-probability regions, which, in turn, can be effectively transformed into authentic real-world images. A noteworthy point of comparison for our sampling algorithm is the sampling technique based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM), owing to its inherent capability to represent clusters. Remarkably, we manage to improve the time complexity from the previous $\mathcal{O}(n\times d \times k \times i)$ associated with GMM sampling to a much more streamlined $\mathcal{O}(n\times d)$, thereby resulting in substantial speedup during runtime. Moreover, our experimental results, gauged through the Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image generation, underscore the superior performance of our sampling algorithm across a diverse range of models and datasets. On the MNIST benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms GMM sampling by yielding a noteworthy improvement of up to $0.89$ in FID value. Furthermore, when it comes to generating images of faces and ocular images, our approach showcases substantial enhancements with FID improvements of $1.69$ and $0.87$ respectively, as compared to GMM sampling, as evidenced on the CelebA and MOBIUS datasets. Lastly, we substantiate our methodology's efficacy in estimating latent space distributions in contrast to GMM sampling, particularly through the lens of the Wasserstein distance.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (Re-ID) methods alleviate the burden of data annotation through generating pseudo supervision messages. However, real-world Re-ID systems, with continuously accumulating data streams, simultaneously demand more robust adaptation and anti-forgetting capabilities. Methods based on image rehearsal addresses the forgetting issue with limited extra storage but carry the risk of privacy leakage. In this work, we propose a Color Prompting (CoP) method for data-free continual unsupervised domain adaptive person Re-ID. Specifically, we employ a light-weighted prompter network to fit the color distribution of the current task together with Re-ID training. Then for the incoming new tasks, the learned color distribution serves as color style transfer guidance to transfer the images into past styles. CoP achieves accurate color style recovery for past tasks with adequate data diversity, leading to superior anti-forgetting effects compared with image rehearsal methods. Moreover, CoP demonstrates strong generalization performance for fast adaptation into new domains, given only a small amount of unlabeled images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that after the continual training pipeline the proposed CoP achieves 6.7% and 8.1% average rank-1 improvements over the replay method on seen and unseen domains, respectively.

- **Summary**: Person Re-IDentification (Re-ID) as a retrieval task, has achieved tremendous development over the past decade. Existing state-of-the-art methods follow an analogous framework to first extract features from the input images and then categorize them with a classifier. However, since there is no identity overlap between training and testing sets, the classifier is often discarded during inference. Only the extracted features are used for person retrieval via distance metrics. In this paper, we rethink the role of the classifier in person Re-ID, and advocate a new perspective to conceive the classifier as a projection from image features to class prototypes. These prototypes are exactly the learned parameters of the classifier. In this light, we describe the identity of input images as similarities to all prototypes, which are then utilized as more discriminative features to perform person Re-ID. We thereby propose a new baseline ProNet, which innovatively reserves the function of the classifier at the inference stage. To facilitate the learning of class prototypes, both triplet loss and identity classification loss are applied to features that undergo the projection by the classifier. An improved version of ProNet++ is presented by further incorporating multi-granularity designs. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed ProNet is simple yet effective, and significantly beats previous baselines. ProNet++ also achieves competitive or even better results than transformer-based competitors.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed success in AIGC (AI Generated Content). People can make use of a pre-trained diffusion model to generate images of high quality or freely modify existing pictures with only prompts in nature language. More excitingly, the emerging personalization techniques make it feasible to create specific-desired images with only a few images as references. However, this induces severe threats if such advanced techniques are misused by malicious users, such as spreading fake news or defaming individual reputations. Thus, it is necessary to regulate personalization models (i.e., concept censorship) for their development and advancement.   In this paper, we focus on the personalization technique dubbed Textual Inversion (TI), which is becoming prevailing for its lightweight nature and excellent performance. TI crafts the word embedding that contains detailed information about a specific object. Users can easily download the word embedding from public websites like Civitai and add it to their own stable diffusion model without fine-tuning for personalization. To achieve the concept censorship of a TI model, we propose leveraging the backdoor technique for good by injecting backdoors into the Textual Inversion embeddings. Briefly, we select some sensitive words as triggers during the training of TI, which will be censored for normal use. In the subsequent generation stage, if the triggers are combined with personalized embeddings as final prompts, the model will output a pre-defined target image rather than images including the desired malicious concept.   To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion, a prevailing open-sourced text-to-image model.

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques depend on large datasets whose annotation is time-consuming. To reduce annotation burden, the self-training (ST) and active-learning (AL) methods have been developed as well as methods that combine them in an iterative fashion. However, it remains unclear when each method is the most useful, and when it is advantageous to combine them. In this paper, we propose a new method that combines ST with AL using Test-Time Augmentations (TTA). First, TTA is performed on an initial teacher network. Then, cases for annotation are selected based on the lowest estimated Dice score. Cases with high estimated scores are used as soft pseudo-labels for ST. The selected annotated cases are trained with existing annotated cases and ST cases with border slices annotations. We demonstrate the method on MRI fetal body and placenta segmentation tasks with different data variability characteristics. Our results indicate that ST is highly effective for both tasks, boosting performance for in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. However, while self-training improved the performance of single-sequence fetal body segmentation when combined with AL, it slightly deteriorated performance of multi-sequence placenta segmentation on ID data. AL was helpful for the high variability placenta data, but did not improve upon random selection for the single-sequence body data. For fetal body segmentation sequence transfer, combining AL with ST following ST iteration yielded a Dice of 0.961 with only 6 original scans and 2 new sequence scans. Results using only 15 high-variability placenta cases were similar to those using 50 cases. Code is available at: https://github.com/Bella31/TTA-quality-estimation-ST-AL

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers have achieved great success in computer visions, delivering exceptional performance across various tasks. However, their inherent reliance on sequential input enforces the manual partitioning of images into patch sequences, which disrupts the image's inherent structural and semantic continuity. To handle this, we propose a novel Pattern Transformer (Patternformer) to adaptively convert images to pattern sequences for Transformer input. Specifically, we employ the Convolutional Neural Network to extract various patterns from the input image, with each channel representing a unique pattern that is fed into the succeeding Transformer as a visual token. By enabling the network to optimize these patterns, each pattern concentrates on its local region of interest, thereby preserving its intrinsic structural and semantic information. Only employing the vanilla ResNet and Transformer, we have accomplished state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and have achieved competitive results on ImageNet.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing a threat to the models' applications and raising security concerns. An intriguing property of adversarial examples is their strong transferability. Several methods have been proposed to enhance transferability, including ensemble attacks which have demonstrated their efficacy. However, prior approaches simply average logits, probabilities, or losses for model ensembling, lacking a comprehensive analysis of how and why model ensembling significantly improves transferability. In this paper, we propose a similar targeted attack method named Similar Target~(ST). By promoting cosine similarity between the gradients of each model, our method regularizes the optimization direction to simultaneously attack all surrogate models. This strategy has been proven to enhance generalization ability. Experimental results on ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving adversarial transferability. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art attackers on 18 discriminative classifiers and adversarially trained models.

- **Summary**: The rise in popularity of ChatGPT and GPT-4 has significantly accelerated the development of large models, leading to the creation of numerous impressive large language models(LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These cutting-edge models owe their remarkable performance to high-quality data. However, the details of the training data used in leading paradigms are often kept confidential. This lack of transparency, coupled with the scarcity of open-source data, impedes further developments within the community. As a response, this paper presents "Wan Juan", a large-scale multimodal dataset composed of both Chinese and English data, collected from a wide range of web sources. The dataset incorporates text, image-text, and video modalities, with a total volume exceeding 2TB. It was utilized in the training of InternLM, a model that demonstrated significant advantages in multi-dimensional evaluations when compared to models of a similar scale.

- **Summary**: Image classification is a longstanding problem in computer vision and machine learning research. Most recent works (e.g. SupCon , Triplet, and max-margin) mainly focus on grouping the intra-class samples aggressively and compactly, with the assumption that all intra-class samples should be pulled tightly towards their class centers. However, such an objective will be very hard to achieve since it ignores the intra-class variance in the dataset. (i.e. different instances from the same class can have significant differences). Thus, such a monotonous objective is not sufficient. To provide a more informative objective, we introduce Contrast Your Neighbours (CoNe) - a simple yet practical learning framework for supervised image classification. Specifically, in CoNe, each sample is not only supervised by its class center but also directly employs the features of its similar neighbors as anchors to generate more adaptive and refined targets. Moreover, to further boost the performance, we propose ``distributional consistency" as a more informative regularization to enable similar instances to have a similar probability distribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoNe achieves state-of-the-art performance across different benchmark datasets, network architectures, and settings. Notably, even without a complicated training recipe, our CoNe achieves 80.8\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, which surpasses the recent Timm training recipe (80.4\%).

- **Summary**: Early surgical treatment of brain tumors is crucial in reducing patient mortality rates. However, brain tissue deformation (called brain shift) occurs during the surgery, rendering pre-operative images invalid. As a cost-effective and portable tool, intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) can track brain shift, and accurate MRI-iUS registration techniques can update pre-surgical plans and facilitate the interpretation of iUS. This can boost surgical safety and outcomes by maximizing tumor removal while avoiding eloquent regions. However, manual assessment of MRI-iUS registration results in real-time is difficult and prone to errors due to the 3D nature of the data. Automatic algorithms that can quantify the quality of inter-modal medical image registration outcomes can be highly beneficial. Therefore, we propose a novel deep-learning (DL) based framework with the Swin UNETR to automatically assess 3D-patch-wise dense error maps for MRI-iUS registration in iUS-guided brain tumor resection and show its performance with real clinical data for the first time.

- **Summary**: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate rule-based algorithms to enhance the extraction of text data, including retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) values and other ganglion cell count (GCC) data, from Zeiss Cirrus optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan reports. Methods: DICOM files that contained encapsulated PDF reports with RNFL or Ganglion Cell in their document titles were identified from a clinical imaging repository at a single academic ophthalmic center. PDF reports were then converted into image files and processed using the PaddleOCR Python package for optical character recognition. Rule-based algorithms were designed and iteratively optimized for improved performance in extracting RNFL and GCC data. Evaluation of the algorithms was conducted through manual review of a set of RNFL and GCC reports. Results: The developed algorithms demonstrated high precision in extracting data from both RNFL and GCC scans. Precision was slightly better for the right eye in RNFL extraction (OD: 0.9803 vs. OS: 0.9046), and for the left eye in GCC extraction (OD: 0.9567 vs. OS: 0.9677). Some values presented more challenges in extraction, particularly clock hours 5 and 6 for RNFL thickness, and signal strength for GCC. Conclusions: A customized optical character recognition algorithm can identify numeric results from optical coherence scan reports with high precision. Automated processing of PDF reports can greatly reduce the time to extract OCT results on a large scale.

- **Summary**: Masked autoencoding has shown excellent performance on self-supervised video representation learning. Temporal redundancy has led to a high masking ratio and customized masking strategy in VideoMAE. In this paper, we aim to further improve the performance of video masked autoencoding by introducing a motion guided masking strategy. Our key insight is that motion is a general and unique prior in video, which should be taken into account during masked pre-training. Our motion guided masking explicitly incorporates motion information to build temporal consistent masking volume. Based on this masking volume, we can track the unmasked tokens in time and sample a set of temporal consistent cubes from videos. These temporal aligned unmasked tokens will further relieve the information leakage issue in time and encourage the MGMAE to learn more useful structure information. We implement our MGMAE with an online efficient optical flow estimator and backward masking map warping strategy. We perform experiments on the datasets of Something-Something V2 and Kinetics-400, demonstrating the superior performance of our MGMAE to the original VideoMAE. In addition, we provide the visualization analysis to illustrate that our MGMAE can sample temporal consistent cubes in a motion-adaptive manner for more effective video pre-training.

- **Summary**: This work dedicates to continuous sign language recognition (CSLR), which is a weakly supervised task dealing with the recognition of continuous signs from videos, without any prior knowledge about the temporal boundaries between consecutive signs. Data scarcity heavily impedes the progress of CSLR. Existing approaches typically train CSLR models on a monolingual corpus, which is orders of magnitude smaller than that of speech recognition. In this work, we explore the feasibility of utilizing multilingual sign language corpora to facilitate monolingual CSLR. Our work is built upon the observation of cross-lingual signs, which originate from different sign languages but have similar visual signals (e.g., hand shape and motion). The underlying idea of our approach is to identify the cross-lingual signs in one sign language and properly leverage them as auxiliary training data to improve the recognition capability of another. To achieve the goal, we first build two sign language dictionaries containing isolated signs that appear in two datasets. Then we identify the sign-to-sign mappings between two sign languages via a well-optimized isolated sign language recognition model. At last, we train a CSLR model on the combination of the target data with original labels and the auxiliary data with mapped labels. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely-used CSLR datasets: Phoenix-2014 and Phoenix-2014T.



### Jumping through Local Minima: Quantization in the Loss Landscape of Vision Transformers

- **Summary**: Quantization scale and bit-width are the most important parameters when considering how to quantize a neural network. Prior work focuses on optimizing quantization scales in a global manner through gradient methods (gradient descent \& Hessian analysis). Yet, when applying perturbations to quantization scales, we observe a very jagged, highly non-smooth test loss landscape. In fact, small perturbations in quantization scale can greatly affect accuracy, yielding a $0.5-0.8\%$ accuracy boost in 4-bit quantized vision transformers (ViTs). In this regime, gradient methods break down, since they cannot reliably reach local minima. In our work, dubbed Evol-Q, we use evolutionary search to effectively traverse the non-smooth landscape. Additionally, we propose using an infoNCE loss, which not only helps combat overfitting on the small calibration dataset ($1,000$ images) but also makes traversing such a highly non-smooth surface easier. Evol-Q improves the top-1 accuracy of a fully quantized ViT-Base by $10.30\%$, $0.78\%$, and $0.15\%$ for $3$-bit, $4$-bit, and $8$-bit weight quantization levels. Extensive experiments on a variety of CNN and ViT architectures further demonstrate its robustness in extreme quantization scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/enyac-group/evol-q

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral Image (HSI) reconstruction has made gratifying progress with the deep unfolding framework by formulating the problem into a data module and a prior module. Nevertheless, existing methods still face the problem of insufficient matching with HSI data. The issues lie in three aspects: 1) fixed gradient descent step in the data module while the degradation of HSI is agnostic in the pixel-level. 2) inadequate prior module for 3D HSI cube. 3) stage interaction ignoring the differences in features at different stages. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a Pixel Adaptive Deep Unfolding Transformer (PADUT) for HSI reconstruction. In the data module, a pixel adaptive descent step is employed to focus on pixel-level agnostic degradation. In the prior module, we introduce the Non-local Spectral Transformer (NST) to emphasize the 3D characteristics of HSI for recovering. Moreover, inspired by the diverse expression of features in different stages and depths, the stage interaction is improved by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Experimental results on both simulated and real scenes exhibit the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art HSI reconstruction methods. The code is released at: https://github.com/MyuLi/PADUT.

- **Summary**: Visual Place Recognition is a task that aims to predict the place of an image (called query) based solely on its visual features. This is typically done through image retrieval, where the query is matched to the most similar images from a large database of geotagged photos, using learned global descriptors. A major challenge in this task is recognizing places seen from different viewpoints. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method, called EigenPlaces, to train our neural network on images from different point of views, which embeds viewpoint robustness into the learned global descriptors. The underlying idea is to cluster the training data so as to explicitly present the model with different views of the same points of interest. The selection of this points of interest is done without the need for extra supervision. We then present experiments on the most comprehensive set of datasets in literature, finding that EigenPlaces is able to outperform previous state of the art on the majority of datasets, while requiring 60\% less GPU memory for training and using 50\% smaller descriptors. The code and trained models for EigenPlaces are available at {\small{\url{https://github.com/gmberton/EigenPlaces}}}, while results with any other baseline can be computed with the codebase at {\small{\url{https://github.com/gmberton/auto_VPR}}}.

- **Summary**: This is a further development of Vision Transformer Pruning via matrix decomposition. The purpose of the Vision Transformer Pruning is to prune the dimension of the linear projection of the dataset by learning their associated importance score in order to reduce the storage, run-time memory, and computational demands. In this paper we further reduce dimension and complexity of the linear projection by implementing and comparing several matrix decomposition methods while preserving the generated important features. We end up selected the Singular Value Decomposition as the method to achieve our goal by comparing the original accuracy scores in the original Github repository and the accuracy scores of using those matrix decomposition methods, including Singular Value Decomposition, four versions of QR Decomposition, and LU factorization.

- **Summary**: Privacy-preserving machine learning aims to train models on private data without leaking sensitive information. Differential privacy (DP) is considered the gold standard framework for privacy-preserving training, as it provides formal privacy guarantees. However, compared to their non-private counterparts, models trained with DP often have significantly reduced accuracy. Private classifiers are also believed to exhibit larger performance disparities across subpopulations, raising fairness concerns. The poor performance of classifiers trained with DP has prevented the widespread adoption of privacy preserving machine learning in industry. Here we show that pre-trained foundation models fine-tuned with DP can achieve similar accuracy to non-private classifiers, even in the presence of significant distribution shifts between pre-training data and downstream tasks. We achieve private accuracies within a few percent of the non-private state of the art across four datasets, including two medical imaging benchmarks. Furthermore, our private medical classifiers do not exhibit larger performance disparities across demographic groups than non-private models. This milestone to make DP training a practical and reliable technology has the potential to widely enable machine learning practitioners to train safely on sensitive datasets while protecting individuals' privacy.

- **Summary**: We show how shadows can be efficiently generated in differentiable rendering of triangle meshes. Our central observation is that pre-filtered shadow mapping, a technique for approximating shadows based on rendering from the perspective of a light, can be combined with existing differentiable rasterizers to yield differentiable visibility information. We demonstrate at several inverse graphics problems that differentiable shadow maps are orders of magnitude faster than differentiable light transport simulation with similar accuracy -- while differentiable rasterization without shadows often fails to converge.

- **Summary**: We present a framework for generating appropriate facial responses from a listener in dyadic social interactions based on the speaker's words. Given an input transcription of the speaker's words with their timestamps, our approach autoregressively predicts a response of a listener: a sequence of listener facial gestures, quantized using a VQ-VAE. Since gesture is a language component, we propose treating the quantized atomic motion elements as additional language token inputs to a transformer-based large language model. Initializing our transformer with the weights of a language model pre-trained only on text results in significantly higher quality listener responses than training a transformer from scratch. We show that our generated listener motion is fluent and reflective of language semantics through quantitative metrics and a qualitative user study. In our evaluation, we analyze the model's ability to utilize temporal and semantic aspects of spoken text. Project page: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~evonne_ng/projects/text2listen/

- **Summary**: We study the problem of few-shot physically-aware articulated mesh generation. By observing an articulated object dataset containing only a few examples, we wish to learn a model that can generate diverse meshes with high visual fidelity and physical validity. Previous mesh generative models either have difficulties in depicting a diverse data space from only a few examples or fail to ensure physical validity of their samples. Regarding the above challenges, we propose two key innovations, including 1) a hierarchical mesh deformation-based generative model based upon the divide-and-conquer philosophy to alleviate the few-shot challenge by borrowing transferrable deformation patterns from large scale rigid meshes and 2) a physics-aware deformation correction scheme to encourage physically plausible generations. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 articulated categories to demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating articulated meshes with better diversity, higher visual fidelity, and better physical validity over previous methods in the few-shot setting. Further, we validate solid contributions of our two innovations in the ablation study. Project page with code is available at https://meowuu7.github.io/few-arti-obj-gen.

- **Summary**: We tackle the problem of learning complex, general behaviors directly in the real world. We propose an approach for robots to efficiently learn manipulation skills using only a handful of real-world interaction trajectories from many different settings. Inspired by the success of learning from large-scale datasets in the fields of computer vision and natural language, our belief is that in order to efficiently learn, a robot must be able to leverage internet-scale, human video data. Humans interact with the world in many interesting ways, which can allow a robot to not only build an understanding of useful actions and affordances but also how these actions affect the world for manipulation. Our approach builds a structured, human-centric action space grounded in visual affordances learned from human videos. Further, we train a world model on human videos and fine-tune on a small amount of robot interaction data without any task supervision. We show that this approach of affordance-space world models enables different robots to learn various manipulation skills in complex settings, in under 30 minutes of interaction.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can be optimized to obtain high-fidelity 3D scene reconstructions of objects and large-scale scenes. However, NeRFs require accurate camera parameters as input -- inaccurate camera parameters result in blurry renderings. Extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters are usually estimated using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods as a pre-processing step to NeRF, but these techniques rarely yield perfect estimates. Thus, prior works have proposed jointly optimizing camera parameters alongside a NeRF, but these methods are prone to local minima in challenging settings. In this work, we analyze how different camera parameterizations affect this joint optimization problem, and observe that standard parameterizations exhibit large differences in magnitude with respect to small perturbations, which can lead to an ill-conditioned optimization problem. We propose using a proxy problem to compute a whitening transform that eliminates the correlation between camera parameters and normalizes their effects, and we propose to use this transform as a preconditioner for the camera parameters during joint optimization. Our preconditioned camera optimization significantly improves reconstruction quality on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset: we reduce error rates (RMSE) by 67% compared to state-of-the-art NeRF approaches that do not optimize for cameras like Zip-NeRF, and by 29% relative to state-of-the-art joint optimization approaches using the camera parameterization of SCNeRF. Our approach is easy to implement, does not significantly increase runtime, can be applied to a wide variety of camera parameterizations, and can straightforwardly be incorporated into other NeRF-like models.

- **Summary**: This work presents BundleSeg, a reliable, reproducible, and fast method for extracting white matter pathways. The proposed method combines an iterative registration procedure with a recently developed precise streamline search algorithm that enables efficient segmentation of streamlines without the need for tractogram clustering or simplifying assumptions. We show that BundleSeg achieves improved repeatability and reproducibility than state-of-the-art segmentation methods, with significant speed improvements. The enhanced precision and reduced variability in extracting white matter connections offer a valuable tool for neuroinformatic studies, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of tractography-based studies of white matter pathways.

- **Summary**: Recent works have demonstrated success in MRI reconstruction using deep learning-based models. However, most reported approaches require training on a task-specific, large-scale dataset. Regularization by denoising (RED) is a general pipeline which embeds a denoiser as a prior for image reconstruction. The potential of RED has been demonstrated for multiple image-related tasks such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. In this work, we propose a regularization by neural style transfer (RNST) method to further leverage the priors from the neural transfer and denoising engine. This enables RNST to reconstruct a high-quality image from a noisy low-quality image with different image styles and limited data. We validate RNST with clinical MRI scans from 1.5T and 3T and show that RNST can significantly boost image quality. Our results highlight the capability of the RNST framework for MRI reconstruction and the potential for reconstruction tasks with limited data.

- **Summary**: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection has developed substantially in the past few years, with available methods approaching, and in a few cases achieving, perfect data separation on standard benchmarks. These results generally involve large or complex models, pretraining, exposure to OoD examples or extra hyperparameter tuning. Remarkably, it is possible to achieve results that can exceed many of these state-of-the-art methods with a very simple method. We demonstrate that ResNet18 trained with Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) produces state-of-the-art results out-of-the-box on near and far OoD detection benchmarks using only Euclidean distance as a scoring rule. This may obviate the need in some cases for more sophisticated methods or larger models, and at the very least provides a very strong, easy to use baseline for further experimentation and analysis.

- **Summary**: Visual question answering is a task of predicting the answer to a question about an image. Given that different people can provide different answers to a visual question, we aim to better understand why with answer groundings. We introduce the first dataset that visually grounds each unique answer to each visual question, which we call VQAAnswerTherapy. We then propose two novel problems of predicting whether a visual question has a single answer grounding and localizing all answer groundings. We benchmark modern algorithms for these novel problems to show where they succeed and struggle. The dataset and evaluation server can be found publicly at https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/vqa-answer-therapy/.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models can perform well in complex medical imaging classification tasks, even when basing their conclusions on spurious correlations (i.e. confounders), should they be prevalent in the training dataset, rather than on the causal image markers of interest. This would thereby limit their ability to generalize across the population. Explainability based on counterfactual image generation can be used to expose the confounders but does not provide a strategy to mitigate the bias. In this work, we introduce the first end-to-end training framework that integrates both (i) popular debiasing classifiers (e.g. distributionally robust optimization (DRO)) to avoid latching onto the spurious correlations and (ii) counterfactual image generation to unveil generalizable imaging markers of relevance to the task. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, Spurious Correlation Latching Score (SCLS), to quantify the extent of the classifier reliance on the spurious correlation as exposed by the counterfactual images. Through comprehensive experiments on two public datasets (with the simulated and real visual artifacts), we demonstrate that the debiasing method: (i) learns generalizable markers across the population, and (ii) successfully ignores spurious correlations and focuses on the underlying disease pathology.

- **Summary**: Functional tissue Units (FTUs) are cell population neighborhoods local to a particular organ performing its main function. The FTUs provide crucial information to the pathologist in understanding the disease affecting a particular organ by providing information at the cellular level. In our research, we have developed a model to segment multi-organ FTUs across 5 organs namely: the kidney, large intestine, lung, prostate and spleen by utilizing the HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body competition dataset. We propose adding shifted auxiliary loss for training models like the transformers to overcome the diminishing gradient problem which poses a challenge towards optimal training of deep models. Overall, our model achieved a dice score of 0.793 on the public dataset and 0.778 on the private dataset and shows a 1% improvement with the use of the proposed method. The findings also bolster the use of transformers models for dense prediction tasks in the field of medical image analysis. The study assists in understanding the relationships between cell and tissue organization thereby providing a useful medium to look at the impact of cellular functions on human health.

- **Summary**: Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and its short atmospheric half-life makes it a prime target to rapidly curb global warming. However, current methane emission monitoring techniques primarily rely on approximate emission factors or self-reporting, which have been shown to often dramatically underestimate emissions. Although initially designed to monitor surface properties, satellite multispectral data has recently emerged as a powerful method to analyze atmospheric content. However, the spectral resolution of multispectral instruments is poor, and methane measurements are typically very noisy. Methane data products are also sensitive to absorption by the surface and other atmospheric gases (water vapor in particular) and therefore provide noisy maps of potential methane plumes, that typically require extensive human analysis. Here, we show that the image recognition capabilities of deep learning methods can be leveraged to automatize the detection of methane leaks in Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral data, with dramatically reduced false positive rates compared with state-of-the-art multispectral methane data products, and without the need for a priori knowledge of potential leak sites. Our proposed approach paves the way for the automated, high-definition and high-frequency monitoring of point-source methane emissions across the world.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel transformer-based framework that reconstructs two high fidelity hands from multi-view RGB images. Unlike existing hand pose estimation methods, where one typically trains a deep network to regress hand model parameters from single RGB image, we consider a more challenging problem setting where we directly regress the absolute root poses of two-hands with extended forearm at high resolution from egocentric view. As existing datasets are either infeasible for egocentric viewpoints or lack background variations, we create a large-scale synthetic dataset with diverse scenarios and collect a real dataset from multi-calibrated camera setup to verify our proposed multi-view image feature fusion strategy. To make the reconstruction physically plausible, we propose two strategies: (i) a coarse-to-fine spectral graph convolution decoder to smoothen the meshes during upsampling and (ii) an optimisation-based refinement stage at inference to prevent self-penetrations. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that our framework is able to produce realistic two-hand reconstructions and demonstrate the generalisation of synthetic-trained models to real data, as well as real-time AR/VR applications.

- **Summary**: There are many ways of interpreting the world and they are highly interdependent. We exploit such complex dependencies and introduce a powerful multi-task hypergraph, in which every node is a task and different paths through the hypergraph reaching a given task become unsupervised teachers, by forming ensembles that learn to generate reliable pseudolabels for that task. Each hyperedge is part of an ensemble teacher for a given task and it is also a student of the self-supervised hypergraph system. We apply our model to one of the most important problems of our times, that of Earth Observation, which is highly multi-task and it often suffers from missing ground-truth data. By performing extensive experiments on the NASA NEO Dataset, spanning a period of 22 years, we demonstrate the value of our multi-task semi-supervised approach, by consistent improvements over strong baselines and recent work. We also show that the hypergraph can adapt unsupervised to gradual data distribution shifts and reliably recover, through its multi-task self-supervision process, the missing data for several observational layers for up to seven years.

- **Summary**: In recent years, huge progress has been made on learning neural implicit representations from multi-view images for 3D reconstruction. As an additional input complementing coordinates, using sinusoidal functions as positional encodings plays a key role in revealing high frequency details with coordinate-based neural networks. However, high frequency positional encodings make the optimization unstable, which results in noisy reconstructions and artifacts in empty space. To resolve this issue in a general sense, we introduce to learn neural implicit representations with quantized coordinates, which reduces the uncertainty and ambiguity in the field during optimization. Instead of continuous coordinates, we discretize continuous coordinates into discrete coordinates using nearest interpolation among quantized coordinates which are obtained by discretizing the field in an extremely high resolution. We use discrete coordinates and their positional encodings to learn implicit functions through volume rendering. This significantly reduces the variations in the sample space, and triggers more multi-view consistency constraints on intersections of rays from different views, which enables to infer implicit function in a more effective way. Our quantized coordinates do not bring any computational burden, and can seamlessly work upon the latest methods. Our evaluations under the widely used benchmarks show our superiority over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/MachinePerceptionLab/CQ-NIR.

- **Summary**: For machine learning-based prognosis and diagnosis of rare diseases, such as pediatric brain tumors, it is necessary to gather medical imaging data from multiple clinical sites that may use different devices and protocols. Deep learning-driven harmonization of radiologic images relies on generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs notoriously generate pseudo structures that do not exist in the original training data, a phenomenon known as "hallucination". To prevent hallucination in medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we propose a one-shot learning method where we utilize neural style transfer for harmonization. At test time, the method uses one image from a clinical site to generate an image that matches the intensity scale of the collaborating sites. Our approach combines learning a feature extractor, neural style transfer, and adaptive instance normalization. We further propose a novel strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of image harmonization approaches with evaluation metrics that both measure image style harmonization and assess the preservation of anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving patient anatomy while adjusting the image intensities to a new clinical site. Our general harmonization model can be used on unseen data from new sites, making it a valuable tool for real-world medical applications and clinical trials.

- **Summary**: In recent years, several Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WS3) methods have been proposed that use class activation maps (CAMs) generated by a classifier to produce pseudo-ground truths for training segmentation models. While CAMs are good at highlighting discriminative regions (DR) of an image, they are known to disregard regions of the object that do not contribute to the classifier's prediction, termed non-discriminative regions (NDR). In contrast, attribution methods such as saliency maps provide an alternative approach for assigning a score to every pixel based on its contribution to the classification prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between saliencies and CAMs for WS3. Our study includes multiple perspectives on understanding their similarities and dissimilarities. Moreover, we provide new evaluation metrics that perform a comprehensive assessment of WS3 performance of alternative methods w.r.t. CAMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of saliencies in addressing the limitation of CAMs through our empirical studies on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we propose random cropping as a stochastic aggregation technique that improves the performance of saliency, making it a strong alternative to CAM for WS3.

- **Summary**: While large-scale image-text pretrained models such as CLIP have been used for multiple video-level tasks on trimmed videos, their use for temporal localization in untrimmed videos is still a relatively unexplored task. We design a new approach for this called UnLoc, which uses pretrained image and text towers, and feeds tokens to a video-text fusion model. The output of the fusion module are then used to construct a feature pyramid in which each level connects to a head to predict a per-frame relevancy score and start/end time displacements. Unlike previous works, our architecture enables Moment Retrieval, Temporal Localization, and Action Segmentation with a single stage model, without the need for action proposals, motion based pretrained features or representation masking. Unlike specialized models, we achieve state of the art results on all three different localization tasks with a unified approach.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider a real-world scenario where a model that is trained on pre-defined classes continually encounters unlabeled data that contains both known and novel classes. The goal is to continually discover novel classes while maintaining the performance in known classes. We name the setting Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD). Existing methods for novel class discovery cannot directly handle the C-GCD setting due to some unrealistic assumptions, such as the unlabeled data only containing novel classes. Furthermore, they fail to discover novel classes in a continual fashion. In this work, we lift all these assumptions and propose an approach, called MetaGCD, to learn how to incrementally discover with less forgetting. Our proposed method uses a meta-learning framework and leverages the offline labeled data to simulate the testing incremental learning process. A meta-objective is defined to revolve around two conflicting learning objectives to achieve novel class discovery without forgetting. Furthermore, a soft neighborhood-based contrastive network is proposed to discriminate uncorrelated images while attracting correlated images. We build strong baselines and conduct extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications including video action recognition, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks (Trojans). The backdoor-compromised model will mis-classify to the target class chosen by the attacker when a test instance (from a non-target class) is embedded with a specific trigger, while maintaining high accuracy on attack-free instances. Although there are extensive studies on backdoor attacks against image data, the susceptibility of video-based systems under backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. Current studies are direct extensions of approaches proposed for image data, e.g., the triggers are independently embedded within the frames, which tend to be detectable by existing defenses. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective backdoor attack against video data. Our proposed attack, adding perturbations in a transformed domain, plants an imperceptible, temporally distributed trigger across the video frames, and is shown to be resilient to existing defensive strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed attack is demonstrated by extensive experiments with various well-known models on two video recognition benchmarks, UCF101 and HMDB51, and a sign language recognition benchmark, Greek Sign Language (GSL) dataset. We delve into the impact of several influential factors on our proposed attack and identify an intriguing effect termed "collateral damage" through extensive studies.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection (VAD) without human monitoring is a complex computer vision task that can have a positive impact on society if implemented successfully. While recent advances have made significant progress in solving this task, most existing approaches overlook a critical real-world concern: privacy. With the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence technologies, it becomes crucial to implement proper AI ethics into their development. Privacy leakage in VAD allows models to pick up and amplify unnecessary biases related to people's personal information, which may lead to undesirable decision making. In this paper, we propose TeD-SPAD, a privacy-aware video anomaly detection framework that destroys visual private information in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we propose the use of a temporally-distinct triplet loss to promote temporally discriminative features, which complements current weakly-supervised VAD methods. Using TeD-SPAD, we achieve a positive trade-off between privacy protection and utility anomaly detection performance on three popular weakly supervised VAD datasets: UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed anonymization model reduces private attribute prediction by 32.25% while only reducing frame-level ROC AUC on the UCF-Crime anomaly detection dataset by 3.69%.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce audio-visual class-incremental learning, a class-incremental learning scenario for audio-visual video recognition. We demonstrate that joint audio-visual modeling can improve class-incremental learning, but current methods fail to preserve semantic similarity between audio and visual features as incremental step grows. Furthermore, we observe that audio-visual correlations learned in previous tasks can be forgotten as incremental steps progress, leading to poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose AV-CIL, which incorporates Dual-Audio-Visual Similarity Constraint (D-AVSC) to maintain both instance-aware and class-aware semantic similarity between audio-visual modalities and Visual Attention Distillation (VAD) to retain previously learned audio-guided visual attentive ability. We create three audio-visual class-incremental datasets, AVE-Class-Incremental (AVE-CI), Kinetics-Sounds-Class-Incremental (K-S-CI), and VGGSound100-Class-Incremental (VS100-CI) based on the AVE, Kinetics-Sounds, and VGGSound datasets, respectively. Our experiments on AVE-CI, K-S-CI, and VS100-CI demonstrate that AV-CIL significantly outperforms existing class-incremental learning methods in audio-visual class-incremental learning.

- **Summary**: Predicting high dimensional video sequences is a curiously difficult problem. The number of possible futures for a given video sequence grows exponentially over time due to uncertainty. This is especially evident when trying to predict complicated natural video scenes from a limited snapshot of the world. The inherent uncertainty accumulates the further into the future you predict making long-term prediction very difficult. In this work we introduce a number of improvements to existing work that aid in creating Robust Video Predictors (RoViPs). We show that with a combination of deep Perceptual and uncertainty-based reconstruction losses we are able to create high quality short-term predictions. Attention-based skip connections are utilised to allow for long range spatial movement of input features to further improve performance. Finally, we show that by simply making the predictor robust to its own prediction errors, it is possible to produce very long, realistic natural video sequences using an iterated single-step prediction task.

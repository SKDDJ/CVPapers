- **Summary**: We present 2SDS (Scene Separation and Data Selection algorithm), a temporal segmentation algorithm used in real-time video stream interpretation. It complements CNN-based models to make use of temporal information in videos. 2SDS can detect the change between scenes in a video stream by com-paring the image difference between two frames. It separates a video into segments (scenes), and by combining itself with a CNN model, 2SDS can select the optimal result for each scene. In this paper, we will be discussing some basic methods and concepts behind 2SDS, as well as presenting some preliminary experiment results regarding 2SDS. During these experiments, 2SDS has achieved an overall accuracy of over 90%.

- **Summary**: Many tasks performed in image-guided, mini-invasive, medical procedures can be cast as pose estimation problems, where an X-ray projection is utilized to reach a target in 3D space. Expanding on recent advances in the differentiable rendering of optically reflective materials, we introduce new methods for pose estimation of radiolucent objects using X-ray projections, and we demonstrate the critical role of optimal view synthesis in performing this task. We first develop an algorithm (DiffDRR) that efficiently computes Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) and leverages automatic differentiation within TensorFlow. Pose estimation is performed by iterative gradient descent using a loss function that quantifies the similarity of the DRR synthesized from a randomly initialized pose and the true fluoroscopic image at the target pose. We propose two novel methods for high-fidelity view synthesis, Neural Tuned Tomography (NeTT) and masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF). Both methods rely on classic Cone-Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT); NeTT directly optimizes the CBCT densities, while the non-zero values of mNeRF are constrained by a 3D mask of the anatomic region segmented from CBCT. We demonstrate that both NeTT and mNeRF distinctly improve pose estimation within our framework. By defining a successful pose estimate to be a 3D angle error of less than 3 deg, we find that NeTT and mNeRF can achieve similar results, both with overall success rates more than 93%. However, the computational cost of NeTT is significantly lower than mNeRF in both training and pose estimation. Furthermore, we show that a NeTT trained for a single subject can generalize to synthesize high-fidelity DRRs and ensure robust pose estimations for all other subjects. Therefore, we suggest that NeTT is an attractive option for robust pose estimation using fluoroscopic projections.

- **Summary**: Over the past few years, there has been a great deal of research on navigation tasks in indoor environments using deep reinforcement learning agents. Most of these tasks use only visual information in the form of first-person images to navigate to a single goal. More recently, tasks that simultaneously use visual and auditory information to navigate to the sound source and even navigation tasks with multiple goals instead of one have been proposed. However, there has been no proposal for a generalized navigation task combining these two types of tasks and using both visual and auditory information in a situation where multiple sound sources are goals. In this paper, we propose a new framework for this generalized task: multi-goal audio-visual navigation. We first define the task in detail, and then we investigate the difficulty of the multi-goal audio-visual navigation task relative to the current navigation tasks by conducting experiments in various situations. The research shows that multi-goal audio-visual navigation has the difficulty of the implicit need to separate the sources of sound. Next, to mitigate the difficulties in this new task, we propose a method named sound direction map (SDM), which dynamically localizes multiple sound sources in a learning-based manner while making use of past memories. Experimental results show that the use of SDM significantly improves the performance of multiple baseline methods, regardless of the number of goals.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis. However, current losses for medical image segmentation mainly focus on overall segmentation results, with fewer losses proposed to guide boundary segmentation. Those that do exist often need to be used in combination with other losses and produce ineffective results. To address this issue, we have developed a simple and effective loss called the Boundary Difference over Union Loss (Boundary DoU Loss) to guide boundary region segmentation. It is obtained by calculating the ratio of the difference set of prediction and ground truth to the union of the difference set and the partial intersection set. Our loss only relies on region calculation, making it easy to implement and training stable without needing any additional losses. Additionally, we use the target size to adaptively adjust attention applied to the boundary regions. Experimental results using UNet, TransUNet, and Swin-UNet on two datasets (ACDC and Synapse) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed loss function. Code is available at https://github.com/sunfan-bvb/BoundaryDoULoss.

- **Summary**: Automatic emotion recognition is a hot topic with a wide range of applications. Much work has been done in the area of automatic emotion recognition in recent years. The focus has been mainly on using the characteristics of a person such as speech, facial expression and pose for this purpose. However, the processing of scene and semantic features for emotion recognition has had limited exploration. In this paper, we propose to use combined scene and semantic features, along with personal features, for multi-modal emotion recognition. Scene features will describe the environment or context in which the target person is operating. The semantic feature can include objects that are present in the environment, as well as their attributes and relationships with the target person. In addition, we use a modified EmbraceNet to extract features from the images, which is trained to learn both the body and pose features simultaneously. By fusing both body and pose features, the EmbraceNet can improve the accuracy and robustness of the model, particularly when dealing with partially missing data. This is because having both body and pose features provides a more complete representation of the subject in the images, which can help the model to make more accurate predictions even when some parts of body are missing. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on the benchmark EMOTIC dataset. We report an average precision of 40.39\% across the 26 emotion categories, which is a 5\% improvement over previous approaches.



### Partitioned Saliency Ranking with Dense Pyramid Transformers

- **Summary**: In recent years, saliency ranking has emerged as a challenging task focusing on assessing the degree of saliency at instance-level. Being subjective, even humans struggle to identify the precise order of all salient instances. Previous approaches undertake the saliency ranking by directly sorting the rank scores of salient instances, which have not explicitly resolved the inherent ambiguities. To overcome this limitation, we propose the ranking by partition paradigm, which segments unordered salient instances into partitions and then ranks them based on the correlations among these partitions. The ranking by partition paradigm alleviates ranking ambiguities in a general sense, as it consistently improves the performance of other saliency ranking models. Additionally, we introduce the Dense Pyramid Transformer (DPT) to enable global cross-scale interactions, which significantly enhances feature interactions with reduced computational burden. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms all existing methods. The code for our method is available at \url{https://github.com/ssecv/PSR}.

- **Summary**: The advent of deep learning has brought a revolutionary transformation to image denoising techniques. However, the persistent challenge of acquiring noise-clean pairs for supervised methods in real-world scenarios remains formidable, necessitating the exploration of more practical self-supervised image denoising. This paper focuses on self-supervised image denoising methods that offer effective solutions to address this challenge. Our comprehensive review thoroughly analyzes the latest advancements in self-supervised image denoising approaches, categorizing them into three distinct classes: General methods, Blind Spot Network (BSN)-based methods, and Transformer-based methods. For each class, we provide a concise theoretical analysis along with their practical applications. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, we present both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on various datasets, utilizing classical algorithms as benchmarks. Additionally, we critically discuss the current limitations of these methods and propose promising directions for future research. By offering a detailed overview of recent developments in self-supervised image denoising, this review serves as an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, facilitating a deeper understanding of this emerging domain and inspiring further advancements.

- **Summary**: Recently, the efficient deployment and acceleration of powerful vision transformers (ViTs) on resource-limited edge devices for providing multimedia services have become attractive tasks. Although early exiting is a feasible solution for accelerating inference, most works focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models in natural language processing (NLP).Moreover, the direct application of early exiting methods to ViTs may result in substantial performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we systematically investigate the efficacy of early exiting in ViTs and point out that the insufficient feature representations in shallow internal classifiers and the limited ability to capture target semantic information in deep internal classifiers restrict the performance of these methods. We then propose an early exiting framework for general ViTs termed LGViT, which incorporates heterogeneous exiting heads, namely, local perception head and global aggregation head, to achieve an efficiency-accuracy trade-off. In particular, we develop a novel two-stage training scheme, including end-to-end training and self-distillation with the backbone frozen to generate early exiting ViTs, which facilitates the fusion of global and local information extracted by the two types of heads. We conduct extensive experiments using three popular ViT backbones on three vision datasets. Results demonstrate that our LGViT can achieve competitive performance with approximately 1.8 $\times$ speed-up.

- **Summary**: There has been significant progress in Masked Image Modeling (MIM). Existing MIM methods can be broadly categorized into two groups based on the reconstruction target: pixel-based and tokenizer-based approaches. The former offers a simpler pipeline and lower computational cost, but it is known to be biased toward high-frequency details. In this paper, we provide a set of empirical studies to confirm this limitation of pixel-based MIM and propose a new method that explicitly utilizes low-level features from shallow layers to aid pixel reconstruction. By incorporating this design into our base method, MAE, we reduce the wasted modeling capability of pixel-based MIM, improving its convergence and achieving non-trivial improvements across various downstream tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically investigate multi-level feature fusion for isotropic architectures like the standard Vision Transformer (ViT). Notably, when applied to a smaller model (e.g., ViT-S), our method yields significant performance gains, such as 1.2\% on fine-tuning, 2.8\% on linear probing, and 2.6\% on semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: This work presents our solutions to the Algonauts Project 2023 Challenge. The primary objective of the challenge revolves around employing computational models to anticipate brain responses captured during participants' observation of intricate natural visual scenes. The goal is to predict brain responses across the entire visual brain, as it is the region where the most reliable responses to images have been observed. We constructed an image-based brain encoder through a two-step training process to tackle this challenge. Initially, we created a pretrained encoder using data from all subjects. Next, we proceeded to fine-tune individual subjects. Each step employed different training strategies, such as different loss functions and objectives, to introduce diversity. Ultimately, our solution constitutes an ensemble of multiple unique encoders. The code is available at https://github.com/uark-cviu/Algonauts2023

- **Summary**: Deep learning based methods have achieved significant success in the task of single image reflection removal (SIRR). However, the majority of these methods are focused on High-Definition/Standard-Definition (HD/SD) images, while ignoring higher resolution images such as Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images. With the increasing prevalence of UHD images captured by modern devices, in this paper, we aim to address the problem of UHD SIRR. Specifically, we first synthesize two large-scale UHD datasets, UHDRR4K and UHDRR8K. The UHDRR4K dataset consists of $2,999$ and $168$ quadruplets of images for training and testing respectively, and the UHDRR8K dataset contains $1,014$ and $105$ quadruplets. To the best of our knowledge, these two datasets are the first largest-scale UHD datasets for SIRR. Then, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art SIRR methods using the proposed datasets. Based on the results, we provide detailed discussions regarding the strengths and limitations of these methods when applied to UHD images. Finally, we present a transformer-based architecture named RRFormer for reflection removal. RRFormer comprises three modules, namely the Prepossessing Embedding Module, Self-attention Feature Extraction Module, and Multi-scale Spatial Feature Extraction Module. These modules extract hypercolumn features, global and partial attention features, and multi-scale spatial features, respectively. To ensure effective training, we utilize three terms in our loss function: pixel loss, feature loss, and adversarial loss. We demonstrate through experimental results that RRFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the non-UHD dataset and our proposed UHDRR datasets. The code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Liar-zzy/Benchmarking-Ultra-High-Definition-Single-Image-Reflection-Removal.

- **Summary**: Driver attention prediction implies the intention understanding of where the driver intends to go and what object the driver concerned about, which commonly provides a driving task-guided traffic scene understanding. Some recent works explore driver attention prediction in critical or accident scenarios and find a positive role in helping accident prediction, while the promotion ability is constrained by the prediction accuracy of driver attention maps. In this work, we explore the network connection gating mechanism for driver attention prediction (Gate-DAP). Gate-DAP aims to learn the importance of different spatial, temporal, and modality information in driving scenarios with various road types, occasions, and light and weather conditions. The network connection gating in Gate-DAP consists of a spatial encoding network gating, long-short-term memory network gating, and information type gating modules. Each connection gating operation is plug-and-play and can be flexibly assembled, which makes the architecture of Gate-DAP transparent for evaluating different spatial, temporal, and information types for driver attention prediction. Evaluations on DADA-2000 and BDDA datasets verify the superiority of the proposed method with the comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on https://github.com/JWFangit/Gate-DAP.



### Robust Positive-Unlabeled Learning via Noise Negative Sample Self-correction

- **Summary**: Learning from positive and unlabeled data is known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning in literature and has attracted much attention in recent years. One common approach in PU learning is to sample a set of pseudo-negatives from the unlabeled data using ad-hoc thresholds so that conventional supervised methods can be applied with both positive and negative samples. Owing to the label uncertainty among the unlabeled data, errors of misclassifying unlabeled positive samples as negative samples inevitably appear and may even accumulate during the training processes. Those errors often lead to performance degradation and model instability. To mitigate the impact of label uncertainty and improve the robustness of learning with positive and unlabeled data, we propose a new robust PU learning method with a training strategy motivated by the nature of human learning: easy cases should be learned first. Similar intuition has been utilized in curriculum learning to only use easier cases in the early stage of training before introducing more complex cases. Specifically, we utilize a novel ``hardness'' measure to distinguish unlabeled samples with a high chance of being negative from unlabeled samples with large label noise. An iterative training strategy is then implemented to fine-tune the selection of negative samples during the training process in an iterative manner to include more ``easy'' samples in the early stage of training. Extensive experimental validations over a wide range of learning tasks show that this approach can effectively improve the accuracy and stability of learning with positive and unlabeled data.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods facilitate the transfer of models to target domains without labels. However, these methods necessitate a labeled target validation set for hyper-parameter tuning and model selection. In this paper, we aim to find an evaluation metric capable of assessing the quality of a transferred model without access to target validation labels. We begin with the metric based on mutual information of the model prediction. Through empirical analysis, we identify three prevalent issues with this metric: 1) It does not account for the source structure. 2) It can be easily attacked. 3) It fails to detect negative transfer caused by the over-alignment of source and target features. To address the first two issues, we incorporate source accuracy into the metric and employ a new MLP classifier that is held out during training, significantly improving the result. To tackle the final issue, we integrate this enhanced metric with data augmentation, resulting in a novel unsupervised UDA metric called the Augmentation Consistency Metric (ACM). Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the shortcomings of previous experiment settings and conduct large-scale experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed metric. Furthermore, we employ our metric to automatically search for the optimal hyper-parameter set, achieving superior performance compared to manually tuned sets across four common benchmarks. Codes will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a novel and effective screening tool for ophthalmic examination. Since collecting OCT images is relatively more expensive than fundus photographs, existing methods use multi-modal learning to complement limited OCT data with additional context from fundus images. However, the multi-modal framework requires eye-paired datasets of both modalities, which is impractical for clinical use. To address this problem, we propose a novel fundus-enhanced disease-aware distillation model (FDDM), for retinal disease classification from OCT images. Our framework enhances the OCT model during training by utilizing unpaired fundus images and does not require the use of fundus images during testing, which greatly improves the practicality and efficiency of our method for clinical use. Specifically, we propose a novel class prototype matching to distill disease-related information from the fundus model to the OCT model and a novel class similarity alignment to enforce consistency between disease distribution of both modalities. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms single-modal, multi-modal, and state-of-the-art distillation methods for retinal disease classification.

- **Summary**: Text-based VQA aims at answering questions by reading the text present in the images. It requires a large amount of scene-text relationship understanding compared to the VQA task. Recent studies have shown that the question-answer pairs in the dataset are more focused on the text present in the image but less importance is given to visual features and some questions do not require understanding the image. The models trained on this dataset predict biased answers due to the lack of understanding of visual context. For example, in questions like "What is written on the signboard?", the answer predicted by the model is always "STOP" which makes the model to ignore the image. To address these issues, we propose a method to learn visual features (making V matter in TextVQA) along with the OCR features and question features using VQA dataset as external knowledge for Text-based VQA. Specifically, we combine the TextVQA dataset and VQA dataset and train the model on this combined dataset. Such a simple, yet effective approach increases the understanding and correlation between the image features and text present in the image, which helps in the better answering of questions. We further test the model on different datasets and compare their qualitative and quantitative results.

- **Summary**: Online continual learning (CL) studies the problem of learning continuously from a single-pass data stream while adapting to new data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, by storing a small subset of old data, replay-based methods have shown promising performance. Unlike previous methods that focus on sample storage or knowledge distillation against catastrophic forgetting, this paper aims to understand why the online learning models fail to generalize well from a new perspective of shortcut learning. We identify shortcut learning as the key limiting factor for online CL, where the learned features may be biased, not generalizable to new tasks, and may have an adverse impact on knowledge distillation. To tackle this issue, we present the online prototype learning (OnPro) framework for online CL. First, we propose online prototype equilibrium to learn representative features against shortcut learning and discriminative features to avoid class confusion, ultimately achieving an equilibrium status that separates all seen classes well while learning new classes. Second, with the feedback of online prototypes, we devise a novel adaptive prototypical feedback mechanism to sense the classes that are easily misclassified and then enhance their boundaries. Extensive experimental results on widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of OnPro over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Camouflaged object detection is a challenging task that aims to identify objects that are highly similar to their background. Due to the powerful noise-to-image denoising capability of denoising diffusion models, in this paper, we propose a diffusion-based framework for camouflaged object detection, termed diffCOD, a new framework that considers the camouflaged object segmentation task as a denoising diffusion process from noisy masks to object masks. Specifically, the object mask diffuses from the ground-truth masks to a random distribution, and the designed model learns to reverse this noising process. To strengthen the denoising learning, the input image prior is encoded and integrated into the denoising diffusion model to guide the diffusion process. Furthermore, we design an injection attention module (IAM) to interact conditional semantic features extracted from the image with the diffusion noise embedding via the cross-attention mechanism to enhance denoising learning. Extensive experiments on four widely used COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves favorable performance compared to the existing 11 state-of-the-art methods, especially in the detailed texture segmentation of camouflaged objects. Our code will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/ZNan-Chen/diffCOD.

- **Summary**: How can we apply human feedback into generative model? As answer of this question, in this paper, we show the method applied on denoising problem and domain adaptation using human feedback. Deep generative models have demonstrated impressive results in image denoising. However, current image denoising models often produce inappropriate results when applied to domains different from the ones they were trained on. If there are `Good' and `Bad' result for unseen data, how to raise up quality of `Bad' result. Most methods use an approach based on generalization of model. However, these methods require target image for training or adapting unseen domain. In this paper, to adapting domain, we deal with non-target image for unseen domain, and improve specific failed image. To address this, we propose a method for fine-tuning inappropriate results generated in a different domain by utilizing human feedback. First, we train a generator to denoise images using only the noisy MNIST digit '0' images. The denoising generator trained on the source domain leads to unintended results when applied to target domain images. To achieve domain adaptation, we construct a noise-image denoising generated image data set and train a reward model predict human feedback. Finally, we fine-tune the generator on the different domain using the reward model with auxiliary loss function, aiming to transfer denoising capabilities to target domain. Our approach demonstrates the potential to efficiently fine-tune a generator trained on one domain using human feedback from another domain, thereby enhancing denoising abilities in different domains.

- **Summary**: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of machine learning models in real-world applications. However, existing OOD detection approaches primarily rely on the feature maps or the full gradient space information to derive OOD scores neglecting the role of most important parameters of the pre-trained network over in-distribution (ID) data. In this study, we propose a novel approach called GradOrth to facilitate OOD detection based on one intriguing observation that the important features to identify OOD data lie in the lower-rank subspace of in-distribution (ID) data. In particular, we identify OOD data by computing the norm of gradient projection on the subspaces considered important for the in-distribution data. A large orthogonal projection value (i.e. a small projection value) indicates the sample as OOD as it captures a weak correlation of the ID data. This simple yet effective method exhibits outstanding performance, showcasing a notable reduction in the average false positive rate at a 95% true positive rate (FPR95) of up to 8% when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes by generalizing the knowledge, i.e., visual and semantic relationships, obtained from seen classes, where image augmentation techniques are commonly applied to improve the generalization ability of a model. However, this approach can also cause adverse effects on ZSL since the conventional augmentation techniques that solely depend on single-label supervision is not able to maintain semantic information and result in the semantic distortion issue consequently. In other words, image argumentation may falsify the semantic (e.g., attribute) information of an image. To take the advantage of image augmentations while mitigating the semantic distortion issue, we propose a novel ZSL approach by Harnessing Adversarial Samples (HAS). HAS advances ZSL through adversarial training which takes into account three crucial aspects: (1) robust generation by enforcing augmentations to be similar to negative classes, while maintaining correct labels, (2) reliable generation by introducing a latent space constraint to avert significant deviations from the original data manifold, and (3) diverse generation by incorporating attribute-based perturbation by adjusting images according to each semantic attribute's localization. Through comprehensive experiments on three prominent zero-shot benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial samples approach in both ZSL and Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) scenarios.

- **Summary**: Human body-pose estimation is a complex problem in computer vision. Recent research interests have been widened specifically on the Sports, Yoga, and Dance (SYD) postures for maintaining health conditions. The SYD pose categories are regarded as a fine-grained image classification task due to the complex movement of body parts. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have attained significantly improved performance in solving various human body-pose estimation problems. Though decent progress has been achieved in yoga postures recognition using deep learning techniques, fine-grained sports, and dance recognition necessitates ample research attention. However, no benchmark public image dataset with sufficient inter-class and intra-class variations is available yet to address sports and dance postures classification. To solve this limitation, we have proposed two image datasets, one for 102 sport categories and another for 12 dance styles. Two public datasets, Yoga-82 which contains 82 classes and Yoga-107 represents 107 classes are collected for yoga postures. These four SYD datasets are experimented with the proposed deep model, SYD-Net, which integrates a patch-based attention (PbA) mechanism on top of standard backbone CNNs. The PbA module leverages the self-attention mechanism that learns contextual information from a set of uniform and multi-scale patches and emphasizes discriminative features to understand the semantic correlation among patches. Moreover, random erasing data augmentation is applied to improve performance. The proposed SYD-Net has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on Yoga-82 using five base CNNs. SYD-Net's accuracy on other datasets is remarkable, implying its efficiency. Our Sports-102 and Dance-12 datasets are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/syd-net/home.

- **Summary**: Open-world instance-level scene understanding aims to locate and recognize unseen object categories that are not present in the annotated dataset. This task is challenging because the model needs to both localize novel 3D objects and infer their semantic categories. A key factor for the recent progress in 2D open-world perception is the availability of large-scale image-text pairs from the Internet, which cover a wide range of vocabulary concepts. However, this success is hard to replicate in 3D scenarios due to the scarcity of 3D-text pairs. To address this challenge, we propose to harness pre-trained vision-language (VL) foundation models that encode extensive knowledge from image-text pairs to generate captions for multi-view images of 3D scenes. This allows us to establish explicit associations between 3D shapes and semantic-rich captions. Moreover, to enhance the fine-grained visual-semantic representation learning from captions for object-level categorization, we design hierarchical point-caption association methods to learn semantic-aware embeddings that exploit the 3D geometry between 3D points and multi-view images. In addition, to tackle the localization challenge for novel classes in the open-world setting, we develop debiased instance localization, which involves training object grouping modules on unlabeled data using instance-level pseudo supervision. This significantly improves the generalization capabilities of instance grouping and thus the ability to accurately locate novel objects. We conduct extensive experiments on 3D semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks, covering indoor and outdoor scenes across three datasets. Our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin in semantic segmentation (e.g. 34.5%$\sim$65.3%), instance segmentation (e.g. 21.8%$\sim$54.0%) and panoptic segmentation (e.g. 14.7%$\sim$43.3%).

- **Summary**: Given a composite image, image harmonization aims to adjust the foreground illumination to be consistent with background. Previous methods have explored transforming foreground features to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we show that using global information to guide foreground feature transformation could achieve significant improvement. Besides, we propose to transfer the foreground-background relation from real images to composite images, which can provide intermediate supervision for the transformed encoder features. Additionally, considering the drawbacks of existing harmonization datasets, we also contribute a ccHarmony dataset which simulates the natural illumination variation. Extensive experiments on iHarmony4 and our contributed dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our ccHarmony dataset is released at https://github.com/bcmi/Image-Harmonization-Dataset-ccHarmony.

- **Summary**: Despite the proliferation of diverse hardware accelerators (e.g., NPU, TPU, DPU), deploying deep learning models on edge devices with fixed-point hardware is still challenging due to complex model quantization and conversion. Existing model quantization frameworks like Tensorflow QAT [1], TFLite PTQ [2], and Qualcomm AIMET [3] supports only a limited set of quantization schemes (e.g., only asymmetric per-tensor quantization in TF1.x QAT [4]). Accordingly, deep learning models cannot be easily quantized for diverse fixed-point hardwares, mainly due to slightly different quantization requirements. In this paper, we envision a new type of model quantization approach called MRQ (model re-quantization), which takes existing quantized models and quickly transforms the models to meet different quantization requirements (e.g., asymmetric -> symmetric, non-power-of-2 scale -> power-of-2 scale). Re-quantization is much simpler than quantizing from scratch because it avoids costly re-training and provides support for multiple quantization schemes simultaneously. To minimize re-quantization error, we developed a new set of re-quantization algorithms including weight correction and rounding error folding. We have demonstrated that MobileNetV2 QAT model [7] can be quickly re-quantized into two different quantization schemes (i.e., symmetric and symmetric+power-of-2 scale) with less than 0.64 units of accuracy loss. We believe our work is the first to leverage this concept of re-quantization for model quantization and models obtained from the re-quantization process have been successfully deployed on NNA in the Echo Show devices.

- **Summary**: The goal of image harmonization is adjusting the foreground appearance in a composite image to make the whole image harmonious. To construct paired training images, existing datasets adopt different ways to adjust the illumination statistics of foregrounds of real images to produce synthetic composite images. However, different datasets have considerable domain gap and the performances on small-scale datasets are limited by insufficient training data. In this work, we explore learnable augmentation to enrich the illumination diversity of small-scale datasets for better harmonization performance. In particular, our designed SYthetic COmposite Network (SycoNet) takes in a real image with foreground mask and a random vector to learn suitable color transformation, which is applied to the foreground of this real image to produce a synthetic composite image. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed learnable augmentation for image harmonization. The code of SycoNet is released at https://github.com/bcmi/SycoNet-Adaptive-Image-Harmonization.

- **Summary**: Shape completion, i.e., predicting the complete geometry of an object from a partial observation, is highly relevant for several downstream tasks, most notably robotic manipulation. When basing planning or prediction of real grasps on object shape reconstruction, an indication of severe geometric uncertainty is indispensable. In particular, there can be an irreducible uncertainty in extended regions about the presence of entire object parts when given ambiguous object views. To treat this important case, we propose two novel methods for predicting such uncertain regions as straightforward extensions of any method for predicting local spatial occupancy, one through postprocessing occupancy scores, the other through direct prediction of an uncertainty indicator. We compare these methods together with two known approaches to probabilistic shape completion. Moreover, we generate a dataset, derived from ShapeNet, of realistically rendered depth images of object views with ground-truth annotations for the uncertain regions. We train on this dataset and test each method in shape completion and prediction of uncertain regions for known and novel object instances and on synthetic and real data. While direct uncertainty prediction is by far the most accurate in the segmentation of uncertain regions, both novel methods outperform the two baselines in shape completion and uncertain region prediction, and avoiding the predicted uncertain regions increases the quality of grasps for all tested methods.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, posing a significant security risk in critical applications. Adversarial Training (AT) is a well-established technique to enhance adversarial robustness, but it often comes at the cost of decreased generalization ability. This paper proposes Robustness Critical Fine-Tuning (RiFT), a novel approach to enhance generalization without compromising adversarial robustness. The core idea of RiFT is to exploit the redundant capacity for robustness by fine-tuning the adversarially trained model on its non-robust-critical module. To do so, we introduce module robust criticality (MRC), a measure that evaluates the significance of a given module to model robustness under worst-case weight perturbations. Using this measure, we identify the module with the lowest MRC value as the non-robust-critical module and fine-tune its weights to obtain fine-tuned weights. Subsequently, we linearly interpolate between the adversarially trained weights and fine-tuned weights to derive the optimal fine-tuned model weights. We demonstrate the efficacy of RiFT on ResNet18, ResNet34, and WideResNet34-10 models trained on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets. Our experiments show that \method can significantly improve both generalization and out-of-distribution robustness by around 1.5% while maintaining or even slightly enhancing adversarial robustness.

- **Summary**: An event-based camera outputs an event whenever a change in scene brightness of a preset magnitude is detected at a particular pixel location in the sensor plane. The resulting sparse and asynchronous output coupled with the high dynamic range and temporal resolution of this novel camera motivate the study of event-based cameras for navigation and landing applications. However, the lack of real-world and synthetic datasets to support this line of research has limited its consideration for onboard use. This paper presents a methodology and a software pipeline for generating event-based vision datasets from optimal landing trajectories during the approach of a target body. We construct sequences of photorealistic images of the lunar surface with the Planet and Asteroid Natural Scene Generation Utility at different viewpoints along a set of optimal descent trajectories obtained by varying the boundary conditions. The generated image sequences are then converted into event streams by means of an event-based camera emulator. We demonstrate that the pipeline can generate realistic event-based representations of surface features by constructing a dataset of 500 trajectories, complete with event streams and motion field ground truth data. We anticipate that novel event-based vision datasets can be generated using this pipeline to support various spacecraft pose reconstruction problems given events as input, and we hope that the proposed methodology would attract the attention of researchers working at the intersection of neuromorphic vision and guidance navigation and control.

- **Summary**: End-to-end autonomous driving aims to build a fully differentiable system that takes raw sensor data as inputs and directly outputs the planned trajectory or control signals of the ego vehicle. State-of-the-art methods usually follow the `Teacher-Student' paradigm. The Teacher model uses privileged information (ground-truth states of surrounding agents and map elements) to learn the driving strategy. The student model only has access to raw sensor data and conducts behavior cloning on the data collected by the teacher model. By eliminating the noise of the perception part during planning learning, state-of-the-art works could achieve better performance with significantly less data compared to those coupled ones.   However, under the current Teacher-Student paradigm, the student model still needs to learn a planning head from scratch, which could be challenging due to the redundant and noisy nature of raw sensor inputs and the casual confusion issue of behavior cloning. In this work, we aim to explore the possibility of directly adopting the strong teacher model to conduct planning while letting the student model focus more on the perception part. We find that even equipped with a SOTA perception model, directly letting the student model learn the required inputs of the teacher model leads to poor driving performance, which comes from the large distribution gap between predicted privileged inputs and the ground-truth.   To this end, we propose DriveAdapter, which employs adapters with the feature alignment objective function between the student (perception) and teacher (planning) modules. Additionally, since the pure learning-based teacher model itself is imperfect and occasionally breaks safety rules, we propose a method of action-guided feature learning with a mask for those imperfect teacher features to further inject the priors of hand-crafted rules into the learning process.

- **Summary**: Constructing supervised machine learning models for real-world video analysis require substantial labeled data, which is costly to acquire due to scarce domain expertise and laborious manual inspection. While data programming shows promise in generating labeled data at scale with user-defined labeling functions, the high dimensional and complex temporal information in videos poses additional challenges for effectively composing and evaluating labeling functions. In this paper, we propose VideoPro, a visual analytics approach to support flexible and scalable video data programming for model steering with reduced human effort. We first extract human-understandable events from videos using computer vision techniques and treat them as atomic components of labeling functions. We further propose a two-stage template mining algorithm that characterizes the sequential patterns of these events to serve as labeling function templates for efficient data labeling. The visual interface of VideoPro facilitates multifaceted exploration, examination, and application of the labeling templates, allowing for effective programming of video data at scale. Moreover, users can monitor the impact of programming on model performance and make informed adjustments during the iterative programming process. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach with two case studies and expert interviews.

- **Summary**: Image synthesis is increasingly being adopted in medical image processing, for example for data augmentation or inter-modality image translation. In these critical applications, the generated images must fulfill a high standard of biological correctness. A particular requirement for these images is global consistency, i.e an image being overall coherent and structured so that all parts of the image fit together in a realistic and meaningful way. Yet, established image quality metrics do not explicitly quantify this property of synthetic images. In this work, we introduce two metrics that can measure the global consistency of synthetic images on a per-image basis. To measure the global consistency, we presume that a realistic image exhibits consistent properties, e.g., a person's body fat in a whole-body MRI, throughout the depicted object or scene. Hence, we quantify global consistency by predicting and comparing explicit attributes of images on patches using supervised trained neural networks. Next, we adapt this strategy to an unlabeled setting by measuring the similarity of implicit image features predicted by a self-supervised trained network. Our results demonstrate that predicting explicit attributes of synthetic images on patches can distinguish globally consistent from inconsistent images. Implicit representations of images are less sensitive to assess global consistency but are still serviceable when labeled data is unavailable. Compared to established metrics, such as the FID, our method can explicitly measure global consistency on a per-image basis, enabling a dedicated analysis of the biological plausibility of single synthetic images.

- **Summary**: The volume of space debris currently orbiting the Earth is reaching an unsustainable level at an accelerated pace. The detection, tracking, identification, and differentiation between orbit-defined, registered spacecraft, and rogue/inactive space ``objects'', is critical to asset protection. The primary objective of this work is to investigate the validity of Deep Neural Network (DNN) solutions to overcome the limitations and image artefacts most prevalent when captured with monocular cameras in the visible light spectrum. In this work, a hybrid UNet-ResNet34 Deep Learning (DL) architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is developed. Image degradations addressed include blurring, exposure issues, poor contrast, and noise. The shortage of space-generated data suitable for supervised DL is also addressed. A visual comparison between the URes34P model developed in this work and the existing state of the art in deep learning image enhancement methods, relevant to images captured in space, is presented. Based upon visual inspection, it is determined that our UNet model is capable of correcting for space-related image degradations and merits further investigation to reduce its computational complexity.

- **Summary**: In Vitro Fertilization is among the most widespread treatments for infertility. One of its main challenges is the evaluation and selection of embryo for implantation, a process with large inter- and intra-clinician variability. Deep learning based methods are gaining attention, but their opaque nature compromises their acceptance in the clinical context, where transparency in the decision making is key. In this paper we analyze the current work in the explainability of AI-assisted embryo analysis models, identifying the limitations. We also discuss how these models could be integrated in the clinical context as decision support systems, considering the needs of clinicians and patients. Finally, we propose guidelines for the sake of increasing interpretability and trustworthiness, pushing this technology forward towards established clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation techniques have shown significant progress in recent years, but their robustness to real-world perturbations and data samples not seen during training remains a challenge, particularly in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation techniques by leveraging the synergy between label-to-image generators and image-to-label segmentation models. Specifically, we design and train Robusta, a novel robust conditional generative adversarial network to generate realistic and plausible perturbed or outlier images that can be used to train reliable segmentation models. We conduct in-depth studies of the proposed generative model, assess the performance and robustness of the downstream segmentation network, and demonstrate that our approach can significantly enhance the robustness of semantic segmentation techniques in the face of real-world perturbations, distribution shifts, and out-of-distribution samples. Our results suggest that this approach could be valuable in safety-critical applications, where the reliability of semantic segmentation techniques is of utmost importance and comes with a limited computational budget in inference. We will release our code shortly.

- **Summary**: Handwritten signature verification is a significant biometric verification method widely acknowledged by legal and financial institutions. However, the development of automatic signature verification systems poses challenges due to inter-writer similarity, intra-writer variations, and the limited number of signature samples. To address these challenges, we propose a multiscale global and regional feature learning network (MGRNet) with the co-tuplet loss, a new metric learning loss, for offline handwritten signature verification. MGRNet jointly learns global and regional information from various spatial scales and integrates it to generate discriminative features. Consequently, it can capture overall signature stroke information while detecting detailed local differences between genuine and skilled-forged signatures. To enhance the discriminative capability of our network further, we propose the co-tuplet loss, which simultaneously considers multiple positive and negative examples to learn distance metrics. By dealing with inter-writer similarity and intra-writer variations and focusing on informative examples, the co-tuplet loss addresses the limitations of typical metric learning losses. Additionally, we develop HanSig, a large-scale Chinese signature dataset, to facilitate the development of robust systems for this script. The dataset is available at https://github.com/ashleyfhh/HanSig. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets in different languages demonstrate the promising performance of our method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection without priors of the anomalies is challenging. In the field of unsupervised anomaly detection, traditional auto-encoder (AE) tends to fail based on the assumption that by training only on normal images, the model will not be able to reconstruct abnormal images correctly. On the contrary, we propose a novel patch-wise auto-encoder (Patch AE) framework, which aims at enhancing the reconstruction ability of AE to anomalies instead of weakening it. Each patch of image is reconstructed by corresponding spatially distributed feature vector of the learned feature representation, i.e., patch-wise reconstruction, which ensures anomaly-sensitivity of AE. Our method is simple and efficient. It advances the state-of-the-art performances on Mvtec AD benchmark, which proves the effectiveness of our model. It shows great potential in practical industrial application scenarios.

- **Summary**: The quadratic computation complexity of self-attention has been a persistent challenge when applying Transformer models to vision tasks. Linear attention, on the other hand, offers a much more efficient alternative with its linear complexity by approximating the Softmax operation through carefully designed mapping functions. However, current linear attention approaches either suffer from significant performance degradation or introduce additional computation overhead from the mapping functions. In this paper, we propose a novel Focused Linear Attention module to achieve both high efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, we first analyze the factors contributing to the performance degradation of linear attention from two perspectives: the focus ability and feature diversity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple yet effective mapping function and an efficient rank restoration module to enhance the expressiveness of self-attention while maintaining low computation complexity. Extensive experiments show that our linear attention module is applicable to a variety of advanced vision Transformers, and achieves consistently improved performances on multiple benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In line with the human capacity to perceive the world by simultaneously processing and integrating high-dimensional inputs from multiple modalities like vision and audio, we propose a novel model, MAiVAR-T (Multimodal Audio-Image to Video Action Recognition Transformer). This model employs an intuitive approach for the combination of audio-image and video modalities, with a primary aim to escalate the effectiveness of multimodal human action recognition (MHAR). At the core of MAiVAR-T lies the significance of distilling substantial representations from the audio modality and transmuting these into the image domain. Subsequently, this audio-image depiction is fused with the video modality to formulate a unified representation. This concerted approach strives to exploit the contextual richness inherent in both audio and video modalities, thereby promoting action recognition. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art strategies that focus solely on audio or video modalities, MAiVAR-T demonstrates superior performance. Our extensive empirical evaluations conducted on a benchmark action recognition dataset corroborate the model's remarkable performance. This underscores the potential enhancements derived from integrating audio and video modalities for action recognition purposes.

- **Summary**: Palmprint as biometrics has gained increasing attention recently due to its discriminative ability and robustness. However, existing methods mainly improve palmprint verification within one spectrum, which is challenging to verify across different spectrums. Additionally, in distributed server-client-based deployment, palmprint verification systems predominantly necessitate clients to transmit private data for model training on the centralized server, thereby engendering privacy apprehensions. To alleviate the above issues, in this paper, we propose a physics-driven spectrum-consistent federated learning method for palmprint verification, dubbed as PSFed-Palm. PSFed-Palm draws upon the inherent physical properties of distinct wavelength spectrums, wherein images acquired under similar wavelengths display heightened resemblances. Our approach first partitions clients into short- and long-spectrum groups according to the wavelength range of their local spectrum images. Subsequently, we introduce anchor models for short- and long-spectrum, which constrain the optimization directions of local models associated with long- and short-spectrum images. Specifically, a spectrum-consistent loss that enforces the model parameters and feature representation to align with their corresponding anchor models is designed. Finally, we impose constraints on the local models to ensure their consistency with the global model, effectively preventing model drift. This measure guarantees spectrum consistency while protecting data privacy, as there is no need to share local data. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed PSFed-Palm approach. The proposed PSFed-Palm demonstrates compelling performance despite only a limited number of training data. The codes will be released at https://github.com/Zi-YuanYang/PSFed-Palm.

- **Summary**: Patch robustness certification ensures no patch within a given bound on a sample can manipulate a deep learning model to predict a different label. However, existing techniques cannot certify samples that cannot meet their strict bars at the classifier or patch region levels. This paper proposes MajorCert. MajorCert firstly finds all possible label sets manipulatable by the same patch region on the same sample across the underlying classifiers, then enumerates their combinations element-wise, and finally checks whether the majority invariant of all these combinations is intact to certify samples.

- **Summary**: In this study, we demonstrate the application of a hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) model, pretrained on ImageNet, on an electroencephalogram (EEG) regression task. Despite being originally trained for image classification tasks, when fine-tuned on EEG data, this model shows a notable increase in performance compared to other models, including an identical architecture ViT trained without the ImageNet weights. This discovery challenges the traditional understanding of model generalization, suggesting that Transformer models pretrained on seemingly unrelated image data can provide valuable priors for EEG regression tasks with an appropriate fine-tuning pipeline.   The success of this approach suggests that the features extracted by ViT models in the context of visual tasks can be readily transformed for the purpose of EEG predictive modeling. We recommend utilizing this methodology not only in neuroscience and related fields, but generally for any task where data collection is limited by practical, financial, or ethical constraints. Our results illuminate the potential of pretrained models on tasks that are clearly distinct from their original purpose.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning is a major studied topic in metric learning. However, sampling effective contrastive pairs remains a challenge due to factors such as limited batch size, imbalanced data distribution, and the risk of overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel metric learning function called Center Contrastive Loss, which maintains a class-wise center bank and compares the category centers with the query data points using a contrastive loss. The center bank is updated in real-time to boost model convergence without the need for well-designed sample mining. The category centers are well-optimized classification proxies to re-balance the supervisory signal of each class. Furthermore, the proposed loss combines the advantages of both contrastive and classification methods by reducing intra-class variations and enhancing inter-class differences to improve the discriminative power of embeddings. Our experimental results, as shown in Figure 1, demonstrate that a standard network (ResNet50) trained with our loss achieves state-of-the-art performance and faster convergence.

- **Summary**: Cities play an important role in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) to promote economic growth and meet social needs. Especially satellite imagery is a potential data source for studying sustainable urban development. However, a comprehensive dataset in the United States (U.S.) covering multiple cities, multiple years, multiple scales, and multiple indicators for SDG monitoring is lacking. To support the research on SDGs in U.S. cities, we develop a satellite imagery dataset using deep learning models for five SDGs containing 25 sustainable development indicators. The proposed dataset covers the 100 most populated U.S. cities and corresponding Census Block Groups from 2014 to 2023. Specifically, we collect satellite imagery and identify objects with state-of-the-art object detection and semantic segmentation models to observe cities' bird's-eye view. We further gather population, nighttime light, survey, and built environment data to depict SDGs regarding poverty, health, education, inequality, and living environment. We anticipate the dataset to help urban policymakers and researchers to advance SDGs-related studies, especially applying satellite imagery to monitor long-term and multi-scale SDGs in cities.

- **Summary**: Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic imaging technique that first needs intravenously administration of an iodinated contrast medium; then, it collects both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image. The two scans are then combined to get a recombined image showing contrast enhancement. Despite CESM diagnostic advantages for breast cancer diagnosis, the use of contrast medium can cause side effects, and CESM also beams patients with a higher radiation dose compared to standard mammography. To address these limitations this work proposes to use deep generative models for virtual contrast enhancement on CESM, aiming to make the CESM contrast-free as well as to reduce the radiation dose. Our deep networks, consisting of an autoencoder and two Generative Adversarial Networks, the Pix2Pix, and the CycleGAN, generate synthetic recombined images solely from low-energy images. We perform an extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of the model's performance, also exploiting radiologists' assessments, on a novel CESM dataset that includes 1138 images that, as a further contribution of this work, we make publicly available. The results show that CycleGAN is the most promising deep network to generate synthetic recombined images, highlighting the potential of artificial intelligence techniques for virtual contrast enhancement in this field.

- **Summary**: Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are known to learn to rely on spurious features, i.e., their prediction is based on undesired auxiliary features which are strongly correlated with class labels but lack causal reasoning. This behavior particularly degrades accuracy in groups of samples of the correlated class that are missing the spurious feature or samples of the opposite class but with the spurious feature present. The recently proposed Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) method improves accuracy of these worst groups. Based on the main argument that ERM mods can learn core features sufficiently well, DFR only needs to retrain the last layer of the classification model with a small group-balanced data set. In this work, we examine the applicability of DFR to realistic data in the medical domain. Furthermore, we investigate the reasoning behind the effectiveness of last-layer retraining and show that even though DFR has the potential to improve the accuracy of the worst group, it remains susceptible to spurious correlations.

- **Summary**: The limited availability of labeled chest X-ray datasets is a significant bottleneck in the development of medical imaging methods. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this problem by training models on unlabeled data. Furthermore, self-supervised pretraining has yielded promising results in visual recognition of natural images but has not been given much consideration in medical image analysis. In this work, we propose a self-supervised method, DINO-CXR, which is a novel adaptation of a self-supervised method, DINO, based on a vision transformer for chest X-ray classification. A comparative analysis is performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for both pneumonia and COVID-19 detection. Through a quantitative analysis, it is also shown that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and achieves comparable results in terms of AUC and F-1 score while requiring significantly less labeled data.

- **Summary**: We propose an accurate and fast classification network for classification of brain tumors in MRI images that outperforms all lightweight methods investigated in terms of accuracy. We test our model on a challenging 2D T1-weighted CE-MRI dataset containing three types of brain tumors: Meningioma, Glioma and Pituitary. We introduce an l2-normalized spatial attention mechanism that acts as a regularizer against overfitting during training. We compare our results against the state-of-the-art on this dataset and show that by integrating l2-normalized spatial attention into a baseline network we achieve a performance gain of 1.79 percentage points. Even better accuracy can be attained by combining our model in an ensemble with the pretrained VGG16 at the expense of execution speed.

- **Summary**: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer in which the tumor-vascular involvement greatly affects the resectability and, thus, overall survival of patients. However, current prognostic prediction methods fail to explicitly and accurately investigate relationships between the tumor and nearby important vessels. This paper proposes a novel learnable neural distance that describes the precise relationship between the tumor and vessels in CT images of different patients, adopting it as a major feature for prognosis prediction. Besides, different from existing models that used CNNs or LSTMs to exploit tumor enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT imaging, we improved the extraction of dynamic tumor-related texture features in multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT by fusing local and global features using CNN and transformer modules, further enhancing the features extracted across multi-phase CT images. We extensively evaluated and compared the proposed method with existing methods in the multi-center (n=4) dataset with 1,070 patients with PDAC, and statistical analysis confirmed its clinical effectiveness in the external test set consisting of three centers. The developed risk marker was the strongest predictor of overall survival among preoperative factors and it has the potential to be combined with established clinical factors to select patients at higher risk who might benefit from neoadjuvant therapy.

- **Summary**: Context-aware methods achieved great success in supervised scene text recognition via incorporating semantic priors from words. We argue that such prior contextual information can be interpreted as the relations of textual primitives due to the heterogeneous text and background, which can provide effective self-supervised labels for representation learning. However, textual relations are restricted to the finite size of dataset due to lexical dependencies, which causes the problem of over-fitting and compromises representation robustness. To this end, we propose to enrich the textual relations via rearrangement, hierarchy and interaction, and design a unified framework called RCLSTR: Relational Contrastive Learning for Scene Text Recognition. Based on causality, we theoretically explain that three modules suppress the bias caused by the contextual prior and thus guarantee representation robustness. Experiments on representation quality show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised STR methods. Code is available at https://github.com/ThunderVVV/RCLSTR.

- **Summary**: Markerless Human Pose Estimation (HPE) proved its potential to support decision making and assessment in many fields of application. HPE is often preferred to traditional marker-based Motion Capture systems due to the ease of setup, portability, and affordable cost of the technology. However, the exploitation of HPE in biomedical applications is still under investigation. This review aims to provide an overview of current biomedical applications of HPE. In this paper, we examine the main features of HPE approaches and discuss whether or not those features are of interest to biomedical applications. We also identify those areas where HPE is already in use and present peculiarities and trends followed by researchers and practitioners. We include here 25 approaches to HPE and more than 40 studies of HPE applied to motor development assessment, neuromuscolar rehabilitation, and gait & posture analysis. We conclude that markerless HPE offers great potential for extending diagnosis and rehabilitation outside hospitals and clinics, toward the paradigm of remote medical care.

- **Summary**: Logit based knowledge distillation gets less attention in recent years since feature based methods perform better in most cases. Nevertheless, we find it still has untapped potential when we re-investigate the temperature, which is a crucial hyper-parameter to soften the logit outputs. For most of the previous works, it was set as a fixed value for the entire distillation procedure. However, as the logits from different samples are distributed quite variously, it is not feasible to soften all of them to an equal degree by just a single temperature, which may make the previous work transfer the knowledge of each sample inadequately. In this paper, we restudy the hyper-parameter temperature and figure out its incapability to distill the knowledge from each sample sufficiently when it is a single value. To address this issue, we propose Normalized Knowledge Distillation (NormKD), with the purpose of customizing the temperature for each sample according to the characteristic of the sample's logit distribution. Compared to the vanilla KD, NormKD barely has extra computation or storage cost but performs significantly better on CIRAR-100 and ImageNet for image classification. Furthermore, NormKD can be easily applied to the other logit based methods and achieve better performance which can be closer to or even better than the feature based method.

- **Summary**: This article aims to classify diabetic retinopathy (DR) disease into five different classes using an ensemble approach based on two popular pre-trained convolutional neural networks: VGG16 and Inception V3. The proposed model aims to leverage the strengths of the two individual nets to enhance the classification performance for diabetic retinopathy. The ensemble model architecture involves freezing a portion of the layers in each pre-trained model to utilize their learned representations effectively. Global average pooling layers are added to transform the output feature maps into fixed-length vectors. These vectors are then concatenated to form a consolidated representation of the input image. The ensemble model is trained using a dataset of diabetic retinopathy images (APTOS), divided into training and validation sets. During the training process, the model learns to classify the retinal images into the corresponding diabetic retinopathy classes. Experimental results on the test set demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ensemble model for DR classification achieving an accuracy of 96.4%.

- **Summary**: Visual attention forms the basis of understanding the visual world. In this work we follow a computational approach to investigate the biological basis of visual attention. We analyze retinal and cortical electrophysiological data from mouse. Visual Stimuli are Natural Images depicting real world scenes. Our results show that in primary visual cortex (V1), a subset of around $10\%$ of the neurons responds differently to salient versus non-salient visual regions. Visual attention information was not traced in retinal response. It appears that the retina remains naive concerning visual attention; cortical response gets modulated to interpret visual attention information. Experimental animal studies may be designed to further explore the biological basis of visual attention we traced in this study. In applied and translational science, our study contributes to the design of improved visual prostheses systems -- systems that create artificial visual percepts to visually impaired individuals by electronic implants placed on either the retina or the cortex.

- **Summary**: We propose PressureTransferNet, a novel method for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using ground pressure information. Our approach generates body-specific dynamic ground pressure profiles for specific activities by leveraging existing pressure data from different individuals. PressureTransferNet is an encoder-decoder model taking a source pressure map and a target human attribute vector as inputs, producing a new pressure map reflecting the target attribute. To train the model, we use a sensor simulation to create a diverse dataset with various human attributes and pressure profiles. Evaluation on a real-world dataset shows its effectiveness in accurately transferring human attributes to ground pressure profiles across different scenarios. We visually confirm the fidelity of the synthesized pressure shapes using a physics-based deep learning model and achieve a binary R-square value of 0.79 on areas with ground contact. Validation through classification with F1 score (0.911$\pm$0.015) on physical pressure mat data demonstrates the correctness of the synthesized pressure maps, making our method valuable for data augmentation, denoising, sensor simulation, and anomaly detection. Applications span sports science, rehabilitation, and bio-mechanics, contributing to the development of HAR systems.

- **Summary**: This work explores capabilities of the pre-trained CLIP vision-language model to identify satellite images affected by clouds. Several approaches to using the model to perform cloud presence detection are proposed and evaluated, including a purely zero-shot operation with text prompts and several fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, the transferability of the methods across different datasets and sensor types (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) is tested. The results that CLIP can achieve non-trivial performance on the cloud presence detection task with apparent capability to generalise across sensing modalities and sensing bands. It is also found that a low-cost fine-tuning stage leads to a strong increase in true negative rate. The results demonstrate that the representations learned by the CLIP model can be useful for satellite image processing tasks involving clouds.

- **Summary**: Instance-wise feature selection and ranking methods can achieve a good selection of task-friendly features for each sample in the context of neural networks. However, existing approaches that assume feature subsets to be independent are imperfect when considering the dependency between features. To address this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Gaussian copula, a powerful mathematical technique for capturing correlations between variables, into the current feature selection framework with no additional changes needed. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, in terms of performance comparison and interpretability, demonstrate that our method is capable of capturing meaningful correlations.

- **Summary**: Convolution-based and Transformer-based vision backbone networks process images into the grid or sequence structures, respectively, which are inflexible for capturing irregular objects. Though Vision GNN (ViG) adopts graph-level features for complex images, it has some issues, such as inaccurate neighbor node selection, expensive node information aggregation calculation, and over-smoothing in the deep layers. To address the above problems, we propose a Progressive Vision Graph (PVG) architecture for vision recognition task. Compared with previous works, PVG contains three main components: 1) Progressively Separated Graph Construction (PSGC) to introduce second-order similarity by gradually increasing the channel of the global graph branch and decreasing the channel of local branch as the layer deepens; 2) Neighbor nodes information aggregation and update module by using Max pooling and mathematical Expectation (MaxE) to aggregate rich neighbor information; 3) Graph error Linear Unit (GraphLU) to enhance low-value information in a relaxed form to reduce the compression of image detail information for alleviating the over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PVG over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., our PVG-S obtains 83.0% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K that surpasses GNN-based ViG-S by +0.9 with the parameters reduced by 18.5%, while the largest PVG-B obtains 84.2% that has +0.5 improvement than ViG-B. Furthermore, our PVG-S obtains +1.3 box AP and +0.4 mask AP gains than ViG-S on COCO dataset.

- **Summary**: Person clustering with multi-modal clues, including faces, bodies, and voices, is critical for various tasks, such as movie parsing and identity-based movie editing. Related methods such as multi-view clustering mainly project multi-modal features into a joint feature space. However, multi-modal clue features are usually rather weakly correlated due to the semantic gap from the modality-specific uniqueness. As a result, these methods are not suitable for person clustering. In this paper, we propose a Relation-Aware Distribution representation Network (RAD-Net) to generate a distribution representation for multi-modal clues. The distribution representation of a clue is a vector consisting of the relation between this clue and all other clues from all modalities, thus being modality agnostic and good for person clustering. Accordingly, we introduce a graph-based method to construct distribution representation and employ a cyclic update policy to refine distribution representation progressively. Our method achieves substantial improvements of +6% and +8.2% in F-score on the Video Person-Clustering Dataset (VPCD) and VoxCeleb2 multi-view clustering dataset, respectively. Codes will be released publicly upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Low-light hazy scenes commonly appear at dusk and early morning. The visual enhancement for low-light hazy images is an ill-posed problem. Even though numerous methods have been proposed for image dehazing and low-light enhancement respectively, simply integrating them cannot deliver pleasing results for this particular task. In this paper, we present a novel method to enhance visibility for low-light hazy scenarios. To handle this challenging task, we propose two key techniques, namely cross-consistency dehazing-enhancement framework and physically based simulation for low-light hazy dataset. Specifically, the framework is designed for enhancing visibility of the input image via fully utilizing the clues from different sub-tasks. The simulation is designed for generating the dataset with ground-truths by the proposed low-light hazy imaging model. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the SOTA solutions on different metrics including SSIM (9.19%) and PSNR(5.03%). In addition, we conduct a user study on real images to demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed method by human visual perception.

- **Summary**: End-to-end image/video codecs are getting competitive compared to traditional compression techniques that have been developed through decades of manual engineering efforts. These trainable codecs have many advantages over traditional techniques such as easy adaptation on perceptual distortion metrics and high performance on specific domains thanks to their learning ability. However, state of the art neural codecs does not take advantage of the existence of gradient of entropy in decoding device. In this paper, we theoretically show that gradient of entropy (available at decoder side) is correlated with the gradient of the reconstruction error (which is not available at decoder side). We then demonstrate experimentally that this gradient can be used on various compression methods, leading to a $1-2\%$ rate savings for the same quality. Our method is orthogonal to other improvements and brings independent rate savings.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving perception tasks rely heavily on cameras as the primary sensor for Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Instance Segmentation, and Object Tracking. However, RGB images captured by cameras lack depth information, which poses a significant challenge in 3D detection tasks. To supplement this missing data, mapping sensors such as LIDAR and RADAR are used for accurate 3D Object Detection. Despite their significant accuracy, the multi-sensor models are expensive and require a high computational demand. In contrast, Monocular 3D Object Detection models are becoming increasingly popular, offering a faster, cheaper, and easier-to-implement solution for 3D detections. This paper introduces a different Multi-Tasking Learning approach called MonoNext that utilizes a spatial grid to map objects in the scene. MonoNext employs a straightforward approach based on the ConvNext network and requires only 3D bounding box annotated data. In our experiments with the KITTI dataset, MonoNext achieved high precision and competitive performance comparable with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by adding more training data, MonoNext surpassed itself and achieved higher accuracies.

- **Summary**: Images are loaded with semantic information that pertains to real-world ontologies: dog breeds share mammalian similarities, food pictures are often depicted in domestic environments, and so on. However, when training machine learning models for image classification, the relative similarities amongst object classes are commonly paired with one-hot-encoded labels. According to this logic, if an image is labelled as 'spoon', then 'tea-spoon' and 'shark' are equally wrong in terms of training loss. To overcome this limitation, we explore the integration of additional goals that reflect ontological and semantic knowledge, improving model interpretability and trustworthiness. We suggest a generic approach that allows to derive an additional loss term starting from any kind of semantic information about the classification label. First, we show how to apply our approach to ontologies and word embeddings, and discuss how the resulting information can drive a supervised learning process. Second, we use our semantically enriched loss to train image classifiers, and analyse the trade-offs between accuracy, mistake severity, and learned internal representations. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be further exploited in terms of explainability and adversarial robustness. Code repository: https://github.com/S1M0N38/semantic-encodings

- **Summary**: This paper presents a research study on the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0 and NASNetMobile models to efficiently detect brain tumors in order to reduce the time required for manual review of the report and create an automated system for classifying brain tumors. An automated pipeline is proposed, which encompasses five models: CNN, ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0 and NASNetMobile. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated on a balanced dataset and found to yield an accuracy of 99.33% for fine-tuned InceptionV3 model. Furthermore, Explainable AI approaches are incorporated to visualize the model's latent behavior in order to understand its black box behavior. To further optimize the training process, a cost-sensitive neural network approach has been proposed in order to work with imbalanced datasets which has achieved almost 4% more accuracy than the conventional models used in our experiments. The cost-sensitive InceptionV3 (CS-InceptionV3) and CNN (CS-CNN) show a promising accuracy of 92.31% and a recall value of 1.00 respectively on an imbalanced dataset. The proposed models have shown great potential in improving tumor detection accuracy and must be further developed for application in practical solutions.

- **Summary**: Cross-domain few-shot classification (CD-FSC) aims to identify novel target classes with a few samples, assuming that there exists a domain shift between source and target domains. Existing state-of-the-art practices typically pre-train on source domain and then finetune on the few-shot target data to yield task-adaptive representations. Despite promising progress, these methods are prone to overfitting the limited target distribution since data-scarcity and ignore the transferable knowledge learned in the source domain. To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple plug-and-play Adaptive Semantic Consistency (ASC) framework, which improves cross-domain robustness by preserving source transfer capability during the finetuning stage. Concretely, we reuse the source images in the pretraining phase and design an adaptive weight assignment strategy to highlight the samples similar to target domain, aiming to aggregate informative target-related knowledge from source domain. Subsequently, a semantic consistency regularization is applied to constrain the consistency between the semantic features of the source images output by the source model and target model. In this way, the proposed ASC enables explicit transfer of source domain knowledge to prevent the model from overfitting the target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ASC, and ASC provides consistent improvements over the baselines. The source code will be released.

- **Summary**: The atmospheric and water turbulence mitigation problems have emerged as challenging inverse problems in computer vision and optics communities over the years. However, current methods either rely heavily on the quality of the training dataset or fail to generalize over various scenarios, such as static scenes, dynamic scenes, and text reconstructions. We propose a general implicit neural representation for unsupervised atmospheric and water turbulence mitigation (NeRT). NeRT leverages the implicit neural representations and the physically correct tilt-then-blur turbulence model to reconstruct the clean, undistorted image, given only dozens of distorted input images. Moreover, we show that NeRT outperforms the state-of-the-art through various qualitative and quantitative evaluations of atmospheric and water turbulence datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of NeRT to eliminate uncontrolled turbulence from real-world environments. Lastly, we incorporate NeRT into continuously captured video sequences and demonstrate $48 \times$ speedup.

- **Summary**: Although existing stereo matching models have achieved continuous improvement, they often face issues related to trustworthiness due to the absence of uncertainty estimation. Additionally, effectively leveraging multi-scale and multi-view knowledge of stereo pairs remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the \textbf{E}vidential \textbf{L}ocal-global \textbf{F}usion (ELF) framework for stereo matching, which endows both uncertainty estimation and confidence-aware fusion with trustworthy heads. Instead of predicting the disparity map alone, our model estimates an evidential-based disparity considering both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. With the normal inverse-Gamma distribution as a bridge, the proposed framework realizes intra evidential fusion of multi-level predictions and inter evidential fusion between cost-volume-based and transformer-based stereo matching. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed framework exploits multi-view information effectively and achieves state-of-the-art overall performance both on accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

- **Summary**: 3D human pose estimation in outdoor environments has garnered increasing attention recently. However, prevalent 3D human pose datasets pertaining to outdoor scenes lack diversity, as they predominantly utilize only one type of modality (RGB image or pointcloud), and often feature only one individual within each scene. This limited scope of dataset infrastructure considerably hinders the variability of available data. In this article, we propose Human-M3, an outdoor multi-modal multi-view multi-person human pose database which includes not only multi-view RGB videos of outdoor scenes but also corresponding pointclouds. In order to obtain accurate human poses, we propose an algorithm based on multi-modal data input to generate ground truth annotation. This benefits from robust pointcloud detection and tracking, which solves the problem of inaccurate human localization and matching ambiguity that may exist in previous multi-view RGB videos in outdoor multi-person scenes, and generates reliable ground truth annotations. Evaluation of multiple different modalities algorithms has shown that this database is challenging and suitable for future research. Furthermore, we propose a 3D human pose estimation algorithm based on multi-modal data input, which demonstrates the advantages of multi-modal data input for 3D human pose estimation. Code and data will be released on https://github.com/soullessrobot/Human-M3-Dataset.

- **Summary**: Video quality assessment (VQA) has attracted growing attention in recent years. While the great expense of annotating large-scale VQA datasets has become the main obstacle for current deep-learning methods. To surmount the constraint of insufficient training data, in this paper, we first consider the complete range of video distribution diversity (\ie content, distortion, motion) and employ diverse pretrained models (\eg architecture, pretext task, pre-training dataset) to benefit quality representation. An Adaptive Diverse Quality-aware feature Acquisition (Ada-DQA) framework is proposed to capture desired quality-related features generated by these frozen pretrained models. By leveraging the Quality-aware Acquisition Module (QAM), the framework is able to extract more essential and relevant features to represent quality. Finally, the learned quality representation is utilized as supplementary supervisory information, along with the supervision of the labeled quality score, to guide the training of a relatively lightweight VQA model in a knowledge distillation manner, which largely reduces the computational cost during inference. Experimental results on three mainstream no-reference VQA benchmarks clearly show the superior performance of Ada-DQA in comparison with current state-of-the-art approaches without using extra training data of VQA.

- **Summary**: Optical character recognition (OCR) methods have been applied to diverse tasks, e.g., street view text recognition and document analysis. Recently, zero-shot OCR has piqued the interest of the research community because it considers a practical OCR scenario with unbalanced data distribution. However, there is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating such zero-shot methods that apply a divide-and-conquer recognition strategy by decomposing characters into radicals. Meanwhile, radical recognition, as another important OCR task, also lacks radical-level annotation for model training. In this paper, we construct an ancient Chinese character image dataset that contains both radical-level and character-level annotations to satisfy the requirements of the above-mentioned methods, namely, ACCID, where radical-level annotations include radical categories, radical locations, and structural relations. To increase the adaptability of ACCID, we propose a splicing-based synthetic character algorithm to augment the training samples and apply an image denoising method to improve the image quality. By introducing character decomposition and recombination, we propose a baseline method for zero-shot OCR. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of ACCID and the baseline model quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Today, large language models (LLMs) are taught to use new tools by providing a few demonstrations of the tool's usage. Unfortunately, demonstrations are hard to acquire, and can result in undesirable biased usage if the wrong demonstration is chosen. Even in the rare scenario that demonstrations are readily available, there is no principled selection protocol to determine how many and which ones to provide. As tasks grow more complex, the selection search grows combinatorially and invariably becomes intractable. Our work provides an alternative to demonstrations: tool documentation. We advocate the use of tool documentation, descriptions for the individual tool usage, over demonstrations. We substantiate our claim through three main empirical findings on 6 tasks across both vision and language modalities. First, on existing benchmarks, zero-shot prompts with only tool documentation are sufficient for eliciting proper tool usage, achieving performance on par with few-shot prompts. Second, on a newly collected realistic tool-use dataset with hundreds of available tool APIs, we show that tool documentation is significantly more valuable than demonstrations, with zero-shot documentation significantly outperforming few-shot without documentation. Third, we highlight the benefits of tool documentations by tackling image generation and video tracking using just-released unseen state-of-the-art models as tools. Finally, we highlight the possibility of using tool documentation to automatically enable new applications: by using nothing more than the documentation of GroundingDino, Stable Diffusion, XMem, and SAM, LLMs can re-invent the functionalities of the just-released Grounded-SAM and Track Anything models.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigated how to build a high-performance vision encoding model to predict brain activity as part of our participation in the Algonauts Project 2023 Challenge. The challenge provided brain activity recorded by functional MRI (fMRI) while participants viewed images. Several vision models with parameter sizes ranging from 86M to 4.3B were used to build predictive models. To build highly accurate models, we focused our analysis on two main aspects: (1) How does the sample size of the fMRI training set change the prediction accuracy? (2) How does the prediction accuracy across the visual cortex vary with the parameter size of the vision models? The results show that as the sample size used during training increases, the prediction accuracy improves according to the scaling law. Similarly, we found that as the parameter size of the vision models increases, the prediction accuracy improves according to the scaling law. These results suggest that increasing the sample size of the fMRI training set and the parameter size of visual models may contribute to more accurate visual models of the brain and lead to a better understanding of visual neuroscience.

- **Summary**: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is vital for robot localization. To date, the most performant VPR approaches are environment- and task-specific: while they exhibit strong performance in structured environments (predominantly urban driving), their performance degrades severely in unstructured environments, rendering most approaches brittle to robust real-world deployment. In this work, we develop a universal solution to VPR -- a technique that works across a broad range of structured and unstructured environments (urban, outdoors, indoors, aerial, underwater, and subterranean environments) without any re-training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that general-purpose feature representations derived from off-the-shelf self-supervised models with no VPR-specific training are the right substrate upon which to build such a universal VPR solution. Combining these derived features with unsupervised feature aggregation enables our suite of methods, AnyLoc, to achieve up to 4X significantly higher performance than existing approaches. We further obtain a 6% improvement in performance by characterizing the semantic properties of these features, uncovering unique domains which encapsulate datasets from similar environments. Our detailed experiments and analysis lay a foundation for building VPR solutions that may be deployed anywhere, anytime, and across anyview. We encourage the readers to explore our project page and interactive demos: https://anyloc.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent years, they still rely on explicit human instruction to identify the target objects or categories before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems lack the ability to actively reason and comprehend implicit user intentions. In this work, we propose a new segmentation task -- reasoning segmentation. The task is designed to output a segmentation mask given a complex and implicit query text. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark comprising over one thousand image-instruction pairs, incorporating intricate reasoning and world knowledge for evaluation purposes. Finally, we present LISA: large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant, which inherits the language generation capabilities of the multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) while also possessing the ability to produce segmentation masks. We expand the original vocabulary with a <SEG> token and propose the embedding-as-mask paradigm to unlock the segmentation capability. Remarkably, LISA can handle cases involving: 1) complex reasoning; 2) world knowledge; 3) explanatory answers; 4) multi-turn conversation. Also, it demonstrates robust zero-shot capability when trained exclusively on reasoning-free datasets. In addition, fine-tuning the model with merely 239 reasoning segmentation image-instruction pairs results in further performance enhancement. Experiments show our method not only unlocks new reasoning segmentation capabilities but also proves effective in both complex reasoning segmentation and standard referring segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Bias amplification is a phenomenon in which models increase imbalances present in the training data. In this paper, we study bias amplification in the text-to-image domain using Stable Diffusion by comparing gender ratios in training vs. generated images. We find that the model appears to amplify gender-occupation biases found in the training data (LAION). However, we discover that amplification can largely be attributed to discrepancies between training captions and model prompts. For example, an inherent difference is that captions from the training data often contain explicit gender information while the prompts we use do not, which leads to a distribution shift and consequently impacts bias measures. Once we account for various distributional differences between texts used for training and generation, we observe that amplification decreases considerably. Our findings illustrate the challenges of comparing biases in models and the data they are trained on, and highlight confounding factors that contribute to bias amplification.

- **Summary**: Learning to restore multiple image degradations within a single model is quite beneficial for real-world applications. Nevertheless, existing works typically concentrate on regarding each degradation independently, while their relationship has been less exploited to ensure the synergistic learning. To this end, we revisit the diverse degradations through the lens of singular value decomposition, with the observation that the decomposed singular vectors and singular values naturally undertake the different types of degradation information, dividing various restoration tasks into two groups,\ie, singular vector dominated and singular value dominated. The above analysis renders a more unified perspective to ascribe the diverse degradations, compared to previous task-level independent learning. The dedicated optimization of degraded singular vectors and singular values inherently utilizes the potential relationship among diverse restoration tasks, attributing to the Decomposition Ascribed Synergistic Learning (DASL). Specifically, DASL comprises two effective operators, namely, Singular VEctor Operator (SVEO) and Singular VAlue Operator (SVAO), to favor the decomposed optimization, which can be lightly integrated into existing convolutional image restoration backbone. Moreover, the congruous decomposition loss has been devised for auxiliary. Extensive experiments on blended five image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, including image deraining, image dehazing, image denoising, image deblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

- **Summary**: Face rendering using neural radiance fields (NeRF) is a rapidly developing research area in computer vision. While recent methods primarily focus on controlling facial attributes such as identity and expression, they often overlook the crucial aspect of modeling eyeball rotation, which holds importance for various downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to learn a face NeRF model that is sensitive to eye movements from multi-view images. We address two key challenges in eye-aware face NeRF learning: how to effectively capture eyeball rotation for training and how to construct a manifold for representing eyeball rotation. To accomplish this, we first fit FLAME, a well-established parametric face model, to the multi-view images considering multi-view consistency. Subsequently, we introduce a new Dynamic Eye-aware NeRF (DeNeRF). DeNeRF transforms 3D points from different views into a canonical space to learn a unified face NeRF model. We design an eye deformation field for the transformation, including rigid transformation, e.g., eyeball rotation, and non-rigid transformation. Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our model is capable of generating high-fidelity images with accurate eyeball rotation and non-rigid periocular deformation, even under novel viewing angles. Furthermore, we show that utilizing the rendered images can effectively enhance gaze estimation performance.

- **Summary**: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) aims to detect and associate all desired objects across frames. Most methods accomplish the task by explicitly or implicitly leveraging strong cues (i.e., spatial and appearance information), which exhibit powerful instance-level discrimination. However, when object occlusion and clustering occur, both spatial and appearance information will become ambiguous simultaneously due to the high overlap between objects. In this paper, we demonstrate that this long-standing challenge in MOT can be efficiently and effectively resolved by incorporating weak cues to compensate for strong cues. Along with velocity direction, we introduce the confidence state and height state as potential weak cues. With superior performance, our method still maintains Simple, Online and Real-Time (SORT) characteristics. Furthermore, our method shows strong generalization for diverse trackers and scenarios in a plug-and-play and training-free manner. Significant and consistent improvements are observed when applying our method to 5 different representative trackers. Further, by leveraging both strong and weak cues, our method Hybrid-SORT achieves superior performance on diverse benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, and especially DanceTrack where interaction and occlusion are frequent and severe. The code and models are available at https://github.com/ymzis69/HybirdSORT.

- **Summary**: While 3D body reconstruction methods have made remarkable progress recently, it remains difficult to acquire the sufficiently accurate and numerous 3D supervisions required for training. In this paper, we propose \textbf{KNOWN}, a framework that effectively utilizes body \textbf{KNOW}ledge and u\textbf{N}certainty modeling to compensate for insufficient 3D supervisions. KNOWN exploits a comprehensive set of generic body constraints derived from well-established body knowledge. These generic constraints precisely and explicitly characterize the reconstruction plausibility and enable 3D reconstruction models to be trained without any 3D data. Moreover, existing methods typically use images from multiple datasets during training, which can result in data noise (\textit{e.g.}, inconsistent joint annotation) and data imbalance (\textit{e.g.}, minority images representing unusual poses or captured from challenging camera views). KNOWN solves these problems through a novel probabilistic framework that models both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty is encoded in a robust Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) training loss, while epistemic uncertainty is used to guide model refinement. Experiments demonstrate that KNOWN's body reconstruction outperforms prior weakly-supervised approaches, particularly on the challenging minority images.

- **Summary**: Breast Cancer (BC) is among women's most lethal health concerns. Early diagnosis can alleviate the mortality rate by helping patients make efficient treatment decisions. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER2) has become one the most lethal subtype of BC. According to the College of American Pathologists/American Society of Clinical Oncology (CAP/ASCO), the severity level of HER2 expression can be classified between 0 and 3+ range. HER2 can be detected effectively from immunohistochemical (IHC) and, hematoxylin \& eosin (HE) images of different classes such as 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+. An ensemble approach integrated with threshold filtered single instance evaluation (SIE) technique has been proposed in this study to diagnose BC from the multi-categorical expression of HER2 subtypes. Initially, DenseNet201 and Xception have been ensembled into a single classifier as feature extractors with an effective combination of global average pooling, dropout layer, dense layer with a swish activation function, and l2 regularizer, batch normalization, etc. After that, extracted features has been processed through single instance evaluation (SIE) to determine different confidence levels and adjust decision boundary among the imbalanced classes. This study has been conducted on the BC immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset, which is classified by pathologists into four stages of HER2 BC. This proposed approach known as DenseNet201-Xception-SIE with a threshold value of 0.7 surpassed all other existing state-of-art models with an accuracy of 97.12\%, precision of 97.15\%, and recall of 97.68\% on H\&E data and, accuracy of 97.56\%, precision of 97.57\%, and recall of 98.00\% on IHC data respectively, maintaining momentous improvement. Finally, Grad-CAM and Guided Grad-CAM have been employed in this study to interpret, how TL-based model works on the histopathology dataset and make decisions from the data.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in image processing and deep learning techniques for pavement distress detection and classification, a critical aspect in modern pavement management systems. The conventional manual inspection process conducted by human experts is gradually being superseded by automated solutions, leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms to enhance efficiency and accuracy. The ability of these algorithms to discern patterns and make predictions based on extensive datasets has revolutionized the domain of pavement distress identification. The paper investigates the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for data collection, offering unique advantages such as aerial perspectives and efficient coverage of large areas. By capturing high-resolution images, UAVs provide valuable data that can be processed using deep learning algorithms to detect and classify various pavement distresses effectively. While the primary focus is on 2D image processing, the paper also acknowledges the challenges associated with 3D images, such as sensor limitations and computational requirements. Understanding these challenges is crucial for further advancements in the field. The findings of this review significantly contribute to the evolution of pavement distress detection, fostering the development of efficient pavement management systems. As automated approaches continue to mature, the implementation of deep learning techniques holds great promise in ensuring safer and more durable road infrastructure for the benefit of society.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- subtle, perceptually indistinguishable perturbations of inputs that change the response of the model. In the context of vision, we hypothesize that an important contributor to the robustness of human visual perception is constant exposure to low-fidelity visual stimuli in our peripheral vision. To investigate this hypothesis, we develop \RBlur, an image transform that simulates the loss in fidelity of peripheral vision by blurring the image and reducing its color saturation based on the distance from a given fixation point. We show that compared to DNNs trained on the original images, DNNs trained on images transformed by \RBlur are substantially more robust to adversarial attacks, as well as other, non-adversarial, corruptions, achieving up to 25\% higher accuracy on perturbed data.

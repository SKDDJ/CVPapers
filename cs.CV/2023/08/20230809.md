- **Summary**: LiDAR place recognition approaches based on deep learning suffer a significant degradation in performance when there is a shift between the distribution of the training and testing datasets, with re-training often required to achieve top performance. However, obtaining accurate ground truth on new environments can be prohibitively expensive, especially in complex or GPS-deprived environments. To address this issue we propose GeoAdapt, which introduces a novel auxiliary classification head to generate pseudo-labels for re-training on unseen environments in a self-supervised manner. GeoAdapt uses geometric consistency as a prior to improve the robustness of our generated pseudo-labels against domain shift, improving the performance and reliability of our Test-Time Adaptation approach. Comprehensive experiments show that GeoAdapt significantly boosts place recognition performance across moderate to severe domain shifts, and is competitive with fully supervised test-time adaptation approaches. Our code will be available at https://github.com/csiro-robotics/GeoAdapt.

- **Summary**: Gestures form an important medium of communication between humans and machines. An overwhelming majority of existing gesture recognition methods are tailored to a scenario where humans and machines are located very close to each other. This short-distance assumption does not hold true for several types of interactions, for example gesture-based interactions with a floor cleaning robot or with a drone. Methods made for short-distance recognition are unable to perform well on long-distance recognition due to gestures occupying only a small portion of the input data. Their performance is especially worse in resource constrained settings where they are not able to effectively focus their limited compute on the gesturing subject. We propose a novel, accurate and efficient method for the recognition of gestures from longer distances. It uses a dynamic neural network to select features from gesture-containing spatial regions of the input sensor data for further processing. This helps the network focus on features important for gesture recognition while discarding background features early on, thus making it more compute efficient compared to other techniques. We demonstrate the performance of our method on the LD-ConGR long-distance dataset where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on recognition accuracy and compute efficiency.

- **Summary**: This study focuses on comparing deep learning methods for the segmentation and quantification of uncertainty in prostate segmentation from MRI images. The aim is to improve the workflow of prostate cancer detection and diagnosis. Seven different U-Net-based architectures, augmented with Monte-Carlo dropout, are evaluated for automatic segmentation of the central zone, peripheral zone, transition zone, and tumor, with uncertainty estimation. The top-performing model in this study is the Attention R2U-Net, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 76.3% and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85% for segmenting all zones. Additionally, Attention R2U-Net exhibits the lowest uncertainty values, particularly in the boundaries of the transition zone and tumor, when compared to the other models.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Since the introduction of the Vision Transformer (ViT), researchers have sought to make ViTs more efficient by removing redundant information in the processed tokens. While different methods have been explored to achieve this goal, we still lack understanding of the resulting reduction patterns and how those patterns differ across token reduction methods and datasets. To close this gap, we set out to understand the reduction patterns of 10 different token reduction methods using four image classification datasets. By systematically comparing these methods on the different classification tasks, we find that the Top-K pruning method is a surprisingly strong baseline. Through in-depth analysis of the different methods, we determine that: the reduction patterns are generally not consistent when varying the capacity of the backbone model, the reduction patterns of pruning-based methods significantly differ from fixed radial patterns, and the reduction patterns of pruning-based methods are correlated across classification datasets. Finally we report that the similarity of reduction patterns is a moderate-to-strong proxy for model performance. Project page at https://vap.aau.dk/tokens.

- **Summary**: The accurate diagnosis on pathological subtypes for lung cancer is of significant importance for the follow-up treatments and prognosis managements. In this paper, we propose self-generating hybrid feature network (SGHF-Net) for accurately classifying lung cancer subtypes on computed tomography (CT) images. Inspired by studies stating that cross-scale associations exist in the image patterns between the same case's CT images and its pathological images, we innovatively developed a pathological feature synthetic module (PFSM), which quantitatively maps cross-modality associations through deep neural networks, to derive the "gold standard" information contained in the corresponding pathological images from CT images. Additionally, we designed a radiological feature extraction module (RFEM) to directly acquire CT image information and integrated it with the pathological priors under an effective feature fusion framework, enabling the entire classification model to generate more indicative and specific pathologically related features and eventually output more accurate predictions. The superiority of the proposed model lies in its ability to self-generate hybrid features that contain multi-modality image information based on a single-modality input. To evaluate the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalization ability of our model, we performed extensive experiments on a large-scale multi-center dataset (i.e., 829 cases from three hospitals) to compare our model and a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification models. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our model for lung cancer subtypes classification with significant accuracy improvements in terms of accuracy (ACC), area under the curve (AUC), and F1 score.

- **Summary**: A variety of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods have recently achieved remarkable success in high render speed. However, current accelerating methods are specialized and incompatible with various implicit methods, preventing real-time composition over various types of NeRF works. Because NeRF relies on sampling along rays, it is possible to provide general guidance for acceleration. To that end, we propose a general implicit pipeline for composing NeRF objects quickly. Our method enables the casting of dynamic shadows within or between objects using analytical light sources while allowing multiple NeRF objects to be seamlessly placed and rendered together with any arbitrary rigid transformations. Mainly, our work introduces a new surface representation known as Neural Depth Fields (NeDF) that quickly determines the spatial relationship between objects by allowing direct intersection computation between rays and implicit surfaces. It leverages an intersection neural network to query NeRF for acceleration instead of depending on an explicit spatial structure.Our proposed method is the first to enable both the progressive and interactive composition of NeRF objects. Additionally, it also serves as a previewing plugin for a range of existing NeRF works.

- **Summary**: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the characteristics of event-driven and high energy-efficient, which are different from traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) when deployed on edge devices such as neuromorphic chips. Most previous work focuses on SNNs training strategies to improve model performance and brings larger and deeper network architectures. It is difficult to deploy these complex networks on resource-limited edge devices directly. To meet such demand, people compress SNNs very cautiously to balance the performance and the computation efficiency. Existing compression methods either iteratively pruned SNNs using weights norm magnitude or formulated the problem as a sparse learning optimization. We propose an improved end-to-end Minimax optimization method for this sparse learning problem to better balance the model performance and the computation efficiency. We also demonstrate that jointly applying compression and finetuning on SNNs is better than sequentially, especially for extreme compression ratios. The compressed SNN models achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various benchmark datasets and architectures.

- **Summary**: Fairness in deep learning models trained with high-dimensional inputs and subjective labels remains a complex and understudied area. Facial emotion recognition, a domain where datasets are often racially imbalanced, can lead to models that yield disparate outcomes across racial groups. This study focuses on analyzing racial bias by sub-sampling training sets with varied racial distributions and assessing test performance across these simulations. Our findings indicate that smaller datasets with posed faces improve on both fairness and performance metrics as the simulations approach racial balance. Notably, the F1-score increases by $27.2\%$ points, and demographic parity increases by $15.7\%$ points on average across the simulations. However, in larger datasets with greater facial variation, fairness metrics generally remain constant, suggesting that racial balance by itself is insufficient to achieve parity in test performance across different racial groups.

- **Summary**: Real-world single image denoising is crucial and practical in computer vision. Bayesian inversions combined with score priors now have proven effective for single image denoising but are limited to white Gaussian noise. Moreover, applying existing score-based methods for real-world denoising requires not only the explicit train of score priors on the target domain but also the careful design of sampling procedures for posterior inference, which is complicated and impractical. To address these limitations, we propose a score priors-guided deep variational inference, namely ScoreDVI, for practical real-world denoising. By considering the deep variational image posterior with a Gaussian form, score priors are extracted based on easily accessible minimum MSE Non-$i.i.d$ Gaussian denoisers and variational samples, which in turn facilitate optimizing the variational image posterior. Such a procedure adaptively applies cheap score priors to denoising. Additionally, we exploit a Non-$i.i.d$ Gaussian mixture model and variational noise posterior to model the real-world noise. This scheme also enables the pixel-wise fusion of multiple image priors and variational image posteriors. Besides, we develop a noise-aware prior assignment strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight of image priors in the optimization. Our method outperforms other single image-based real-world denoising methods and achieves comparable performance to dataset-based unsupervised methods.

- **Summary**: While the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for medical image analysis is gaining wide acceptance, the expertise, time and cost required to generate annotated data in the medical field are significantly high, due to limited availability of both data and expert annotation. Strongly supervised object localization models require data that is exhaustively annotated, meaning all objects of interest in an image are identified. This is difficult to achieve and verify for medical images. We present a method for the transformation of real data to train any Deep Neural Network to solve the above problems. We show the efficacy of this approach on both a weakly supervised localization model and a strongly supervised localization model. For the weakly supervised model, we show that the localization accuracy increases significantly using the generated data. For the strongly supervised model, this approach overcomes the need for exhaustive annotation on real images. In the latter model, we show that the accuracy, when trained with generated images, closely parallels the accuracy when trained with exhaustively annotated real images. The results are demonstrated on images of human urine samples obtained using microscopy.



### GIFD: A Generative Gradient Inversion Method with Feature Domain Optimization

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising distributed machine learning framework to preserve clients' privacy, by allowing multiple clients to upload the gradients calculated from their local data to a central server. Recent studies find that the exchanged gradients also take the risk of privacy leakage, e.g., an attacker can invert the shared gradients and recover sensitive data against an FL system by leveraging pre-trained generative adversarial networks (GAN) as prior knowledge. However, performing gradient inversion attacks in the latent space of the GAN model limits their expression ability and generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textbf{G}radient \textbf{I}nversion over \textbf{F}eature \textbf{D}omains (GIFD), which disassembles the GAN model and searches the feature domains of the intermediate layers. Instead of optimizing only over the initial latent code, we progressively change the optimized layer, from the initial latent space to intermediate layers closer to the output images. In addition, we design a regularizer to avoid unreal image generation by adding a small ${l_1}$ ball constraint to the searching range. We also extend GIFD to the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, which weakens the assumption that the training sets of GANs and FL tasks obey the same data distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve pixel-level reconstruction and is superior to the existing methods. Notably, GIFD also shows great generalizability under different defense strategy settings and batch sizes.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art multimodal semantic segmentation approaches combining LiDAR and color data are usually designed on top of asymmetric information-sharing schemes and assume that both modalities are always available. Regrettably, this strong assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios, where sensors are prone to failure or can face adverse conditions (night-time, rain, fog, etc.) that make the acquired information unreliable. Moreover, these architectures tend to fail in continual learning scenarios. In this work, we re-frame the task of multimodal semantic segmentation by enforcing a tightly-coupled feature representation and a symmetric information-sharing scheme, which allows our approach to work even when one of the input modalities is missing. This makes our model reliable even in safety-critical settings, as is the case of autonomous driving. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI dataset, comparing it with our closest competitor. We also introduce an ad-hoc continual learning scheme and show results in a class-incremental continual learning scenario that prove the effectiveness of the approach also in this setting.



### Self-supervised Learning of Rotation-invariant 3D Point Set Features using Transformer and its Self-distillation

- **Summary**: Invariance against rotations of 3D objects is an important property in analyzing 3D point set data. Conventional 3D point set DNNs having rotation invariance typically obtain accurate 3D shape features via supervised learning by using labeled 3D point sets as training samples. However, due to the rapid increase in 3D point set data and the high cost of labeling, a framework to learn rotation-invariant 3D shape features from numerous unlabeled 3D point sets is required. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning framework for acquiring accurate and rotation-invariant 3D point set features at object-level. Our proposed lightweight DNN architecture decomposes an input 3D point set into multiple global-scale regions, called tokens, that preserve the spatial layout of partial shapes composing the 3D object. We employ a self-attention mechanism to refine the tokens and aggregate them into an expressive rotation-invariant feature per 3D point set. Our DNN is effectively trained by using pseudo-labels generated by a self-distillation framework. To facilitate the learning of accurate features, we propose to combine multi-crop and cut-mix data augmentation techniques to diversify 3D point sets for training. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we empirically demonstrate that, (1) existing rotation-invariant DNN architectures designed for supervised learning do not necessarily learn accurate 3D shape features under a self-supervised learning scenario, and (2) our proposed algorithm learns rotation-invariant 3D point set features that are more accurate than those learned by existing algorithms.

- **Summary**: A significant number of machine learning models are vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which focus on stealing the models by using specially curated queries against the target model. This task is well accomplished by using part of the training data or a surrogate dataset to train a new model that mimics a target model in a white-box environment. In pragmatic situations, however, the target models are trained on private datasets that are inaccessible to the adversary. The data-free model extraction technique replaces this problem when it comes to using queries artificially curated by a generator similar to that used in Generative Adversarial Nets. We propose for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an adversary black box attack extending to a regression problem for predicting bounding box coordinates in object detection. As part of our study, we found that defining a loss function and using a novel generator setup is one of the key aspects in extracting the target model. We find that the proposed model extraction method achieves significant results by using reasonable queries. The discovery of this object detection vulnerability will support future prospects for securing such models.

- **Summary**: Text design is one of the most critical procedures in poster design, as it relies heavily on the creativity and expertise of humans to design text images considering the visual harmony and text-semantic. This study introduces TextPainter, a novel multimodal approach that leverages contextual visual information and corresponding text semantics to generate text images. Specifically, TextPainter takes the global-local background image as a hint of style and guides the text image generation with visual harmony. Furthermore, we leverage the language model and introduce a text comprehension module to achieve both sentence-level and word-level style variations. Besides, we construct the PosterT80K dataset, consisting of about 80K posters annotated with sentence-level bounding boxes and text contents. We hope this dataset will pave the way for further research on multimodal text image generation. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that TextPainter can generate visually-and-semantically-harmonious text images for posters.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate outstanding performance across most computer vision tasks. Some critical applications, such as autonomous driving or medical imaging, also require investigation into their behavior and the reasons behind the decisions they make. In this vein, DNN attribution consists in studying the relationship between the predictions of a DNN and its inputs. Attribution methods have been adapted to highlight the most relevant weights or neurons in a DNN, allowing to more efficiently select which weights or neurons can be pruned. However, a limitation of these approaches is that weights are typically compared within each layer separately, while some layers might appear as more critical than others. In this work, we propose to investigate DNN layer importance, i.e. to estimate the sensitivity of the accuracy w.r.t. perturbations applied at the layer level. To do so, we propose a novel dataset to evaluate our method as well as future works. We benchmark a number of criteria and draw conclusions regarding how to assess DNN layer importance and, consequently, how to budgetize layers for increased DNN efficiency (with applications for DNN pruning and quantization), as well as robustness to hardware failure (e.g. bit swaps).

- **Summary**: Vision-language navigation (VLN), which entails an agent to navigate 3D environments following human instructions, has shown great advances. However, current agents are built upon panoramic observations, which hinders their ability to perceive 3D scene geometry and easily leads to ambiguous selection of panoramic view. To address these limitations, we present a BEV Scene Graph (BSG), which leverages multi-step BEV representations to encode scene layouts and geometric cues of indoor environment under the supervision of 3D detection. During navigation, BSG builds a local BEV representation at each step and maintains a BEV-based global scene map, which stores and organizes all the online collected local BEV representations according to their topological relations. Based on BSG, the agent predicts a local BEV grid-level decision score and a global graph-level decision score, combined with a sub-view selection score on panoramic views, for more accurate action prediction. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on REVERIE, R2R, and R4R, showing the potential of BEV perception in VLN.

- **Summary**: Human facial skin images contain abundant textural information that can serve as valuable features for attribute classification, such as age, race, and gender. Additionally, facial skin images offer the advantages of easy collection and minimal privacy concerns. However, the availability of well-labeled human skin datasets with a sufficient number of images is limited. To address this issue, we introduce a dataset called FaceSkin, which encompasses a diverse range of ages and races. Furthermore, to broaden the application scenarios, we incorporate synthetic skin-patches obtained from 2D and 3D attack images, including printed paper, replays, and 3D masks. We evaluate the FaceSkin dataset across distinct categories and present experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness in attribute classification, as well as its potential for various downstream tasks, such as Face anti-spoofing and Age estimation.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised sound source localization is usually challenged by the modality inconsistency. In recent studies, contrastive learning based strategies have shown promising to establish such a consistent correspondence between audio and sound sources in visual scenarios. Unfortunately, the insufficient attention to the heterogeneity influence in the different modality features still limits this scheme to be further improved, which also becomes the motivation of our work. In this study, an Induction Network is proposed to bridge the modality gap more effectively. By decoupling the gradients of visual and audio modalities, the discriminative visual representations of sound sources can be learned with the designed Induction Vector in a bootstrap manner, which also enables the audio modality to be aligned with the visual modality consistently. In addition to a visual weighted contrastive loss, an adaptive threshold selection strategy is introduced to enhance the robustness of the Induction Network. Substantial experiments conducted on SoundNet-Flickr and VGG-Sound Source datasets have demonstrated a superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art works in different challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Objects in videos are typically characterized by continuous smooth motion. We exploit continuous smooth motion in three ways. 1) Improved accuracy by using object motion as an additional source of supervision, which we obtain by anticipating object locations from a static keyframe. 2) Improved efficiency by only doing the expensive feature computations on a small subset of all frames. Because neighboring video frames are often redundant, we only compute features for a single static keyframe and predict object locations in subsequent frames. 3) Reduced annotation cost, where we only annotate the keyframe and use smooth pseudo-motion between keyframes. We demonstrate computational efficiency, annotation efficiency, and improved mean average precision compared to the state-of-the-art on four datasets: ImageNet VID, EPIC KITCHENS-55, YouTube-BoundingBoxes, and Waymo Open dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a new sparse unmixing technique using archetypal analysis (SUnAA). First, we design a new model based on archetypal analysis. We assume that the endmembers of interest are a convex combination of endmembers provided by a spectral library and that the number of endmembers of interest is known. Then, we propose a minimization problem. Unlike most conventional sparse unmixing methods, here the minimization problem is non-convex. We minimize the optimization objective iteratively using an active set algorithm. Our method is robust to the initialization and only requires the number of endmembers of interest. SUnAA is evaluated using two simulated datasets for which results confirm its better performance over other conventional and advanced techniques in terms of signal-to-reconstruction error. SUnAA is also applied to Cuprite dataset and the results are compared visually with the available geological map provided for this dataset. The qualitative assessment demonstrates the successful estimation of the minerals abundances and significantly improves the detection of dominant minerals compared to the conventional regression-based sparse unmixing methods. The Python implementation of SUnAA can be found at: https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/SUnAA.

- **Summary**: Motivated by the advances in deep learning techniques, the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based object detection has proliferated across a range of fields, including vehicle counting, fire detection, and city monitoring. While most existing research studies only a subset of the challenges inherent to UAV-based object detection, there are few studies that balance various aspects to design a practical system for energy consumption reduction. In response, we present the E3-UAV, an edge-based energy-efficient object detection system for UAVs. The system is designed to dynamically support various UAV devices, edge devices, and detection algorithms, with the aim of minimizing energy consumption by deciding the most energy-efficient flight parameters (including flight altitude, flight speed, detection algorithm, and sampling rate) required to fulfill the detection requirements of the task. We first present an effective evaluation metric for actual tasks and construct a transparent energy consumption model based on hundreds of actual flight data to formalize the relationship between energy consumption and flight parameters. Then we present a lightweight energy-efficient priority decision algorithm based on a large quantity of actual flight data to assist the system in deciding flight parameters. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the system, and our experimental results demonstrate that it can significantly decrease energy consumption in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we provide four insights that can assist researchers and engineers in their efforts to study UAV-based object detection further.

- **Summary**: The application of 3D ground-penetrating radar (3D-GPR) for subgrade distress detection has gained widespread popularity. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detection, pioneering studies have attempted to adopt automatic detection techniques, particularly deep learning. However, existing works typically rely on traditional 1D A-scan, 2D B-scan or 3D C-scan data of the GPR, resulting in either insufficient spatial information or high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel methodology for the subgrade distress detection task by leveraging the multi-view information from 3D-GPR data. Moreover, we construct a real multi-view image dataset derived from the original 3D-GPR data for the detection task, which provides richer spatial information compared to A-scan and B-scan data, while reducing computational complexity compared to C-scan data. Subsequently, we develop a novel \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{V}usion and \textbf{D}istillation framework, \textbf{GPR-MVFD}, specifically designed to optimally utilize the multi-view GPR dataset. This framework ingeniously incorporates multi-view distillation and attention-based fusion to facilitate significant feature extraction for subgrade distresses. In addition, a self-adaptive learning mechanism is adopted to stabilize the model training and prevent performance degeneration in each branch. Extensive experiments conducted on this new GPR benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Our framework outperforms not only the existing GPR baselines, but also the state-of-the-art methods in the fields of multi-view learning, multi-modal learning, and knowledge distillation. We will release the constructed multi-view GPR dataset with expert-annotated labels and the source codes of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration is a task to estimate the rigid transformation between two unaligned scans, which plays an important role in many computer vision applications. Previous learning-based works commonly focus on supervised registration, which have limitations in practice. Recently, with the advance of inexpensive RGB-D sensors, several learning-based works utilize RGB-D data to achieve unsupervised registration. However, most of existing unsupervised methods follow a cascaded design or fuse RGB-D data in a unidirectional manner, which do not fully exploit the complementary information in the RGB-D data. To leverage the complementary information more effectively, we propose a network implementing multi-scale bidirectional fusion between RGB images and point clouds generated from depth images. By bidirectionally fusing visual and geometric features in multi-scales, more distinctive deep features for correspondence estimation can be obtained, making our registration more accurate. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and 3DMatch demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/phdymz/PointMBF

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention due to its broad range of applications, particularly in industrial defect detection. To address the challenges of data collection, researchers have introduced zero-/few-shot anomaly detection techniques that require minimal normal images for each category. However, complex industrial scenarios often involve multiple objects, presenting a significant challenge. In light of this, we propose a straightforward yet powerful multi-scale memory comparison framework for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection. Our approach employs a global memory bank to capture features across the entire image, while an individual memory bank focuses on simplified scenes containing a single object. The efficacy of our method is validated by its remarkable achievement of 4th place in the zero-shot track and 2nd place in the few-shot track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) competition.

- **Summary**: As Facial Recognition System(FRS) is widely applied in areas such as access control and mobile payments due to its convenience and high accuracy. The security of facial recognition is also highly regarded. The Face anti-spoofing system(FAS) for face recognition is an important component used to enhance the security of face recognition systems. Traditional FAS used images containing identity information to detect spoofing traces, however there is a risk of privacy leakage during the transmission and storage of these images. Besides, the encryption and decryption of these privacy-sensitive data takes too long compared to inference time by FAS model. To address the above issues, we propose a face anti-spoofing algorithm based on facial skin patches leveraging pure facial skin patch images as input, which contain no privacy information, no encryption or decryption is needed for these images. We conduct experiments on several public datasets, the results prove that our algorithm has demonstrated superiority in both accuracy and speed.



### High-Level Features Parallelization for Inference Cost Reduction Through Selective Attention

- **Summary**: In this work, we parallelize high-level features in deep networks to selectively skip or select class-specific features to reduce inference costs. This challenges most deep learning methods due to their limited ability to efficiently and effectively focus on selected class-specific features without retraining. We propose a serial-parallel hybrid architecture with serial generic low-level features and parallel high-level features. This accounts for the fact that many high-level features are class-specific rather than generic, and has connections to recent neuroscientific findings that observe spatially and contextually separated neural activations in the human brain. Our approach provides the unique functionality of cutouts: selecting parts of the network to focus on only relevant subsets of classes without requiring retraining. High performance is maintained, but the cost of inference can be significantly reduced. In some of our examples, up to $75\,\%$ of parameters are skipped and $35\,\%$ fewer GMACs (Giga multiply-accumulate) operations are used as the approach adapts to a change in task complexity. This is important for mobile, industrial, and robotic applications where reducing the number of parameters, the computational complexity, and thus the power consumption can be paramount. Another unique functionality is that it allows processing to be directly influenced by enhancing or inhibiting high-level class-specific features, similar to the mechanism of selective attention in the human brain. This can be relevant for cross-modal applications, the use of semantic prior knowledge, and/or context-aware processing.

- **Summary**: Existing Unbiased Scene Graph Generation (USGG) methods only focus on addressing the predicate-level imbalance that high-frequency classes dominate predictions of rare ones, while overlooking the concept-level imbalance. Actually, even if predicates themselves are balanced, there is still a significant concept-imbalance within them due to the long-tailed distribution of contexts (i.e., subject-object combinations). This concept-level imbalance poses a more pervasive and challenging issue compared to the predicate-level imbalance since subject-object pairs are inherently complex in combinations. Hence, we introduce a novel research problem: Generalized Unbiased Scene Graph Generation (G-USGG), which takes into account both predicate-level and concept-level imbalance. To the end, we propose the Multi-Concept Learning (MCL) framework, which ensures a balanced learning process across rare/ uncommon/ common concepts. MCL first quantifies the concept-level imbalance across predicates in terms of different amounts of concepts, representing as multiple concept-prototypes within the same class. It then effectively learns concept-prototypes by applying the Concept Regularization (CR) technique. Furthermore, to achieve balanced learning over different concepts, we introduce the Balanced Prototypical Memory (BPM), which guides SGG models to generate balanced representations for concept-prototypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of our model-agnostic strategy in enhancing the performance of benchmark models on both VG-SGG and OI-SGG datasets, leading to new state-of-the-art achievements in two key aspects: predicate-level unbiased relation recognition and concept-level compositional generability.

- **Summary**: Multi-person motion prediction is a challenging problem due to the dependency of motion on both individual past movements and interactions with other people. Transformer-based methods have shown promising results on this task, but they miss the explicit relation representation between joints, such as skeleton structure and pairwise distance, which is crucial for accurate interaction modeling. In this paper, we propose the Joint-Relation Transformer, which utilizes relation information to enhance interaction modeling and improve future motion prediction. Our relation information contains the relative distance and the intra-/inter-person physical constraints. To fuse relation and joint information, we design a novel joint-relation fusion layer with relation-aware attention to update both features. Additionally, we supervise the relation information by forecasting future distance. Experiments show that our method achieves a 13.4% improvement of 900ms VIM on 3DPW-SoMoF/RC and 17.8%/12.0% improvement of 3s MPJPE on CMU-Mpcap/MuPoTS-3D dataset.

- **Summary**: Parallel imaging, a fast MRI technique, involves dynamic adjustments based on the configuration i.e. number, positioning, and sensitivity of the coils with respect to the anatomy under study. Conventional deep learning-based image reconstruction models have to be trained or fine-tuned for each configuration, posing a barrier to clinical translation, given the lack of computational resources and machine learning expertise for clinicians to train models at deployment. Joint training on diverse datasets learns a single weight set that might underfit to deviated configurations. We propose, HyperCoil-Recon, a hypernetwork-based coil configuration task-switching network for multi-coil MRI reconstruction that encodes varying configurations of the numbers of coils in a multi-tasking perspective, posing each configuration as a task. The hypernetworks infer and embed task-specific weights into the reconstruction network, 1) effectively utilizing the contextual knowledge of common and varying image features among the various fields-of-view of the coils, and 2) enabling generality to unseen configurations at test time. Experiments reveal that our approach 1) adapts on the fly to various unseen configurations up to 32 coils when trained on lower numbers (i.e. 7 to 11) of randomly varying coils, and to 120 deviated unseen configurations when trained on 18 configurations in a single model, 2) matches the performance of coil configuration-specific models, and 3) outperforms configuration-invariant models with improvement margins of around 1 dB / 0.03 and 0.3 dB / 0.02 in PSNR / SSIM for knee and brain data.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has shown impressive performance in novel view synthesis via implicit scene representation. However, it usually suffers from poor scalability as requiring densely sampled images for each new scene. Several studies have attempted to mitigate this problem by integrating Multi-View Stereo (MVS) technique into NeRF while they still entail a cumbersome fine-tuning process for new scenes. Notably, the rendering quality will drop severely without this fine-tuning process and the errors mainly appear around the high-frequency features. In the light of this observation, we design WaveNeRF, which integrates wavelet frequency decomposition into MVS and NeRF to achieve generalizable yet high-quality synthesis without any per-scene optimization. To preserve high-frequency information when generating 3D feature volumes, WaveNeRF builds Multi-View Stereo in the Wavelet domain by integrating the discrete wavelet transform into the classical cascade MVS, which disentangles high-frequency information explicitly. With that, disentangled frequency features can be injected into classic NeRF via a novel hybrid neural renderer to yield faithful high-frequency details, and an intuitive frequency-guided sampling strategy can be designed to suppress artifacts around high-frequency regions. Extensive experiments over three widely studied benchmarks show that WaveNeRF achieves superior generalizable radiance field modeling when only given three images as input.

- **Summary**: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has recently shown remarkable generalization on "zero-shot" training and has applied to many downstream tasks. We explore the adaptation of CLIP to achieve a more efficient and generalized action recognition method. We propose that the key lies in explicitly modeling the motion cues flowing in video frames. To that end, we design a two-stream motion modeling block to capture motion and spatial information at the same time. And then, the obtained motion cues are utilized to drive a dynamic prompts learner to generate motion-aware prompts, which contain much semantic information concerning human actions. In addition, we propose a multimodal communication block to achieve a collaborative learning and further improve the performance. We conduct extensive experiments on HMDB-51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400 datasets. Our method outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on "few-shot" and "zero-shot" training. We also achieve competitive performance on "closed-set" training with extremely few trainable parameters and additional computational costs.

- **Summary**: Recently, semantic segmentation models trained with image-level text supervision have shown promising results in challenging open-world scenarios. However, these models still face difficulties in learning fine-grained semantic alignment at the pixel level and predicting accurate object masks. To address this issue, we propose MixReorg, a novel and straightforward pre-training paradigm for semantic segmentation that enhances a model's ability to reorganize patches mixed across images, exploring both local visual relevance and global semantic coherence. Our approach involves generating fine-grained patch-text pairs data by mixing image patches while preserving the correspondence between patches and text. The model is then trained to minimize the segmentation loss of the mixed images and the two contrastive losses of the original and restored features. With MixReorg as a mask learner, conventional text-supervised semantic segmentation models can achieve highly generalizable pixel-semantic alignment ability, which is crucial for open-world segmentation. After training with large-scale image-text data, MixReorg models can be applied directly to segment visual objects of arbitrary categories, without the need for further fine-tuning. Our proposed framework demonstrates strong performance on popular zero-shot semantic segmentation benchmarks, outperforming GroupViT by significant margins of 5.0%, 6.2%, 2.5%, and 3.4% mIoU on PASCAL VOC2012, PASCAL Context, MS COCO, and ADE20K, respectively.

- **Summary**: Current talking face generation methods mainly focus on speech-lip synchronization. However, insufficient investigation on the facial talking style leads to a lifeless and monotonous avatar. Most previous works fail to imitate expressive styles from arbitrary video prompts and ensure the authenticity of the generated video. This paper proposes an unsupervised variational style transfer model (VAST) to vivify the neutral photo-realistic avatars. Our model consists of three key components: a style encoder that extracts facial style representations from the given video prompts; a hybrid facial expression decoder to model accurate speech-related movements; a variational style enhancer that enhances the style space to be highly expressive and meaningful. With our essential designs on facial style learning, our model is able to flexibly capture the expressive facial style from arbitrary video prompts and transfer it onto a personalized image renderer in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed approach contributes to a more vivid talking avatar with higher authenticity and richer expressiveness.

- **Summary**: Activation functions are essential components of neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a new activation function called the Truncated and Signed Square Root (TSSR) function. This function is distinctive because it is odd, nonlinear, monotone and differentiable. Its gradient is continuous and always positive. Thanks to these properties, it has the potential to improve the numerical stability of neural networks. Several experiments confirm that the proposed TSSR has better performance than other stat-of-the-art activation functions. The proposed function has significant implications for the development of neural network models and can be applied to a wide range of applications in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

- **Summary**: Recent adaptive methods for efficient video recognition mostly follow the two-stage paradigm of "preview-then-recognition" and have achieved great success on multiple video benchmarks. However, this two-stage paradigm involves two visits of raw frames from coarse-grained to fine-grained during inference (cannot be parallelized), and the captured spatiotemporal features cannot be reused in the second stage (due to varying granularity), being not friendly to efficiency and computation optimization. To this end, inspired by human cognition, we propose a novel recognition paradigm of "View while Moving" for efficient long-untrimmed video recognition. In contrast to the two-stage paradigm, our paradigm only needs to access the raw frame once. The two phases of coarse-grained sampling and fine-grained recognition are combined into unified spatiotemporal modeling, showing great performance. Moreover, we investigate the properties of semantic units in video and propose a hierarchical mechanism to efficiently capture and reason about the unit-level and video-level temporal semantics in long-untrimmed videos respectively. Extensive experiments on both long-untrimmed and short-trimmed videos demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency, yielding new efficiency and accuracy trade-offs for video spatiotemporal modeling.

- **Summary**: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely available diagnostic tool that allows for a cost-effective and fast assessment of the cardiovascular health. However, more detailed examination with expensive cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is often preferred for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. While providing detailed visualization of the cardiac anatomy, CMR imaging is not widely available due to long scan times and high costs. To address this issue, we propose the first self-supervised contrastive approach that transfers domain-specific information from CMR images to ECG embeddings. Our approach combines multimodal contrastive learning with masked data modeling to enable holistic cardiac screening solely from ECG data. In extensive experiments using data from 40,044 UK Biobank subjects, we demonstrate the utility and generalizability of our method. We predict the subject-specific risk of various cardiovascular diseases and determine distinct cardiac phenotypes solely from ECG data. In a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that our learned ECG embeddings incorporate information from CMR image regions of interest. We make our entire pipeline publicly available, including the source code and pre-trained model weights.

- **Summary**: While many studies have assessed the fairness of AI algorithms in the medical field, the causes of differences in prediction performance are often unknown. This lack of knowledge about the causes of bias hampers the efficacy of bias mitigation, as evidenced by the fact that simple dataset balancing still often performs best in reducing performance gaps but is unable to resolve all performance differences. In this work, we investigate the causes of gender bias in machine learning-based chest X-ray diagnosis. In particular, we explore the hypothesis that breast tissue leads to underexposure of the lungs and causes lower model performance. Methodologically, we propose a new sampling method which addresses the highly skewed distribution of recordings per patient in two widely used public datasets, while at the same time reducing the impact of label errors. Our comprehensive analysis of gender differences across diseases, datasets, and gender representations in the training set shows that dataset imbalance is not the sole cause of performance differences. Moreover, relative group performance differs strongly between datasets, indicating important dataset-specific factors influencing male/female group performance. Finally, we investigate the effect of breast tissue more specifically, by cropping out the breasts from recordings, finding that this does not resolve the observed performance gaps. In conclusion, our results indicate that dataset-specific factors, not fundamental physiological differences, are the main drivers of male--female performance gaps in chest X-ray analyses on widely used NIH and CheXpert Dataset.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in full-head reconstruction have been obtained by optimizing a neural field through differentiable surface or volume rendering to represent a single scene. While these techniques achieve an unprecedented accuracy, they take several minutes, or even hours, due to the expensive optimization process required. In this work, we introduce InstantAvatar, a method that recovers full-head avatars from few images (down to just one) in a few seconds on commodity hardware. In order to speed up the reconstruction process, we propose a system that combines, for the first time, a voxel-grid neural field representation with a surface renderer. Notably, a naive combination of these two techniques leads to unstable optimizations that do not converge to valid solutions. In order to overcome this limitation, we present a novel statistical model that learns a prior distribution over 3D head signed distance functions using a voxel-grid based architecture. The use of this prior model, in combination with other design choices, results into a system that achieves 3D head reconstructions with comparable accuracy as the state-of-the-art with a 100x speed-up.

- **Summary**: This study proposes a simple method for multi-object tracking (MOT) of players in a badminton court. We leverage two off-the-shelf cameras, one on the top of the court and the other on the side of the court. The one on the top is to track players' trajectories, while the one on the side is to analyze the pixel features of players. By computing the correlations between adjacent frames and engaging the information of the two cameras, MOT of badminton players is obtained. This two-camera approach addresses the challenge of player occlusion and overlapping in a badminton court, providing player trajectory tracking and multi-angle analysis. The presented system offers insights into the positions and movements of badminton players, thus serving as a coaching or self-training tool for badminton players to improve their gaming strategies.

- **Summary**: Recently, learning-based algorithms have achieved promising performance on cross-spectral image patch matching, which, however, is still far from satisfactory for practical application. On the one hand, a lack of large-scale dataset with diverse scenes haunts its further improvement for learning-based algorithms, whose performances and generalization rely heavily on the dataset size and diversity. On the other hand, more emphasis has been put on feature relation in the spatial domain whereas the scale dependency between features has often been ignored, leading to performance degeneration especially when encountering significant appearance variations for cross-spectral patches. To address these issues, we publish, to be best of our knowledge, the largest visible and Long-wave Infrared (LWIR) image patch matching dataset, termed VL-CMIM, which contains 1300 pairs of strictly aligned visible and LWIR images and over 2 million patch pairs covering diverse scenes such as asteroid, field, country, build, street and water.In addition, a multi-domain feature relation learning network (MD-FRN) is proposed. Input by the features extracted from a four-branch network, both feature relations in spatial and scale domains are learned via a spatial correlation module (SCM) and multi-scale adaptive aggregation module (MSAG), respectively. To further aggregate the multi-domain relations, a deep domain interactive mechanism (DIM) is applied, where the learnt spatial-relation and scale-relation features are exchanged and further input into MSCRM and SCM. This mechanism allows our model to learn interactive cross-domain feature relations, leading to improved robustness to significant appearance changes due to different modality.

- **Summary**: The design of personalized cranial implants is a challenging and tremendous task that has become a hot topic in terms of process automation with the use of deep learning techniques. The main challenge is associated with the high diversity of possible cranial defects. The lack of appropriate data sources negatively influences the data-driven nature of deep learning algorithms. Hence, one of the possible solutions to overcome this problem is to rely on synthetic data. In this work, we propose three volumetric variations of deep generative models to augment the dataset by generating synthetic skulls, i.e. Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), WGAN-GP hybrid with Variational Autoencoder pretraining (VAE/WGAN-GP) and Introspective Variational Autoencoder (IntroVAE). We show that it is possible to generate dozens of thousands of defective skulls with compatible defects that achieve a trade-off between defect heterogeneity and the realistic shape of the skull. We evaluate obtained synthetic data quantitatively by defect segmentation with the use of V-Net and qualitatively by their latent space exploration. We show that the synthetically generated skulls highly improve the segmentation process compared to using only the original unaugmented data. The generated skulls may improve the automatic design of personalized cranial implants for real medical cases.

- **Summary**: Dialect classification is used in a variety of applications, such as machine translation and speech recognition, to improve the overall performance of the system. In a real-world scenario, a deployed dialect classification model can encounter anomalous inputs that differ from the training data distribution, also called out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Those OOD samples can lead to unexpected outputs, as dialects of those samples are unseen during model training. Out-of-distribution detection is a new research area that has received little attention in the context of dialect classification. Towards this, we proposed a simple yet effective unsupervised Mahalanobis distance feature-based method to detect out-of-distribution samples. We utilize the latent embeddings from all intermediate layers of a wav2vec 2.0 transformer-based dialect classifier model for multi-task learning. Our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art OOD detection methods significantly.

- **Summary**: In recent years, with the continuous development of the marine industry, underwater image enhancement has attracted plenty of attention. Unfortunately, the propagation of light in water will be absorbed by water bodies and scattered by suspended particles, resulting in color deviation and low contrast. To solve these two problems, we propose an Adaptive Transmission and Dynamic Color guided network (named ATDCnet) for underwater image enhancement. In particular, to exploit the knowledge of physics, we design an Adaptive Transmission-directed Module (ATM) to better guide the network. To deal with the color deviation problem, we design a Dynamic Color-guided Module (DCM) to post-process the enhanced image color. Further, we design an Encoder-Decoder-based Compensation (EDC) structure with attention and a multi-stage feature fusion mechanism to perform color restoration and contrast enhancement simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the ATDCnet on multiple benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Video colorization, aiming at obtaining colorful and plausible results from grayish frames, has aroused a lot of interest recently. Nevertheless, how to maintain temporal consistency while keeping the quality of colorized results remains challenging. To tackle the above problems, we present a Histogram-guided Video Colorization with Spatial-Temporal connection structure (named ST-HVC). To fully exploit the chroma and motion information, the joint flow and histogram module is tailored to integrate the histogram and flow features. To manage the blurred and artifact, we design a combination scheme attending to temporal detail and flow feature combination. We further recombine the histogram, flow and sharpness features via a U-shape network. Extensive comparisons are conducted with several state-of-the-art image and video-based methods, demonstrating that the developed method achieves excellent performance both quantitatively and qualitatively in two video datasets.

- **Summary**: Video shakiness is an unpleasant distortion of User Generated Content (UGC) videos, which is usually caused by the unstable hold of cameras. In recent years, many video stabilization algorithms have been proposed, yet no specific and accurate metric enables comprehensively evaluating the stability of videos. Indeed, most existing quality assessment models evaluate video quality as a whole without specifically taking the subjective experience of video stability into consideration. Therefore, these models cannot measure the video stability explicitly and precisely when severe shakes are present. In addition, there is no large-scale video database in public that includes various degrees of shaky videos with the corresponding subjective scores available, which hinders the development of Video Quality Assessment for Stability (VQA-S). To this end, we build a new database named StableDB that contains 1,952 diversely-shaky UGC videos, where each video has a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) on the degree of video stability rated by 34 subjects. Moreover, we elaborately design a novel VQA-S model named StableVQA, which consists of three feature extractors to acquire the optical flow, semantic, and blur features respectively, and a regression layer to predict the final stability score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the StableVQA achieves a higher correlation with subjective opinions than the existing VQA-S models and generic VQA models. The database and codes are available at https://github.com/QMME/StableVQA.

- **Summary**: Medical image analysis using deep learning is often challenged by limited labeled data and high annotation costs. Fine-tuning the entire network in label-limited scenarios can lead to overfitting and suboptimal performance. Recently, prompt tuning has emerged as a more promising technique that introduces a few additional tunable parameters as prompts to a task-agnostic pre-trained model, and updates only these parameters using supervision from limited labeled data while keeping the pre-trained model unchanged. However, previous work has overlooked the importance of selective labeling in downstream tasks, which aims to select the most valuable downstream samples for annotation to achieve the best performance with minimum annotation cost. To address this, we propose a framework that combines selective labeling with prompt tuning (SLPT) to boost performance in limited labels. Specifically, we introduce a feature-aware prompt updater to guide prompt tuning and a TandEm Selective LAbeling (TESLA) strategy. TESLA includes unsupervised diversity selection and supervised selection using prompt-based uncertainty. In addition, we propose a diversified visual prompt tuning strategy to provide multi-prompt-based discrepant predictions for TESLA. We evaluate our method on liver tumor segmentation and achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming traditional fine-tuning with only 6% of tunable parameters, also achieving 94% of full-data performance by labeling only 5% of the data.

- **Summary**: Live commerce is the act of selling products online through live streaming. The customer's diverse demands for online products introduce more challenges to Livestreaming Product Recognition. Previous works have primarily focused on fashion clothing data or utilize single-modal input, which does not reflect the real-world scenario where multimodal data from various categories are present. In this paper, we present LPR4M, a large-scale multimodal dataset that covers 34 categories, comprises 3 modalities (image, video, and text), and is 50x larger than the largest publicly available dataset. LPR4M contains diverse videos and noise modality pairs while exhibiting a long-tailed distribution, resembling real-world problems. Moreover, a cRoss-vIew semantiC alignmEnt (RICE) model is proposed to learn discriminative instance features from the image and video views of the products. This is achieved through instance-level contrastive learning and cross-view patch-level feature propagation. A novel Patch Feature Reconstruction loss is proposed to penalize the semantic misalignment between cross-view patches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RICE and provide insights into the importance of dataset diversity and expressivity.

- **Summary**: Functionally significant coronary artery disease (CAD) is caused by plaque buildup in the coronary arteries, potentially leading to narrowing of the arterial lumen, i.e. coronary stenosis, that significantly obstructs blood flow to the myocardium. The current reference for establishing the presence of a functionally significant stenosis is invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement. To avoid invasive measurements, non-invasive prediction of FFR from coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has emerged. For this, machine learning approaches, characterized by fast inference, are increasingly developed. However, these methods predict a single FFR value per artery i.e. they don't provide information about the stenosis location or treatment strategy. We propose a deep learning-based method to predict the FFR along the artery from CCTA scans. This study includes CCTA images of 110 patients who underwent invasive FFR pullback measurement in 112 arteries. First, a multi planar reconstruction (MPR) of the artery is fed to a variational autoencoder to characterize the artery, i.e. through the lumen area and unsupervised artery encodings. Thereafter, a convolutional neural network (CNN) predicts the FFR along the artery. The CNN is supervised by multiple loss functions, notably a loss function inspired by the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to predict the correct location of FFR drops and a histogram-based loss to explicitly supervise the slope of the FFR curve. To train and evaluate our model, eight-fold cross-validation was performed. The resulting FFR curves show good agreement with the reference allowing the distinction between diffuse and focal CAD distributions in most cases. Quantitative evaluation yielded a mean absolute difference in the area under the FFR pullback curve (AUPC) of 1.7. The method may pave the way towards fast, accurate, automatic prediction of FFR along the artery from CCTA.



### GeodesicPSIM: Predicting the Quality of Static Mesh with Texture Map via Geodesic Patch Similarity

- **Summary**: Static meshes with texture maps have attracted considerable attention in both industrial manufacturing and academic research, leading to an urgent requirement for effective and robust objective quality evaluation. However, current model-based static mesh quality metrics have obvious limitations: most of them only consider geometry information, while color information is ignored, and they have strict constraints for the meshes' geometrical topology. Other metrics, such as image-based and point-based metrics, are easily influenced by the prepossessing algorithms, e.g., projection and sampling, hampering their ability to perform at their best. In this paper, we propose Geodesic Patch Similarity (GeodesicPSIM), a novel model-based metric to accurately predict human perception quality for static meshes. After selecting a group keypoints, 1-hop geodesic patches are constructed based on both the reference and distorted meshes cleaned by an effective mesh cleaning algorithm. A two-step patch cropping algorithm and a patch texture mapping module refine the size of 1-hop geodesic patches and build the relationship between the mesh geometry and color information, resulting in the generation of 1-hop textured geodesic patches. Three types of features are extracted to quantify the distortion: patch color smoothness, patch discrete mean curvature, and patch pixel color average and variance. To the best of our knowledge, GeodesicPSIM is the first model-based metric especially designed for static meshes with texture maps. GeodesicPSIM provides state-of-the-art performance in comparison with image-based, point-based, and video-based metrics on a newly created and challenging database. We also prove the robustness of GeodesicPSIM by introducing different settings of hyperparameters. Ablation studies also exhibit the effectiveness of three proposed features and the patch cropping algorithm.

- **Summary**: We propose JEDI, a multi-dataset semi-supervised learning method, which efficiently combines knowledge from multiple experts, learned on different datasets, to train and improve the performance of individual, per dataset, student models. Our approach achieves this by addressing two important problems in current machine learning research: generalization across datasets and limitations of supervised training due to scarcity of labeled data. We start with an arbitrary number of experts, pretrained on their own specific dataset, which form the initial set of student models. The teachers are immediately derived by concatenating the feature representations from the penultimate layers of the students. We then train all models in a student-teacher semi-supervised learning scenario until convergence. In our efficient approach, student-teacher training is carried out jointly and end-to-end, showing that both students and teachers improve their generalization capacity during training. We validate our approach on four video action recognition datasets. By simultaneously considering all datasets within a unified semi-supervised setting, we demonstrate significant improvements over the initial experts.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) in images, identifying significant deviations from normality, is a critical issue in computer vision. This paper introduces a novel approach to dimensionality reduction for AD using pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that incorporate EfficientNet models. We investigate the importance of component selection and propose two types of tree search approaches, both employing a greedy strategy, for optimal eigencomponent selection. Our study conducts three main experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The first experiment explores the influence of test set performance on component choice, the second experiment examines the performance when we train on one anomaly type and evaluate on all other types, and the third experiment investigates the impact of using a minimum number of images for training and selecting them based on anomaly types. Our approach aims to find the optimal subset of components that deliver the highest performance score, instead of focusing solely on the proportion of variance explained by each component and also understand the components behaviour in different settings. Our results indicate that the proposed method surpasses both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Negated Principal Component Analysis (NPCA) in terms of detection accuracy, even when using fewer components. Thus, our approach provides a promising alternative to conventional dimensionality reduction techniques in AD, and holds potential to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of AD systems.

- **Summary**: Generalisation of deep neural networks becomes vulnerable when distribution shifts are encountered between train (source) and test (target) domain data. Few-shot domain adaptation mitigates this issue by adapting deep neural networks pre-trained on the source domain to the target domain using a randomly selected and annotated support set from the target domain. This paper argues that randomly selecting the support set can be further improved for effectively adapting the pre-trained source models to the target domain. Alternatively, we propose SelectNAdapt, an algorithm to curate the selection of the target domain samples, which are then annotated and included in the support set. In particular, for the K-shot adaptation problem, we first leverage self-supervision to learn features of the target domain data. Then, we propose a per-class clustering scheme of the learned target domain features and select K representative target samples using a distance-based scoring function. Finally, we bring our selection setup towards a practical ground by relying on pseudo-labels for clustering semantically similar target domain samples. Our experiments show promising results on three few-shot domain adaptation benchmarks for image recognition compared to related approaches and the standard random selection.

- **Summary**: End-to-end weakly supervised semantic segmentation aims at optimizing a segmentation model in a single-stage training process based on only image annotations. Existing methods adopt an online-trained classification branch to provide pseudo annotations for supervising the segmentation branch. However, this strategy makes the classification branch dominate the whole concurrent training process, hindering these two branches from assisting each other. In our work, we treat these two branches equally by viewing them as diverse ways to generate the segmentation map, and add interactions on both their supervision and operation to achieve mutual promotion. For this purpose, a bidirectional supervision mechanism is elaborated to force the consistency between the outputs of these two branches. Thus, the segmentation branch can also give feedback to the classification branch to enhance the quality of localization seeds. Moreover, our method also designs interaction operations between these two branches to exchange their knowledge to assist each other. Experiments indicate our work outperforms existing end-to-end weakly supervised segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) extends Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) to simultaneously segment unseen classes and seen classes during evaluation. Previous works leverage additional branch or prototypical aggregation to eliminate the constrained setting of FSS. However, representation division and embedding prejudice, which heavily results in poor performance of GFSS, have not been synthetical considered. We address the aforementioned problems by jointing the prototypical kernel learning and open-set foreground perception. Specifically, a group of learnable kernels is proposed to perform segmentation with each kernel in charge of a stuff class. Then, we explore to merge the prototypical learning to the update of base-class kernels, which is consistent with the prototype knowledge aggregation of few-shot novel classes. In addition, a foreground contextual perception module cooperating with conditional bias based inference is adopted to perform class-agnostic as well as open-set foreground detection, thus to mitigate the embedding prejudice and prevent novel targets from being misclassified as background. Moreover, we also adjust our method to the Class Incremental Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (CIFSS) which takes the knowledge of novel classes in a incremental stream. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate that our method performs better than previous state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unknown poses (projection angles and image translation) in cryo-EM experiments, reconstructing 3D structures from 2D images is very challenging. On top of these challenges, heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction also has an additional requirement: conformation classification. An emerging solution to this problem is called amortized inference, implemented using the autoencoder architecture or its variants. Instead of searching for the correct image-to-pose/conformation mapping for every image in the dataset as in non-amortized methods, amortized inference only needs to train an encoder that maps images to appropriate latent spaces representing poses or conformations. Unfortunately, standard amortized-inference-based methods with entangled latent spaces have difficulty learning the distribution of conformations and poses from cryo-EM images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning architecture called "ACE-HetEM" based on amortized inference. To explicitly enforce the disentanglement of conformation classifications and pose estimations, we designed two alternating training tasks in our method: image-to-image task and pose-to-pose task. Results on simulated datasets show that ACE-HetEM has comparable accuracy in pose estimation and produces even better reconstruction resolution than non-amortized methods. Furthermore, we show that ACE-HetEM is also applicable to real experimental datasets.

- **Summary**: A Point Distribution Model (PDM) is the basis of a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) that relies on a set of landmark points to represent a shape and characterize the shape variation. In this work, we present a self-supervised approach to extract landmark points from a given registration model for the PDMs. Based on the assumption that the landmarks are the points that have the most influence on registration, existing works learn a point-based registration model with a small number of points to estimate the landmark points that influence the deformation the most. However, such approaches assume that the deformation can be captured by point-based registration and quality landmarks can be learned solely with the deformation capturing objective. We argue that data with complicated deformations can not easily be modeled with point-based registration when only a limited number of points is used to extract influential landmark points. Further, landmark consistency is not assured in existing approaches In contrast, we propose to extract landmarks based on a given registration model, which is tailored for the target data, so we can obtain more accurate correspondences. Secondly, to establish the anatomical consistency of the predicted landmarks, we introduce a landmark discovery loss to explicitly encourage the model to predict the landmarks that are anatomically consistent across subjects. We conduct experiments on an osteoarthritis progression prediction task and show our method outperforms existing image-based and point-based approaches.

- **Summary**: Foreground object search (FOS) aims to find compatible foreground objects for a given background image, producing realistic composite image. We observe that competitive retrieval performance could be achieved by using a discriminator to predict the compatibility of composite image, but this approach has unaffordable time cost. To this end, we propose a novel FOS method via distilling composite feature (DiscoFOS). Specifically, the abovementioned discriminator serves as teacher network. The student network employs two encoders to extract foreground feature and background feature. Their interaction output is enforced to match the composite image feature from the teacher network. Additionally, previous works did not release their datasets, so we contribute two datasets for FOS task: S-FOSD dataset with synthetic composite images and R-FOSD dataset with real composite images. Extensive experiments on our two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over previous approaches. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/bcmi/Foreground-Object-Search-Dataset-FOSD.

- **Summary**: The availability of large-scale authentic face databases has been crucial to the significant advances made in face recognition research over the past decade. However, legal and ethical concerns led to the recent retraction of many of these databases by their creators, raising questions about the continuity of future face recognition research without one of its key resources. Synthetic datasets have emerged as a promising alternative to privacy-sensitive authentic data for face recognition development. However, recent synthetic datasets that are used to train face recognition models suffer either from limitations in intra-class diversity or cross-class (identity) discrimination, leading to less optimal accuracies, far away from the accuracies achieved by models trained on authentic data. This paper targets this issue by proposing IDiff-Face, a novel approach based on conditional latent diffusion models for synthetic identity generation with realistic identity variations for face recognition training. Through extensive evaluations, our proposed synthetic-based face recognition approach pushed the limits of state-of-the-art performances, achieving, for example, 98.00% accuracy on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark, far ahead from the recent synthetic-based face recognition solutions with 95.40% and bridging the gap to authentic-based face recognition with 99.82% accuracy.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised methods, such as class activation maps (CAM) based, have been applied to achieve bleeding segmentation with low annotation efforts in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images. However, the CAM labels tend to be extremely noisy, and there is an irreparable gap between CAM labels and ground truths for medical images. This paper proposes a new Discrepancy-basEd Active Learning (DEAL) approach to bridge the gap between CAMs and ground truths with a few annotations. Specifically, to liberate labor, we design a novel discrepancy decoder model and a CAMPUS (CAM, Pseudo-label and groUnd-truth Selection) criterion to replace the noisy CAMs with accurate model predictions and a few human labels. The discrepancy decoder model is trained with a unique scheme to generate standard, coarse and fine predictions. And the CAMPUS criterion is proposed to predict the gaps between CAMs and ground truths based on model divergence and CAM divergence. We evaluate our method on the WCE dataset and results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art active learning methods and reaches comparable performance to those trained with full annotated datasets with only 10% of the training data labeled.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL) models are gaining popularity in forest variable prediction using Earth Observation images. However, in practical forest inventories, reference datasets are often represented by plot- or stand-level measurements, while high-quality representative wall-to-wall reference data for end-to-end training of DL models are rarely available. Transfer learning facilitates expansion of the use of deep learning models into areas with sub-optimal training data by allowing pretraining of the model in areas where high-quality teaching data are available. In this study, we perform a "model transfer" (or domain adaptation) of a pretrained DL model into a target area using plot-level measurements and compare performance versus other machine learning models. We use an earlier developed UNet based model (SeUNet) to demonstrate the approach on two distinct taiga sites with varying forest structure and composition. Multisource Earth Observation (EO) data are represented by a combination of Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, JAXA ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 SAR mosaic and TanDEM-X bistatic interferometric radar data. The training study site is located in Finnish Lapland, while the target site is located in Southern Finland. By leveraging transfer learning, the prediction of SeUNet achieved root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.70 m and R$^2$ of 0.882, considerably more accurate than traditional benchmark methods. We expect such forest-specific DL model transfer can be suitable also for other forest variables and other EO data sources that are sensitive to forest structure.



### Do Diffusion Models Suffer Error Propagation? Theoretical Analysis and Consistency Regularization

- **Summary**: While diffusion models have achieved promising performances in data synthesis, they might suffer error propagation because of their cascade structure, where the distributional mismatch spreads and magnifies through the chain of denoising modules. However, a strict analysis is expected since many sequential models such as Conditional Random Field (CRF) are free from error propagation. In this paper, we empirically and theoretically verify that diffusion models are indeed affected by error propagation and we then propose a regularization to address this problem. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the question can be reduced to whether every denoising module of the diffusion model is fault-tolerant. We derive insightful transition equations, indicating that the module can't recover from input errors and even propagates additional errors to the next module. Our analysis directly leads to a consistency regularization scheme for diffusion models, which explicitly reduces the distribution gap between forward and backward processes. We further introduce a bootstrapping algorithm to reduce the computation cost of the regularizer. Our experimental results on multiple image datasets show that our regularization effectively handles error propagation and significantly improves the performance of vanilla diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Object modeling has become a core part of recent tracking frameworks. Current popular tackers use Transformer attention to extract the template feature separately or interactively with the search region. However, separate template learning lacks communication between the template and search regions, which brings difficulty in extracting discriminative target-oriented features. On the other hand, interactive template learning produces hybrid template features, which may introduce potential distractors to the template via the cluttered search regions. To enjoy the merits of both methods, we propose a robust object modeling framework for visual tracking (ROMTrack), which simultaneously models the inherent template and the hybrid template features. As a result, harmful distractors can be suppressed by combining the inherent features of target objects with search regions' guidance. Target-related features can also be extracted using the hybrid template, thus resulting in a more robust object modeling framework. To further enhance robustness, we present novel variation tokens to depict the ever-changing appearance of target objects. Variation tokens are adaptable to object deformation and appearance variations, which can boost overall performance with negligible computation. Experiments show that our ROMTrack sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based methods have exhibited remarkable potential in single image super-resolution (SISR) by effectively extracting long-range dependencies. However, most of the current research in this area has prioritized the design of transformer blocks to capture global information, while overlooking the importance of incorporating high-frequency priors, which we believe could be beneficial. In our study, we conducted a series of experiments and found that transformer structures are more adept at capturing low-frequency information, but have limited capacity in constructing high-frequency representations when compared to their convolutional counterparts. Our proposed solution, the cross-refinement adaptive feature modulation transformer (CRAFT), integrates the strengths of both convolutional and transformer structures. It comprises three key components: the high-frequency enhancement residual block (HFERB) for extracting high-frequency information, the shift rectangle window attention block (SRWAB) for capturing global information, and the hybrid fusion block (HFB) for refining the global representation. Our experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that CRAFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 0.29dB while using fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: Perception that involves multi-object detection and tracking, and trajectory prediction are two major tasks of autonomous driving. However, they are currently mostly studied separately, which results in most trajectory prediction modules being developed based on ground truth trajectories without taking into account that trajectories extracted from the detection and tracking modules in real-world scenarios are noisy. These noisy trajectories can have a significant impact on the performance of the trajectory predictor and can lead to serious prediction errors. In this paper, we build an end-to-end framework for detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction called ODTP (Online Detection, Tracking and Prediction). It adopts the state-of-the-art online multi-object tracking model, QD-3DT, for perception and trains the trajectory predictor, DCENet++, directly based on the detection results without purely relying on ground truth trajectories. We evaluate the performance of ODTP on the widely used nuScenes dataset for autonomous driving. Extensive experiments show that ODPT achieves high performance end-to-end trajectory prediction. DCENet++, with the enhanced dynamic maps, predicts more accurate trajectories than its base model. It is also more robust when compared with other generative and deterministic trajectory prediction models trained on noisy detection results.

- **Summary**: One of the important bottlenecks in training modern object detectors is the need for labeled images where bounding box annotations have to be produced for each object present in the image. This bottleneck is further exacerbated in aerial images where the annotators have to label small objects often distributed in clusters on high-resolution images. In recent days, the mean-teacher approach trained with pseudo-labels and weak-strong augmentation consistency is gaining popularity for semi-supervised object detection. However, a direct adaptation of such semi-supervised detectors for aerial images where small clustered objects are often present, might not lead to optimal results. In this paper, we propose a density crop-guided semi-supervised detector that identifies the cluster of small objects during training and also exploits them to improve performance at inference. During training, image crops of clusters identified from labeled and unlabeled images are used to augment the training set, which in turn increases the chance of detecting small objects and creating good pseudo-labels for small objects on the unlabeled images. During inference, the detector is not only able to detect the objects of interest but also regions with a high density of small objects (density crops) so that detections from the input image and detections from image crops are combined, resulting in an overall more accurate object prediction, especially for small objects. Empirical studies on the popular benchmarks of VisDrone and DOTA datasets show the effectiveness of our density crop-guided semi-supervised detector with an average improvement of more than 2\% over the basic mean-teacher method in COCO style AP.

- **Summary**: We present PAT, a transformer-based network that learns complex temporal co-occurrence action dependencies in a video by exploiting multi-scale temporal features. In existing methods, the self-attention mechanism in transformers loses the temporal positional information, which is essential for robust action detection. To address this issue, we (i) embed relative positional encoding in the self-attention mechanism and (ii) exploit multi-scale temporal relationships by designing a novel non hierarchical network, in contrast to the recent transformer-based approaches that use a hierarchical structure. We argue that joining the self-attention mechanism with multiple sub-sampling processes in the hierarchical approaches results in increased loss of positional information. We evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on two challenging dense multi-label benchmark datasets, and show that PAT improves the current state-of-the-art result by 1.1% and 0.6% mAP on the Charades and MultiTHUMOS datasets, respectively, thereby achieving the new state-of-the-art mAP at 26.5% and 44.6%, respectively. We also perform extensive ablation studies to examine the impact of the different components of our proposed network.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has revolutionized industries like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, back propagation, the main method for training deep neural networks, faces challenges like computational overhead and vanishing gradients. In this paper, we propose a novel instant parameter update methodology that eliminates the need for computing gradients at each layer. Our approach accelerates learning, avoids the vanishing gradient problem, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark data sets. This research presents a promising direction for efficient and effective deep neural network training.

- **Summary**: Many segmentation networks have been proposed for 3D volumetric segmentation of tumors and organs at risk. Hospitals and clinical institutions seek to accelerate and minimize the efforts of specialists in image segmentation. Still, in case of errors generated by these networks, clinicians would have to manually edit the generated segmentation maps. Given a 3D volume and its putative segmentation map, we propose an approach to identify and measure erroneous regions in the segmentation map. Our method can estimate error at any point or node in a 3D mesh generated from a possibly erroneous volumetric segmentation map, serving as a Quality Assurance tool. We propose a graph neural network-based transformer based on the Nodeformer architecture to measure and classify the segmentation errors at any point. We have evaluated our network on a high-resolution micro-CT dataset of the human inner-ear bony labyrinth structure by simulating erroneous 3D segmentation maps. Our network incorporates a convolutional encoder to compute node-centric features from the input micro-CT data, the Nodeformer to learn the latent graph embeddings, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to compute and classify the node-wise errors. Our network achieves a mean absolute error of ~0.042 over other Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and an accuracy of 79.53% over other GNNs in estimating and classifying the node-wise errors, respectively. We also put forth vertex-normal prediction as a custom pretext task for pre-training the CNN encoder to improve the network's overall performance. Qualitative analysis shows the efficiency of our network in correctly classifying errors and reducing misclassifications.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Digital Document Restoration (DDR) have led to significant breakthroughs in analyzing highly damaged written artifacts. Among those, there has been an increasing interest in applying Artificial Intelligence techniques for virtually unwrapping and automatically detecting ink on the Herculaneum papyri collection. This collection consists of carbonized scrolls and fragments of documents, which have been digitized via X-ray tomography to allow the development of ad-hoc deep learning-based DDR solutions. In this work, we propose a modification of the Fast Fourier Convolution operator for volumetric data and apply it in a segmentation architecture for ink detection on the challenging Herculaneum papyri, demonstrating its suitability via deep experimental analysis. To encourage the research on this task and the application of the proposed operator to other tasks involving volumetric data, we will release our implementation (https://github.com/aimagelab/vffc)

- **Summary**: In order to respond effectively in the aftermath of a disaster, emergency services and relief organizations rely on timely and accurate information about the affected areas. Remote sensing has the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort required to collect such information by enabling a rapid survey of large areas. To achieve this, the main challenge is the automatic extraction of relevant information from remotely sensed data. In this work, we show how the combination of drone-based data with deep learning methods enables automated and large-scale situation assessment. In addition, we demonstrate the integration of onboard image processing techniques for the deployment of autonomous drone-based aid delivery. The results show the feasibility of a rapid and large-scale image analysis in the field, and that onboard image processing can increase the safety of drone-based aid deliveries.

- **Summary**: Video Semantic Role Labeling (VidSRL) aims to detect the salient events from given videos, by recognizing the predict-argument event structures and the interrelationships between events. While recent endeavors have put forth methods for VidSRL, they can be mostly subject to two key drawbacks, including the lack of fine-grained spatial scene perception and the insufficiently modeling of video temporality. Towards this end, this work explores a novel holistic spatio-temporal scene graph (namely HostSG) representation based on the existing dynamic scene graph structures, which well model both the fine-grained spatial semantics and temporal dynamics of videos for VidSRL. Built upon the HostSG, we present a nichetargeting VidSRL framework. A scene-event mapping mechanism is first designed to bridge the gap between the underlying scene structure and the high-level event semantic structure, resulting in an overall hierarchical scene-event (termed ICE) graph structure. We further perform iterative structure refinement to optimize the ICE graph, such that the overall structure representation can best coincide with end task demand. Finally, three subtask predictions of VidSRL are jointly decoded, where the end-to-end paradigm effectively avoids error propagation. On the benchmark dataset, our framework boosts significantly over the current best-performing model. Further analyses are shown for a better understanding of the advances of our methods.

- **Summary**: The purpose of the research is to determine if currently available self-supervised learning techniques can accomplish human level comprehension of visual images using the same degree and amount of sensory input that people acquire from. Initial research on this topic solely considered data volume scaling. Here, we scale both the volume of data and the quality of the image. This scaling experiment is a self-supervised learning method that may be done without any outside financing. We find that scaling up data volume and picture resolution at the same time enables human-level item detection performance at sub-human sizes.We run a scaling experiment with vision transformers trained on up to 200000 images up to 256 ppi.

- **Summary**: In the text-to-image generation field, recent remarkable progress in Stable Diffusion makes it possible to generate rich kinds of novel photorealistic images. However, current models still face misalignment issues (e.g., problematic spatial relation understanding and numeration failure) in complex natural scenes, which impedes the high-faithfulness text-to-image generation. Although recent efforts have been made to improve controllability by giving fine-grained guidance (e.g., sketch and scribbles), this issue has not been fundamentally tackled since users have to provide such guidance information manually. In this work, we strive to synthesize high-fidelity images that are semantically aligned with a given textual prompt without any guidance. Toward this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine paradigm to achieve layout planning and image generation. Concretely, we first generate the coarse-grained layout conditioned on a given textual prompt via in-context learning based on Large Language Models. Afterward, we propose a fine-grained object-interaction diffusion method to synthesize high-faithfulness images conditioned on the prompt and the automatically generated layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of layout and image generation.

- **Summary**: Existing methods for interactive segmentation in radiance fields entail scene-specific optimization and thus cannot generalize across different scenes, which greatly limits their applicability. In this work we make the first attempt at Scene-Generalizable Interactive Segmentation in Radiance Fields (SGISRF) and propose a novel SGISRF method, which can perform 3D object segmentation for novel (unseen) scenes represented by radiance fields, guided by only a few interactive user clicks in a given set of multi-view 2D images. In particular, the proposed SGISRF focuses on addressing three crucial challenges with three specially designed techniques. First, we devise the Cross-Dimension Guidance Propagation to encode the scarce 2D user clicks into informative 3D guidance representations. Second, the Uncertainty-Eliminated 3D Segmentation module is designed to achieve efficient yet effective 3D segmentation. Third, Concealment-Revealed Supervised Learning scheme is proposed to reveal and correct the concealed 3D segmentation errors resulted from the supervision in 2D space with only 2D mask annotations. Extensive experiments on two real-world challenging benchmarks covering diverse scenes demonstrate 1) effectiveness and scene-generalizability of the proposed method, 2) favorable performance compared to classical method requiring scene-specific optimization.

- **Summary**: The present work discusses the use of a weakly-supervised deep learning algorithm that reduces the cost of labelling pixel-level masks for complex radio galaxies with multiple components. The algorithm is trained on weak class-level labels of radio galaxies to get class activation maps (CAMs). The CAMs are further refined using an inter-pixel relations network (IRNet) to get instance segmentation masks over radio galaxies and the positions of their infrared hosts. We use data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, specifically the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) Pilot Survey, which covered a sky area of 270 square degrees with an RMS sensitivity of 25-35 $\mu$Jy/beam. We demonstrate that weakly-supervised deep learning algorithms can achieve high accuracy in predicting pixel-level information, including masks for the extended radio emission encapsulating all galaxy components and the positions of the infrared host galaxies. We evaluate the performance of our method using mean Average Precision (mAP) across multiple classes at a standard intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.5. We show that the model achieves a mAP$_{50}$ of 67.5\% and 76.8\% for radio masks and infrared host positions, respectively.

- **Summary**: Existing model evaluation tools mainly focus on evaluating classification models, leaving a gap in evaluating more complex models, such as object detection. In this paper, we develop an open-source visual analysis tool, Uni-Evaluator, to support a unified model evaluation for classification, object detection, and instance segmentation in computer vision. The key idea behind our method is to formulate both discrete and continuous predictions in different tasks as unified probability distributions. Based on these distributions, we develop 1) a matrix-based visualization to provide an overview of model performance; 2) a table visualization to identify the problematic data subsets where the model performs poorly; 3) a grid visualization to display the samples of interest. These visualizations work together to facilitate the model evaluation from a global overview to individual samples. Two case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Uni-Evaluator in evaluating model performance and making informed improvements.

- **Summary**: Surgical instrument segmentation is recognised as a key enabler to provide advanced surgical assistance and improve computer assisted interventions. In this work, we propose SegMatch, a semi supervised learning method to reduce the need for expensive annotation for laparoscopic and robotic surgical images. SegMatch builds on FixMatch, a widespread semi supervised classification pipeline combining consistency regularization and pseudo labelling, and adapts it for the purpose of segmentation. In our proposed SegMatch, the unlabelled images are weakly augmented and fed into the segmentation model to generate a pseudo-label to enforce the unsupervised loss against the output of the model for the adversarial augmented image on the pixels with a high confidence score. Our adaptation for segmentation tasks includes carefully considering the equivariance and invariance properties of the augmentation functions we rely on. To increase the relevance of our augmentations, we depart from using only handcrafted augmentations and introduce a trainable adversarial augmentation strategy. Our algorithm was evaluated on the MICCAI Instrument Segmentation Challenge datasets Robust-MIS 2019 and EndoVis 2017. Our results demonstrate that adding unlabelled data for training purposes allows us to surpass the performance of fully supervised approaches which are limited by the availability of training data in these challenges. SegMatch also outperforms a range of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning semantic segmentation models in different labelled to unlabelled data ratios.

- **Summary**: Environmental perception is a key element of autonomous driving because the information received from the perception module influences core driving decisions. An outstanding challenge in real-time perception for autonomous driving lies in finding the best trade-off between detection quality and latency. Major constraints on both computation and power have to be taken into account for real-time perception in autonomous vehicles. Larger object detection models tend to produce the best results, but are also slower at runtime. Since the most accurate detectors cannot run in real-time locally, we investigate the possibility of offloading computation to edge and cloud platforms, which are less resource-constrained. We create a synthetic dataset to train object detection models and evaluate different offloading strategies. Using real hardware and network simulations, we compare different trade-offs between prediction quality and end-to-end delay. Since sending raw frames over the network implies additional transmission delays, we also explore the use of JPEG and H.265 compression at varying qualities and measure their impact on prediction metrics. We show that models with adequate compression can be run in real-time on the cloud while outperforming local detection performance.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are models that are utilized extensively for the hierarchical extraction of features. Vision transformers (ViTs), through the use of a self-attention mechanism, have recently achieved superior modeling of global contextual information compared to CNNs. However, to realize their image classification strength, ViTs require substantial training datasets. Where the available training data are limited, current advanced multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can provide viable alternatives to both deep CNNs and ViTs. In this paper, we developed the SGU-MLP, a learning algorithm that effectively uses both MLPs and spatial gating units (SGUs) for precise land use land cover (LULC) mapping. Results illustrated the superiority of the developed SGU-MLP classification algorithm over several CNN and CNN-ViT-based models, including HybridSN, ResNet, iFormer, EfficientFormer and CoAtNet. The proposed SGU-MLP algorithm was tested through three experiments in Houston, USA, Berlin, Germany and Augsburg, Germany. The SGU-MLP classification model was found to consistently outperform the benchmark CNN and CNN-ViT-based algorithms. For example, for the Houston experiment, SGU-MLP significantly outperformed HybridSN, CoAtNet, Efficientformer, iFormer and ResNet by approximately 15%, 19%, 20%, 21%, and 25%, respectively, in terms of average accuracy.

- **Summary**: This study performs an ablation analysis of Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGANs), concentrating on image-to-image synthesis utilizing a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. The current work explores the nuanced effects of varying critical parameters including the number of epochs, image count, and attributes of codebook vectors and latent dimensions, specifically within the constraint of limited resources. Notably, our focus is pinpointed on the vector quantization loss, keeping other hyperparameters and loss components (GAN loss) fixed. This was done to delve into a deeper understanding of the discrete latent space, and to explore how varying its size affects the reconstruction. Though, our results do not surpass the existing benchmarks, however, our findings shed significant light on VQGAN's behaviour for a smaller dataset, particularly concerning artifacts, codebook size optimization, and comparative analysis with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The study also uncovers the promising direction by introducing 2D positional encodings, revealing a marked reduction in artifacts and insights into balancing clarity and overfitting.

- **Summary**: Aphids are efficient vectors to transmit virus yellows in sugar beet fields. Timely monitoring and control of their populations are thus critical to prevent the large-scale outbreak of virus yellows. However, the manual counting of aphids, which is the most common practice, is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Additionally, two of the biggest challenges in aphid counting are that aphids are small objects and their density distributions are varied in different areas of the field. To address these challenges, we proposed a hybrid automatic aphid counting network architecture which integrates the detection network and the density map estimation network. When the distribution density of aphids is low, it utilizes an improved Yolov5 to count aphids. Conversely, when the distribution density of aphids is high, its witches to CSRNet to count aphids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework integrating the detection network and the density map estimation network for counting tasks. Through comparison experiments of counting aphids, it verified that our proposed approach outperforms all other methods in counting aphids. It achieved the lowest MAE and RMSE values for both the standard and high-density aphid datasets: 2.93 and 4.01 (standard), and 34.19 and 38.66 (high-density), respectively. Moreover, the AP of the improved Yolov5 is 5% higher than that of the original Yolov5. Especially for extremely small aphids and densely distributed aphids, the detection performance of the improved Yolov5 is significantly better than the original Yolov5. This work provides an effective early warning for the virus yellows risk caused by aphids in sugar beet fields, offering protection for sugar beet growth and ensuring sugar beet yield.

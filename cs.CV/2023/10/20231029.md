- **Summary**: Outdoor LiDAR point clouds are typically large-scale and complexly distributed. To achieve efficient and accurate registration, emphasizing the similarity among local regions and prioritizing global local-to-local matching is of utmost importance, subsequent to which accuracy can be enhanced through cost-effective fine registration. In this paper, a novel hierarchical neural network with double attention named HDMNet is proposed for large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud registration. Specifically, A novel feature consistency enhanced double-soft matching network is introduced to achieve two-stage matching with high flexibility while enlarging the receptive field with high efficiency in a patch-to patch manner, which significantly improves the registration performance. Moreover, in order to further utilize the sparse matching information from deeper layer, we develop a novel trainable embedding mask to incorporate the confidence scores of correspondences obtained from pose estimation of deeper layer, eliminating additional computations. The high-confidence keypoints in the sparser point cloud of the deeper layer correspond to a high-confidence spatial neighborhood region in shallower layer, which will receive more attention, while the features of non-key regions will be masked. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets to demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed HDMNet.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. Finally, we introduce an effective initialization method for the proposed scheme. Our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised monocular depth estimation techniques have demonstrated encouraging results but typically assume that the scene is static. These techniques suffer when trained on dynamical scenes, where apparent object motion can equally be explained by hypothesizing the object's independent motion, or by altering its depth. This ambiguity causes depth estimators to predict erroneous depth for moving objects. To resolve this issue, we introduce Dynamo-Depth, an unifying approach that disambiguates dynamical motion by jointly learning monocular depth, 3D independent flow field, and motion segmentation from unlabeled monocular videos. Specifically, we offer our key insight that a good initial estimation of motion segmentation is sufficient for jointly learning depth and independent motion despite the fundamental underlying ambiguity. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on monocular depth estimation on Waymo Open and nuScenes Dataset with significant improvement in the depth of moving objects.

- **Summary**: Existing multi-stage clustering methods independently learn the salient features from multiple views and then perform the clustering task. Particularly, multi-view clustering (MVC) has attracted a lot of attention in multi-view or multi-modal scenarios. MVC aims at exploring common semantics and pseudo-labels from multiple views and clustering in a self-supervised manner. However, limited by noisy data and inadequate feature learning, such a clustering paradigm generates overconfident pseudo-labels that mis-guide the model to produce inaccurate predictions. Therefore, it is desirable to have a method that can correct this pseudo-label mistraction in multi-stage clustering to avoid the bias accumulation. To alleviate the effect of overconfident pseudo-labels and improve the generalization ability of the model, this paper proposes a novel multi-stage deep MVC framework where multi-view self-distillation (DistilMVC) is introduced to distill dark knowledge of label distribution. Specifically, in the feature subspace at different hierarchies, we explore the common semantics of multiple views through contrastive learning and obtain pseudo-labels by maximizing the mutual information between views. Additionally, a teacher network is responsible for distilling pseudo-labels into dark knowledge, supervising the student network and improving its predictive capabilities to enhance the robustness. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets show that our method has better clustering performance than state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Current deep-learning models for object recognition are known to be heavily biased toward texture. In contrast, human visual systems are known to be biased toward shape and structure. What could be the design principles in human visual systems that led to this difference? How could we introduce more shape bias into the deep learning models? In this paper, we report that sparse coding, a ubiquitous principle in the brain, can in itself introduce shape bias into the network. We found that enforcing the sparse coding constraint using a non-differential Top-K operation can lead to the emergence of structural encoding in neurons in convolutional neural networks, resulting in a smooth decomposition of objects into parts and subparts and endowing the networks with shape bias. We demonstrated this emergence of shape bias and its functional benefits for different network structures with various datasets. For object recognition convolutional neural networks, the shape bias leads to greater robustness against style and pattern change distraction. For the image synthesis generative adversary networks, the emerged shape bias leads to more coherent and decomposable structures in the synthesized images. Ablation studies suggest that sparse codes tend to encode structures, whereas the more distributed codes tend to favor texture.

- **Summary**: Understanding urban dynamics and promoting sustainable development requires comprehensive insights about buildings. While geospatial artificial intelligence has advanced the extraction of such details from Earth observational data, existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiencies and inconsistencies when compiling unified building-related datasets for practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Multi-task Building Refiner (MT-BR), an adaptable neural network tailored for simultaneous extraction of spatial and attributional building details from high-resolution satellite imagery, exemplified by building rooftops, urban functional types, and roof architectural types. Notably, MT-BR can be fine-tuned to incorporate additional building details, extending its applicability. For large-scale applications, we devise a novel spatial sampling scheme that strategically selects limited but representative image samples. This process optimizes both the spatial distribution of samples and the urban environmental characteristics they contain, thus enhancing extraction effectiveness while curtailing data preparation expenditures. We further enhance MT-BR's predictive performance and generalization capabilities through the integration of advanced augmentation techniques. Our quantitative results highlight the efficacy of the proposed methods. Specifically, networks trained with datasets curated via our sampling method demonstrate improved predictive accuracy relative to those using alternative sampling approaches, with no alterations to network architecture. Moreover, MT-BR consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in extracting building details across various metrics. The real-world practicality is also demonstrated in an application across Shanghai, generating a unified dataset that encompasses both the spatial and attributional details of buildings.

- **Summary**: Existing contrastive learning methods rely on pairwise sample contrast $z_x^\top z_{x'}$ to learn data representations, but the learned features often lack clear interpretability from a human perspective. Theoretically, it lacks feature identifiability and different initialization may lead to totally different features. In this paper, we study a new method named tri-factor contrastive learning (triCL) that involves a 3-factor contrast in the form of $z_x^\top S z_{x'}$, where $S=\text{diag}(s_1,\dots,s_k)$ is a learnable diagonal matrix that automatically captures the importance of each feature. We show that by this simple extension, triCL can not only obtain identifiable features that eliminate randomness but also obtain more interpretable features that are ordered according to the importance matrix $S$. We show that features with high importance have nice interpretability by capturing common classwise features, and obtain superior performance when evaluated for image retrieval using a few features. The proposed triCL objective is general and can be applied to different contrastive learning methods like SimCLR and CLIP. We believe that it is a better alternative to existing 2-factor contrastive learning by improving its identifiability and interpretability with minimal overhead.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been a fundamental challenge in machine learning for decades. The primary family of SSL algorithms, known as pseudo-labeling, involves assigning pseudo-labels to confident unlabeled instances and incorporating them into the training set. Therefore, the selection criteria of confident instances are crucial to the success of SSL. Recently, there has been growing interest in the development of SSL methods that use dynamic or adaptive thresholds. Yet, these methods typically apply the same threshold to all samples, or use class-dependent thresholds for instances belonging to a certain class, while neglecting instance-level information. In this paper, we propose the study of instance-dependent thresholds, which has the highest degree of freedom compared with existing methods. Specifically, we devise a novel instance-dependent threshold function for all unlabeled instances by utilizing their instance-level ambiguity and the instance-dependent error rates of pseudo-labels, so instances that are more likely to have incorrect pseudo-labels will have higher thresholds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our instance-dependent threshold function provides a bounded probabilistic guarantee for the correctness of the pseudo-labels it assigns.

- **Summary**: Previous attempts to integrate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework either rely on the assumption of static scenes or treat dynamic objects as outliers. However, most of real-world scenarios is dynamic. In this paper, we propose a time-varying representation to track and reconstruct the dynamic scenes. Our system simultaneously maintains two processes, tracking process and mapping process. For tracking process, the entire input images are uniformly sampled and training of the RGB images are self-supervised. For mapping process, we leverage know masks to differentiate dynamic objects and static backgrounds, and we apply distinct sampling strategies for two types of areas. The parameters optimization for both processes are made up by two stages, the first stage associates time with 3D positions to convert the deformation field to the canonical field. And the second associates time with 3D positions in canonical field to obtain colors and Signed Distance Function (SDF). Besides, We propose a novel keyframe selection strategy based on the overlapping rate. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available synthetic datasets and validate that our method is more effective compared to current state-of-the-art dynamic mapping methods.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation and tracking are fundamental tasks for understanding human behaviors in videos. Existing top-down framework-based methods usually perform three-stage tasks: human detection, pose estimation and tracking. Although promising results have been achieved, these methods rely heavily on high-performance detectors and may fail to track persons who are occluded or miss-detected. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we develop a novel keypoint confidence network and a tracking pipeline to improve human detection and pose estimation in top-down approaches. Specifically, the keypoint confidence network is designed to determine whether each keypoint is occluded, and it is incorporated into the pose estimation module. In the tracking pipeline, we propose the Bbox-revision module to reduce missing detection and the ID-retrieve module to correct lost trajectories, improving the performance of the detection stage. Experimental results show that our approach is universal in human detection and pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both PoseTrack 2017 and 2018 datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present an efficient solution for weed classification in agriculture. We focus on optimizing model performance at inference while respecting the constraints of the agricultural domain. We propose a Quantized Deep Neural Network model that classifies a dataset of 9 weed classes using 8-bit integer (int8) quantization, a departure from standard 32-bit floating point (fp32) models. Recognizing the hardware resource limitations in agriculture, our model balances model size, inference time, and accuracy, aligning with practical requirements. We evaluate the approach on ResNet-50 and InceptionV3 architectures, comparing their performance against their int8 quantized versions. Transfer learning and fine-tuning are applied using the DeepWeeds dataset. The results show staggering model size and inference time reductions while maintaining accuracy in real-world production scenarios like Desktop, Mobile and Raspberry Pi. Our work sheds light on a promising direction for efficient AI in agriculture, holding potential for broader applications.   Code: https://github.com/parikshit14/QNN-for-weed

- **Summary**: Compressing videos into binary codes can improve retrieval speed and reduce storage overhead. However, learning accurate hash codes for video retrieval can be challenging due to high local redundancy and complex global dependencies between video frames, especially in the absence of labels. Existing self-supervised video hashing methods have been effective in designing expressive temporal encoders, but have not fully utilized the temporal dynamics and spatial appearance of videos due to less challenging and unreliable learning tasks. To address these challenges, we begin by utilizing the contrastive learning task to capture global spatio-temporal information of videos for hashing. With the aid of our designed augmentation strategies, which focus on spatial and temporal variations to create positive pairs, the learning framework can generate hash codes that are invariant to motion, scale, and viewpoint. Furthermore, we incorporate two collaborative learning tasks, i.e., frame order verification and scene change regularization, to capture local spatio-temporal details within video frames, thereby enhancing the perception of temporal structure and the modeling of spatio-temporal relationships. Our proposed Contrastive Hashing with Global-Local Spatio-temporal Information (CHAIN) outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised video hashing methods on four video benchmark datasets. Our codes will be released.

- **Summary**: Due to the epidemic of the coronavirus (Covid-19) and its rapid spread around the world, the world has faced an enormous crisis. To prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced the use of masks and keeping social distance as the best preventive method. So, developing an automatic monitoring system for detecting facemasks in some crowded places is essential. To do this, we propose a mask recognition system based on transfer learning and Inception v3 architecture. In the proposed method, two datasets are used simultaneously for training including the Simulated Mask Face Dataset (SMFD) and MaskedFace-Net (MFN) This paper tries to increase the accuracy of the proposed system by optimally setting hyper-parameters and accurately designing the fully connected layers. The main advantage of the proposed method is that in addition to masked and unmasked faces, it can also detect cases of incorrect use of mask. Therefore, the proposed method classifies the input face images into three categories. Experimental results show the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method; so, this method has achieved an accuracy of 99.47% and 99.33% in training and test data respectively

- **Summary**: In a backdoor attack, an adversary injects corrupted data into a model's training dataset in order to gain control over its predictions on images with a specific attacker-defined trigger. A typical corrupted training example requires altering both the image, by applying the trigger, and the label. Models trained on clean images, therefore, were considered safe from backdoor attacks. However, in some common machine learning scenarios, the training labels are provided by potentially malicious third-parties. This includes crowd-sourced annotation and knowledge distillation. We, hence, investigate a fundamental question: can we launch a successful backdoor attack by only corrupting labels? We introduce a novel approach to design label-only backdoor attacks, which we call FLIP, and demonstrate its strengths on three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet) and four architectures (ResNet-32, ResNet-18, VGG-19, and Vision Transformer). With only 2% of CIFAR-10 labels corrupted, FLIP achieves a near-perfect attack success rate of 99.4% while suffering only a 1.8% drop in the clean test accuracy. Our approach builds upon the recent advances in trajectory matching, originally introduced for dataset distillation.



### Adversarial Examples Are Not Real Features

- **Summary**: The existence of adversarial examples has been a mystery for years and attracted much interest. A well-known theory by \citet{ilyas2019adversarial} explains adversarial vulnerability from a data perspective by showing that one can extract non-robust features from adversarial examples and these features alone are useful for classification. However, the explanation remains quite counter-intuitive since non-robust features are mostly noise features to humans. In this paper, we re-examine the theory from a larger context by incorporating multiple learning paradigms. Notably, we find that contrary to their good usefulness under supervised learning, non-robust features attain poor usefulness when transferred to other self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning, masked image modeling, and diffusion models. It reveals that non-robust features are not really as useful as robust or natural features that enjoy good transferability between these paradigms. Meanwhile, for robustness, we also show that naturally trained encoders from robust features are largely non-robust under AutoAttack. Our cross-paradigm examination suggests that the non-robust features are not really useful but more like paradigm-wise shortcuts, and robust features alone might be insufficient to attain reliable model robustness.

- **Summary**: In this work, we first propose a fully differentiable Many-to-Many (M2M) splatting framework to interpolate frames efficiently. Given a frame pair, we estimate multiple bidirectional flows to directly forward warp the pixels to the desired time step before fusing overlapping pixels. In doing so, each source pixel renders multiple target pixels and each target pixel can be synthesized from a larger area of visual context, establishing a many-to-many splatting scheme with robustness to undesirable artifacts. For each input frame pair, M2M has a minuscule computational overhead when interpolating an arbitrary number of in-between frames, hence achieving fast multi-frame interpolation. However, directly warping and fusing pixels in the intensity domain is sensitive to the quality of motion estimation and may suffer from less effective representation capacity. To improve interpolation accuracy, we further extend an M2M++ framework by introducing a flexible Spatial Selective Refinement (SSR) component, which allows for trading computational efficiency for interpolation quality and vice versa. Instead of refining the entire interpolated frame, SSR only processes difficult regions selected under the guidance of an estimated error map, thereby avoiding redundant computation. Evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets shows that our method is able to improve the efficiency while maintaining competitive video interpolation quality, and it can be adjusted to use more or less compute as needed.

- **Summary**: Generating images from human sketches typically requires dedicated networks trained from scratch. In contrast, the emergence of the pre-trained Vision-Language models (e.g., CLIP) has propelled generative applications based on controlling the output imagery of existing StyleGAN models with text inputs or reference images. Parallelly, our work proposes a framework to control StyleGAN imagery with a single user sketch. In particular, we learn a conditional distribution in the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN model via energy-based learning and propose two novel energy functions leveraging CLIP for cross-domain semantic supervision. Once trained, our model can generate multi-modal images semantically aligned with the input sketch. Quantitative evaluations on synthesized datasets have shown that our approach improves significantly from previous methods in the one-shot regime. The superiority of our method is further underscored when experimenting with a wide range of human sketches of diverse styles and poses. Surprisingly, our models outperform the previous baseline regarding both the range of sketch inputs and image qualities despite operating with a stricter setting: with no extra training data and single sketch input.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of unsupervised heteroscedastic covariance estimation, where the goal is to learn the multivariate target distribution $\mathcal{N}(y, \Sigma_y | x )$ given an observation $x$. This problem is particularly challenging as $\Sigma_{y}$ varies for different samples (heteroscedastic) and no annotation for the covariance is available (unsupervised). Typically, state-of-the-art methods predict the mean $f_{\theta}(x)$ and covariance $\textrm{Cov}(f_{\theta}(x))$ of the target distribution through two neural networks trained using the negative log-likelihood. This raises two questions: (1) Does the predicted covariance truly capture the randomness of the predicted mean? (2) In the absence of ground-truth annotation, how can we quantify the performance of covariance estimation? We address (1) by deriving TIC: Taylor Induced Covariance, which captures the randomness of the multivariate $f_{\theta}(x)$ by incorporating its gradient and curvature around $x$ through the second order Taylor polynomial. Furthermore, we tackle (2) by introducing TAC: Task Agnostic Correlations, a metric which leverages conditioning of the normal distribution to evaluate the covariance. We verify the effectiveness of TIC through multiple experiments spanning synthetic (univariate, multivariate) and real-world datasets (UCI Regression, LSP, and MPII Human Pose Estimation). Our experiments show that TIC outperforms state-of-the-art in accurately learning the covariance, as quantified through TAC.

- **Summary**: Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) involves assigning a semantic label to each pixel in a video sequence. Prior work in this field has demonstrated promising results by extending image semantic segmentation models to exploit temporal relationships across video frames; however, these approaches often incur significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient mask propagation framework for VSS, called MPVSS. Our approach first employs a strong query-based image segmentor on sparse key frames to generate accurate binary masks and class predictions. We then design a flow estimation module utilizing the learned queries to generate a set of segment-aware flow maps, each associated with a mask prediction from the key frame. Finally, the mask-flow pairs are warped to serve as the mask predictions for the non-key frames. By reusing predictions from key frames, we circumvent the need to process a large volume of video frames individually with resource-intensive segmentors, alleviating temporal redundancy and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments on VSPW and Cityscapes demonstrate that our mask propagation framework achieves SOTA accuracy and efficiency trade-offs. For instance, our best model with Swin-L backbone outperforms the SOTA MRCFA using MiT-B5 by 4.0% mIoU, requiring only 26% FLOPs on the VSPW dataset. Moreover, our framework reduces up to 4x FLOPs compared to the per-frame Mask2Former baseline with only up to 2% mIoU degradation on the Cityscapes validation set.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) requires detection models trained using auxiliary data to detect anomalies without any training sample in a target dataset. It is a crucial task when training data is not accessible due to various concerns, \eg, data privacy, yet it is challenging since the models need to generalize to anomalies across different domains where the appearance of foreground objects, abnormal regions, and background features, such as defects/tumors on different products/organs, can vary significantly. Recently large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong zero-shot recognition ability in various vision tasks, including anomaly detection. However, their ZSAD performance is weak since the VLMs focus more on modeling the class semantics of the foreground objects rather than the abnormality/normality in the images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach, namely AnomalyCLIP, to adapt CLIP for accurate ZSAD across different domains. The key insight of AnomalyCLIP is to learn object-agnostic text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image regardless of its foreground objects. This allows our model to focus on the abnormal image regions rather than the object semantics, enabling generalized normality and abnormality recognition on diverse types of objects. Large-scale experiments on 17 real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AnomalyCLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies in datasets of highly diverse class semantics from various defect inspection and medical imaging domains.

- **Summary**: The space environment around the Earth is becoming increasingly populated by both active spacecraft and space debris. To avoid potential collision events, significant improvements in Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities and Collision Avoidance (CA) technologies are allowing the tracking and maneuvering of spacecraft with increasing accuracy and reliability. However, these procedures still largely involve a high level of human intervention to make the necessary decisions. For an increasingly complex space environment, this decision-making strategy is not likely to be sustainable. Therefore, it is important to successfully introduce higher levels of automation for key Space Traffic Management (STM) processes to ensure the level of reliability needed for navigating a large number of spacecraft. These processes range from collision risk detection to the identification of the appropriate action to take and the execution of avoidance maneuvers. This work proposes an implementation of autonomous CA decision-making capabilities on spacecraft based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. A novel methodology based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework is developed to train the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system on board the spacecraft, considering epistemic and aleatory uncertainties. The proposed framework considers imperfect monitoring information about the status of the debris in orbit and allows the AI system to effectively learn stochastic policies to perform accurate Collision Avoidance Maneuvers (CAMs). The objective is to successfully delegate the decision-making process for autonomously implementing a CAM to the spacecraft without human intervention. This approach would allow for a faster response in the decision-making process and for highly decentralized operations.

- **Summary**: Despite the growing use of transformer models in computer vision, a mechanistic understanding of these networks is still needed. This work introduces a method to reverse-engineer Vision Transformers trained to solve image classification tasks. Inspired by previous research in NLP, we demonstrate how the inner representations at any level of the hierarchy can be projected onto the learned class embedding space to uncover how these networks build categorical representations for their predictions. We use our framework to show how image tokens develop class-specific representations that depend on attention mechanisms and contextual information, and give insights on how self-attention and MLP layers differentially contribute to this categorical composition. We additionally demonstrate that this method (1) can be used to determine the parts of an image that would be important for detecting the class of interest, and (2) exhibits significant advantages over traditional linear probing approaches. Taken together, our results position our proposed framework as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability and explainability research.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable success achieved by deep learning algorithms in various domains, such as computer vision, they remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Adversarial Training (AT) stands out as one of the most effective solutions to address this issue; however, single-step AT can lead to Catastrophic Overfitting (CO). This scenario occurs when the adversarially trained network suddenly loses robustness against multi-step attacks like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Although several approaches have been proposed to address this problem in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we found out that they do not perform well when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we propose Blacksmith, a novel training strategy to overcome the CO problem, specifically in ViTs. Our approach utilizes either of PGD-2 or Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) randomly in a mini-batch during the adversarial training of the neural network. This will increase the diversity of our training attacks, which could potentially mitigate the CO issue. To manage the increased training time resulting from this combination, we craft the PGD-2 attack based on only the first half of the layers, while FGSM is applied end-to-end. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our novel method effectively prevents CO, achieves PGD-2 level performance, and outperforms other existing techniques including N-FGSM, which is the state-of-the-art method in fast training for CNNs.

- **Summary**: Music-driven group choreography poses a considerable challenge but holds significant potential for a wide range of industrial applications. The ability to generate synchronized and visually appealing group dance motions that are aligned with music opens up opportunities in many fields such as entertainment, advertising, and virtual performances. However, most of the recent works are not able to generate high-fidelity long-term motions, or fail to enable controllable experience. In this work, we aim to address the demand for high-quality and customizable group dance generation by effectively governing the consistency and diversity of group choreographies. In particular, we utilize a diffusion-based generative approach to enable the synthesis of flexible number of dancers and long-term group dances, while ensuring coherence to the input music. Ultimately, we introduce a Group Contrastive Diffusion (GCD) strategy to enhance the connection between dancers and their group, presenting the ability to control the consistency or diversity level of the synthesized group animation via the classifier-guidance sampling technique. Through intensive experiments and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing visually captivating and consistent group dance motions. The experimental results show the capability of our method to achieve the desired levels of consistency and diversity, while maintaining the overall quality of the generated group choreography.

- **Summary**: The introduction of neural radiance fields has greatly improved the effectiveness of view synthesis for monocular videos. However, existing algorithms face difficulties when dealing with uncontrolled or lengthy scenarios, and require extensive training time specific to each new scenario. To tackle these limitations, we propose DynPoint, an algorithm designed to facilitate the rapid synthesis of novel views for unconstrained monocular videos. Rather than encoding the entirety of the scenario information into a latent representation, DynPoint concentrates on predicting the explicit 3D correspondence between neighboring frames to realize information aggregation. Specifically, this correspondence prediction is achieved through the estimation of consistent depth and scene flow information across frames. Subsequently, the acquired correspondence is utilized to aggregate information from multiple reference frames to a target frame, by constructing hierarchical neural point clouds. The resulting framework enables swift and accurate view synthesis for desired views of target frames. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the considerable acceleration of training time achieved - typically an order of magnitude - by our proposed method while yielding comparable outcomes compared to prior approaches. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong robustness in handling long-duration videos without learning a canonical representation of video content.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the problem of weakly open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (WOVSS), which learns to segment objects of arbitrary classes using mere image-text pairs. Existing works turn to enhance the vanilla vision transformer by introducing explicit grouping recognition, i.e., employing several group tokens/centroids to cluster the image tokens and perform the group-text alignment. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from a granularity inconsistency regarding the usage of group tokens, which are aligned in the all-to-one v.s. one-to-one manners during the training and inference phases, respectively. We argue that this discrepancy arises from the lack of elaborate supervision for each group token. To bridge this granularity gap, this paper explores explicit supervision for the group tokens from the prototypical knowledge. To this end, this paper proposes the non-learnable prototypical regularization (NPR) where non-learnable prototypes are estimated from source features to serve as supervision and enable contrastive matching of the group tokens. This regularization encourages the group tokens to segment objects with less redundancy and capture more comprehensive semantic regions, leading to increased compactness and richness. Based on NPR, we propose the prototypical guidance segmentation network (PGSeg) that incorporates multi-modal regularization by leveraging prototypical sources from both images and texts at different levels, progressively enhancing the segmentation capability with diverse prototypical patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/Ferenas/PGSeg.

- **Summary**: Image super-resolution (SR) aims to learn a mapping from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) using paired HR-LR training images. Conventional SR methods typically gather the paired training data by synthesizing LR images from HR images using a predetermined degradation model, e.g., Bicubic down-sampling. However, the realistic degradation type of test images may mismatch with the training-time degradation type due to the dynamic changes of the real-world scenarios, resulting in inferior-quality SR images. To address this, existing methods attempt to estimate the degradation model and train an image-specific model, which, however, is quite time-consuming and impracticable to handle rapidly changing domain shifts. Moreover, these methods largely concentrate on the estimation of one degradation type (e.g., blur degradation), overlooking other degradation types like noise and JPEG in real-world test-time scenarios, thus limiting their practicality. To tackle these problems, we present an efficient test-time adaptation framework for SR, named SRTTA, which is able to quickly adapt SR models to test domains with different/unknown degradation types. Specifically, we design a second-order degradation scheme to construct paired data based on the degradation type of the test image, which is predicted by a pre-trained degradation classifier. Then, we adapt the SR model by implementing feature-level reconstruction learning from the initial test image to its second-order degraded counterparts, which helps the SR model generate plausible HR images. Extensive experiments are conducted on newly synthesized corrupted DIV2K datasets with 8 different degradations and several real-world datasets, demonstrating that our SRTTA framework achieves an impressive improvement over existing methods with satisfying speed.

- **Summary**: Training fingerprint recognition models using synthetic data has recently gained increased attention in the biometric community as it alleviates the dependency on sensitive personal data. Existing approaches for fingerprint generation are limited in their ability to generate diverse impressions of the same finger, a key property for providing effective data for training recognition models. To address this gap, we present FPGAN-Control, an identity preserving image generation framework which enables control over the fingerprint's image appearance (e.g., fingerprint type, acquisition device, pressure level) of generated fingerprints. We introduce a novel appearance loss that encourages disentanglement between the fingerprint's identity and appearance properties. In our experiments, we used the publicly available NIST SD302 (N2N) dataset for training the FPGAN-Control model. We demonstrate the merits of FPGAN-Control, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in terms of identity preservation level, degree of appearance control, and low synthetic-to-real domain gap. Finally, training recognition models using only synthetic datasets generated by FPGAN-Control lead to recognition accuracies that are on par or even surpass models trained using real data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate this.

- **Summary**: Decision-based methods have shown to be effective in black-box adversarial attacks, as they can obtain satisfactory performance and only require to access the final model prediction. Gradient estimation is a critical step in black-box adversarial attacks, as it will directly affect the query efficiency. Recent works have attempted to utilize gradient priors to facilitate score-based methods to obtain better results. However, these gradient priors still suffer from the edge gradient discrepancy issue and the successive iteration gradient direction issue, thus are difficult to simply extend to decision-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Decision-based Black-box Attack framework with Gradient Priors (DBA-GP), which seamlessly integrates the data-dependent gradient prior and time-dependent prior into the gradient estimation procedure. First, by leveraging the joint bilateral filter to deal with each random perturbation, DBA-GP can guarantee that the generated perturbations in edge locations are hardly smoothed, i.e., alleviating the edge gradient discrepancy, thus remaining the characteristics of the original image as much as possible. Second, by utilizing a new gradient updating strategy to automatically adjust the successive iteration gradient direction, DBA-GP can accelerate the convergence speed, thus improving the query efficiency. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms other strong baselines significantly.

- **Summary**: Large-scale video-language pre-training has made remarkable strides in advancing video-language understanding tasks. However, the heavy computational burden of video encoding remains a formidable efficiency bottleneck, particularly for long-form videos. These videos contain massive visual tokens due to their inherent 3D properties and spatiotemporal redundancy, making it challenging to capture complex temporal and spatial relationships. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient method called TEmporal-Spatial Token Aggregation (TESTA). TESTA condenses video semantics by adaptively aggregating similar frames, as well as similar patches within each frame. TESTA can reduce the number of visual tokens by 75% and thus accelerate video encoding. Building upon TESTA, we introduce a pre-trained video-language model equipped with a divided space-time token aggregation module in each video encoder block. We evaluate our model on five datasets for paragraph-to-video retrieval and long-form VideoQA tasks. Experimental results show that TESTA improves computing efficiency by 1.7 times, and achieves significant performance gains from its scalability in processing longer input frames, e.g., +13.7 R@1 on QuerYD and +6.5 R@1 on Condensed Movie.

Our experiments thoroughly assess GPT-4V's proficiency in answering questions paired with images using both pathology and radiology datasets from 11 modalities (e.g. Microscopy, Dermoscopy, X-ray, CT, etc.) and fifteen objects of interests (brain, liver, lung, etc.). Our datasets encompass a comprehensive range of medical inquiries, including sixteen distinct question types. Throughout our evaluations, we devised textual prompts for GPT-4V, directing it to synergize visual and textual information. The experiments with accuracy score conclude that the current version of GPT-4V is not recommended for real-world diagnostics due to its unreliable and suboptimal accuracy in responding to diagnostic medical questions. In addition, we delineate seven unique facets of GPT-4V's behavior in medical VQA, highlighting its constraints within this complex arena.

- **Summary**: Existing industrial anomaly detection (IAD) methods predict anomaly scores for both anomaly detection and localization. However, they struggle to perform a multi-turn dialog and detailed descriptions for anomaly regions, e.g., color, shape, and categories of industrial anomalies. Recently, large multimodal (i.e., vision and language) models (LMMs) have shown eminent perception abilities on multiple vision tasks such as image captioning, visual understanding, visual reasoning, etc., making it a competitive potential choice for more comprehensible anomaly detection. However, the knowledge about anomaly detection is absent in existing general LMMs, while training a specific LMM for anomaly detection requires a tremendous amount of annotated data and massive computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel large multi-modal model by applying vision experts for industrial anomaly detection (dubbed Myriad), which leads to definite anomaly detection and high-quality anomaly description. Specifically, we adopt MiniGPT-4 as the base LMM and design an Expert Perception module to embed the prior knowledge from vision experts as tokens which are intelligible to Large Language Models (LLMs). To compensate for the errors and confusions of vision experts, we introduce a domain adapter to bridge the visual representation gaps between generic and industrial images. Furthermore, we propose a Vision Expert Instructor, which enables the Q-Former to generate IAD domain vision-language tokens according to vision expert prior. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method not only performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods under the 1-class and few-shot settings, but also provide definite anomaly prediction along with detailed descriptions in IAD domain.

- **Summary**: Diffusion or flow-based models are powerful generative paradigms that are notoriously hard to sample as samples are defined as solutions to high-dimensional Ordinary or Stochastic Differential Equations (ODEs/SDEs) which require a large Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to approximate well. Existing methods to alleviate the costly sampling process include model distillation and designing dedicated ODE solvers. However, distillation is costly to train and sometimes can deteriorate quality, while dedicated solvers still require relatively large NFE to produce high quality samples. In this paper we introduce "Bespoke solvers", a novel framework for constructing custom ODE solvers tailored to the ODE of a given pre-trained flow model. Our approach optimizes an order consistent and parameter-efficient solver (e.g., with 80 learnable parameters), is trained for roughly 1% of the GPU time required for training the pre-trained model, and significantly improves approximation and generation quality compared to dedicated solvers. For example, a Bespoke solver for a CIFAR10 model produces samples with Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.73 with 10 NFE, and gets to 1% of the Ground Truth (GT) FID (2.59) for this model with only 20 NFE. On the more challenging ImageNet-64$\times$64, Bespoke samples at 2.2 FID with 10 NFE, and gets within 2% of GT FID (1.71) with 20 NFE.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in machine learning have shown that Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can improve machine learning models and align them with human preferences. Although very successful for Large Language Models (LLMs), these advancements have not had a comparable impact in research for autonomous vehicles -- where alignment with human expectations can be imperative. In this paper, we propose to adapt similar RL-based methods to unsupervised object discovery, i.e. learning to detect objects from LiDAR points without any training labels. Instead of labels, we use simple heuristics to mimic human feedback. More explicitly, we combine multiple heuristics into a simple reward function that positively correlates its score with bounding box accuracy, \ie, boxes containing objects are scored higher than those without. We start from the detector's own predictions to explore the space and reinforce boxes with high rewards through gradient updates. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is not only more accurate, but also orders of magnitudes faster to train compared to prior works on object discovery.

- **Summary**: This paper explores post-disaster analytics using multimodal deep learning models trained with curriculum learning method. Studying post-disaster analytics is important as it plays a crucial role in mitigating the impact of disasters by providing timely and accurate insights into the extent of damage and the allocation of resources. We propose a curriculum learning strategy to enhance the performance of multimodal deep learning models. Curriculum learning emulates the progressive learning sequence in human education by training deep learning models on increasingly complex data. Our primary objective is to develop a curriculum-trained multimodal deep learning model, with a particular focus on visual question answering (VQA) capable of jointly processing image and text data, in conjunction with semantic segmentation for disaster analytics using the FloodNet\footnote{https://github.com/BinaLab/FloodNet-Challenge-EARTHVISION2021} dataset. To achieve this, U-Net model is used for semantic segmentation and image encoding. A custom built text classifier is used for visual question answering. Existing curriculum learning methods rely on manually defined difficulty functions. We introduce a novel curriculum learning approach termed Dynamic Task and Weight Prioritization (DATWEP), which leverages a gradient-based method to automatically decide task difficulty during curriculum learning training, thereby eliminating the need for explicit difficulty computation. The integration of DATWEP into our multimodal model shows improvement on VQA performance. Source code is available at https://github.com/fualsan/DATWEP.

- **Summary**: While existing strategies for optimizing deep learning-based classification models on low-power platforms assume the models are trained on all classes of interest, this paper posits that adopting context-awareness i.e. focusing solely on the likely classes in the current context, can substantially enhance performance in resource-constrained environments. We propose a new paradigm, CACTUS, for scalable and efficient context-aware classification where a micro-classifier recognizes a small set of classes relevant to the current context and, when context change happens, rapidly switches to another suitable micro-classifier. CACTUS has several innovations including optimizing the training cost of context-aware classifiers, enabling on-the-fly context-aware switching between classifiers, and selecting the best context-aware classifiers given limited resources. We show that CACTUS achieves significant benefits in accuracy, latency, and compute budget across a range of datasets and IoT platforms.

- **Summary**: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) perception is an innovative technology that enhances vehicle perception accuracy, thereby elevating the security and reliability of autonomous systems. However, existing V2X perception methods focus on static scenes from mainly vehicle-based vision, which is constrained by sensor capabilities and communication loads. To adapt V2X perception models to dynamic scenes, we propose to build V2X perception from road-to-vehicle vision and present Adaptive Road-to-Vehicle Perception (AR2VP) method. In AR2VP,we leverage roadside units to offer stable, wide-range sensing capabilities and serve as communication hubs. AR2VP is devised to tackle both intra-scene and inter-scene changes. For the former, we construct a dynamic perception representing module, which efficiently integrates vehicle perceptions, enabling vehicles to capture a more comprehensive range of dynamic factors within the scene.Moreover, we introduce a road-to-vehicle perception compensating module, aimed at preserving the maximized roadside unit perception information in the presence of intra-scene changes.For inter-scene changes, we implement an experience replay mechanism leveraging the roadside unit's storage capacity to retain a subset of historical scene data, maintaining model robustness in response to inter-scene shifts. We conduct perception experiment on 3D object detection and segmentation, and the results show that AR2VP excels in both performance-bandwidth trade-offs and adaptability within dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: The superior performance of object detectors is often established under the condition that the test samples are in the same distribution as the training data. However, in many practical applications, out-of-distribution (OOD) instances are inevitable and usually lead to uncertainty in the results. In this paper, we propose a novel, intuitive, and scalable probabilistic object detection method for OOD detection. Unlike other uncertainty-modeling methods that either require huge computational costs to infer the weight distributions or rely on model training through synthetic outlier data, our method is able to distinguish between in-distribution (ID) data and OOD data via weight parameter sampling from proposed Gaussian distributions based on pre-trained networks. We demonstrate that our Bayesian object detector can achieve satisfactory OOD identification performance by reducing the FPR95 score by up to 8.19% and increasing the AUROC score by up to 13.94% when trained on BDD100k and VOC datasets as the ID datasets and evaluated on COCO2017 dataset as the OOD dataset.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the impact of objects on gender bias in image captioning systems. Our results show that only gender-specific objects have a strong gender bias (e.g., women-lipstick). In addition, we propose a visual semantic-based gender score that measures the degree of bias and can be used as a plug-in for any image captioning system. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of the gender score, since we observe that our score can measure the bias relation between a caption and its related gender; therefore, our score can be used as an additional metric to the existing Object Gender Co-Occ approach.

- **Summary**: Natural language instructions are a powerful interface for editing the outputs of text-to-image diffusion models. However, several challenges need to be addressed: 1) underspecification (the need to model the implicit meaning of instructions) 2) grounding (the need to localize where the edit has to be performed), 3) faithfulness (the need to preserve the elements of the image not affected by the edit instruction). Current approaches focusing on image editing with natural language instructions rely on automatically generated paired data, which, as shown in our investigation, is noisy and sometimes nonsensical, exacerbating the above issues. Building on recent advances in segmentation, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and visual question answering, we significantly improve the quality of the paired data. In addition, we enhance the supervision signal by highlighting parts of the image that need to be changed by the instruction. The model fine-tuned on the improved data is capable of performing fine-grained object-centric edits better than state-of-the-art baselines, mitigating the problems outlined above, as shown by automatic and human evaluations. Moreover, our model is capable of generalizing to domains unseen during training, such as visual metaphors.

- **Summary**: We propose a metadata-aware self-supervised learning~(SSL)~framework useful for fine-grained classification and ecological mapping of bird species around the world. Our framework unifies two SSL strategies: Contrastive Learning~(CL) and Masked Image Modeling~(MIM), while also enriching the embedding space with metadata available with ground-level imagery of birds. We separately train uni-modal and cross-modal ViT on a novel cross-view global bird species dataset containing ground-level imagery, metadata (location, time), and corresponding satellite imagery. We demonstrate that our models learn fine-grained and geographically conditioned features of birds, by evaluating on two downstream tasks: fine-grained visual classification~(FGVC) and cross-modal retrieval. Pre-trained models learned using our framework achieve SotA performance on FGVC of iNAT-2021 birds and in transfer learning settings for CUB-200-2011 and NABirds datasets. Moreover, the impressive cross-modal retrieval performance of our model enables the creation of species distribution maps across any geographic region. The dataset and source code will be released at https://github.com/mvrl/BirdSAT}.

- **Summary**: With rapid advances in generative artificial intelligence, the text-to-music synthesis task has emerged as a promising direction for music generation from scratch. However, finer-grained control over multi-track generation remains an open challenge. Existing models exhibit strong raw generation capability but lack the flexibility to compose separate tracks and combine them in a controllable manner, differing from typical workflows of human composers. To address this issue, we propose JEN-1 Composer, a unified framework to efficiently model marginal, conditional, and joint distributions over multi-track music via a single model. JEN-1 Composer framework exhibits the capacity to seamlessly incorporate any diffusion-based music generation system, \textit{e.g.} Jen-1, enhancing its capacity for versatile multi-track music generation. We introduce a curriculum training strategy aimed at incrementally instructing the model in the transition from single-track generation to the flexible generation of multi-track combinations. During the inference, users have the ability to iteratively produce and choose music tracks that meet their preferences, subsequently creating an entire musical composition incrementally following the proposed Human-AI co-composition workflow. Quantitative and qualitative assessments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in controllable and high-fidelity multi-track music synthesis. The proposed JEN-1 Composer represents a significant advance toward interactive AI-facilitated music creation and composition. Demos will be available at https://jenmusic.ai/audio-demos.

- **Summary**: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID) performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. Recently, projected gradient descent has been successfully used in robust fine-tuning by constraining the deviation from the initialization of the fine-tuned model explicitly through projection. However, algorithmically, two limitations prevent this method from being adopted more widely, scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new projection-based fine-tuning algorithm, Fast Trainable Projection (FTP) for computationally efficient learning of per-layer projection constraints, resulting in an average $35\%$ speedup on our benchmarks compared to prior works. FTP can be combined with existing optimizers such as AdamW, and be used in a plug-and-play fashion. Finally, we show that FTP is a special instance of hyper-optimizers that tune the hyper-parameters of optimizers in a learnable manner through nested differentiation. Empirically, we show superior robustness on OOD datasets, including domain shifts and natural corruptions, across four different vision tasks with five different pre-trained models. Additionally, we demonstrate that FTP is broadly applicable and beneficial to other learning scenarios such as low-label and continual learning settings thanks to its easy adaptability. The code will be available at https://github.com/GT-RIPL/FTP.git.

- **Summary**: We present 3DMiner -- a pipeline for mining 3D shapes from challenging large-scale unannotated image datasets. Unlike other unsupervised 3D reconstruction methods, we assume that, within a large-enough dataset, there must exist images of objects with similar shapes but varying backgrounds, textures, and viewpoints. Our approach leverages the recent advances in learning self-supervised image representations to cluster images with geometrically similar shapes and find common image correspondences between them. We then exploit these correspondences to obtain rough camera estimates as initialization for bundle-adjustment. Finally, for every image cluster, we apply a progressive bundle-adjusting reconstruction method to learn a neural occupancy field representing the underlying shape. We show that this procedure is robust to several types of errors introduced in previous steps (e.g., wrong camera poses, images containing dissimilar shapes, etc.), allowing us to obtain shape and pose annotations for images in-the-wild. When using images from Pix3D chairs, our method is capable of producing significantly better results than state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D reconstruction techniques, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, we show how 3DMiner can be applied to in-the-wild data by reconstructing shapes present in images from the LAION-5B dataset. Project Page: https://ttchengab.github.io/3dminerOfficial

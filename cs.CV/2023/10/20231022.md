- **Summary**: Desire is a set of human aspirations and wishes that comprise verbal and cognitive aspects that drive human feelings and behaviors, distinguishing humans from other animals. Understanding human desire has the potential to be one of the most fascinating and challenging research domains. It is tightly coupled with sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks. It is beneficial for increasing human-computer interactions, recognizing human emotional intelligence, understanding interpersonal relationships, and making decisions. However, understanding human desire is challenging and under-explored because ways of eliciting desire might be different among humans. The task gets more difficult due to the diverse cultures, countries, and languages. Prior studies overlooked the use of image-text pairwise feature representation, which is crucial for the task of human desire understanding. In this research, we have proposed a unified multimodal transformer-based framework with image-text pair settings to identify human desire, sentiment, and emotion. The core of our proposed method lies in the encoder module, which is built using two state-of-the-art multimodal transformer models. These models allow us to extract diverse features. To effectively extract visual and contextualized embedding features from social media image and text pairs, we conducted joint fine-tuning of two pre-trained multimodal transformer models: Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) and Vision-and-Augmented-Language Transformer (VAuLT). Subsequently, we use an early fusion strategy on these embedding features to obtain combined diverse feature representations of the image-text pair. This consolidation incorporates diverse information about this task, enabling us to robustly perceive the context and image pair from multiple perspectives.

- **Summary**: Multi-class cell nuclei detection is a fundamental prerequisite in the diagnosis of histopathology. It is critical to efficiently locate and identify cells with diverse morphology and distributions in digital pathological images. Most existing methods take complex intermediate representations as learning targets and rely on inflexible post-refinements while paying less attention to various cell density and fields of view. In this paper, we propose a novel Affine-Consistent Transformer (AC-Former), which directly yields a sequence of nucleus positions and is trained collaboratively through two sub-networks, a global and a local network. The local branch learns to infer distorted input images of smaller scales while the global network outputs the large-scale predictions as extra supervision signals. We further introduce an Adaptive Affine Transformer (AAT) module, which can automatically learn the key spatial transformations to warp original images for local network training. The AAT module works by learning to capture the transformed image regions that are more valuable for training the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on various benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL) has been used in the automatic diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) with brain imaging data. However, previous methods have not fully exploited the relation between brain image and clinical information that is widely adopted by experts in practice. To exploit the heterogeneous features from imaging and tabular data simultaneously, we propose the Visual-Attribute Prompt Learning-based Transformer (VAP-Former), a transformer-based network that efficiently extracts and fuses the multi-modal features with prompt fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a Prompt fine-Tuning (PT) scheme to transfer the knowledge from AD prediction task for progressive MCI (pMCI) diagnosis. In details, we first pre-train the VAP-Former without prompts on the AD diagnosis task and then fine-tune the model on the pMCI detection task with PT, which only needs to optimize a small amount of parameters while keeping the backbone frozen. Next, we propose a novel global prompt token for the visual prompts to provide global guidance to the multi-modal representations. Extensive experiments not only show the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods in pMCI prediction but also demonstrate that the global prompt can make the prompt learning process more effective and stable. Interestingly, the proposed prompt learning model even outperforms the fully fine-tuning baseline on transferring the knowledge from AD to pMCI.

- **Summary**: As short-form funny videos on social networks are gaining popularity, it becomes demanding for AI models to understand them for better communication with humans. Unfortunately, previous video humor datasets target specific domains, such as speeches or sitcoms, and mostly focus on verbal cues. We curate a user-generated dataset of 10K multimodal funny videos from YouTube, called ExFunTube. Using a video filtering pipeline with GPT-3.5, we verify both verbal and visual elements contributing to humor. After filtering, we annotate each video with timestamps and text explanations for funny moments. Our ExFunTube is unique over existing datasets in that our videos cover a wide range of domains with various types of humor that necessitate a multimodal understanding of the content. Also, we develop a zero-shot video-to-text prompting to maximize video humor understanding of large language models (LLMs). With three different evaluation methods using automatic scores, rationale quality experiments, and human evaluations, we show that our prompting significantly improves LLMs' ability for humor explanation.

- **Summary**: In recent years, end to end steering prediction for autonomous vehicles has become a major area of research. The primary method for achieving end to end steering was to use computer vision models on a live feed of video data. However, to further increase accuracy, many companies have added data from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and or radar sensors through sensor fusion. However, the addition of lasers and sensors comes at a high financial cost. In this paper, I address both of these issues by increasing the accuracy of the computer vision models without the increased cost of using LiDAR and or sensors. I achieved this by improving the accuracy of computer vision models by sensor fusing CAN bus data, a vehicle protocol, with video data. CAN bus data is a rich source of information about the vehicle's state, including its speed, steering angle, and acceleration. By fusing this data with video data, the accuracy of the computer vision model's predictions can be improved. When I trained the model without CAN bus data, I obtained an RMSE of 0.02492, while the model trained with the CAN bus data achieved an RMSE of 0.01970. This finding indicates that fusing CAN Bus data with video data can reduce the computer vision model's prediction error by 20% with some models decreasing the error by 80%.

- **Summary**: Automatic tissue segmentation of fetal brain images is essential for the quantitative analysis of prenatal neurodevelopment. However, producing voxel-level annotations of fetal brain imaging is time-consuming and expensive. To reduce labeling costs, we propose a practical unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting that adapts the segmentation labels of high-quality fetal brain atlases to unlabeled fetal brain MRI data from another domain. To address the task, we propose a new UDA framework based on Appearance and Structure Consistency, named ASC. We adapt the segmentation model to the appearances of different domains by constraining the consistency before and after a frequency-based image transformation, which is to swap the appearance between brain MRI data and atlases. Consider that even in the same domain, the fetal brain images of different gestational ages could have significant variations in the anatomical structures. To make the model adapt to the structural variations in the target domain, we further encourage prediction consistency under different structural perturbations. Extensive experiments on FeTA 2021 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our ASC in comparison to registration-based, semi-supervised learning-based, and existing UDA-based methods.

- **Summary**: Automatic nuclei detection and classification can produce effective information for disease diagnosis. Most existing methods classify nuclei independently or do not make full use of the semantic similarity between nuclei and their grouping features. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end nuclei detection and classification framework based on a grouping transformer-based classifier. The nuclei classifier learns and updates the representations of nuclei groups and categories via hierarchically grouping the nucleus embeddings. Then the cell types are predicted with the pairwise correlations between categorical embeddings and nucleus features. For the efficiency of the fully transformer-based framework, we take the nucleus group embeddings as the input prompts of backbone, which helps harvest grouping guided features by tuning only the prompts instead of the whole backbone. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing models on three datasets.

- **Summary**: $\textit{Implicit neural representations}$ (INRs) aim to learn a $\textit{continuous function}$ (i.e., a neural network) to represent an image, where the input and output of the function are pixel coordinates and RGB/Gray values, respectively. However, images tend to consist of many objects whose colors are not perfectly consistent, resulting in the challenge that image is actually a $\textit{discontinuous piecewise function}$ and cannot be well estimated by a continuous function. In this paper, we empirically investigate that if a neural network is enforced to fit a discontinuous piecewise function to reach a fixed small error, the time costs will increase exponentially with respect to the boundaries in the spatial domain of the target signal. We name this phenomenon the $\textit{exponential-increase}$ hypothesis. Under the $\textit{exponential-increase}$ hypothesis, learning INRs for images with many objects will converge very slowly. To address this issue, we first prove that partitioning a complex signal into several sub-regions and utilizing piecewise INRs to fit that signal can significantly speed up the convergence. Based on this fact, we introduce a simple partition mechanism to boost the performance of two INR methods for image reconstruction: one for learning INRs, and the other for learning-to-learn INRs. In both cases, we partition an image into different sub-regions and dedicate smaller networks for each part. In addition, we further propose two partition rules based on regular grids and semantic segmentation maps, respectively. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning methods in terms of learning INR for a single image (ordinary learning framework) and the learning-to-learn framework.

- **Summary**: Event cameras, or dynamic vision sensors, have recently achieved success from fundamental vision tasks to high-level vision researches. Due to its ability to asynchronously capture light intensity changes, event camera has an inherent advantage to capture moving objects in challenging scenarios including objects under low light, high dynamic range, or fast moving objects. Thus event camera are natural for visual object tracking. However, the current event-based trackers derived from RGB trackers simply modify the input images to event frames and still follow conventional tracking pipeline that mainly focus on object texture for target distinction. As a result, the trackers may not be robust dealing with challenging scenarios such as moving cameras and cluttered foreground. In this paper, we propose a distractor-aware event-based tracker that introduces transformer modules into Siamese network architecture (named DANet). Specifically, our model is mainly composed of a motion-aware network and a target-aware network, which simultaneously exploits both motion cues and object contours from event data, so as to discover motion objects and identify the target object by removing dynamic distractors. Our DANet can be trained in an end-to-end manner without any post-processing and can run at over 80 FPS on a single V100. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two large event tracking datasets to validate the proposed model. We demonstrate that our tracker has superior performance against the state-of-the-art trackers in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Nuclei segmentation is a fundamental but challenging task in the quantitative analysis of histopathology images. Although fully-supervised deep learning-based methods have made significant progress, a large number of labeled images are required to achieve great segmentation performance. Considering that manually labeling all nuclei instances for a dataset is inefficient, obtaining a large-scale human-annotated dataset is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, augmenting a dataset with only a few labeled images to improve the segmentation performance is of significant research and application value. In this paper, we introduce the first diffusion-based augmentation method for nuclei segmentation. The idea is to synthesize a large number of labeled images to facilitate training the segmentation model. To achieve this, we propose a two-step strategy. In the first step, we train an unconditional diffusion model to synthesize the Nuclei Structure that is defined as the representation of pixel-level semantic and distance transform. Each synthetic nuclei structure will serve as a constraint on histopathology image synthesis and is further post-processed to be an instance map. In the second step, we train a conditioned diffusion model to synthesize histopathology images based on nuclei structures. The synthetic histopathology images paired with synthetic instance maps will be added to the real dataset for training the segmentation model. The experimental results show that by augmenting 10% labeled real dataset with synthetic samples, one can achieve comparable segmentation results with the fully-supervised baseline.

- **Summary**: In the remote sensing field, Change Detection (CD) aims to identify and localize the changed regions from dual-phase images over the same places. Recently, it has achieved great progress with the advances of deep learning. However, current methods generally deliver incomplete CD regions and irregular CD boundaries due to the limited representation ability of the extracted visual features. To relieve these issues, in this work we propose a novel Transformer-based learning framework named TransY-Net for remote sensing image CD, which improves the feature extraction from a global view and combines multi-level visual features in a pyramid manner. More specifically, the proposed framework first utilizes the advantages of Transformers in long-range dependency modeling. It can help to learn more discriminative global-level features and obtain complete CD regions. Then, we introduce a novel pyramid structure to aggregate multi-level visual features from Transformers for feature enhancement. The pyramid structure grafted with a Progressive Attention Module (PAM) can improve the feature representation ability with additional inter-dependencies through spatial and channel attentions. Finally, to better train the whole framework, we utilize the deeply-supervised learning with multiple boundary-aware loss functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on four optical and two SAR image CD benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Tiny object detection has gained considerable attention in the research community owing to the frequent occurrence of tiny objects in numerous critical real-world scenarios. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used as the backbone for object detection architectures typically neglect Nyquist's sampling theorem during down-sampling operations, resulting in aliasing and degraded performance. This is likely to be a particular issue for tiny objects that occupy very few pixels and therefore have high spatial frequency features. This paper applied an existing approach WaveCNet for anti-aliasing to tiny object detection. WaveCNet addresses aliasing by replacing standard down-sampling processes in CNNs with Wavelet Pooling (WaveletPool) layers, effectively suppressing aliasing. We modify the original WaveCNet to apply WaveletPool in a consistent way in both pathways of the residual blocks in ResNets. Additionally, we also propose a bottom-heavy version of the backbone, which further improves the performance of tiny object detection while also reducing the required number of parameters by almost half. Experimental results on the TinyPerson, WiderFace, and DOTA datasets demonstrate the importance of anti-aliasing in tiny object detection and the effectiveness of the proposed method which achieves new state-of-the-art results on all three datasets. Codes and experiment results are released at https://github.com/freshn/Anti-aliasing-Tiny-Object-Detection.git.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel translation model, UniTranslator, for transforming representations between visually distinct domains under conditions of limited training data and significant visual differences. The main idea behind our approach is leveraging the domain-neutral capabilities of CLIP as a bridging mechanism, while utilizing a separate module to extract abstract, domain-agnostic semantics from the embeddings of both the source and target realms. Fusing these abstract semantics with target-specific semantics results in a transformed embedding within the CLIP space. To bridge the gap between the disparate worlds of CLIP and StyleGAN, we introduce a new non-linear mapper, the CLIP2P mapper. Utilizing CLIP embeddings, this module is tailored to approximate the latent distribution in the P space, effectively acting as a connector between these two spaces. The proposed UniTranslator is versatile and capable of performing various tasks, including style mixing, stylization, and translations, even in visually challenging scenarios across different visual domains. Notably, UniTranslator generates high-quality translations that showcase domain relevance, diversity, and improved image quality. UniTranslator surpasses the performance of existing general-purpose models and performs well against specialized models in representative tasks. The source code and trained models will be released to the public.

- **Summary**: Cell segmentation for multi-modal microscopy images remains a challenge due to the complex textures, patterns, and cell shapes in these images. To tackle the problem, we first develop an automatic cell classification pipeline to label the microscopy images based on their low-level image characteristics, and then train a classification model based on the category labels. Afterward, we train a separate segmentation model for each category using the images in the corresponding category. Besides, we further deploy two types of segmentation models to segment cells with roundish and irregular shapes respectively. Moreover, an efficient and powerful backbone model is utilized to enhance the efficiency of our segmentation model. Evaluated on the Tuning Set of NeurIPS 2022 Cell Segmentation Challenge, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8795 and the running time for all cases is within the time tolerance.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised image Anomaly Detection (UAD) aims to learn robust and discriminative representations of normal samples. While separate solutions per class endow expensive computation and limited generalizability, this paper focuses on building a unified framework for multiple classes. Under such a challenging setting, popular reconstruction-based networks with continuous latent representation assumption always suffer from the "identical shortcut" issue, where both normal and abnormal samples can be well recovered and difficult to distinguish. To address this pivotal issue, we propose a hierarchical vector quantized prototype-oriented Transformer under a probabilistic framework. First, instead of learning the continuous representations, we preserve the typical normal patterns as discrete iconic prototypes, and confirm the importance of Vector Quantization in preventing the model from falling into the shortcut. The vector quantized iconic prototype is integrated into the Transformer for reconstruction, such that the abnormal data point is flipped to a normal data point.Second, we investigate an exquisite hierarchical framework to relieve the codebook collapse issue and replenish frail normal patterns. Third, a prototype-oriented optimal transport method is proposed to better regulate the prototypes and hierarchically evaluate the abnormal score. By evaluating on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, our model surpasses the state-of-the-art alternatives and possesses good interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/RuiyingLu/HVQ-Trans.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has achieved widespread success in medical image analysis, leading to an increasing demand for large-scale expert-annotated medical image datasets. Yet, the high cost of annotating medical images severely hampers the development of deep learning in this field. To reduce annotation costs, active learning aims to select the most informative samples for annotation and train high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. In this survey, we review the core methods of active learning, including the evaluation of informativeness and sampling strategy. For the first time, we provide a detailed summary of the integration of active learning with other label-efficient techniques, such as semi-supervised, self-supervised learning, and so on. Additionally, we also highlight active learning works that are specifically tailored to medical image analysis. In the end, we offer our perspectives on the future trends and challenges of active learning and its applications in medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Recent works based on convolutional encoder-decoder architecture and 3DMM parameterization have shown great potential for canonical view reconstruction from a single input image. Conventional CNN architectures benefit from exploiting the spatial correspondence between the input and output pixels. However, in 3D face reconstruction, the spatial misalignment between the input image (e.g. face) and the canonical/UV output makes the feature encoding-decoding process quite challenging. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we propose a new network architecture, namely the Affine Convolution Networks, which enables CNN based approaches to handle spatially non-corresponding input and output images and maintain high-fidelity quality output at the same time. In our method, an affine transformation matrix is learned from the affine convolution layer for each spatial location of the feature maps. In addition, we represent 3D human heads in UV space with multiple components, including diffuse maps for texture representation, position maps for geometry representation, and light maps for recovering more complex lighting conditions in the real world. All the components can be trained without any manual annotations. Our method is parametric-free and can generate high-quality UV maps at resolution of 512 x 512 pixels, while previous approaches normally generate 256 x 256 pixels or smaller. Our code will be released once the paper got accepted.

- **Summary**: Visually impaired persons find it difficult to know about their surroundings while walking on a road. Walking sticks used by them can only give them information about the obstacles in the stick's proximity. Moreover, it is mostly effective in static or very slow-paced environments. Hence, this paper introduces a method to guide them in a busy street. To create such a system it is very important to know about the approaching object and its direction of approach. To achieve this objective we created a method in which the image frame received from the video is divided into three parts i.e. center, left, and right to know the direction of approach of the approaching object. Object detection is done using YOLOv3. Lucas Kanade's optical flow estimation method is used for the optical flow estimation and Depth-net is used for depth estimation. Using the depth information, object motion trajectory, and object category information, the model provides necessary information/warning to the person. This model has been tested in the real world to show its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Continual learning, also known as incremental learning or life-long learning, stands at the forefront of deep learning and AI systems. It breaks through the obstacle of one-way training on close sets and enables continuous adaptive learning on open-set conditions. In the recent decade, continual learning has been explored and applied in multiple fields especially in computer vision covering classification, detection and segmentation tasks. Continual semantic segmentation (CSS), of which the dense prediction peculiarity makes it a challenging, intricate and burgeoning task. In this paper, we present a review of CSS, committing to building a comprehensive survey on problem formulations, primary challenges, universal datasets, neoteric theories and multifarious applications. Concretely, we begin by elucidating the problem definitions and primary challenges. Based on an in-depth investigation of relevant approaches, we sort out and categorize current CSS models into two main branches including \textit{data-replay} and \textit{data-free} sets. In each branch, the corresponding approaches are similarity-based clustered and thoroughly analyzed, following qualitative comparison and quantitative reproductions on relevant datasets. Besides, we also introduce four CSS specialities with diverse application scenarios and development tendencies. Furthermore, we develop a benchmark for CSS encompassing representative references, evaluation results and reproductions, which is available at~\url{https://github.com/YBIO/SurveyCSS}. We hope this survey can serve as a reference-worthy and stimulating contribution to the advancement of the life-long learning field, while also providing valuable perspectives for related fields.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a fast and modular framework for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) based on the Markov descision process (MDP) tracking-by-detection paradigm. It is designed to allow its various functional components to be replaced by custom-designed alternatives to suit a given application. An interactive GUI with integrated object detection, segmentation, MOT and semi-automated labeling is also provided to help make it easier to get started with this framework. Though not breaking new ground in terms of performance, Deep MDP has a large code-base that should be useful for the community to try out new ideas or simply to have an easy-to-use and easy-to-adapt system for any MOT application.

- **Summary**: Since NASA put forward the concept of the digital twin in 2010, many industries have put forward the dynamic goal of digital development, and the transportation industry is also among them. With more and more companies laying out on this virgin land, the digital twin transportation industry has grown rapidly and gradually formed a complete scientific research system. However, under the largely mature framework, there are still many loophole problems that need to be solved. In the process of constructing a road network with point cloud information, we summarize several major features of the point cloud collected by laser scanners and analyze the potential problems of constructing the network, such as misjudging the feature points as ground points and grid voids. On this basis, we reviewed relevant literature and proposed targeted solutions, such as building a point cloud pyramid modeled after the image pyramid, expanding the virtual grid, etc., applying CSF for ground-point cloud extraction, and constructing a road network model using the PTD (progressive density-based filter) algorithm. For the problem of road sign detection, we optimize the remote sensing data in the ground point cloud by enhancing the information density using edge detection, improving the data quality by removing the low intensity points, and achieving 90% accuracy of road text recognition using PaddleOCR and Densenet. As for the real-time digital twin traffic, we design the P2PRN network using the backbone of MPR-GAN for 2D feature generation and SuperGlue for 2D feature matching, rendering the viewpoints according to the matching optimization points, completing the multimodal matching task after several iterations, and successfully calculating the road camera position with 10{\deg} and 15m accuracy.

- **Summary**: Proximal operators are ubiquitous in inverse problems, commonly appearing as part of algorithmic strategies to regularize problems that are otherwise ill-posed. Modern deep learning models have been brought to bear for these tasks too, as in the framework of plug-and-play or deep unrolling, where they loosely resemble proximal operators. Yet, something essential is lost in employing these purely data-driven approaches: there is no guarantee that a general deep network represents the proximal operator of any function, nor is there any characterization of the function for which the network might provide some approximate proximal. This not only makes guaranteeing convergence of iterative schemes challenging but, more fundamentally, complicates the analysis of what has been learned by these networks about their training data. Herein we provide a framework to develop learned proximal networks (LPN), prove that they provide exact proximal operators for a data-driven nonconvex regularizer, and show how a new training strategy, dubbed proximal matching, provably promotes the recovery of the log-prior of the true data distribution. Such LPN provide general, unsupervised, expressive proximal operators that can be used for general inverse problems with convergence guarantees. We illustrate our results in a series of cases of increasing complexity, demonstrating that these models not only result in state-of-the-art performance, but provide a window into the resulting priors learned from data.

- **Summary**: Lens flare is a common image artifact that can significantly degrade image quality and affect the performance of computer vision systems due to a strong light source pointing at the camera. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted domain of lens flare, encompassing its underlying physics, influencing factors, types, and characteristics. It delves into the complex optics of flare formation, arising from factors like internal reflection, scattering, diffraction, and dispersion within the camera lens system. The diverse categories of flare are explored, including scattering, reflective, glare, orb, and starburst types. Key properties such as shape, color, and localization are analyzed. The numerous factors impacting flare appearance are discussed, spanning light source attributes, lens features, camera settings, and scene content. The survey extensively covers the wide range of methods proposed for flare removal, including hardware optimization strategies, classical image processing techniques, and learning-based methods using deep learning. It not only describes pioneering flare datasets created for training and evaluation purposes but also how they were created. Commonly employed performance metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS are explored. Challenges posed by flare's complex and data-dependent characteristics are highlighted. The survey provides insights into best practices, limitations, and promising future directions for flare removal research. Reviewing the state-of-the-art enables an in-depth understanding of the inherent complexities of the flare phenomenon and the capabilities of existing solutions. This can inform and inspire new innovations for handling lens flare artifacts and improving visual quality across various applications.

- **Summary**: Computer vision often treats perception as objective, and this assumption gets reflected in the way that datasets are collected and models are trained. For instance, image descriptions in different languages are typically assumed to be translations of the same semantic content. However, work in cross-cultural psychology and linguistics has shown that individuals differ in their visual perception depending on their cultural background and the language they speak. In this paper, we demonstrate significant differences in semantic content across languages in both dataset and model-produced captions. When data is multilingual as opposed to monolingual, captions have higher semantic coverage on average, as measured by scene graph, embedding, and linguistic complexity. For example, multilingual captions have on average 21.8% more objects, 24.5% more relations, and 27.1% more attributes than a set of monolingual captions. Moreover, models trained on content from different languages perform best against test data from those languages, while those trained on multilingual content perform consistently well across all evaluation data compositions. Our research provides implications for how diverse modes of perception can improve image understanding.

- **Summary**: Generating accurate 3D reconstructions from endoscopic video is a promising avenue for longitudinal radiation-free analysis of sinus anatomy and surgical outcomes. Several methods for monocular reconstruction have been proposed, yielding visually pleasant 3D anatomical structures by retrieving relative camera poses with structure-from-motion-type algorithms and fusion of monocular depth estimates. However, due to the complex properties of the underlying algorithms and endoscopic scenes, the reconstruction pipeline may perform poorly or fail unexpectedly. Further, acquiring medical data conveys additional challenges, presenting difficulties in quantitatively benchmarking these models, understanding failure cases, and identifying critical components that contribute to their precision. In this work, we perform a quantitative analysis of a self-supervised approach for sinus reconstruction using endoscopic sequences paired with optical tracking and high-resolution computed tomography acquired from nine ex-vivo specimens. Our results show that the generated reconstructions are in high agreement with the anatomy, yielding an average point-to-mesh error of 0.91 mm between reconstructions and CT segmentations. However, in a point-to-point matching scenario, relevant for endoscope tracking and navigation, we found average target registration errors of 6.58 mm. We identified that pose and depth estimation inaccuracies contribute equally to this error and that locally consistent sequences with shorter trajectories generate more accurate reconstructions. These results suggest that achieving global consistency between relative camera poses and estimated depths with the anatomy is essential. In doing so, we can ensure proper synergy between all components of the pipeline for improved reconstructions that will facilitate clinical application of this innovative technology.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary learning has emerged as a cutting-edge research area, particularly in light of the widespread adoption of vision-based foundational models. Its primary objective is to comprehend novel concepts that are not encompassed within a predefined vocabulary. One key facet of this endeavor is Visual Grounding, which entails locating a specific region within an image based on a corresponding language description. While current foundational models excel at various visual language tasks, there's a noticeable absence of models specifically tailored for open-vocabulary visual grounding. This research endeavor introduces novel and challenging OV tasks, namely Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding and Open-Vocabulary Phrase Localization. The overarching aim is to establish connections between language descriptions and the localization of novel objects. To facilitate this, we have curated a comprehensive annotated benchmark, encompassing 7,272 OV-VG images and 1,000 OV-PL images. In our pursuit of addressing these challenges, we delved into various baseline methodologies rooted in existing open-vocabulary object detection, VG, and phrase localization frameworks. Surprisingly, we discovered that state-of-the-art methods often falter in diverse scenarios. Consequently, we developed a novel framework that integrates two critical components: Text-Image Query Selection and Language-Guided Feature Attention. These modules are designed to bolster the recognition of novel categories and enhance the alignment between visual and linguistic information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, which consistently attains SOTA performance across the OV-VG task. Additionally, ablation studies provide further evidence of the effectiveness of our innovative models. Codes and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cv516Buaa/OV-VG.

- **Summary**: We introduce GROOT, an imitation learning method for learning robust policies with object-centric and 3D priors. GROOT builds policies that generalize beyond their initial training conditions for vision-based manipulation. It constructs object-centric 3D representations that are robust toward background changes and camera views and reason over these representations using a transformer-based policy. Furthermore, we introduce a segmentation correspondence model that allows policies to generalize to new objects at test time. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the robustness of GROOT policies against perceptual variations in simulated and real-world environments. GROOT's performance excels in generalization over background changes, camera viewpoint shifts, and the presence of new object instances, whereas both state-of-the-art end-to-end learning methods and object proposal-based approaches fall short. We also extensively evaluate GROOT policies on real robots, where we demonstrate the efficacy under very wild changes in setup. More videos and model details can be found in the appendix and the project website: https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/GROOT .

- **Summary**: The ubiquitous availability of smartphones and smartwatches with integrated inertial measurement units (IMUs) enables straightforward capturing of human activities. For specific applications of sensor based human activity recognition (HAR), however, logistical challenges and burgeoning costs render especially the ground truth annotation of such data a difficult endeavor, resulting in limited scale and diversity of datasets. Transfer learning, i.e., leveraging publicly available labeled datasets to first learn useful representations that can then be fine-tuned using limited amounts of labeled data from a target domain, can alleviate some of the performance issues of contemporary HAR systems. Yet they can fail when the differences between source and target conditions are too large and/ or only few samples from a target application domain are available, each of which are typical challenges in real-world human activity recognition scenarios. In this paper, we present an approach for economic use of publicly available labeled HAR datasets for effective transfer learning. We introduce a novel transfer learning framework, Cross-Domain HAR, which follows the teacher-student self-training paradigm to more effectively recognize activities with very limited label information. It bridges conceptual gaps between source and target domains, including sensor locations and type of activities. Through our extensive experimental evaluation on a range of benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for practically relevant few shot activity recognition scenarios. We also present a detailed analysis into how the individual components of our framework affect downstream performance.

- **Summary**: In this technical report, we present a reproduction of MaskGIT: Masked Generative Image Transformer, using PyTorch. The approach involves leveraging a masked bidirectional transformer architecture, enabling image generation with only few steps (8~16 steps) for 512 x 512 resolution images, i.e., ~64x faster than an auto-regressive approach. Through rigorous experimentation and optimization, we achieved results that closely align with the findings presented in the original paper. We match the reported FID of 7.32 with our replication and obtain 7.59 with similar hyperparameters on ImageNet at resolution 512 x 512. Moreover, we improve over the official implementation with some minor hyperparameter tweaking, achieving FID of 7.26. At the lower resolution of 256 x 256 pixels, our reimplementation scores 6.80, in comparison to the original paper's 6.18. To promote further research on Masked Generative Models and facilitate their reproducibility, we released our code and pre-trained weights openly at https://github.com/valeoai/MaskGIT-pytorch/

- **Summary**: The Transformer architecture has gained significant popularity in computer vision tasks due to its capacity to generalize and capture long-range dependencies. This characteristic makes it well-suited for generating spatiotemporal tokens from videos. On the other hand, convolutions serve as the fundamental backbone for processing images and videos, as they efficiently aggregate information within small local neighborhoods to create spatial tokens that describe the spatial dimension of a video. While both CNN-based architectures and pure transformer architectures are extensively studied and utilized by researchers, the effective combination of these two backbones has not received comparable attention in the field of activity recognition. In this research, we propose a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both CNNs and Transformers in an hybrid architecture for performing activity recognition using RGB videos. Specifically, we suggest employing a CNN network to enhance the video representation by generating a 128-channel video that effectively separates the human performing the activity from the background. Subsequently, the output of the CNN module is fed into a transformer to extract spatiotemporal tokens, which are then used for classification purposes. Our architecture has achieved new SOTA results with 90.05 \%, 99.6\%, and 95.09\% on HMDB51, UCF101, and ETRI-Activity3D respectively.

- **Summary**: Metric depth estimation plays an important role in mobile augmented reality (AR). With accurate metric depth, we can achieve more realistic user interactions such as object placement and occlusion detection. While specialized hardware like LiDAR demonstrates its promise, its restricted availability, i.e., only on selected high-end mobile devices, and performance limitations such as range and sensitivity to the environment, make it less ideal. Monocular depth estimation, on the other hand, relies solely on mobile cameras, which are ubiquitous, making it a promising alternative for mobile AR.   In this paper, we investigate the challenges and opportunities of achieving accurate metric depth estimation in mobile AR. We tested four different state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models on a newly introduced dataset (ARKitScenes) and identified three types of challenges: hard-ware, data, and model related challenges. Furthermore, our research provides promising future directions to explore and solve those challenges. These directions include (i) using more hardware-related information from the mobile device's camera and other available sensors, (ii) capturing high-quality data to reflect real-world AR scenarios, and (iii) designing a model architecture to utilize the new information.

- **Summary**: CNN-based object detection methods have achieved significant progress in recent years. The classic structures of CNNs produce pyramid-like feature maps due to the pooling or other re-scale operations. The feature maps in different levels of the feature pyramid are used to detect objects with different scales. For more accurate object detection, the highest-level feature, which has the lowest resolution and contains the strongest semantics, is up-scaled and connected with the lower-level features to enhance the semantics in the lower-level features. However, the classic mode of feature connection combines the feature of lower-level with all the features above it, which may result in semantics degradation. In this paper, we propose a skipped connection to obtain stronger semantics at each level of the feature pyramid. In our method, the lower-level feature only connects with the feature at the highest level, making it more reasonable that each level is responsible for detecting objects with fixed scales. In addition, we simplify the generation of anchor for bounding box regression, which can further improve the accuracy of object detection. The experiments on the MS COCO and Wider Face demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

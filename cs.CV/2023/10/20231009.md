- **Summary**: A neural network trained on a classification dataset often exhibits a higher vector norm of hidden layer features for in-distribution (ID) samples, while producing relatively lower norm values on unseen instances from out-of-distribution (OOD). Despite this intriguing phenomenon being utilized in many applications, the underlying cause has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we demystify this very phenomenon by scrutinizing the discriminative structures concealed in the intermediate layers of a neural network. Our analysis leads to the following discoveries: (1) The feature norm is a confidence value of a classifier hidden in the network layer, specifically its maximum logit. Hence, the feature norm distinguishes OOD from ID in the same manner that a classifier confidence does. (2) The feature norm is class-agnostic, thus it can detect OOD samples across diverse discriminative models. (3) The conventional feature norm fails to capture the deactivation tendency of hidden layer neurons, which may lead to misidentification of ID samples as OOD instances. To resolve this drawback, we propose a novel negative-aware norm (NAN) that can capture both the activation and deactivation tendencies of hidden layer neurons. We conduct extensive experiments on NAN, demonstrating its efficacy and compatibility with existing OOD detectors, as well as its capability in label-free environments.

- **Summary**: Real-time pavement condition monitoring provides highway agencies with timely and accurate information that could form the basis of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation policies. Existing technologies rely heavily on manual data processing, are expensive and therefore, difficult to scale for frequent, networklevel pavement condition monitoring. Additionally, these systems require sending large packets of data to the cloud which requires large storage space, are computationally expensive to process, and results in high latency. The current study proposes a solution that capitalizes on the widespread availability of affordable Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) sensors, edge computing and internet connection capabilities of microcontrollers, and deployable machine learning (ML) models to (a) design an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled device that can be mounted on axles of vehicles to stream live pavement condition data (b) reduce latency through on-device processing and analytics of pavement condition sensor data before sending to the cloud servers. In this study, three ML models including Random Forest, LightGBM and XGBoost were trained to predict International Roughness Index (IRI) at every 0.1-mile segment. XGBoost had the highest accuracy with an RMSE and MAPE of 16.89in/mi and 20.3%, respectively. In terms of the ability to classify the IRI of pavement segments based on ride quality according to MAP-21 criteria, our proposed device achieved an average accuracy of 96.76% on I-70EB and 63.15% on South Providence. Overall, our proposed device demonstrates significant potential in providing real-time pavement condition data to State Highway Agencies (SHA) and Department of Transportation (DOTs) with a satisfactory level of accuracy.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection is to determine whether there are any abnormal events, behaviors or objects in a given video, which enables effective and intelligent public safety management. As video anomaly labeling is both time-consuming and expensive, most existing works employ unsupervised or weakly supervised learning methods. This paper focuses on weakly supervised video anomaly detection, in which the training videos are labeled whether or not they contain any anomalies, but there is no information about which frames the anomalies are located. However, the uncertainty of weakly labeled data and the large model size prevent existing methods from wide deployment in real scenarios, especially the resource-limit situations such as edge-computing. In this paper, we develop a lightweight video anomaly detection model. On the one hand, we propose an adaptive instance selection strategy, which is based on the model's current status to select confident instances, thereby mitigating the uncertainty of weakly labeled data and subsequently promoting the model's performance. On the other hand, we design a lightweight multi-level temporal correlation attention module and an hourglass-shaped fully connected layer to construct the model, which can reduce the model parameters to only 0.56\% of the existing methods (e.g. RTFM). Our extensive experiments on two public datasets UCF-Crime and ShanghaiTech show that our model can achieve comparable or even superior AUC score compared to the state-of-the-art methods, with a significantly reduced number of model parameters.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a regularization method called GReAT, Graph Regularized Adversarial Training, to improve deep learning models' classification performance. Adversarial examples are a well-known challenge in machine learning, where small, purposeful perturbations to input data can mislead models. Adversarial training, a powerful and one of the most effective defense strategies, involves training models with both regular and adversarial examples. However, it often neglects the underlying structure of the data. In response, we propose GReAT, a method that leverages data graph structure to enhance model robustness. GReAT deploys the graph structure of the data into the adversarial training process, resulting in more robust models that better generalize its testing performance and defend against adversarial attacks. Through extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate GReAT's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art classification methods, highlighting its potential in improving deep learning models' classification performance.

- **Summary**: The success of modern neural networks has prompted study of the connection between memorisation and generalisation: overparameterised models generalise well, despite being able to perfectly fit (memorise) completely random labels. To carefully study this issue, Feldman proposed a metric to quantify the degree of memorisation of individual training examples, and empirically computed the corresponding memorisation profile of a ResNet on image classification bench-marks. While an exciting first glimpse into what real-world models memorise, this leaves open a fundamental question: do larger neural models memorise more? We present a comprehensive empirical analysis of this question on image classification benchmarks. We find that training examples exhibit an unexpectedly diverse set of memorisation trajectories across model sizes: most samples experience decreased memorisation under larger models, while the rest exhibit cap-shaped or increasing memorisation. We show that various proxies for the Feldman memorization score fail to capture these fundamental trends. Lastly, we find that knowledge distillation, an effective and popular model compression technique, tends to inhibit memorisation, while also improving generalisation. Specifically, memorisation is mostly inhibited on examples with increasing memorisation trajectories, thus pointing at how distillation improves generalisation.

- **Summary**: Object hallucination poses a significant challenge in vision-language (VL) models, often leading to the generation of nonsensical or unfaithful responses with non-existent objects. However, the absence of a general measurement for evaluating object hallucination in VL models has hindered our understanding and ability to mitigate this issue. In this work, we present NOPE (Negative Object Presence Evaluation), a novel benchmark designed to assess object hallucination in VL models through visual question answering (VQA). We propose a cost-effective and scalable approach utilizing large language models to generate 29.5k synthetic negative pronoun (NegP) data of high quality for NOPE. We extensively investigate the performance of 10 state-of-the-art VL models in discerning the non-existence of objects in visual questions, where the ground truth answers are denoted as NegP (e.g., "none"). Additionally, we evaluate their standard performance on visual questions on 9 other VQA datasets. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that no VL model is immune to the vulnerability of object hallucination, as all models achieve accuracy below 10\% on NegP. Furthermore, we uncover that lexically diverse visual questions, question types with large scopes, and scene-relevant objects capitalize the risk of object hallucination in VL models.



### A Critical Look at Classic Test-Time Adaptation Methods in Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a model, initially trained on training data, to potential distribution shifts in the test data. Most existing TTA studies, however, focus on classification tasks, leaving a notable gap in the exploration of TTA for semantic segmentation. This pronounced emphasis on classification might lead numerous newcomers and engineers to mistakenly assume that classic TTA methods designed for classification can be directly applied to segmentation. Nonetheless, this assumption remains unverified, posing an open question. To address this, we conduct a systematic, empirical study to disclose the unique challenges of segmentation TTA, and to determine whether classic TTA strategies can effectively address this task. Our comprehensive results have led to three key observations. First, the classic batch norm updating strategy, commonly used in classification TTA, only brings slight performance improvement, and in some cases it might even adversely affect the results. Even with the application of advanced distribution estimation techniques like batch renormalization, the problem remains unresolved. Second, the teacher-student scheme does enhance training stability for segmentation TTA in the presence of noisy pseudo-labels. However, it cannot directly result in performance improvement compared to the original model without TTA. Third, segmentation TTA suffers a severe long-tailed imbalance problem, which is substantially more complex than that in TTA for classification. This long-tailed challenge significantly affects segmentation TTA performance, even when the accuracy of pseudo-labels is high. In light of these observations, we conclude that TTA for segmentation presents significant challenges, and simply using classic TTA methods cannot address this problem well.



### Anyview: Generalizable Indoor 3D Object Detection with Variable Frames

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel network framework for indoor 3D object detection to handle variable input frame numbers in practical scenarios. Existing methods only consider fixed frames of input data for a single detector, such as monocular RGB-D images or point clouds reconstructed from dense multi-view RGB-D images. While in practical application scenes such as robot navigation and manipulation, the raw input to the 3D detectors is the RGB-D images with variable frame numbers instead of the reconstructed scene point cloud. However, the previous approaches can only handle fixed frame input data and have poor performance with variable frame input. In order to facilitate 3D object detection methods suitable for practical tasks, we present a novel 3D detection framework named AnyView for our practical applications, which generalizes well across different numbers of input frames with a single model. To be specific, we propose a geometric learner to mine the local geometric features of each input RGB-D image frame and implement local-global feature interaction through a designed spatial mixture module. Meanwhile, we further utilize a dynamic token strategy to adaptively adjust the number of extracted features for each frame, which ensures consistent global feature density and further enhances the generalization after fusion. Extensive experiments on the ScanNet dataset show our method achieves both great generalizability and high detection accuracy with a simple and clean architecture containing a similar amount of parameters with the baselines.

- **Summary**: Infrared small target detection plays an important role in the remote sensing fields. Therefore, many detection algorithms have been proposed, in which the infrared patch-tensor (IPT) model has become a mainstream tool due to its excellent performance. However, most IPT-based methods face great challenges, such as inaccurate measure of the tensor low-rankness and poor robustness to complex scenes, which will leadto poor detection performance. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel double-weighted multi-granularity infrared patch tensor (DWMGIPT) model. First, to capture different granularity information of tensor from multiple modes, a multi-granularity infrared patch tensor (MGIPT) model is constructed by collecting nonoverlapping patches and tensor augmentation based on the tensor train (TT) decomposition. Second, to explore the latent structure of tensor more efficiently, we utilize the auto-weighted mechanism to balance the importance of information at different granularity. Then, the steering kernel (SK) is employed to extract local structure prior, which suppresses background interference such as strong edges and noise. Finally, an efficient optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is presented to solve the model. Extensive experiments in various challenging scenes show that the proposed algorithm is robust to noise and different scenes. Compared with the other eight state-of-the-art methods, different evaluation metrics demonstrate that our method achieves better detection performance in various complex scenes.

- **Summary**: Neural collapse provides an elegant mathematical characterization of learned last layer representations (a.k.a. features) and classifier weights in deep classification models. Such results not only provide insights but also motivate new techniques for improving practical deep models. However, most of the existing empirical and theoretical studies in neural collapse focus on the case that the number of classes is small relative to the dimension of the feature space. This paper extends neural collapse to cases where the number of classes are much larger than the dimension of feature space, which broadly occur for language models, retrieval systems, and face recognition applications. We show that the features and classifier exhibit a generalized neural collapse phenomenon, where the minimum one-vs-rest margins is maximized.We provide empirical study to verify the occurrence of generalized neural collapse in practical deep neural networks. Moreover, we provide theoretical study to show that the generalized neural collapse provably occurs under unconstrained feature model with spherical constraint, under certain technical conditions on feature dimension and number of classes.

- **Summary**: In clinical scenarios, multiple medical images with different views are usually generated simultaneously, and these images have high semantic consistency. However, most existing medical report generation methods only consider single-view data. The rich multi-view mutual information of medical images can help generate more accurate reports, however, the dependence of multi-view models on multi-view data in the inference stage severely limits their application in clinical practice. In addition, word-level optimization based on numbers ignores the semantics of reports and medical images, and the generated reports often cannot achieve good performance. Therefore, we propose a cross-modal consistent multi-view medical report generation with a domain transfer network (C^2M-DoT). Specifically, (i) a semantic-based multi-view contrastive learning medical report generation framework is adopted to utilize cross-view information to learn the semantic representation of lesions; (ii) a domain transfer network is further proposed to ensure that the multi-view report generation model can still achieve good inference performance under single-view input; (iii) meanwhile, optimization using a cross-modal consistency loss facilitates the generation of textual reports that are semantically consistent with medical images. Extensive experimental studies on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that C^2M-DoT substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in all metrics. Ablation studies also confirmed the validity and necessity of each component in C^2M-DoT.

- **Summary**: Research on monocular 3D object detection is being actively studied, and as a result, performance has been steadily improving. However, 3D object detection performance is significantly reduced when applied to a camera system different from the system used to capture the training datasets. For example, a 3D detector trained on datasets from a passenger car mostly fails to regress accurate 3D bounding boxes for a camera mounted on a bus. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the factors that cause performance degradation. We find that changing the camera pose, especially camera orientation, relative to the road plane caused performance degradation. In addition, we propose a generalized 3D object detection method that can be universally applied to various camera systems. We newly design a compensation module that corrects the estimated 3D bounding box location and heading direction. The proposed module can be applied to most of the recent 3D object detection networks. It increases AP3D score (KITTI moderate, IoU $> 70\%$) about 6-to-10-times above the baselines without additional training. Both quantitative and qualitative results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Analyzing and forecasting trajectories of agents like pedestrians and cars in complex scenes has become more and more significant in many intelligent systems and applications. The diversity and uncertainty in socially interactive behaviors among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than other deterministic computer vision tasks. Researchers have made a lot of efforts to quantify the effects of these interactions on future trajectories through different mathematical models and network structures, but this problem has not been well solved. Inspired by marine animals that localize the positions of their companions underwater through echoes, we build a new anglebased trainable social representation, named SocialCircle, for continuously reflecting the context of social interactions at different angular orientations relative to the target agent. We validate the effect of the proposed SocialCircle by training it along with several newly released trajectory prediction models, and experiments show that the SocialCircle not only quantitatively improves the prediction performance, but also qualitatively helps better consider social interactions when forecasting pedestrian trajectories in a way that is consistent with human intuitions.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a severe disease among men globally. It is important to identify PCa early and make a precise diagnosis for effective treatment. For PCa diagnosis, Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) emerged as an invaluable imaging modality that offers a precise anatomical view of the prostate gland and its tissue structure. Deep learning (DL) models can enhance existing clinical systems and improve patient care by locating regions of interest for physicians. Recently, DL techniques have been employed to develop a pipeline for segmenting and classifying different cancer types. These studies show that DL can be used to increase diagnostic precision and give objective results without variability. This work uses well-known DL models for the classification and segmentation of mpMRI images to detect PCa. Our implementation involves four pipelines; Semantic DeepSegNet with ResNet50, DeepSegNet with recurrent neural network (RNN), U-Net with RNN, and U-Net with a long short-term memory (LSTM). Each segmentation model is paired with a different classifier to evaluate the performance using different metrics. The results of our experiments show that the pipeline that uses the combination of U-Net and the LSTM model outperforms all other combinations, excelling in both segmentation and classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-3D generation have been remarkable, with methods such as DreamFusion leveraging large-scale text-to-image diffusion-based models to supervise 3D generation. These methods, including the variational score distillation proposed by ProlificDreamer, enable the synthesis of detailed and photorealistic textured meshes. However, the appearance of 3D objects generated by these methods is often random and uncontrollable, posing a challenge in achieving appearance-controllable 3D objects. To address this challenge, we introduce IPDreamer, a novel approach that incorporates image prompts to provide specific and comprehensive appearance information for 3D object generation. Our results demonstrate that IPDreamer effectively generates high-quality 3D objects that are consistent with both the provided text and image prompts, demonstrating its promising capability in appearance-controllable 3D object generation.

- **Summary**: Blurry video frame interpolation (BVFI) aims to generate high-frame-rate clear videos from low-frame-rate blurry videos, is a challenging but important topic in the computer vision community. Blurry videos not only provide spatial and temporal information like clear videos, but also contain additional motion information hidden in each blurry frame. However, existing BVFI methods usually fail to fully leverage all valuable information, which ultimately hinders their performance. In this paper, we propose a simple end-to-end three-stage framework to fully explore useful information from blurry videos. The frame interpolation stage designs a temporal deformable network to directly sample useful information from blurry inputs and synthesize an intermediate frame at an arbitrary time interval. The temporal feature fusion stage explores the long-term temporal information for each target frame through a bi-directional recurrent deformable alignment network. And the deblurring stage applies a transformer-empowered Taylor approximation network to recursively recover the high-frequency details. The proposed three-stage framework has clear task assignment for each module and offers good expandability, the effectiveness of which are demonstrated by various experimental results. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks, including the Adobe240 dataset, GoPro dataset, YouTube240 dataset and Sony dataset. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that our model outperforms existing SOTA methods. Besides, experiments on real-world blurry videos also indicate the good generalization ability of our model.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have significantly advanced the generation of highly realistic and expressive 3D scenes. However, the task of editing NeRF, particularly in terms of geometry modification, poses a significant challenge. This issue has obstructed NeRF's wider adoption across various applications. To tackle the problem of efficiently editing neural implicit fields, we introduce Neural Impostor, a hybrid representation incorporating an explicit tetrahedral mesh alongside a multigrid implicit field designated for each tetrahedron within the explicit mesh. Our framework bridges the explicit shape manipulation and the geometric editing of implicit fields by utilizing multigrid barycentric coordinate encoding, thus offering a pragmatic solution to deform, composite, and generate neural implicit fields while maintaining a complex volumetric appearance.

- **Summary**: Although single object trackers have achieved advanced performance, their large-scale network models make it difficult to apply them on the platforms with limited resources. Moreover, existing lightweight trackers only achieve balance between 2-3 points in terms of parameters, performance, Flops and FPS. To achieve the balance among all 4 points, this paper propose a lightweight full-convolutional Siamese tracker called lightFC. LightFC employs a noval efficient cross-correlation module (ECM) and a noval efficient rep-center head (ERH) to enhance the nonlinear expressiveness of the convoluational tracking pipeline. The ECM adopts an architecture of attention-like module and fuses local spatial and channel features from the pixel-wise correlation fusion features and enhance model nonlinearity with an inversion activation block. Additionally, skip-connections and the reuse of search area features are introduced by the ECM to improve its performance. The ERH reasonably introduces reparameterization technology and channel attention to enhance the nonlinear expressiveness of the center head. Comprehensive experiments show that LightFC achieves a good balance between performance, parameters, Flops and FPS. The precision score of LightFC outperforms MixFormerV2-S by 3.7 \% and 6.5 \% on LaSOT and TNL2K, respectively, while using 5x fewer parameters and 4.6x fewer Flops. Besides, LightFC runs 2x faster than MixFormerV2-S on CPUs. Our code and raw results can be found at https://github.com/LiYunfengLYF/LightFC

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) has consistently demonstrated promising performance in the realm of visual recognition. However, adapting large pre-trained models to various tasks poses a significant challenge. This challenge arises from the need for each model to undergo an independent and comprehensive fine-tuning process, leading to substantial computational and memory demands. While recent advancements in Parameter-efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) have demonstrated their ability to achieve superior performance compared to full fine-tuning with a smaller subset of parameter updates, they tend to overlook dense prediction tasks such as object detection and segmentation. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Side-Tuning (HST), a novel PETL approach that enables ViT transfer to various downstream tasks effectively. Diverging from existing methods that exclusively fine-tune parameters within input spaces or certain modules connected to the backbone, we tune a lightweight and hierarchical side network (HSN) that leverages intermediate activations extracted from the backbone and generates multi-scale features to make predictions. To validate HST, we conducted extensive experiments encompassing diverse visual tasks, including classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art average Top-1 accuracy of 76.0% on VTAB-1k, all while fine-tuning a mere 0.78M parameters. When applied to object detection tasks on COCO testdev benchmark, HST even surpasses full fine-tuning and obtains better performance with 49.7 box AP and 43.2 mask AP using Cascade Mask R-CNN.

- **Summary**: Histopathology image analysis plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis. However, training a clinically applicable segmentation algorithm requires pathologists to engage in labour-intensive labelling. In contrast, weakly supervised learning methods, which only require coarse-grained labels at the image level, can significantly reduce the labeling efforts. Unfortunately, while these methods perform reasonably well in slide-level prediction, their ability to locate cancerous regions, which is essential for many clinical applications, remains unsatisfactory. Previously, we proposed CAMEL, which achieves comparable results to those of fully supervised baselines in pixel-level segmentation. However, CAMEL requires 1,280x1,280 image-level binary annotations for positive WSIs. Here, we present CAMEL2, by introducing a threshold of the cancerous ratio for positive bags, it allows us to better utilize the information, consequently enabling us to scale up the image-level setting from 1,280x1,280 to 5,120x5,120 while maintaining the accuracy. Our results with various datasets, demonstrate that CAMEL2, with the help of 5,120x5,120 image-level binary annotations, which are easy to annotate, achieves comparable performance to that of a fully supervised baseline in both instance- and slide-level classifications.

- **Summary**: Vector-quantized image modeling has shown great potential in synthesizing high-quality images. However, generating high-resolution images remains a challenging task due to the quadratic computational overhead of the self-attention process. In this study, we seek to explore a more efficient two-stage framework for high-resolution image generation with improvements in the following three aspects. (1) Based on the observation that the first quantization stage has solid local property, we employ a local attention-based quantization model instead of the global attention mechanism used in previous methods, leading to better efficiency and reconstruction quality. (2) We emphasize the importance of multi-grained feature interaction during image generation and introduce an efficient attention mechanism that combines global attention (long-range semantic consistency within the whole image) and local attention (fined-grained details). This approach results in faster generation speed, higher generation fidelity, and improved resolution. (3) We propose a new generation pipeline incorporating autoencoding training and autoregressive generation strategy, demonstrating a better paradigm for image synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in high-quality and high-resolution image reconstruction and generation.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes GradientSurf, a novel algorithm for real time surface reconstruction from monocular RGB video. Inspired by Poisson Surface Reconstruction, the proposed method builds on the tight coupling between surface, volume, and oriented point cloud and solves the reconstruction problem in gradient-domain. Unlike Poisson Surface Reconstruction which finds an offline solution to the Poisson equation by solving a linear system after the scanning process is finished, our method finds online solutions from partial scans with a neural network incrementally where the Poisson layer is designed to supervise both local and global reconstruction. The main challenge that existing methods suffer from when reconstructing from RGB signal is a lack of details in the reconstructed surface. We hypothesize this is due to the spectral bias of neural networks towards learning low frequency geometric features. To address this issue, the reconstruction problem is cast onto gradient domain, where zeroth-order and first-order energies are minimized. The zeroth-order term penalizes location of the surface. The first-order term penalizes the difference between the gradient of reconstructed implicit function and the vector field formulated from oriented point clouds sampled at adaptive local densities. For the task of indoor scene reconstruction, visual and quantitative experimental results show that the proposed method reconstructs surfaces with more details in curved regions and higher fidelity for small objects than previous methods.

- **Summary**: In the wheat nutrient deficiencies classification challenge, we present the DividE and EnseMble (DEEM) method for progressive test data predictions. We find that (1) test images are provided in the challenge; (2) samples are equipped with their collection dates; (3) the samples of different dates show notable discrepancies. Based on the findings, we partition the dataset into discrete groups by the dates and train models on each divided group. We then adopt the pseudo-labeling approach to label the test data and incorporate those with high confidence into the training set. In pseudo-labeling, we leverage models ensemble with different architectures to enhance the reliability of predictions. The pseudo-labeling and ensembled model training are iteratively conducted until all test samples are labeled. Finally, the separated models for each group are unified to obtain the model for the whole dataset. Our method achieves an average of 93.6\% Top-1 test accuracy~(94.0\% on WW2020 and 93.2\% on WR2021) and wins the 1$st$ place in the Deep Nutrient Deficiency Challenge~\footnote{https://cvppa2023.github.io/challenges/}.

- **Summary**: Cardiac function assessment aims at predicting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) given an echocardiogram video, which requests models to focus on the changes in the left ventricle during the cardiac cycle. How to assess cardiac function accurately and automatically from an echocardiogram video is a valuable topic in intelligent assisted healthcare. Existing video-based methods do not pay much attention to the left ventricular region, nor the left ventricular changes caused by motion. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised auxiliary learning paradigm with a left ventricular segmentation task, which contributes to the representation learning for the left ventricular region. To better model the importance of motion information, we introduce a temporal channel-wise attention (TCA) module to excite those channels used to describe motion. Furthermore, we reform the TCA module with semantic perception by taking the segmentation map of the left ventricle as input to focus on the motion patterns of the left ventricle. Finally, to reduce the difficulty of direct LVEF regression, we utilize an anchor-based classification and regression method to predict LVEF. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford dataset with an improvement of 0.22 MAE, 0.26 RMSE, and 1.9% $R^2$.

- **Summary**: Cerebral X-ray digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the standard imaging technique for visualizing blood flow and guiding endovascular treatments. The quality of DSA is often negatively impacted by body motion during acquisition, leading to decreased diagnostic value. Time-consuming iterative methods address motion correction based on non-rigid registration, and employ sparse key points and non-rigidity penalties to limit vessel distortion. Recent methods alleviate subtraction artifacts by predicting the subtracted frame from the corresponding unsubtracted frame, but do not explicitly compensate for motion-induced misalignment between frames. This hinders the serial evaluation of blood flow, and often causes undesired vasculature and contrast flow alterations, leading to impeded usability in clinical practice. To address these limitations, we present AngioMoCo, a learning-based framework that generates motion-compensated DSA sequences from X-ray angiography. AngioMoCo integrates contrast extraction and motion correction, enabling differentiation between patient motion and intensity changes caused by contrast flow. This strategy improves registration quality while being substantially faster than iterative elastix-based methods. We demonstrate AngioMoCo on a large national multi-center dataset (MR CLEAN Registry) of clinically acquired angiographic images through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses. AngioMoCo produces high-quality motion-compensated DSA, removing motion artifacts while preserving contrast flow. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/RuishengSu/AngioMoCo.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized medical imaging analysis, showcasing superior efficacy compared to conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in vital tasks such as polyp classification, detection, and segmentation. Leveraging attention mechanisms to focus on specific image regions, ViTs exhibit contextual awareness in processing visual data, culminating in robust and precise predictions, even for intricate medical images. Moreover, the inherent self-attention mechanism in Transformers accommodates varying input sizes and resolutions, granting an unprecedented flexibility absent in traditional CNNs. However, Transformers grapple with challenges like excessive memory usage and limited training parallelism due to self-attention, rendering them impractical for real-time disease detection on resource-constrained devices. In this study, we address these hurdles by investigating the integration of the recently introduced retention mechanism into polyp segmentation, introducing RetSeg, an encoder-decoder network featuring multi-head retention blocks. Drawing inspiration from Retentive Networks (RetNet), RetSeg is designed to bridge the gap between precise polyp segmentation and resource utilization, particularly tailored for colonoscopy images. We train and validate RetSeg for polyp segmentation employing two publicly available datasets: Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB. Additionally, we showcase RetSeg's promising performance across diverse public datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, ETIS-LaribPolypDB, CVC-300, and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp. While our work represents an early-stage exploration, further in-depth studies are imperative to advance these promising findings.

- **Summary**: In this work, we build a modular-designed codebase, formulate strong training recipes, design an error diagnosis toolbox, and discuss current methods for image-based 3D object detection. In particular, different from other highly mature tasks, e.g., 2D object detection, the community of image-based 3D object detection is still evolving, where methods often adopt different training recipes and tricks resulting in unfair evaluations and comparisons. What is worse, these tricks may overwhelm their proposed designs in performance, even leading to wrong conclusions. To address this issue, we build a module-designed codebase and formulate unified training standards for the community. Furthermore, we also design an error diagnosis toolbox to measure the detailed characterization of detection models. Using these tools, we analyze current methods in-depth under varying settings and provide discussions for some open questions, e.g., discrepancies in conclusions on KITTI-3D and nuScenes datasets, which have led to different dominant methods for these datasets. We hope that this work will facilitate future research in image-based 3D object detection. Our codes will be released at \url{https://github.com/OpenGVLab/3dodi}

- **Summary**: Universal domain adaptation aims to align the classes and reduce the feature gap between the same category of the source and target domains. The target private category is set as the unknown class during the adaptation process, as it is not included in the source domain. However, most existing methods overlook the intra-class structure within a category, especially in cases where there exists significant concept shift between the samples belonging to the same category. When samples with large concept shift are forced to be pushed together, it may negatively affect the adaptation performance. Moreover, from the interpretability aspect, it is unreasonable to align visual features with significant differences, such as fighter jets and civil aircraft, into the same category. Unfortunately, due to such semantic ambiguity and annotation cost, categories are not always classified in detail, making it difficult for the model to perform precise adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Memory-Assisted Sub-Prototype Mining (MemSPM) method that can learn the differences between samples belonging to the same category and mine sub-classes when there exists significant concept shift between them. By doing so, our model learns a more reasonable feature space that enhances the transferability and reflects the inherent differences among samples annotated as the same category. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MemSPM method over multiple scenarios, including UniDA, OSDA, and PDA. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks in most cases.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal medical image fusion is essential for the precise clinical diagnosis and surgical navigation since it can merge the complementary information in multi-modalities into a single image. The quality of the fused image depends on the extracted single modality features as well as the fusion rules for multi-modal information. Existing deep learning-based fusion methods can fully exploit the semantic features of each modality, they cannot distinguish the effective low and high frequency information of each modality and fuse them adaptively. To address this issue, we propose AdaFuse, in which multimodal image information is fused adaptively through frequency-guided attention mechanism based on Fourier transform. Specifically, we propose the cross-attention fusion (CAF) block, which adaptively fuses features of two modalities in the spatial and frequency domains by exchanging key and query values, and then calculates the cross-attention scores between the spatial and frequency features to further guide the spatial-frequential information fusion. The CAF block enhances the high-frequency features of the different modalities so that the details in the fused images can be retained. Moreover, we design a novel loss function composed of structure loss and content loss to preserve both low and high frequency information. Extensive comparison experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics. The ablation experiments also validate the effectiveness of the proposed loss and fusion strategy. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/xianming-gu/AdaFuse.

- **Summary**: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving specific images by using a query that involves both a reference image and a relative caption. Most existing CIR models adopt the late-fusion strategy to combine visual and language features. Besides, several approaches have also been suggested to generate a pseudo-word token from the reference image, which is further integrated into the relative caption for CIR. However, these pseudo-word-based prompting methods have limitations when target image encompasses complex changes on reference image, e.g., object removal and attribute modification. In this work, we demonstrate that learning an appropriate sentence-level prompt for the relative caption (SPRC) is sufficient for achieving effective composed image retrieval. Instead of relying on pseudo-word-based prompts, we propose to leverage pretrained V-L models, e.g., BLIP-2, to generate sentence-level prompts. By concatenating the learned sentence-level prompt with the relative caption, one can readily use existing text-based image retrieval models to enhance CIR performance. Furthermore, we introduce both image-text contrastive loss and text prompt alignment loss to enforce the learning of suitable sentence-level prompts. Experiments show that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art CIR methods on the Fashion-IQ and CIRR datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel method for 3D scene and object reconstruction from sparse multi-view images. Different from previous methods that leverage extra information such as depth or generalizable features across scenes, our approach leverages the scene properties embedded in the multi-view inputs to create precise pseudo-labels for optimization without any prior training. Specifically, we introduce a geometry-guided approach that improves surface reconstruction accuracy from sparse views by leveraging spherical harmonics to predict the novel radiance while holistically considering all color observations for a point in the scene. Also, our pipeline exploits proxy geometry and correctly handles the occlusion in generating the pseudo-labels of radiance, which previous image-warping methods fail to avoid. Our method, dubbed Ray Augmentation (RayAug), achieves superior results on DTU and Blender datasets without requiring prior training, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the problem of sparse view reconstruction. Our pipeline is flexible and can be integrated into other implicit neural reconstruction methods for sparse views.

- **Summary**: Annotating remote sensing images (RSIs) presents a notable challenge due to its labor-intensive nature. Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) methods tackle this issue by generating pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data, assuming that all classes found in the unlabeled dataset are also represented in the labeled data. However, real-world situations introduce the possibility of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples being mixed with in-distribution (ID) samples within the unlabeled dataset. In this paper, we delve into techniques for conducting SSOD directly on uncurated unlabeled data, which is termed Open-Set Semi-Supervised Object Detection (OSSOD). Our approach commences by employing labeled in-distribution data to dynamically construct a class-wise feature bank (CFB) that captures features specific to each class. Subsequently, we compare the features of predicted object bounding boxes with the corresponding entries in the CFB to calculate OOD scores. We design an adaptive threshold based on the statistical properties of the CFB, allowing us to filter out OOD samples effectively. The effectiveness of our proposed method is substantiated through extensive experiments on two widely used remote sensing object detection datasets: DIOR and DOTA. These experiments showcase the superior performance and efficacy of our approach for OSSOD on RSIs.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art techniques for monocular camera reconstruction predominantly rely on the Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline. However, such methods often yield reconstruction outcomes that lack crucial scale information, and over time, accumulation of images leads to inevitable drift issues. In contrast, mapping methods based on LiDAR scans are popular in large-scale urban scene reconstruction due to their precise distance measurements, a capability fundamentally absent in visual-based approaches. Researchers have made attempts to utilize concurrent LiDAR and camera measurements in pursuit of precise scaling and color details within mapping outcomes. However, the outcomes are subject to extrinsic calibration and time synchronization precision. In this paper, we propose a novel cost-effective reconstruction pipeline that utilizes a pre-established LiDAR map as a fixed constraint to effectively address the inherent scale challenges present in monocular camera reconstruction. To our knowledge, our method is the first to register images onto the point cloud map without requiring synchronous capture of camera and LiDAR data, granting us the flexibility to manage reconstruction detail levels across various areas of interest. To facilitate further research in this domain, we have released Colmap-PCD${^{3}}$, an open-source tool leveraging the Colmap algorithm, that enables precise fine-scale registration of images to the point cloud map.

- **Summary**: Point-level supervised temporal action localization (PTAL) aims at recognizing and localizing actions in untrimmed videos where only a single point (frame) within every action instance is annotated in training data. Without temporal annotations, most previous works adopt the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, where the input video is segmented into non-overlapped short snippets, and action classification is performed independently on every short snippet. We argue that the MIL framework is suboptimal for PTAL because it operates on separated short snippets that contain limited temporal information. Therefore, the classifier only focuses on several easy-to-distinguish snippets instead of discovering the whole action instance without missing any relevant snippets. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel method that localizes actions by generating and evaluating action proposals of flexible duration that involve more comprehensive temporal information. Moreover, we introduce an efficient clustering algorithm to efficiently generate dense pseudo labels that provide stronger supervision, and a fine-grained contrastive loss to further refine the quality of pseudo labels. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves competitive or superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods and some fully-supervised methods on four benchmarks: ActivityNet 1.3, THUMOS 14, GTEA, and BEOID datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a method for detecting objects of interest, including cars, humans, and fire, in aerial images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) usually during vegetation fires. To achieve this, we use artificial neural networks and create a dataset for supervised learning. We accomplish the assisted labeling of the dataset through the implementation of an object detection pipeline that combines classic image processing techniques with pretrained neural networks. In addition, we develop a data augmentation pipeline to augment the dataset with automatically labeled images. Finally, we evaluate the performance of different neural networks.

- **Summary**: The growing capabilities of neural rendering have increased the demand for new techniques that enable the intuitive editing of 3D objects, particularly when they are represented as neural implicit surfaces. In this paper, we present a novel neural algorithm to parameterize neural implicit surfaces to simple parametric domains, such as spheres, cubes or polycubes, where 3D radiance field can be represented as a 2D field, thereby facilitating visualization and various editing tasks. Technically, our method computes a bi-directional deformation between 3D objects and their chosen parametric domains, eliminating the need for any prior information. We adopt a forward mapping of points on the zero level set of the 3D object to a parametric domain, followed by a backward mapping through inverse deformation. To ensure the map is bijective, we employ a cycle loss while optimizing the smoothness of both deformations. Additionally, we leverage a Laplacian regularizer to effectively control angle distortion and offer the flexibility to choose from a range of parametric domains for managing area distortion. Designed for compatibility, our framework integrates seamlessly with existing neural rendering pipelines, taking multi-view images as input to reconstruct 3D geometry and compute the corresponding texture map. We also introduce a simple yet effective technique for intrinsic radiance decomposition, facilitating both view-independent material editing and view-dependent shading editing. Our method allows for the immediate rendering of edited textures through volume rendering, without the need for network re-training. Moreover, our approach supports the co-parameterization of multiple objects and enables texture transfer between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on images of human heads and man-made objects. We will make the source code publicly available.

- **Summary**: Polyp segmentation is crucial for preventing colorectal cancer a common type of cancer. Deep learning has been used to segment polyps automatically, which reduces the risk of misdiagnosis. Localizing small polyps in colonoscopy images is challenging because of its complex characteristics, such as color, occlusion, and various shapes of polyps. To address this challenge, a novel frequency-based fully convolutional neural network, Multi-Frequency Feature Fusion Polyp Segmentation Network (M3FPolypSegNet) was proposed to decompose the input image into low/high/full-frequency components to use the characteristics of each component. We used three independent multi-frequency encoders to map multiple input images into a high-dimensional feature space. In the Frequency-ASPP Scalable Attention Module (F-ASPP SAM), ASPP was applied between each frequency component to preserve scale information. Subsequently, scalable attention was applied to emphasize polyp regions in a high-dimensional feature space. Finally, we designed three multi-task learning (i.e., region, edge, and distance) in four decoder blocks to learn the structural characteristics of the region. The proposed model outperformed various segmentation models with performance gains of 6.92% and 7.52% on average for all metrics on CVC-ClinicDB and BKAI-IGH-NeoPolyp, respectively.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation models have shown promising performance on clear scenes but fail to generalize to adverse weather conditions due to illumination variations, weather particles, etc. In this paper, we propose WeatherDepth, a self-supervised robust depth estimation model with curriculum contrastive learning, to tackle performance degradation in complex weather conditions. Concretely, we first present a progressive curriculum learning scheme with three simple-to-complex curricula to gradually adapt the model from clear to relative adverse, and then to adverse weather scenes. It encourages the model to gradually grasp beneficial depth cues against the weather effect, yielding smoother and better domain adaption. Meanwhile, to prevent the model from forgetting previous curricula, we integrate contrastive learning into different curricula. Drawn the reference knowledge from the previous course, our strategy establishes a depth consistency constraint between different courses towards robust depth estimation in diverse weather. Besides, to reduce manual intervention and better adapt to different models, we designed an adaptive curriculum scheduler to automatically search for the best timing for course switching. In the experiment, the proposed solution is proven to be easily incorporated into various architectures and demonstrates state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on both synthetic and real weather datasets.

- **Summary**: When it comes to clinical images, automatic segmentation has a wide variety of applications and a considerable diversity of input domains, such as different types of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) and Computerized Tomography (CT) scans. This heterogeneity is a challenge for cross-modality algorithms that should equally perform independently of the input image type fed to them. Often, segmentation models are trained using a single modality, preventing generalization to other types of input data without resorting to transfer learning techniques. Furthermore, the multi-modal or cross-modality architectures proposed in the literature frequently require registered images, which are not easy to collect in clinical environments, or need additional processing steps, such as synthetic image generation. In this work, we propose a simple framework to achieve fair image segmentation of multiple modalities using a single conditional model that adapts its normalization layers based on the input type, trained with non-registered interleaved mixed data. We show that our framework outperforms other cross-modality segmentation methods, when applied to the same 3D UNet baseline model, on the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation Challenge. Furthermore, we define the Conditional Vision Transformer (C-ViT) encoder, based on the proposed cross-modality framework, and we show that it brings significant improvements to the resulting segmentation, up to 6.87\% of Dice accuracy, with respect to its baseline reference. The code to reproduce our experiments and the trained model weights are available at https://github.com/matteo-bastico/MI-Seg.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep generative models have facilitated the creation of photo-realistic images across various tasks. However, these generated images often exhibit perceptual artifacts in specific regions, necessitating manual correction. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical examination of Perceptual Artifacts Localization (PAL) spanning diverse image synthesis endeavors. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,168 generated images, each annotated with per-pixel perceptual artifact labels across ten synthesis tasks. A segmentation model, trained on our proposed dataset, effectively localizes artifacts across a range of tasks. Additionally, we illustrate its proficiency in adapting to previously unseen models using minimal training samples. We further propose an innovative zoom-in inpainting pipeline that seamlessly rectifies perceptual artifacts in the generated images. Through our experimental analyses, we elucidate several practical downstream applications, such as automated artifact rectification, non-referential image quality evaluation, and abnormal region detection in images. The dataset and code are released.

- **Summary**: As labor shortage increases in the health sector, the demand for assistive robotics grows. However, the needed test data to develop those robots is scarce, especially for the application of active 3D object detection, where no real data exists at all. This short paper counters this by introducing such an annotated dataset of real environments. The captured environments represent areas which are already in use in the field of robotic health care research. We further provide ground truth data within one room, for assessing SLAM algorithms running directly on a health care robot.

- **Summary**: In contrastive learning, two views of an original image generated by different augmentations are considered as a positive pair whose similarity is required to be high. Moreover, two views of two different images are considered as a negative pair, and their similarity is encouraged to be low. Normally, a single similarity measure given by a single projection head is used to evaluate positive and negative sample pairs, respectively. However, due to the various augmentation strategies and varying intra-sample similarity, augmented views from the same image are often not similar. Moreover, due to inter-sample similarity, augmented views of two different images may be more similar than augmented views from the same image. As such, enforcing a high similarity for positive pairs and a low similarity for negative pairs may not always be achievable, and in the case of some pairs, forcing so may be detrimental to the performance. To address this issue, we propose to use multiple projection heads, each producing a separate set of features. Our loss function for pre-training emerges from a solution to the maximum likelihood estimation over head-wise posterior distributions of positive samples given observations. The loss contains the similarity measure over positive and negative pairs, each re-weighted by an individual adaptive temperature that is regularized to prevent ill solutions. Our adaptive multi-head contrastive learning (AMCL) can be applied to and experimentally improves several popular contrastive learning methods such as SimCLR, MoCo and Barlow Twins. Such improvement is consistent under various backbones and linear probing epoches and is more significant when multiple augmentation methods are used.

- **Summary**: Given the similarity between facial expression categories, the presence of compound facial expressions, and the subjectivity of annotators, facial expression recognition (FER) datasets often suffer from ambiguity and noisy labels. Ambiguous expressions are challenging to differentiate from expressions with noisy labels, which hurt the robustness of FER models. Furthermore, the difficulty of recognition varies across different expression categories, rendering a uniform approach unfair for all expressions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Adaptive Sample Mining (ASM) to dynamically address ambiguity and noise within each expression category. First, the Adaptive Threshold Learning module generates two thresholds, namely the clean and noisy thresholds, for each category. These thresholds are based on the mean class probabilities at each training epoch. Next, the Sample Mining module partitions the dataset into three subsets: clean, ambiguity, and noise, by comparing the sample confidence with the clean and noisy thresholds. Finally, the Tri-Regularization module employs a mutual learning strategy for the ambiguity subset to enhance discrimination ability, and an unsupervised learning strategy for the noise subset to mitigate the impact of noisy labels. Extensive experiments prove that our method can effectively mine both ambiguity and noise, and outperform SOTA methods on both synthetic noisy and original datasets.

- **Summary**: Generalizable implicit neural representation (INR) enables a single continuous function, i.e., a coordinate-based neural network, to represent multiple data instances by modulating its weights or intermediate features using latent codes. However, the expressive power of the state-of-the-art modulation is limited due to its inability to localize and capture fine-grained details of data entities such as specific pixels and rays. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for generalizable INR that combines a transformer encoder with a locality-aware INR decoder. The transformer encoder predicts a set of latent tokens from a data instance to encode local information into each latent token. The locality-aware INR decoder extracts a modulation vector by selectively aggregating the latent tokens via cross-attention for a coordinate input and then predicts the output by progressively decoding with coarse-to-fine modulation through multiple frequency bandwidths. The selective token aggregation and the multi-band feature modulation enable us to learn locality-aware representation in spatial and spectral aspects, respectively. Our framework significantly outperforms previous generalizable INRs and validates the usefulness of the locality-aware latents for downstream tasks such as image generation.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel Deep Active Learning (DeepAL) model-3D Wasserstein Discriminative UNet (WD-UNet) for reducing the annotation effort of medical 3D Computed Tomography (CT) segmentation. The proposed WD-UNet learns in a semi-supervised way and accelerates learning convergence to meet or exceed the prediction metrics of supervised learning models. Our method can be embedded with different Active Learning (AL) strategies and different network structures. The model is evaluated on 3D lung airway CT scans for medical segmentation and show that the use of uncertainty metric, which is parametrized as an input of query strategy, leads to more accurate prediction results than some state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) supervised models, e.g.,3DUNet and 3D CEUNet. Compared to the above supervised DL methods, our WD-UNet not only saves the cost of annotation for radiologists but also saves computational resources. WD-UNet uses a limited amount of annotated data (35% of the total) to achieve better predictive metrics with a more efficient deep learning model algorithm.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders ViTs' applicability on devices with limited memory and computing resources. Although certain investigations have delved into the fusion of convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of ViTs, there remains a knowledge gap in constructing tiny yet effective ViTs solely based on the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, the straightforward strategy of reducing the feature channels in a large but outperforming ViT often results in significant performance degradation despite improved efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel channel shuffle module to improve tiny-size ViTs, showing the potential of pure self-attention models in environments with constrained computing resources. Inspired by the channel shuffle design in ShuffleNetV2 \cite{ma2018shufflenet}, our module expands the feature channels of a tiny ViT and partitions the channels into two groups: the \textit{Attended} and \textit{Idle} groups. Self-attention computations are exclusively employed on the designated \textit{Attended} group, followed by a channel shuffle operation that facilitates information exchange between the two groups. By incorporating our module into a tiny ViT, we can achieve superior performance while maintaining a comparable computational complexity to the vanilla model. Specifically, our proposed channel shuffle module consistently improves the top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset for various tiny ViT models by up to 2.8\%, with the changes in model complexity being less than 0.03 GMACs.

- **Summary**: Unlike primates, training artificial neural networks on changing data distributions leads to a rapid decrease in performance on old tasks. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we investigate the representational changes that underlie this performance decrease and identify three distinct processes that together account for the phenomenon. The largest component is a misalignment between hidden representations and readout layers. Misalignment occurs due to learning on additional tasks and causes internal representations to shift. Representational geometry is partially conserved under this misalignment and only a small part of the information is irrecoverably lost. All types of representational changes scale with the dimensionality of hidden representations. These insights have implications for deep learning applications that need to be continuously updated, but may also aid aligning ANN models to the rather robust biological vision.

- **Summary**: Estimating tissue parameter maps with high accuracy and precision from highly undersampled measurements presents one of the major challenges in MR fingerprinting (MRF). Many existing works project the recovered voxel fingerprints onto the Bloch manifold to improve reconstruction performance. However, little research focuses on exploiting the latent manifold structure priors among fingerprints. To fill this gap, we propose a novel MRF reconstruction framework based on manifold structured data priors. Since it is difficult to directly estimate the fingerprint manifold structure, we model the tissue parameters as points on a low-dimensional parameter manifold. We reveal that the fingerprint manifold shares the same intrinsic topology as the parameter manifold, although being embedded in different Euclidean spaces. To exploit the non-linear and non-local redundancies in MRF data, we divide the MRF data into spatial patches, and the similarity measurement among data patches can be accurately obtained using the Euclidean distance between the corresponding patches in the parameter manifold. The measured similarity is then used to construct the graph Laplacian operator, which represents the fingerprint manifold structure. Thus, the fingerprint manifold structure is introduced in the reconstruction framework by using the low-dimensional parameter manifold. Additionally, we incorporate the locally low-rank prior in the reconstruction framework to further utilize the local correlations within each patch for improved reconstruction performance. We also adopt a GPU-accelerated NUFFT library to accelerate reconstruction in non-Cartesian sampling scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve significantly improved reconstruction performance with reduced computational time over the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in computer vision tasks, yet their high computational complexity prevents their deployment in computing resource-constrained environments. Various token pruning techniques have been introduced to alleviate the high computational burden of ViTs by dynamically dropping image tokens. However, some undesirable pruning at early stages may result in permanent loss of image information in subsequent layers, consequently hindering model performance. To address this problem, we propose IdleViT, a dynamic token-idle-based method that achieves an excellent trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, in each layer, IdleViT selects a subset of the image tokens to participate in computations while keeping the rest of the tokens idle and directly passing them to this layer's output. By allowing the idle tokens to be re-selected in the following layers, IdleViT mitigates the negative impact of improper pruning in the early stages. Furthermore, inspired by the normalized graph cut, we devise a token cut loss on the attention map as regularization to improve IdleViT's token selection ability. Our method is simple yet effective and can be extended to pyramid ViTs since no token is completely dropped. Extensive experimental results on various ViT architectures have shown that IdleViT can diminish the complexity of pretrained ViTs by up to 33\% with no more than 0.2\% accuracy decrease on ImageNet, after finetuning for only 30 epochs. Notably, when the keep ratio is 0.5, IdleViT outperforms the state-of-the-art EViT on DeiT-S by 0.5\% higher accuracy and even faster inference speed.

- **Summary**: Transformer design is the de facto standard for natural language processing tasks. The success of the transformer design in natural language processing has lately piqued the interest of researchers in the domain of computer vision. When compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs) are becoming more popular and dominant solutions for many vision problems. Transformer-based models outperform other types of networks, such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks, in a range of visual benchmarks. We evaluate various vision transformer models in this work by dividing them into distinct jobs and examining their benefits and drawbacks. ViTs can overcome several possible difficulties with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal of this survey is to show the first use of ViTs in CV. In the first phase, we categorize various CV applications where ViTs are appropriate. Image classification, object identification, image segmentation, video transformer, image denoising, and NAS are all CV applications. Our next step will be to analyze the state-of-the-art in each area and identify the models that are currently available. In addition, we outline numerous open research difficulties as well as prospective research possibilities.

- **Summary**: Anchor-based detectors have been continuously developed for object detection. However, the individual anchor box makes it difficult to predict the boundary's offset accurately. Instead of taking each bounding box as a closed individual, we consider using multiple boxes together to get prediction boxes. To this end, this paper proposes the \textbf{Box Decouple-Couple(BDC) strategy} in the inference, which no longer discards the overlapping boxes, but decouples the corner points of these boxes. Then, according to each corner's score, we couple the corner points to select the most accurate corner pairs. To meet the BDC strategy, a simple but novel model is designed named the \textbf{Anchor-Intermediate Detector(AID)}, which contains two head networks, i.e., an anchor-based head and an anchor-free \textbf{Corner-aware head}. The corner-aware head is able to score the corners of each bounding box to facilitate the coupling between corner points. Extensive experiments on MS COCO show that the proposed anchor-intermediate detector respectively outperforms their baseline RetinaNet and GFL method by $\sim$2.4 and $\sim$1.2 AP on the MS COCO test-dev dataset without any bells and whistles.

- **Summary**: This study presents a comprehensive remote sensing analysis of rainfall patterns and selected hydropower reservoir water extent in two tropical monsoon countries, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. The aim is to understand the relationship between remotely sensed rainfall data and the dynamic changes (monthly) in reservoir water extent. The analysis utilizes high-resolution optical imagery and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to observe and monitor water bodies during different weather conditions, especially during the monsoon season. The average annual rainfall for both countries is determined, and spatiotemporal variations in monthly average rainfall are examined at regional and reservoir basin levels using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) dataset from 1981 to 2022. Water extents are derived for selected reservoirs using Sentinel-1 SAR Ground Range Detected (GRD) images in Vietnam and Sri Lanka from 2017 to 2022. The images are pre-processed and corrected using terrain correction and refined Lee filter. An automated thresholding algorithm, OTSU, distinguishes water and land, taking advantage of both VV and VH polarization data. The connected pixel count threshold is applied to enhance result accuracy. The results indicate a clear relationship between rainfall patterns and reservoir water extent, with increased precipitation during the monsoon season leading to higher water extents in the later months. This study contributes to understanding how rainfall variability impacts reservoir water resources in tropical monsoon regions. The preliminary findings can inform water resource management strategies and support these countries' decision-making processes related to hydropower generation, flood management, and irrigation.

- **Summary**: Climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of many extreme weather events, including heatwaves, which results in increased thermal discomfort and mortality rates. While global mitigation action is undoubtedly necessary, so is climate adaptation, e.g., through climate-sensitive urban planning. Among the most promising strategies is harnessing the benefits of urban trees in shading and cooling pedestrian-level environments. Our work investigates the challenge of optimal placement of such trees. Physical simulations can estimate the radiative and thermal impact of trees on human thermal comfort but induce high computational costs. This rules out optimization of tree placements over large areas and considering effects over longer time scales. Hence, we employ neural networks to simulate the point-wise mean radiant temperatures--a driving factor of outdoor human thermal comfort--across various time scales, spanning from daily variations to extended time scales of heatwave events and even decades. To optimize tree placements, we harness the innate local effect of trees within the iterated local search framework with tailored adaptations. We show the efficacy of our approach across a wide spectrum of study areas and time scales. We believe that our approach is a step towards empowering decision-makers, urban designers and planners to proactively and effectively assess the potential of urban trees to mitigate heat stress.

- **Summary**: With its vast expanse, exceeding that of Western Europe by twice, the Amazon rainforest stands as the largest forest of the Earth, holding immense importance in global climate regulation. Yet, deforestation detection from remote sensing data in this region poses a critical challenge, often hindered by the persistent cloud cover that obscures optical satellite data for much of the year. Addressing this need, this paper proposes three deep-learning models tailored for deforestation monitoring, utilizing SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) multitemporal data moved by its independence on atmospheric conditions. Specifically, the study proposes three novel recurrent fully convolutional network architectures-namely, RRCNN-1, RRCNN-2, and RRCNN-3, crafted to enhance the accuracy of deforestation detection. Additionally, this research explores replacing a bitemporal with multitemporal SAR sequences, motivated by the hypothesis that deforestation signs quickly fade in SAR images over time. A comprehensive assessment of the proposed approaches was conducted using a Sentinel-1 multitemporal sequence from a sample site in the Brazilian rainforest. The experimental analysis confirmed that analyzing a sequence of SAR images over an observation period can reveal deforestation spots undetectable in a pair of images. Notably, experimental results underscored the superiority of the multitemporal approach, yielding approximately a five percent enhancement in F1-Score across all tested network architectures. Particularly the RRCNN-1 achieved the highest accuracy and also boasted half the processing time of its closest counterpart.

- **Summary**: Existing point cloud based 3D detectors are designed for the particular scene, either indoor or outdoor ones. Because of the substantial differences in object distribution and point density within point clouds collected from various environments, coupled with the intricate nature of 3D metrics, there is still a lack of a unified network architecture that can accommodate diverse scenes. In this paper, we propose Uni3DETR, a unified 3D detector that addresses indoor and outdoor 3D detection within the same framework. Specifically, we employ the detection transformer with point-voxel interaction for object prediction, which leverages voxel features and points for cross-attention and behaves resistant to the discrepancies from data. We then propose the mixture of query points, which sufficiently exploits global information for dense small-range indoor scenes and local information for large-range sparse outdoor ones. Furthermore, our proposed decoupled IoU provides an easy-to-optimize training target for localization by disentangling the xy and z space. Extensive experiments validate that Uni3DETR exhibits excellent performance consistently on both indoor and outdoor 3D detection. In contrast to previous specialized detectors, which may perform well on some particular datasets but suffer a substantial degradation on different scenes, Uni3DETR demonstrates the strong generalization ability under heterogeneous conditions (Fig. 1).

- **Summary**: In this work, we present STOPNet, a framework for 6-DoF object suction detection on production lines, with a focus on but not limited to transparent objects, which is an important and challenging problem in robotic systems and modern industry. Current methods requiring depth input fail on transparent objects due to depth cameras' deficiency in sensing their geometry, while we proposed a novel framework to reconstruct the scene on the production line depending only on RGB input, based on multiview stereo. Compared to existing works, our method not only reconstructs the whole 3D scene in order to obtain high-quality 6-DoF suction poses in real time but also generalizes to novel environments, novel arrangements and novel objects, including challenging transparent objects, both in simulation and the real world. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world show that our method significantly surpasses the baselines and has better generalizability, which caters to practical industrial needs.

- **Summary**: Codebook collapse is a common problem in training deep generative models with discrete representation spaces like Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). We observe that the same problem arises for the alternatively designed discrete variational autoencoders (dVAEs) whose encoder directly learns a distribution over the codebook embeddings to represent the data. We hypothesize that using the softmax function to obtain a probability distribution causes the codebook collapse by assigning overconfident probabilities to the best matching codebook elements. In this paper, we propose a novel way to incorporate evidential deep learning (EDL) instead of softmax to combat the codebook collapse problem of dVAE. We evidentially monitor the significance of attaining the probability distribution over the codebook embeddings, in contrast to softmax usage. Our experiments using various datasets show that our model, called EdVAE, mitigates codebook collapse while improving the reconstruction performance, and enhances the codebook usage compared to dVAE and VQ-VAE based models.

- **Summary**: Talking face generation has a wide range of potential applications in the field of virtual digital humans. However, rendering high-fidelity facial video while ensuring lip synchronization is still a challenge for existing audio-driven talking face generation approaches. To address this issue, we propose HyperLips, a two-stage framework consisting of a hypernetwork for controlling lips and a high-resolution decoder for rendering high-fidelity faces. In the first stage, we construct a base face generation network that uses the hypernetwork to control the encoding latent code of the visual face information over audio. First, FaceEncoder is used to obtain latent code by extracting features from the visual face information taken from the video source containing the face frame.Then, HyperConv, which weighting parameters are updated by HyperNet with the audio features as input, will modify the latent code to synchronize the lip movement with the audio. Finally, FaceDecoder will decode the modified and synchronized latent code into visual face content. In the second stage, we obtain higher quality face videos through a high-resolution decoder. To further improve the quality of face generation, we trained a high-resolution decoder, HRDecoder, using face images and detected sketches generated from the first stage as input.Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art work with more realistic, high-fidelity, and lip synchronization.

- **Summary**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are the dominant models for generative tasks in language, they do not perform as well as diffusion models on image and video generation. To effectively use LLMs for visual generation, one crucial component is the visual tokenizer that maps pixel-space inputs to discrete tokens appropriate for LLM learning. In this paper, we introduce MAGVIT-v2, a video tokenizer designed to generate concise and expressive tokens for both videos and images using a common token vocabulary. Equipped with this new tokenizer, we show that LLMs outperform diffusion models on standard image and video generation benchmarks including ImageNet and Kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that our tokenizer surpasses the previously top-performing video tokenizer on two more tasks: (1) video compression comparable to the next-generation video codec (VCC) according to human evaluations, and (2) learning effective representations for action recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: Transferability estimation aims to provide heuristics for quantifying how suitable a pre-trained model is for a specific downstream task, without fine-tuning them all. Prior studies have revealed that well-trained models exhibit the phenomenon of Neural Collapse. Based on a widely used neural collapse metric in existing literature, we observe a strong correlation between the neural collapse of pre-trained models and their corresponding fine-tuned models. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel method termed Fair Collapse (FaCe) for transferability estimation by comprehensively measuring the degree of neural collapse in the pre-trained model. Typically, FaCe comprises two different terms: the variance collapse term, which assesses the class separation and within-class compactness, and the class fairness term, which quantifies the fairness of the pre-trained model towards each class. We investigate FaCe on a variety of pre-trained classification models across different network architectures, source datasets, and training loss functions. Results show that FaCe yields state-of-the-art performance on different tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, and text classification, which demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

- **Summary**: Performing tasks in agriculture, such as fruit monitoring or harvesting, requires perceiving the objects' spatial position. RGB-D cameras are limited under open-field environments due to lightning interferences. Therefore, in this study, we approach the use of Histogram Filters (Bayesian Discrete Filters) to estimate the position of tomatoes in the tomato plant. Two kernel filters were studied: the square kernel and the Gaussian kernel. The implemented algorithm was essayed in simulation, with and without Gaussian noise and random noise, and in a testbed at laboratory conditions. The algorithm reported a mean absolute error lower than 10 mm in simulation and 20 mm in the testbed at laboratory conditions with an assessing distance of about 0.5 m. So, the results are viable for real environments and should be improved at closer distances.

- **Summary**: Efficient and accurate detection of small objects in manufacturing settings, such as defects and cracks, is crucial for ensuring product quality and safety. To address this issue, we proposed a comprehensive strategy by synergizing Faster R-CNN with cutting-edge methods. By combining Faster R-CNN with Feature Pyramid Network, we enable the model to efficiently handle multi-scale features intrinsic to manufacturing environments. Additionally, Deformable Net is used that contorts and conforms to the geometric variations of defects, bringing precision in detecting even the minuscule and complex features. Then, we incorporated an attention mechanism called Convolutional Block Attention Module in each block of our base ResNet50 network to selectively emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones. After that we incorporated RoI Align, replacing RoI Pooling for finer region-of-interest alignment and finally the integration of Focal Loss effectively handles class imbalance, crucial for rare defect occurrences. The rigorous evaluation of our model on both the NEU-DET and Pascal VOC datasets underscores its robust performance and generalization capabilities. On the NEU-DET dataset, our model exhibited a profound understanding of steel defects, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in identifying various defects. Simultaneously, when evaluated on the Pascal VOC dataset, our model showcases its ability to detect objects across a wide spectrum of categories within complex and small scenes.

- **Comment**: First lossless dataset distillation method
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The ultimate goal of Dataset Distillation is to synthesize a small synthetic dataset such that a model trained on this synthetic set will perform equally well as a model trained on the full, real dataset. Until now, no method of Dataset Distillation has reached this completely lossless goal, in part due to the fact that previous methods only remain effective when the total number of synthetic samples is extremely small. Since only so much information can be contained in such a small number of samples, it seems that to achieve truly loss dataset distillation, we must develop a distillation method that remains effective as the size of the synthetic dataset grows. In this work, we present such an algorithm and elucidate why existing methods fail to generate larger, high-quality synthetic sets. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on trajectory-matching, or optimizing the synthetic data to induce similar long-term training dynamics as the real data. We empirically find that the training stage of the trajectories we choose to match (i.e., early or late) greatly affects the effectiveness of the distilled dataset. Specifically, early trajectories (where the teacher network learns easy patterns) work well for a low-cardinality synthetic set since there are fewer examples wherein to distribute the necessary information. Conversely, late trajectories (where the teacher network learns hard patterns) provide better signals for larger synthetic sets since there are now enough samples to represent the necessary complex patterns. Based on our findings, we propose to align the difficulty of the generated patterns with the size of the synthetic dataset. In doing so, we successfully scale trajectory matching-based methods to larger synthetic datasets, achieving lossless dataset distillation for the very first time.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the field of autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements, driven by the integration of a multitude of sensors, including cameras and LiDAR systems, in different prototypes. However, with the proliferation of sensor data comes the pressing need for more sophisticated information processing techniques. This research paper introduces a novel modification to an object detection network that uses camera and lidar information, incorporating an additional branch designed for the task of re-identifying objects across adjacent cameras within the same vehicle while elevating the quality of the baseline 3D object detection outcomes. The proposed methodology employs a two-step detection pipeline: initially, an object detection network is employed, followed by a 3D box estimator that operates on the filtered point cloud generated from the network's detections. Extensive experimental evaluations encompassing both 2D and 3D domains validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the results underscore the superiority of this method over traditional Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) techniques, with an improvement of more than 5\% in the car category in the overlapping areas.

- **Summary**: Though Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) proves effective by utilizing rich information from multiple sources (e.g., language, video, and audio), the potential sentiment-irrelevant and conflicting information across modalities may hinder the performance from being further improved. To alleviate this, we present Adaptive Language-guided Multimodal Transformer (ALMT), which incorporates an Adaptive Hyper-modality Learning (AHL) module to learn an irrelevance/conflict-suppressing representation from visual and audio features under the guidance of language features at different scales. With the obtained hyper-modality representation, the model can obtain a complementary and joint representation through multimodal fusion for effective MSA. In practice, ALMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on several popular datasets (e.g., MOSI, MOSEI and CH-SIMS) and an abundance of ablation demonstrates the validity and necessity of our irrelevance/conflict suppression mechanism.

- **Summary**: An emerging new paradigm for solving inverse problems is via the use of deep learning to learn a regularizer from data. This leads to high-quality results, but often at the cost of provable guarantees. In this work, we show how well-posedness and convergent regularization arises within the convex-nonconvex (CNC) framework for inverse problems. We introduce a novel input weakly convex neural network (IWCNN) construction to adapt the method of learned adversarial regularization to the CNC framework. Empirically we show that our method overcomes numerical issues of previous adversarial methods.

- **Summary**: Spatio-temporal predictive learning plays a crucial role in self-supervised learning, with wide-ranging applications across a diverse range of fields. Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.

- **Summary**: We present the first real-time method for inserting a rigid virtual object into a neural radiance field, which produces realistic lighting and shadowing effects, as well as allows interactive manipulation of the object. By exploiting the rich information about lighting and geometry in a NeRF, our method overcomes several challenges of object insertion in augmented reality. For lighting estimation, we produce accurate, robust and 3D spatially-varying incident lighting that combines the near-field lighting from NeRF and an environment lighting to account for sources not covered by the NeRF. For occlusion, we blend the rendered virtual object with the background scene using an opacity map integrated from the NeRF. For shadows, with a precomputed field of spherical signed distance field, we query the visibility term for any point around the virtual object, and cast soft, detailed shadows onto 3D surfaces. Compared with state-of-the-art techniques, our approach can insert virtual object into scenes with superior fidelity, and has a great potential to be further applied to augmented reality systems.

- **Summary**: An increasing number of vision-language tasks can be handled with little to no training, i.e., in a zero and few-shot manner, by marrying large language models (LLMs) to vision encoders, resulting in large vision-language models (LVLMs). While this has huge upsides, such as not requiring training data or custom architectures, how an input is presented to a LVLM can have a major impact on zero-shot model performance. In particular, inputs phrased in an underspecified way can result in incorrect answers due to factors like missing visual information, complex implicit reasoning, or linguistic ambiguity. Therefore, adding visually grounded information to the input as a preemptive clarification should improve model performance by reducing underspecification, e.g., by localizing objects and disambiguating references. Similarly, in the VQA setting, changing the way questions are framed can make them easier for models to answer. To this end, we present Rephrase, Augment and Reason (RepARe), a gradient-free framework that extracts salient details about the image using the underlying LVLM as a captioner and reasoner, in order to propose modifications to the original question. We then use the LVLM's confidence over a generated answer as an unsupervised scoring function to select the rephrased question most likely to improve zero-shot performance. Focusing on two visual question answering tasks, we show that RepARe can result in a 3.85% (absolute) increase in zero-shot performance on VQAv2 and a 6.41% point increase on A-OKVQA. Additionally, we find that using gold answers for oracle question candidate selection achieves a substantial gain in VQA accuracy by up to 14.41%. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that outputs from RepARe increase syntactic complexity, and effectively utilize vision-language interaction and the frozen language model in LVLMs.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual large language models (LLM) have drawn significant attention, yet the fine-grained combination of both input streams is rather under-explored, which is challenging but necessary for LLMs to understand general video inputs. To this end, a fine-grained audio-visual joint representation (FAVOR) learning framework for multimodal LLMs is proposed in this paper, which extends a text-based LLM to simultaneously perceive speech and audio events in the audio input stream and images or videos in the visual input stream, at the frame level. To fuse the audio and visual feature streams into joint representations and to align the joint space with the LLM input embedding space, we propose a causal Q-Former structure with a causal attention module to enhance the capture of causal relations of the audio-visual frames across time. An audio-visual evaluation benchmark (AVEB) is also proposed which comprises six representative single-modal tasks with five cross-modal tasks reflecting audio-visual co-reasoning abilities. While achieving competitive single-modal performance on audio, speech and image tasks in AVEB, FAVOR achieved over 20% accuracy improvements on the video question-answering task when fine-grained information or temporal causal reasoning is required. FAVOR, in addition, demonstrated remarkable video comprehension and reasoning abilities on tasks that are unprecedented by other multimodal LLMs. An interactive demo of FAVOR is available at https://github.com/BriansIDP/AudioVisualLLM.git, and the training code and model checkpoints will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) involves the detection of objects and the prediction of their corresponding relationships (predicates). However, the presence of biased predicate annotations poses a significant challenge for PSG models, as it hinders their ability to establish a clear decision boundary among different predicates. This issue substantially impedes the practical utility and real-world applicability of PSG models. To address the intrinsic bias above, we propose a novel framework to infer potentially biased annotations by measuring the predicate prediction risks within each subject-object pair (domain), and adaptively transfer the biased annotations to consistent ones by learning invariant predicate representation embeddings. Experiments show that our method significantly improves the performance of benchmark models, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance, and shows great generalization and effectiveness on PSG dataset.



### ViCor: Bridging Visual Understanding and Commonsense Reasoning with Large Language Models

- **Summary**: In our work, we explore the synergistic capabilities of pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) for visual commonsense reasoning (VCR). We categorize the problem of VCR into visual commonsense understanding (VCU) and visual commonsense inference (VCI). For VCU, which involves perceiving the literal visual content, pre-trained VLMs exhibit strong cross-dataset generalization. On the other hand, in VCI, where the goal is to infer conclusions beyond image content, VLMs face difficulties. We find that a baseline where VLMs provide perception results (image captions) to LLMs leads to improved performance on VCI. However, we identify a challenge with VLMs' passive perception, which often misses crucial context information, leading to incorrect or uncertain reasoning by LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we suggest a collaborative approach where LLMs, when uncertain about their reasoning, actively direct VLMs to concentrate on and gather relevant visual elements to support potential commonsense inferences. In our method, named ViCor, pre-trained LLMs serve as problem classifiers to analyze the problem category, VLM commanders to leverage VLMs differently based on the problem classification, and visual commonsense reasoners to answer the question. VLMs will perform visual recognition and understanding. We evaluate our framework on two VCR benchmark datasets and outperform all other methods that do not require in-domain supervised fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning diffusion models through personalized datasets is an acknowledged method for improving generation quality across downstream tasks, which, however, often inadvertently generates unintended concepts such as watermarks and QR codes, attributed to the limitations in image sources and collecting methods within specific downstream tasks. Existing solutions suffer from eliminating these unintentionally learned implicit concepts, primarily due to the dependency on the model's ability to recognize concepts that it actually cannot discern. In this work, we introduce Geom-Erasing, a novel approach that successfully removes the implicit concepts with either an additional accessible classifier or detector model to encode geometric information of these concepts into text domain. Moreover, we propose Implicit Concept, a novel image-text dataset imbued with three implicit concepts (i.e., watermarks, QR codes, and text) for training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that Geom-Erasing not only identifies but also proficiently eradicates implicit concepts, revealing a significant improvement over the existing methods. The integration of geometric information marks a substantial progression in the precise removal of implicit concepts in diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Radiology reports are detailed text descriptions of the content of medical scans. Each report describes the presence/absence and location of relevant clinical findings, commonly including comparison with prior exams of the same patient to describe how they evolved. Radiology reporting is a time-consuming process, and scan results are often subject to delays. One strategy to speed up reporting is to integrate automated reporting systems, however clinical deployment requires high accuracy and interpretability. Previous approaches to automated radiology reporting generally do not provide the prior study as input, precluding comparison which is required for clinical accuracy in some types of scans, and offer only unreliable methods of interpretability. Therefore, leveraging an existing visual input format of anatomical tokens, we introduce two novel aspects: (1) longitudinal representation learning -- we input the prior scan as an additional input, proposing a method to align, concatenate and fuse the current and prior visual information into a joint longitudinal representation which can be provided to the multimodal report generation model; (2) sentence-anatomy dropout -- a training strategy for controllability in which the report generator model is trained to predict only sentences from the original report which correspond to the subset of anatomical regions given as input. We show through in-depth experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset how the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results while enabling anatomy-wise controllable report generation.

- **Summary**: Streaming neural network models for fast frame-wise responses to various speech and sensory signals are widely adopted on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, increasing the learning capacity of such streaming models (i.e., by adding more parameters) to improve the predictive power may not be viable for real-world tasks. In this work, we propose a new loss, Streaming Anchor Loss (SAL), to better utilize the given learning capacity by encouraging the model to learn more from essential frames. More specifically, our SAL and its focal variations dynamically modulate the frame-wise cross entropy loss based on the importance of the corresponding frames so that a higher loss penalty is assigned for frames within the temporal proximity of semantically critical events. Therefore, our loss ensures that the model training focuses on predicting the relatively rare but task-relevant frames. Experimental results with standard lightweight convolutional and recurrent streaming networks on three different speech based detection tasks demonstrate that SAL enables the model to learn the overall task more effectively with improved accuracy and latency, without any additional data, model parameters, or architectural changes.

- **Summary**: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) use multiple sensors to gather information about their surroundings. By sharing sensor data between Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), the safety and reliability of these vehicles can be improved through a concept known as cooperative perception. However, recent approaches in cooperative perception only share single sensor information such as cameras or LiDAR. In this research, we explore the fusion of multiple sensor data sources and present a framework, called CoBEVFusion, that fuses LiDAR and camera data to create a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. The CAVs process the multi-modal data locally and utilize a Dual Window-based Cross-Attention (DWCA) module to fuse the LiDAR and camera features into a unified BEV representation. The fused BEV feature maps are shared among the CAVs, and a 3D Convolutional Neural Network is applied to aggregate the features from the CAVs. Our CoBEVFusion framework was evaluated on the cooperative perception dataset OPV2V for two perception tasks: BEV semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. The results show that our DWCA LiDAR-camera fusion model outperforms perception models with single-modal data and state-of-the-art BEV fusion models. Our overall cooperative perception architecture, CoBEVFusion, also achieves comparable performance with other cooperative perception models.

- **Summary**: We investigate the CLIP image encoder by analyzing how individual model components affect the final representation. We decompose the image representation as a sum across individual image patches, model layers, and attention heads, and use CLIP's text representation to interpret the summands. Interpreting the attention heads, we characterize each head's role by automatically finding text representations that span its output space, which reveals property-specific roles for many heads (e.g. location or shape). Next, interpreting the image patches, we uncover an emergent spatial localization within CLIP. Finally, we use this understanding to remove spurious features from CLIP and to create a strong zero-shot image segmenter. Our results indicate that a scalable understanding of transformer models is attainable and can be used to repair and improve models.

- **Summary**: Clothing is an important part of human appearance but challenging to model in photorealistic avatars. In this work we present avatars with dynamically moving loose clothing that can be faithfully driven by sparse RGB-D inputs as well as body and face motion. We propose a Neural Iterative Closest Point (N-ICP) algorithm that can efficiently track the coarse garment shape given sparse depth input. Given the coarse tracking results, the input RGB-D images are then remapped to texel-aligned features, which are fed into the drivable avatar models to faithfully reconstruct appearance details. We evaluate our method against recent image-driven synthesis baselines, and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the N-ICP algorithm. We demonstrate that our method can generalize to a novel testing environment, while preserving the ability to produce high-fidelity and faithful clothing dynamics and appearance.

- **Summary**: The ability to detect objects in images at varying scales has played a pivotal role in the design of modern object detectors. Despite considerable progress in removing handcrafted components using transformers, multi-scale feature maps remain a key factor for their empirical success, even with a plain backbone like the Vision Transformer (ViT). In this paper, we show that this reliance on feature pyramids is unnecessary and a transformer-based detector with scale-aware attention enables the plain detector `SimPLR' whose backbone and detection head both operate on single-scale features. The plain architecture allows SimPLR to effectively take advantages of self-supervised learning and scaling approaches with ViTs, yielding strong performance compared to multi-scale counterparts. We demonstrate through our experiments that when scaling to larger backbones, SimPLR indicates better performance than end-to-end detectors (Mask2Former) and plain-backbone detectors (ViTDet), while consistently being faster. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: Text-to-video editing aims to edit the visual appearance of a source video conditional on textual prompts. A major challenge in this task is to ensure that all frames in the edited video are visually consistent. Most recent works apply advanced text-to-image diffusion models to this task by inflating 2D spatial attention in the U-Net into spatio-temporal attention. Although temporal context can be added through spatio-temporal attention, it may introduce some irrelevant information for each patch and therefore cause inconsistency in the edited video. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce optical flow into the attention module in the diffusion model's U-Net to address the inconsistency issue for text-to-video editing. Our method, FLATTEN, enforces the patches on the same flow path across different frames to attend to each other in the attention module, thus improving the visual consistency in the edited videos. Additionally, our method is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into any diffusion-based text-to-video editing methods and improve their visual consistency. Experiment results on existing text-to-video editing benchmarks show that our proposed method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance. In particular, our method excels in maintaining the visual consistency in the edited videos.

- **Summary**: Visual understanding of the world goes beyond the semantics and flat structure of individual images. In this work, we aim to capture both the 3D structure and dynamics of real-world scenes from monocular real-world videos. Our Dynamic Scene Transformer (DyST) model leverages recent work in neural scene representation to learn a latent decomposition of monocular real-world videos into scene content, per-view scene dynamics, and camera pose. This separation is achieved through a novel co-training scheme on monocular videos and our new synthetic dataset DySO. DyST learns tangible latent representations for dynamic scenes that enable view generation with separate control over the camera and the content of the scene.

- **Summary**: Fitness applications are commonly used to monitor activities within the gym, but they often fail to automatically track indoor activities inside the gym. This study proposes a model that utilizes pose estimation combined with a novel data augmentation method, i.e., rotation matrix. We aim to enhance the classification accuracy of activity recognition based on pose estimation data. Through our experiments, we experiment with different classification algorithms along with image augmentation approaches. Our findings demonstrate that the SVM with SGD optimization, using data augmentation with the Rotation Matrix, yields the most accurate results, achieving a 96% accuracy rate in classifying five physical activities. Conversely, without implementing the data augmentation techniques, the baseline accuracy remains at a modest 64%.

- **Summary**: Lung diseases such as COVID-19, tuberculosis (TB), and pneumonia continue to be serious global health concerns that affect millions of people worldwide. In medical practice, chest X-ray examinations have emerged as the norm for diagnosing diseases, particularly chest infections such as COVID-19. Paramedics and scientists are working intensively to create a reliable and precise approach for early-stage COVID-19 diagnosis in order to save lives. But with a variety of symptoms, medical diagnosis of these disorders poses special difficulties. It is essential to address their identification and timely diagnosis in order to successfully treat and prevent these illnesses. In this research, a multiclass classification approach using state-of-the-art methods for deep learning and image processing is proposed. This method takes into account the robustness and efficiency of the system in order to increase diagnostic precision of chest diseases. A comparison between a brand-new convolution neural network (CNN) and several transfer learning pre-trained models including VGG19, ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and InceptionNet is recommended. Publicly available and widely used research datasets like Shenzen, Montogomery, the multiclass Kaggle dataset and the NIH dataset were used to rigorously test the model. Recall, precision, F1-score, and Area Under Curve (AUC) score are used to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed model. An AUC value of 0.95 for COVID-19, 0.99 for TB, and 0.98 for pneumonia is obtained using the proposed network. Recall and precision ratings of 0.95, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively, likewise met high standards.

- **Summary**: In an era where the global population is aging significantly, cognitive impairments among the elderly have become a major health concern. The need for effective assistive technologies is clear, and facial recognition systems are emerging as promising tools to address this issue. This document discusses the development and evaluation of a new Multifunctional Facial Recognition System (MFRS), designed specifically to assist older adults with cognitive impairments. The MFRS leverages face_recognition [1], a powerful open-source library capable of extracting, identifying, and manipulating facial features. Our system integrates the face recognition and retrieval capabilities of face_recognition, along with additional functionalities to capture images and record voice memos. This combination of features notably enhances the system's usability and versatility, making it a more user-friendly and universally applicable tool for end-users.

- **Summary**: Directional information measurement has many applications in domains such as robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and industrial computer vision. Conventional methods either require pre-calibration or necessitate controlled environments. The state-of-the-art MoireTag approach exploits the Moire effect and QR-design to continuously track the angular shift precisely. However, it is still not a fully QR code design. To overcome the above challenges, we propose a novel snapshot method for discrete angular measurement and tracking with scannable QR-design patterns that are generated by binary structures printed on both sides of a glass plate. The QR codes, resulting from the parallax effect due to the geometry alignment between two layers, can be readily measured as angular information using a phone camera. The simulation results show that the proposed non-contact object tracking framework is computationally efficient with high accuracy.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning for vision-language models, e.g., CoOp, has shown great success in adapting CLIP to different downstream tasks, making it a promising solution for federated learning due to computational reasons. Existing prompt learning techniques replace hand-crafted text prompts with learned vectors that offer improvements on seen classes, but struggle to generalize to unseen classes. Our work addresses this challenge by proposing Federated Text-driven Prompt Generation (FedTPG), which learns a unified prompt generation network across multiple remote clients in a scalable manner. The prompt generation network is conditioned on task-related text input, thus is context-aware, making it suitable to generalize for both seen and unseen classes. Our comprehensive empirical evaluations on nine diverse image classification datasets show that our method is superior to existing federated prompt learning methods, that achieve overall better generalization on both seen and unseen classes and is also generalizable to unseen datasets.

- **Summary**: Multi-task and multi-domain learning methods seek to learn multiple tasks/domains, jointly or one after another, using a single unified network. The key challenge and opportunity is to exploit shared information across tasks and domains to improve the efficiency of the unified network. The efficiency can be in terms of accuracy, storage cost, computation, or sample complexity. In this paper, we propose a factorized tensor network (FTN) that can achieve accuracy comparable to independent single-task/domain networks with a small number of additional parameters. FTN uses a frozen backbone network from a source model and incrementally adds task/domain-specific low-rank tensor factors to the shared frozen network. This approach can adapt to a large number of target domains and tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, FTN requires a significantly smaller number of task-specific parameters compared to existing methods. We performed experiments on widely used multi-domain and multi-task datasets. We show the experiments on convolutional-based architecture with different backbones and on transformer-based architecture. We observed that FTN achieves similar accuracy as single-task/domain methods while using only a fraction of additional parameters per task.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction plays a vital role in understanding pedestrian movement for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Current trajectory prediction models depend on long, complete, and accurately observed sequences from visual modalities. Nevertheless, real-world situations often involve obstructed cameras, missed objects, or objects out of sight due to environmental factors, leading to incomplete or noisy trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we propose LTrajDiff, a novel approach that treats objects obstructed or out of sight as equally important as those with fully visible trajectories. LTrajDiff utilizes sensor data from mobile phones to surmount out-of-sight constraints, albeit introducing new challenges such as modality fusion, noisy data, and the absence of spatial layout and object size information. We employ a denoising diffusion model to predict precise layout sequences from noisy mobile data using a coarse-to-fine diffusion strategy, incorporating the RMS, Siamese Masked Encoding Module, and MFM. Our model predicts layout sequences by implicitly inferring object size and projection status from a single reference timestamp or significantly obstructed sequences. Achieving SOTA results in randomly obstructed experiments and extremely short input experiments, our model illustrates the effectiveness of leveraging noisy mobile data. In summary, our approach offers a promising solution to the challenges faced by layout sequence and trajectory prediction models in real-world settings, paving the way for utilizing sensor data from mobile phones to accurately predict pedestrian bounding box trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses severely obstructed and extremely short layout sequences by combining vision with noisy mobile modality, making it the pioneering work in the field of layout sequence trajectory prediction.

- **Summary**: Chest X-ray is an essential diagnostic tool in the identification of chest diseases given its high sensitivity to pathological abnormalities in the lungs. However, image-driven diagnosis is still challenging due to heterogeneity in size and location of pathology, as well as visual similarities and co-occurrence of separate pathology. Since disease-related regions often occupy a relatively small portion of diagnostic images, classification models based on traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are adversely affected given their locality bias. While CNNs were previously augmented with attention maps or spatial masks to guide focus on potentially critical regions, learning localization guidance under heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of pathology is challenging. To improve multi-label classification performance, here we propose a novel method, HydraViT, that synergistically combines a transformer backbone with a multi-branch output module with learned weighting. The transformer backbone enhances sensitivity to long-range context in X-ray images, while using the self-attention mechanism to adaptively focus on task-critical regions. The multi-branch output module dedicates an independent branch to each disease label to attain robust learning across separate disease classes, along with an aggregated branch across labels to maintain sensitivity to co-occurrence relationships among pathology. Experiments demonstrate that, on average, HydraViT outperforms competing attention-guided methods by 1.2%, region-guided methods by 1.4%, and semantic-guided methods by 1.0% in multi-label classification performance.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised vision transformers (SSTs) have shown great potential to yield rich localization maps that highlight different objects in an image. However, these maps remain class-agnostic since the model is unsupervised. They often tend to decompose the image into multiple maps containing different objects while being unable to distinguish the object of interest from background noise objects. In this paper, Discriminative Pseudo-label Sampling (DiPS) is introduced to leverage these class-agnostic maps for weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL), where only image-class labels are available. Given multiple attention maps, DiPS relies on a pre-trained classifier to identify the most discriminative regions of each attention map. This ensures that the selected ROIs cover the correct image object while discarding the background ones, and, as such, provides a rich pool of diverse and discriminative proposals to cover different parts of the object. Subsequently, these proposals are used as pseudo-labels to train our new transformer-based WSOL model designed to perform classification and localization tasks. Unlike standard WSOL methods, DiPS optimizes performance in both tasks by using a transformer encoder and a dedicated output head for each task, each trained using dedicated loss functions. To avoid overfitting a single proposal and promote better object coverage, a single proposal is randomly selected among the top ones for a training image at each training step. Experimental results on the challenging CUB, ILSVRC, OpenImages, and TelDrone datasets indicate that our architecture, in combination with our transformer-based proposals, can yield better localization performance than state-of-the-art methods.

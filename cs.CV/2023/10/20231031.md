  2023 Workshop on Diffusion Models
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Diffusion models are a family of generative models that yield record-breaking performance in tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, and molecule design. Despite their capabilities, their efficiency, especially in the reverse denoising process, remains a challenge due to slow convergence rates and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce an approach that leverages continuous dynamical systems to design a novel denoising network for diffusion models that is more parameter-efficient, exhibits faster convergence, and demonstrates increased noise robustness. Experimenting with denoising probabilistic diffusion models, our framework operates with approximately a quarter of the parameters and 30% of the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) compared to standard U-Nets in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Furthermore, our model is up to 70% faster in inference than the baseline models when measured in equal conditions while converging to better quality solutions.

- **Summary**: The aim of this paper is the reconstruction of a smooth surface from an unorganized point cloud sampled by a closed surface, with the preservation of geometric shapes, without any further information other than the point cloud. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a promising approach to surface reconstruction. However, the reconstruction quality of existing methods relies on ground truth implicit function values or surface normal vectors. In this paper, we show that proper supervision of partial differential equations and fundamental properties of differential vector fields are sufficient to robustly reconstruct high-quality surfaces. We cast the $p$-Poisson equation to learn a signed distance function (SDF) and the reconstructed surface is implicitly represented by the zero-level set of the SDF. For efficient training, we develop a variable splitting structure by introducing a gradient of the SDF as an auxiliary variable and impose the $p$-Poisson equation directly on the auxiliary variable as a hard constraint. Based on the curl-free property of the gradient field, we impose a curl-free constraint on the auxiliary variable, which leads to a more faithful reconstruction. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that the proposed INR provides a superior and robust reconstruction. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Yebbi/PINC}.

- **Summary**: Denoising algorithms play a crucial role in medical image processing and analysis. However, classical denoising algorithms often ignore explanatory and critical medical features preservation, which may lead to misdiagnosis and legal liabilities.In this work, we propose a new denoising method for medical images that not only efficiently removes various types of noise, but also preserves key medical features throughout the process. To achieve this goal, we utilize a gradient-based eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach to design a feature preserving loss function. Our feature preserving loss function is motivated by the characteristic that gradient-based XAI is sensitive to noise. Through backpropagation, medical image features before and after denoising can be kept consistent. We conducted extensive experiments on three available medical image datasets, including synthesized 13 different types of noise and artifacts. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of denoising performance, model explainability, and generalization.

- **Summary**: In this study, we present a large-scale earth surface reconstruction pipeline for linear-array charge-coupled device (CCD) satellite imagery. While mainstream satellite image-based reconstruction approaches perform exceptionally well, the rational functional model (RFM) is subject to several limitations. For example, the RFM has no rigorous physical interpretation and differs significantly from the pinhole imaging model; hence, it cannot be directly applied to learning-based 3D reconstruction networks and to more novel reconstruction pipelines in computer vision. Hence, in this study, we introduce a method in which the RFM is equivalent to the pinhole camera model (PCM), meaning that the internal and external parameters of the pinhole camera are used instead of the rational polynomial coefficient parameters. We then derive an error formula for this equivalent pinhole model for the first time, demonstrating the influence of the image size on the accuracy of the reconstruction. In addition, we propose a polynomial image refinement model that minimizes equivalent errors via the least squares method. The experiments were conducted using four image datasets: WHU-TLC, DFC2019, ISPRS-ZY3, and GF7. The results demonstrated that the reconstruction accuracy was proportional to the image size. Our polynomial image refinement model significantly enhanced the accuracy and completeness of the reconstruction, and achieved more significant improvements for larger-scale images.

- **Summary**: In this report, we present our approach to the EPIC-KITCHENS VISOR Hand Object Segmentation Challenge, which focuses on the estimation of the relation between the hands and the objects given a single frame as input. The EPIC-KITCHENS VISOR dataset provides pixel-wise annotations and serves as a benchmark for hand and active object segmentation in egocentric video. Our approach combines the baseline method, i.e., Point-based Rendering (PointRend) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM), aiming to enhance the accuracy of hand and object segmentation outcomes, while also minimizing instances of missed detection. We leverage accurate hand segmentation maps obtained from the baseline method to extract more precise hand and in-contact object segments. We utilize the class-agnostic segmentation provided by SAM and apply specific hand-crafted constraints to enhance the results. In cases where the baseline model misses the detection of hands or objects, we re-train an object detector on the training set to enhance the detection accuracy. The detected hand and in-contact object bounding boxes are then used as prompts to extract their respective segments from the output of SAM. By effectively combining the strengths of existing methods and applying our refinements, our submission achieved the 1st place in terms of evaluation criteria in the VISOR HOS Challenge.

- **Summary**: Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) is a serious skin wound requiring specialized care. However, real DFU datasets are limited, hindering clinical training and research activities. In recent years, generative adversarial networks and diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating synthetic images with remarkable realism and diversity in many applications. This paper explores the potential of diffusion models for synthesizing DFU images and evaluates their authenticity through expert clinician assessments. Additionally, evaluation metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) are examined to assess the quality of the synthetic DFU images. A dataset of 2,000 DFU images is used for training the diffusion model, and the synthetic images are generated by applying diffusion processes. The results indicate that the diffusion model successfully synthesizes visually indistinguishable DFU images. 70% of the time, clinicians marked synthetic DFU images as real DFUs. However, clinicians demonstrate higher unanimous confidence in rating real images than synthetic ones. The study also reveals that FID and KID metrics do not significantly align with clinicians' assessments, suggesting alternative evaluation approaches are needed. The findings highlight the potential of diffusion models for generating synthetic DFU images and their impact on medical training programs and research in wound detection and classification.

- **Summary**: Visual question answering (VQA) is the task of answering questions about an image. The task assumes an understanding of both the image and the question to provide a natural language answer. VQA has gained popularity in recent years due to its potential applications in a wide range of fields, including robotics, education, and healthcare. In this paper, we focus on knowledge-augmented VQA, where answering the question requires commonsense knowledge, world knowledge, and reasoning about ideas and concepts not present in the image. We propose a multimodal framework that uses language guidance (LG) in the form of rationales, image captions, scene graphs, etc to answer questions more accurately. We benchmark our method on the multi-choice question-answering task of the A-OKVQA, Science-QA, VSR, and IconQA datasets using CLIP and BLIP models. We show that the use of language guidance is a simple but powerful and effective strategy for visual question answering. Our language guidance improves the performance of CLIP by 7.6% and BLIP-2 by 4.8% in the challenging A-OKVQA dataset. We also observe consistent improvement in performance on the Science-QA, VSR, and IconQA datasets when using the proposed language guidances. The implementation of LG-VQA is publicly available at https:// github.com/declare-lab/LG-VQA.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which pose a significant threat to their security and reliability in real-world applications. The most notable adversarial attacks are transfer-based attacks, where an adversary crafts an adversarial example to fool one model, which can also fool other models. While previous research has made progress in improving the transferability of untargeted adversarial examples, the generation of targeted adversarial examples that can transfer between models remains a challenging task. In this work, we present a novel approach to generate transferable targeted adversarial examples by exploiting the vulnerability of deep neural networks to perturbations on high-frequency components of images. We observe that replacing the high-frequency component of an image with that of another image can mislead deep models, motivating us to craft perturbations containing high-frequency information to achieve targeted attacks. To this end, we propose a method called Low-Frequency Adversarial Attack (\name), which trains a conditional generator to generate targeted adversarial perturbations that are then added to the low-frequency component of the image. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving targeted attack success rates by a margin from 3.2\% to 15.5\%.

- **Summary**: Several visual tasks, such as pedestrian detection and image-to-image translation, are challenging to accomplish in low light using RGB images. Heat variation of objects in thermal images can be used to overcome this. In this work, an end-to-end framework, which consists of a generative network and a detector network, is proposed to translate RGB image into Thermal ones and compare generated thermal images with real data. We have collected images from two different locations using the Parrot Anafi Thermal drone. After that, we created a two-stream network, preprocessed, augmented, the image data, and trained the generator and discriminator models from scratch. The findings demonstrate that it is feasible to translate RGB training data to thermal data using GAN. As a result, thermal data can now be produced more quickly and affordably, which is useful for security and surveillance applications.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recent camouflaged object detection (COD) attempts to segment objects visually blended into their surroundings, which is extremely complex and difficult in real-world scenarios. Apart from the high intrinsic similarity between camouflaged objects and their background, objects are usually diverse in scale, fuzzy in appearance, and even severely occluded. To this end, we propose an effective unified collaborative pyramid network which mimics human behavior when observing vague images and videos, \textit{i.e.}, zooming in and out. Specifically, our approach employs the zooming strategy to learn discriminative mixed-scale semantics by the multi-head scale integration and rich granularity perception units, which are designed to fully explore imperceptible clues between candidate objects and background surroundings. The former's intrinsic multi-head aggregation provides more diverse visual patterns. The latter's routing mechanism can effectively propagate inter-frame difference in spatiotemporal scenarios and adaptively ignore static representations. They provides a solid foundation for realizing a unified architecture for static and dynamic COD. Moreover, considering the uncertainty and ambiguity derived from indistinguishable textures, we construct a simple yet effective regularization, uncertainty awareness loss, to encourage predictions with higher confidence in candidate regions. Our highly task-friendly framework consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in image and video COD benchmarks. The code will be available at \url{https://github.com/lartpang/ZoomNeXt}.

- **Summary**: Underwater images often exhibit poor quality, imbalanced coloration, and low contrast due to the complex and intricate interaction of light, water, and objects. Despite the significant contributions of previous underwater enhancement techniques, there exist several problems that demand further improvement: (i) Current deep learning methodologies depend on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that lack multi-scale enhancement and also have limited global perception fields. (ii) The scarcity of paired real-world underwater datasets poses a considerable challenge, and the utilization of synthetic image pairs risks overfitting. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper presents a Multi-scale Transformer-based Network called UWFormer for enhancing images at multiple frequencies via semi-supervised learning, in which we propose a Nonlinear Frequency-aware Attention mechanism and a Multi-Scale Fusion Feed-forward Network for low-frequency enhancement. Additionally, we introduce a specialized underwater semi-supervised training strategy, proposing a Subaqueous Perceptual Loss function to generate reliable pseudo labels. Experiments using full-reference and non-reference underwater benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantity and visual quality.

- **Summary**: People with blindness and low vision (pBLV) encounter substantial challenges when it comes to comprehensive scene recognition and precise object identification in unfamiliar environments. Additionally, due to the vision loss, pBLV have difficulty in accessing and identifying potential tripping hazards on their own. In this paper, we present a pioneering approach that leverages a large vision-language model to enhance visual perception for pBLV, offering detailed and comprehensive descriptions of the surrounding environments and providing warnings about the potential risks. Our method begins by leveraging a large image tagging model (i.e., Recognize Anything (RAM)) to identify all common objects present in the captured images. The recognition results and user query are then integrated into a prompt, tailored specifically for pBLV using prompt engineering. By combining the prompt and input image, a large vision-language model (i.e., InstructBLIP) generates detailed and comprehensive descriptions of the environment and identifies potential risks in the environment by analyzing the environmental objects and scenes, relevant to the prompt. We evaluate our approach through experiments conducted on both indoor and outdoor datasets. Our results demonstrate that our method is able to recognize objects accurately and provide insightful descriptions and analysis of the environment for pBLV.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection in point clouds is important for autonomous driving systems. A primary challenge in 3D object detection stems from the sparse distribution of points within the 3D scene. Existing high-performance methods typically employ 3D sparse convolutional neural networks with small kernels to extract features. To reduce computational costs, these methods resort to submanifold sparse convolutions, which prevent the information exchange among spatially disconnected features. Some recent approaches have attempted to address this problem by introducing large-kernel convolutions or self-attention mechanisms, but they either achieve limited accuracy improvements or incur excessive computational costs. We propose HEDNet, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder-decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects. We conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open and nuScenes datasets. HEDNet achieved superior detection accuracy on both datasets than previous state-of-the-art methods with competitive efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/zhanggang001/HEDNet.



### Breathing Life into Faces: Speech-driven 3D Facial Animation with Natural Head Pose and Detailed Shape

- **Summary**: The creation of lifelike speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a natural and precise synchronization between audio input and facial expressions. However, existing works still fail to render shapes with flexible head poses and natural facial details (e.g., wrinkles). This limitation is mainly due to two aspects: 1) Collecting training set with detailed 3D facial shapes is highly expensive. This scarcity of detailed shape annotations hinders the training of models with expressive facial animation. 2) Compared to mouth movement, the head pose is much less correlated to speech content. Consequently, concurrent modeling of both mouth movement and head pose yields the lack of facial movement controllability. To address these challenges, we introduce VividTalker, a new framework designed to facilitate speech-driven 3D facial animation characterized by flexible head pose and natural facial details. Specifically, we explicitly disentangle facial animation into head pose and mouth movement and encode them separately into discrete latent spaces. Then, these attributes are generated through an autoregressive process leveraging a window-based Transformer architecture. To augment the richness of 3D facial animation, we construct a new 3D dataset with detailed shapes and learn to synthesize facial details in line with speech content. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that VividTalker outperforms state-of-the-art methods, resulting in vivid and realistic speech-driven 3D facial animation.

- **Summary**: Background and objective: CTA is a gold standard of preoperative diagnosis of abdominal aorta and typically used for geometric-only characteristic extraction. We assume that a model describing the dynamic behavior of the contrast agent in the vessel can be developed from the data of routine CTA studies, allowing the procedure to be investigated and optimized without the need for additional perfusion CT studies. Obtained spatial distribution of CA can be valuable for both increasing the diagnostic value of a particular study and improving the CT data processing tools. Methods: In accordance with the Beer-Lambert law and the absence of chemical interaction between blood and CA, we postulated the existence of a deterministic CA-induced component in the CT signal density. The proposed model, having a double-sigmoid structure, contains six coefficients relevant to the properties of hemodynamics. To validate the model, expert segmentation was performed using the 3D Slicer application for the CTA data obtained from publicly available source. The model was fitted to the data using the non-linear least square method with Levenberg-Marquardt optimization. Results: We analyzed 594 CTA images (4 studies with median size of 144 slices, IQR [134; 158.5]; 1:1 normal:pathology balance). Goodness-of-fit was proved by Wilcox test (p-value > 0.05 for all cases). The proposed model correctly simulated normal blood flow and hemodynamics disturbances caused by local abnormalities (aneurysm, thrombus and arterial branching). Conclusions: Proposed approach can be useful for personalized CA modeling of vessels, improvement of CTA image processing and preparation of synthetic CT training data for artificial intelligence.

- **Summary**: Creating believable motions for various characters has long been a goal in computer graphics. Current learning-based motion synthesis methods depend on extensive motion datasets, which are often challenging, if not impossible, to obtain. On the other hand, pose data is more accessible, since static posed characters are easier to create and can even be extracted from images using recent advancements in computer vision. In this paper, we utilize this alternative data source and introduce a neural motion synthesis approach through retargeting. Our method generates plausible motions for characters that have only pose data by transferring motion from an existing motion capture dataset of another character, which can have drastically different skeletons. Our experiments show that our method effectively combines the motion features of the source character with the pose features of the target character, and performs robustly with small or noisy pose data sets, ranging from a few artist-created poses to noisy poses estimated directly from images. Additionally, a conducted user study indicated that a majority of participants found our retargeted motion to be more enjoyable to watch, more lifelike in appearance, and exhibiting fewer artifacts.

- **Summary**: The application of ionizing radiation for diagnostic imaging is common around the globe. However, the process of imaging, itself, remains to be a relatively hazardous operation. Therefore, it is preferable to use as low a dose of ionizing radiation as possible, particularly in computed tomography (CT) imaging systems, where multiple x-ray operations are performed for the reconstruction of slices of body tissues. A popular method for radiation dose reduction in CT imaging is known as the quarter-dose technique, which reduces the x-ray dose but can cause a loss of image sharpness. Since CT image reconstruction from directional x-rays is a nonlinear process, it is analytically difficult to correct the effect of dose reduction on image quality. Recent and popular deep-learning approaches provide an intriguing possibility of image enhancement for low-dose artifacts. Some recent works propose combinations of multiple deep-learning and classical methods for this purpose, which over-complicate the process. However, it is observed here that the straight utilization of the well-known U-NET provides very successful results for the correction of low-dose artifacts. Blind tests with actual radiologists reveal that the U-NET enhanced quarter-dose CT images not only provide an immense visual improvement over the low-dose versions, but also become diagnostically preferable images, even when compared to their full-dose CT versions.

- **Summary**: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to build machine learning model that can continually learn new concepts from a few data samples, without forgetting knowledge of old classes.   The challenges of FSCIL lies in the limited data of new classes, which not only lead to significant overfitting issues but also exacerbates the notorious catastrophic forgetting problems. As proved in early studies, building sample relationships is beneficial for learning from few-shot samples. In this paper, we promote the idea to the incremental scenario, and propose a Sample-to-Class (S2C) graph learning method for FSCIL.   Specifically, we propose a Sample-level Graph Network (SGN) that focuses on analyzing sample relationships within a single session. This network helps aggregate similar samples, ultimately leading to the extraction of more refined class-level features.   Then, we present a Class-level Graph Network (CGN) that establishes connections across class-level features of both new and old classes. This network plays a crucial role in linking the knowledge between different sessions and helps improve overall learning in the FSCIL scenario. Moreover, we design a multi-stage strategy for training S2C model, which mitigates the training challenges posed by limited data in the incremental process.   The multi-stage training strategy is designed to build S2C graph from base to few-shot stages, and improve the capacity via an extra pseudo-incremental stage. Experiments on three popular benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms the baselines and sets new state-of-the-art results in FSCIL.

- **Summary**: In medical image segmentation, domain generalization poses a significant challenge due to domain shifts caused by variations in data acquisition devices and other factors. These shifts are particularly pronounced in the most common scenario, which involves only single-source domain data due to privacy concerns. To address this, we draw inspiration from the self-supervised learning paradigm that effectively discourages overfitting to the source domain. We propose the Denoising Y-Net (DeY-Net), a novel approach incorporating an auxiliary denoising decoder into the basic U-Net architecture. The auxiliary decoder aims to perform denoising training, augmenting the domain-invariant representation that facilitates domain generalization. Furthermore, this paradigm provides the potential to utilize unlabeled data. Building upon denoising training, we propose Denoising Test Time Adaptation (DeTTA) that further: (i) adapts the model to the target domain in a sample-wise manner, and (ii) adapts to the noise-corrupted input. Extensive experiments conducted on widely-adopted liver segmentation benchmarks demonstrate significant domain generalization improvements over our baseline and state-of-the-art results compared to other methods.

- **Summary**: We study a machine learning (ML) technique for refining images acquired during in situ observation using liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (LC-TEM). Our model is constructed using a U-Net architecture and a ResNet encoder. For training our ML model, we prepared an original image dataset that contained pairs of images of samples acquired with and without a solution present. The former images were used as noisy images and the latter images were used as corresponding ground truth images. The number of pairs of image sets was $1,204$ and the image sets included images acquired at several different magnifications and electron doses. The trained model converted a noisy image into a clear image. The time necessary for the conversion was on the order of 10ms, and we applied the model to in situ observations using the software Gatan DigitalMicrograph (DM). Even if a nanoparticle was not visible in a view window in the DM software because of the low electron dose, it was visible in a successive refined image generated by our ML model.

- **Summary**: Skin lesion segmentation plays a crucial role in the computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Deep Learning models have shown promise in accurately segmenting skin lesions, but their widespread adoption in real-life clinical settings is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In domains as critical as healthcare, interpretability is not merely a feature but a fundamental requirement for model adoption. This paper proposes IARS SegNet an advanced segmentation framework built upon the SegNet baseline model. Our approach incorporates three critical components: Skip connections, residual convolutions, and a global attention mechanism onto the baseline Segnet architecture. These elements play a pivotal role in accentuating the significance of clinically relevant regions, particularly the contours of skin lesions. The inclusion of skip connections enhances the model's capacity to learn intricate contour details, while the use of residual convolutions allows for the construction of a deeper model while preserving essential image features. The global attention mechanism further contributes by extracting refined feature maps from each convolutional and deconvolutional block, thereby elevating the model's interpretability. This enhancement highlights critical regions, fosters better understanding, and leads to more accurate skin lesion segmentation for melanoma diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Active learning, a label-efficient paradigm, empowers models to interactively query an oracle for labeling new data. In the realm of LiDAR semantic segmentation, the challenges stem from the sheer volume of point clouds, rendering annotation labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. This paper presents Annotator, a general and efficient active learning baseline, in which a voxel-centric online selection strategy is tailored to efficiently probe and annotate the salient and exemplar voxel girds within each LiDAR scan, even under distribution shift. Concretely, we first execute an in-depth analysis of several common selection strategies such as Random, Entropy, Margin, and then develop voxel confusion degree (VCD) to exploit the local topology relations and structures of point clouds. Annotator excels in diverse settings, with a particular focus on active learning (AL), active source-free domain adaptation (ASFDA), and active domain adaptation (ADA). It consistently delivers exceptional performance across LiDAR semantic segmentation benchmarks, spanning both simulation-to-real and real-to-real scenarios. Surprisingly, Annotator exhibits remarkable efficiency, requiring significantly fewer annotations, e.g., just labeling five voxels per scan in the SynLiDAR-to-SemanticKITTI task. This results in impressive performance, achieving 87.8% fully-supervised performance under AL, 88.5% under ASFDA, and 94.4% under ADA. We envision that Annotator will offer a simple, general, and efficient solution for label-efficient 3D applications. Project page: https://binhuixie.github.io/annotator-web

- **Summary**: Food security, a global concern, necessitates precise and diverse data-driven solutions to address its multifaceted challenges. This paper explores the integration of AI foundation models across various food security applications, leveraging distinct data types, to overcome the limitations of current deep and machine learning methods. Specifically, we investigate their utilization in crop type mapping, cropland mapping, field delineation and crop yield prediction. By capitalizing on multispectral imagery, meteorological data, soil properties, historical records, and high-resolution satellite imagery, AI foundation models offer a versatile approach. The study demonstrates that AI foundation models enhance food security initiatives by providing accurate predictions, improving resource allocation, and supporting informed decision-making. These models serve as a transformative force in addressing global food security limitations, marking a significant leap toward a sustainable and secure food future.

- **Summary**: When some application scenarios need to use semantic segmentation technology, like automatic driving, the primary concern comes to real-time performance rather than extremely high segmentation accuracy. To achieve a good trade-off between speed and accuracy, two-branch architecture has been proposed in recent years. It treats spatial information and semantics information separately which allows the model to be composed of two networks both not heavy. However, the process of fusing features with two different scales becomes a performance bottleneck for many nowaday two-branch models. In this research, we design a new fusion mechanism for two-branch architecture which is guided by attention computation. To be precise, we use the Dual-Guided Attention (DGA) module we proposed to replace some multi-scale transformations with the calculation of attention which means we only use several attention layers of near linear complexity to achieve performance comparable to frequently-used multi-layer fusion. To ensure that our module can be effective, we use Residual U-blocks (RSU) to build one of the two branches in our networks which aims to obtain better multi-scale features. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid dataset show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Styled Handwritten Text Generation (Styled HTG) is an important task in document analysis, aiming to generate text images with the handwriting of given reference images. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models for tackling this task. Being able to measure the performance of HTG models via a meaningful and representative criterion is key for fostering the development of this research topic. However, despite the current adoption of scores for natural image generation evaluation, assessing the quality of generated handwriting remains challenging. In light of this, we devise the Handwriting Distance (HWD), tailored for HTG evaluation. In particular, it works in the feature space of a network specifically trained to extract handwriting style features from the variable-lenght input images and exploits a perceptual distance to compare the subtle geometric features of handwriting. Through extensive experimental evaluation on different word-level and line-level datasets of handwritten text images, we demonstrate the suitability of the proposed HWD as a score for Styled HTG. The pretrained model used as backbone will be released to ease the adoption of the score, aiming to provide a valuable tool for evaluating HTG models and thus contributing to advancing this important research area.

- **Summary**: Widely-used LiDAR-based 3D object detectors often neglect fundamental geometric information readily available from the object proposals in their confidence estimation. This is mostly due to architectural design choices, which were often adopted from the 2D image domain, where geometric context is rarely available. In 3D, however, considering the object properties and its surroundings in a holistic way is important to distinguish between true and false positive detections, e.g. occluded pedestrians in a group. To address this, we present GACE, an intuitive and highly efficient method to improve the confidence estimation of a given black-box 3D object detector. We aggregate geometric cues of detections and their spatial relationships, which enables us to properly assess their plausibility and consequently, improve the confidence estimation. This leads to consistent performance gains over a variety of state-of-the-art detectors. Across all evaluated detectors, GACE proves to be especially beneficial for the vulnerable road user classes, i.e. pedestrians and cyclists.

- **Summary**: Current techniques face difficulties in generating motions from intricate semantic descriptions, primarily due to insufficient semantic annotations in datasets and weak contextual understanding. To address these issues, we present SemanticBoost, a novel framework that tackles both challenges simultaneously. Our framework comprises a Semantic Enhancement module and a Context-Attuned Motion Denoiser (CAMD). The Semantic Enhancement module extracts supplementary semantics from motion data, enriching the dataset's textual description and ensuring precise alignment between text and motion data without depending on large language models. On the other hand, the CAMD approach provides an all-encompassing solution for generating high-quality, semantically consistent motion sequences by effectively capturing context information and aligning the generated motion with the given textual descriptions. Distinct from existing methods, our approach can synthesize accurate orientational movements, combined motions based on specific body part descriptions, and motions generated from complex, extended sentences. Our experimental results demonstrate that SemanticBoost, as a diffusion-based method, outperforms auto-regressive-based techniques, achieving cutting-edge performance on the Humanml3D dataset while maintaining realistic and smooth motion generation quality.

- **Summary**: Capturing screen contents by smartphone cameras has become a common way for information sharing. However, these images and videos are often degraded by moir\'e patterns, which are caused by frequency aliasing between the camera filter array and digital display grids. We observe that the moir\'e patterns in raw domain is simpler than those in sRGB domain, and the moir\'e patterns in raw color channels have different properties. Therefore, we propose an image and video demoir\'eing network tailored for raw inputs. We introduce a color-separated feature branch, and it is fused with the traditional feature-mixed branch via channel and spatial modulations. Specifically, the channel modulation utilizes modulated color-separated features to enhance the color-mixed features. The spatial modulation utilizes the feature with large receptive field to modulate the feature with small receptive field. In addition, we build the first well-aligned raw video demoir\'eing (RawVDemoir\'e) dataset and propose an efficient temporal alignment method by inserting alternating patterns. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for both image and video demori\'eing. We have released the code and dataset in https://github.com/tju-chengyijia/VD_raw.

- **Summary**: With the advent of large-scale pre-trained models, interest in adapting and exploiting them for continual learning scenarios has grown.   In this paper, we propose an approach to exploiting pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) that enables further adaptation instead of only using zero-shot learning of new tasks. We augment a pre-trained CLIP model with additional layers after the Image Encoder or before the Text Encoder. We investigate three different strategies: a Linear Adapter, a Self-attention Adapter, each operating on the image embedding, and Prompt Tuning which instead modifies prompts input to the CLIP text encoder. We also propose a method for parameter retention in the adapter layers that uses a measure of parameter importance to better maintain stability and plasticity during incremental learning. Our experiments demonstrate that the simplest solution -- a single Linear Adapter layer with parameter retention -- produces the best results. Experiments on several conventional benchmarks consistently show a significant margin of improvement over the current state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: We present a highly compact run-time monitoring approach for deep computer vision networks that extracts selected knowledge from only a few (down to merely two) hidden layers, yet can efficiently detect silent data corruption originating from both hardware memory and input faults. Building on the insight that critical faults typically manifest as peak or bulk shifts in the activation distribution of the affected network layers, we use strategically placed quantile markers to make accurate estimates about the anomaly of the current inference as a whole. Importantly, the detector component itself is kept algorithmically transparent to render the categorization of regular and abnormal behavior interpretable to a human. Our technique achieves up to ~96% precision and ~98% recall of detection. Compared to state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, this approach requires minimal compute overhead (as little as 0.3% with respect to non-supervised inference time) and contributes to the explainability of the model.

- **Summary**: Grasping objects with limited or no prior knowledge about them is a highly relevant skill in assistive robotics. Still, in this general setting, it has remained an open problem, especially when it comes to only partial observability and versatile grasping with multi-fingered hands. We present a novel, fast, and high fidelity deep learning pipeline consisting of a shape completion module that is based on a single depth image, and followed by a grasp predictor that is based on the predicted object shape. The shape completion network is based on VQDIF and predicts spatial occupancy values at arbitrary query points. As grasp predictor, we use our two-stage architecture that first generates hand poses using an autoregressive model and then regresses finger joint configurations per pose. Critical factors turn out to be sufficient data realism and augmentation, as well as special attention to difficult cases during training. Experiments on a physical robot platform demonstrate successful grasping of a wide range of household objects based on a depth image from a single viewpoint. The whole pipeline is fast, taking only about 1 s for completing the object's shape (0.7 s) and generating 1000 grasps (0.3 s).

- **Summary**: Muscle volume is a useful quantitative biomarker in sports, but also for the follow-up of degenerative musculo-skelletal diseases. In addition to volume, other shape biomarkers can be extracted by segmenting the muscles of interest from medical images. Manual segmentation is still today the gold standard for such measurements despite being very time-consuming. We propose a method for automatic segmentation of 18 muscles of the lower limb on 3D Magnetic Resonance Images to assist such morphometric analysis. By their nature, the tissue of different muscles is undistinguishable when observed in MR Images. Thus, muscle segmentation algorithms cannot rely on appearance but only on contour cues. However, such contours are hard to detect and their thickness varies across subjects. To cope with the above challenges, we propose a segmentation approach based on a hybrid architecture, combining convolutional and visual transformer blocks. We investigate for the first time the behaviour of such hybrid architectures in the context of muscle segmentation for shape analysis. Considering the consistent anatomical muscle configuration, we rely on transformer blocks to capture the longrange relations between the muscles. To further exploit the anatomical priors, a second contribution of this work consists in adding a regularisation loss based on an adjacency matrix of plausible muscle neighbourhoods estimated from the training data. Our experimental results on a unique database of elite athletes show it is possible to train complex hybrid models from a relatively small database of large volumes, while the anatomical prior regularisation favours better predictions.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4V's capabilities across diverse medical imaging tasks, including Radiology Report Generation, Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Visual Grounding. While prior efforts have explored GPT-4V's performance in medical imaging, to the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first quantitative evaluation on publicly available benchmarks. Our findings highlight GPT-4V's potential in generating descriptive reports for chest X-ray images, particularly when guided by well-structured prompts. However, its performance on the MIMIC-CXR dataset benchmark reveals areas for improvement in certain evaluation metrics, such as CIDEr. In the domain of Medical VQA, GPT-4V demonstrates proficiency in distinguishing between question types but falls short of prevailing benchmarks in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, our analysis finds the limitations of conventional evaluation metrics like the BLEU score, advocating for the development of more semantically robust assessment methods. In the field of Visual Grounding, GPT-4V exhibits preliminary promise in recognizing bounding boxes, but its precision is lacking, especially in identifying specific medical organs and signs. Our evaluation underscores the significant potential of GPT-4V in the medical imaging domain, while also emphasizing the need for targeted refinements to fully unlock its capabilities.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (DT-CMR) is the only in vivo method to non-invasively examine the microstructure of the human heart. Current research in DT-CMR aims to improve the understanding of how the cardiac microstructure relates to the macroscopic function of the healthy heart as well as how microstructural dysfunction contributes to disease. To get the final DT-CMR metrics, we need to acquire diffusion weighted images of at least 6 directions. However, due to DWI's low signal-to-noise ratio, the standard voxel size is quite big on the scale for microstructures. In this study, we explored the potential of deep-learning-based methods in improving the image quality volumetrically (x4 in all dimensions). This study proposed a novel framework to enable volumetric super-resolution, with an additional model input of high-resolution b0 DWI. We demonstrated that the additional input could offer higher super-resolved image quality. Going beyond, the model is also able to super-resolve DWIs of unseen b-values, proving the model framework's generalizability for cardiac DWI superresolution. In conclusion, we would then recommend giving the model a high-resolution reference image as an additional input to the low-resolution image for training and inference to guide all super-resolution frameworks for parametric imaging where a reference image is available.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a thermal-infrared (TIR) remote target detection system for maritime rescue using deep learning and data augmentation. We established a self-collected TIR dataset consisting of multiple scenes imitating human rescue situations using a TIR camera (FLIR). Additionally, to address dataset scarcity and improve model robustness, a synthetic dataset from a 3D game (ARMA3) to augment the data is further collected. However, a significant domain gap exists between synthetic TIR and real TIR images. Hence, a proper domain adaptation algorithm is essential to overcome the gap. Therefore, we suggest a domain adaptation algorithm in a target-background separated manner from 3D game-to-real, based on a generative model, to address this issue. Furthermore, a segmentation network with fixed-weight kernels at the head is proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and provide weak attention, as remote TIR targets inherently suffer from unclear boundaries. Experiment results reveal that the network trained on augmented data consisting of translated synthetic and real TIR data outperforms that trained on only real TIR data by a large margin. Furthermore, the proposed segmentation model surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning in digital pathology brings intelligence and automation as substantial enhancements to pathological analysis, the gold standard of clinical diagnosis. However, multiple steps from tissue preparation to slide imaging introduce various image corruptions, making it difficult for deep neural network (DNN) models to achieve stable diagnostic results for clinical use. In order to assess and further enhance the robustness of the models, we analyze the physical causes of the full-stack corruptions throughout the pathological life-cycle and propose an Omni-Corruption Emulation (OmniCE) method to reproduce 21 types of corruptions quantified with 5-level severity. We then construct three OmniCE-corrupted benchmark datasets at both patch level and slide level and assess the robustness of popular DNNs in classification and segmentation tasks. Further, we explore to use the OmniCE-corrupted datasets as augmentation data for training and experiments to verify that the generalization ability of the models has been significantly enhanced.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present SignAvatars, the first large-scale multi-prompt 3D sign language (SL) motion dataset designed to bridge the communication gap for hearing-impaired individuals. While there has been an exponentially growing number of research regarding digital communication, the majority of existing communication technologies primarily cater to spoken or written languages, instead of SL, the essential communication method for hearing-impaired communities. Existing SL datasets, dictionaries, and sign language production (SLP) methods are typically limited to 2D as the annotating 3D models and avatars for SL is usually an entirely manual and labor-intensive process conducted by SL experts, often resulting in unnatural avatars. In response to these challenges, we compile and curate the SignAvatars dataset, which comprises 70,000 videos from 153 signers, totaling 8.34 million frames, covering both isolated signs and continuous, co-articulated signs, with multiple prompts including HamNoSys, spoken language, and words. To yield 3D holistic annotations, including meshes and biomechanically-valid poses of body, hands, and face, as well as 2D and 3D keypoints, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline operating on our large corpus of SL videos. SignAvatars facilitates various tasks such as 3D sign language recognition (SLR) and the novel 3D SL production (SLP) from diverse inputs like text scripts, individual words, and HamNoSys notation. Hence, to evaluate the potential of SignAvatars, we further propose a unified benchmark of 3D SL holistic motion production. We believe that this work is a significant step forward towards bringing the digital world to the hearing-impaired communities. Our project page is at https://signavatars.github.io/

- **Summary**: Existing machine learning research has achieved promising results in monaural audio-visual separation (MAVS). However, most MAVS methods purely consider what the sound source is, not where it is located. This can be a problem in VR/AR scenarios, where listeners need to be able to distinguish between similar audio sources located in different directions. To address this limitation, we have generalized MAVS to spatial audio separation and proposed LAVSS: a location-guided audio-visual spatial audio separator. LAVSS is inspired by the correlation between spatial audio and visual location. We introduce the phase difference carried by binaural audio as spatial cues, and we utilize positional representations of sounding objects as additional modality guidance. We also leverage multi-level cross-modal attention to perform visual-positional collaboration with audio features. In addition, we adopt a pre-trained monaural separator to transfer knowledge from rich mono sounds to boost spatial audio separation. This exploits the correlation between monaural and binaural channels. Experiments on the FAIR-Play dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LAVSS over existing benchmarks of audio-visual separation. Our project page: https://yyx666660.github.io/LAVSS/.

- **Summary**: Real-world data is extremely imbalanced and presents a long-tailed distribution, resulting in models that are biased towards classes with sufficient samples and perform poorly on rare classes. Recent methods propose to rebalance classes but they undertake the seesaw dilemma (what is increasing performance on tail classes may decrease that of head classes, and vice versa). In this paper, we argue that the seesaw dilemma is derived from gradient imbalance of different classes, in which gradients of inappropriate classes are set to important for updating, thus are prone to overcompensation or undercompensation on tail classes. To achieve ideal compensation, we formulate the long-tailed recognition as an multi-objective optimization problem, which fairly respects the contributions of head and tail classes simultaneously. For efficiency, we propose a Gradient-Balancing Grouping (GBG) strategy to gather the classes with similar gradient directions, thus approximately make every update under a Pareto descent direction. Our GBG method drives classes with similar gradient directions to form more representative gradient and provide ideal compensation to the tail classes. Moreover, We conduct extensive experiments on commonly used benchmarks in long-tailed learning and demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal models demonstrate remarkable generalist ability to perform diverse multimodal tasks in a zero-shot manner. Large-scale web-based image-text pairs contribute fundamentally to this success, but suffer from excessive noise. Recent studies use alternative captions synthesized by captioning models and have achieved notable benchmark performance. However, our experiments reveal significant Scalability Deficiency and World Knowledge Loss issues in models trained with synthetic captions, which have been largely obscured by their initial benchmark success. Upon closer examination, we identify the root cause as the overly-simplified language structure and lack of knowledge details in existing synthetic captions. To provide higher-quality and more scalable multimodal pretraining data, we propose CapsFusion, an advanced framework that leverages large language models to consolidate and refine information from both web-based image-text pairs and synthetic captions. Extensive experiments show that CapsFusion captions exhibit remarkable all-round superiority over existing captions in terms of model performance (e.g., 18.8 and 18.3 improvements in CIDEr score on COCO and NoCaps), sample efficiency (requiring 11-16 times less computation than baselines), world knowledge depth, and scalability. These effectiveness, efficiency and scalability advantages position CapsFusion as a promising candidate for future scaling of LMM training.

- **Summary**: Forecasting motion and spatial positions of objects is of fundamental importance, especially in safety-critical settings such as autonomous driving. In this work, we address the issue by forecasting two different modalities that carry complementary information, namely optical flow and depth. To this end we propose FLODCAST a flow and depth forecasting model that leverages a multitask recurrent architecture, trained to jointly forecast both modalities at once. We stress the importance of training using flows and depth maps together, demonstrating that both tasks improve when the model is informed of the other modality. We train the proposed model to also perform predictions for several timesteps in the future. This provides better supervision and leads to more precise predictions, retaining the capability of the model to yield outputs autoregressively for any future time horizon. We test our model on the challenging Cityscapes dataset, obtaining state of the art results for both flow and depth forecasting. Thanks to the high quality of the generated flows, we also report benefits on the downstream task of segmentation forecasting, injecting our predictions in a flow-based mask-warping framework.

- **Summary**: In natural vision, feedback connections support versatile visual inference capabilities such as making sense of the occluded or noisy bottom-up sensory information or mediating pure top-down processes such as imagination. However, the mechanisms by which the feedback pathway learns to give rise to these capabilities flexibly are not clear. We propose that top-down effects emerge through alignment between feedforward and feedback pathways, each optimizing its own objectives. To achieve this co-optimization, we introduce Feedback-Feedforward Alignment (FFA), a learning algorithm that leverages feedback and feedforward pathways as mutual credit assignment computational graphs, enabling alignment. In our study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FFA in co-optimizing classification and reconstruction tasks on widely used MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Notably, the alignment mechanism in FFA endows feedback connections with emergent visual inference functions, including denoising, resolving occlusions, hallucination, and imagination. Moreover, FFA offers bio-plausibility compared to traditional backpropagation (BP) methods in implementation. By repurposing the computational graph of credit assignment into a goal-driven feedback pathway, FFA alleviates weight transport problems encountered in BP, enhancing the bio-plausibility of the learning algorithm. Our study presents FFA as a promising proof-of-concept for the mechanisms underlying how feedback connections in the visual cortex support flexible visual functions. This work also contributes to the broader field of visual inference underlying perceptual phenomena and has implications for developing more biologically inspired learning algorithms.

- **Summary**: In the field of radiotherapy, accurate imaging and image registration are of utmost importance for precise treatment planning. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers detailed imaging without being invasive and excels in soft-tissue contrast, making it a preferred modality for radiotherapy planning. However, the high cost of MRI, longer acquisition time, and certain health considerations for patients pose challenges. Conversely, Computed Tomography (CT) scans offer a quicker and less expensive imaging solution. To bridge these modalities and address multimodal alignment challenges, we introduce an approach for enhanced monomodal registration using synthetic MRI images. Utilizing unpaired data, this paper proposes a novel method to produce these synthetic MRI images from CT scans, leveraging CycleGANs and feature extractors. By building upon the foundational work on Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks and incorporating advancements from related literature, our methodology shows promising results, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The efficacy of our approach is validated by multiple comparison metrics.

- **Summary**: Pathological captioning of Whole Slide Images (WSIs), though is essential in computer-aided pathological diagnosis, has rarely been studied due to the limitations in datasets and model training efficacy. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm Subtype-guided Masked Transformer (SGMT) for pathological captioning based on Transformers, which treats a WSI as a sequence of sparse patches and generates an overall caption sentence from the sequence. An accompanying subtype prediction is introduced into SGMT to guide the training process and enhance the captioning accuracy. We also present an Asymmetric Masked Mechansim approach to tackle the large size constraint of pathological image captioning, where the numbers of sequencing patches in SGMT are sampled differently in the training and inferring phases, respectively. Experiments on the PatchGastricADC22 dataset demonstrate that our approach effectively adapts to the task with a transformer-based model and achieves superior performance than traditional RNN-based methods. Our codes are to be made available for further research and development.

- **Summary**: Despite its wide use in medicine, ultrasound imaging faces several challenges related to its poor signal-to-noise ratio and several sources of noise and artefacts. Enhancing ultrasound image quality involves balancing concurrent factors like contrast, resolution, and speckle preservation. In recent years, there has been progress both in model-based and learning-based approaches to improve ultrasound image reconstruction. Bringing the best from both worlds, we propose a hybrid approach leveraging advances in diffusion models. To this end, we adapt Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) to incorporate ultrasound physics through a linear direct model and an unsupervised fine-tuning of the prior diffusion model. We conduct comprehensive experiments on simulated, in-vitro, and in-vivo data, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in achieving high-quality image reconstructions from a single plane wave input and in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, given the stochastic nature of the method, we analyse in depth the statistical properties of single and multiple-sample reconstructions, experimentally show the informativeness of their variance, and provide an empirical model relating this behaviour to speckle noise. The code and data are available at: (upon acceptance).

- **Summary**: The ever-increasing use of synthetically generated content in different sectors of our everyday life, one for all media information, poses a strong need for deepfake detection tools in order to avoid the proliferation of altered messages. The process to identify manipulated content, in particular images and videos, is basically performed by looking for the presence of some inconsistencies and/or anomalies specifically due to the fake generation process. Different techniques exist in the scientific literature that exploit diverse ad-hoc features in order to highlight possible modifications. In this paper, we propose to investigate how deepfake creation can impact on the characteristics that the whole scene had at the time of the acquisition. In particular, when an image (video) is captured the overall geometry of the scene (e.g. surfaces) and the acquisition process (e.g. illumination) determine a univocal environment that is directly represented by the image pixel values; all these intrinsic relations are possibly changed by the deepfake generation process. By resorting to the analysis of the characteristics of the surfaces depicted in the image it is possible to obtain a descriptor usable to train a CNN for deepfake detection: we refer to such an approach as SurFake. Experimental results carried out on the FF++ dataset for different kinds of deepfake forgeries and diverse deep learning models confirm that such a feature can be adopted to discriminate between pristine and altered images; furthermore, experiments witness that it can also be combined with visual data to provide a certain improvement in terms of detection accuracy.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) necessitates the need to robustly evaluate these models. Among the established evaluation criteria, the Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) has been widely adopted due to its conceptual simplicity, fast computation time, and strong correlation with human perception. However, FID has inherent limitations, mainly stemming from its assumption that feature embeddings follow a Gaussian distribution, and therefore can be defined by their first two moments. As this does not hold in practice, in this paper we explore the importance of third-moments in image feature data and use this information to define a new measure, which we call the Skew Inception Distance (SID). We prove that SID is a pseudometric on probability distributions, show how it extends FID, and present a practical method for its computation. Our numerical experiments support that SID either tracks with FID or, in some cases, aligns more closely with human perception when evaluating image features of ImageNet data.

- **Summary**: Histopathological images are essential for medical diagnosis and treatment planning, but interpreting them accurately using machine learning can be challenging due to variations in tissue preparation, staining and imaging protocols. Domain generalization aims to address such limitations by enabling the learning models to generalize to new datasets or populations. Style transfer-based data augmentation is an emerging technique that can be used to improve the generalizability of machine learning models for histopathological images. However, existing style transfer-based methods can be computationally expensive, and they rely on artistic styles, which can negatively impact model accuracy. In this study, we propose a feature domain style mixing technique that uses adaptive instance normalization to generate style-augmented versions of images. We compare our proposed method with existing style transfer-based data augmentation methods and found that it performs similarly or better, despite requiring less computation and time. Our results demonstrate the potential of feature domain statistics mixing in the generalization of learning models for histopathological image analysis.

- **Summary**: DNNs trained on natural clean samples have been shown to perform poorly on corrupted samples, such as noisy or blurry images. Various data augmentation methods have been recently proposed to improve DNN's robustness against common corruptions. Despite their success, they require computationally expensive training and cannot be applied to off-the-shelf trained models. Recently, it has been shown that updating BatchNorm (BN) statistics of an off-the-shelf model on a single corruption improves its accuracy on that corruption significantly. However, adopting the idea at inference time when the type of corruption is unknown and changing decreases the effectiveness of this method. In this paper, we harness the Fourier domain to detect the corruption type, a challenging task in the image domain. We propose a unified framework consisting of a corruption-detection model and BN statistics update that improves the corruption accuracy of any off-the-shelf trained model. We benchmark our framework on different models and datasets. Our results demonstrate about 8% and 4% accuracy improvement on CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-C, respectively. Furthermore, our framework can further improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art robust models, such as AugMix and DeepAug.

- **Summary**: Conditional Imitation learning is a common and effective approach to train autonomous driving agents. However, two issues limit the full potential of this approach: (i) the inertia problem, a special case of causal confusion where the agent mistakenly correlates low speed with no acceleration, and (ii) low correlation between offline and online performance due to the accumulation of small errors that brings the agent in a previously unseen state. Both issues are critical for state-aware models, yet informing the driving agent of its internal state as well as the state of the environment is of crucial importance. In this paper we propose a multi-task learning agent based on a multi-stage vision transformer with state token propagation. We feed the state of the vehicle along with the representation of the environment as a special token of the transformer and propagate it throughout the network. This allows us to tackle the aforementioned issues from different angles: guiding the driving policy with learned stop/go information, performing data augmentation directly on the state of the vehicle and visually explaining the model's decisions. We report a drastic decrease in inertia and a high correlation between offline and online metrics.

- **Summary**: Human-robot walking with prosthetic legs and exoskeletons, especially over complex terrains such as stairs, remains a significant challenge. Egocentric vision has the unique potential to detect the walking environment prior to physical interactions, which can improve transitions to and from stairs. This motivated us to create the StairNet initiative to support the development of new deep learning models for visual sensing and recognition of stairs, with an emphasis on lightweight and efficient neural networks for onboard real-time inference. In this study, we present an overview of the development of our large-scale dataset with over 515,000 manually labeled images, as well as our development of different deep learning models (e.g., 2D and 3D CNN, hybrid CNN and LSTM, and ViT networks) and training methods (e.g., supervised learning with temporal data and semi-supervised learning with unlabeled images) using our new dataset. We consistently achieved high classification accuracy (i.e., up to 98.8%) with different designs, offering trade-offs between model accuracy and size. When deployed on mobile devices with GPU and NPU accelerators, our deep learning models achieved inference speeds up to 2.8 ms. We also deployed our models on custom-designed CPU-powered smart glasses. However, limitations in the embedded hardware yielded slower inference speeds of 1.5 seconds, presenting a trade-off between human-centered design and performance. Overall, we showed that StairNet can be an effective platform to develop and study new visual perception systems for human-robot locomotion with applications in exoskeleton and prosthetic leg control.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) rely on volume rendering to synthesize novel views. Volume rendering requires evaluating an integral along each ray, which is numerically approximated with a finite sum that corresponds to the exact integral along the ray under piecewise constant volume density. As a consequence, the rendered result is unstable w.r.t. the choice of samples along the ray, a phenomenon that we dub quadrature instability. We propose a mathematically principled solution by reformulating the sample-based rendering equation so that it corresponds to the exact integral under piecewise linear volume density. This simultaneously resolves multiple issues: conflicts between samples along different rays, imprecise hierarchical sampling, and non-differentiability of quantiles of ray termination distances w.r.t. model parameters. We demonstrate several benefits over the classical sample-based rendering equation, such as sharper textures, better geometric reconstruction, and stronger depth supervision. Our proposed formulation can be also be used as a drop-in replacement to the volume rendering equation of existing NeRF-based methods. Our project page can be found at pl-nerf.github.io.

- **Summary**: Model pre-training is essential in human-centric perception. In this paper, we first introduce masked image modeling (MIM) as a pre-training approach for this task. Upon revisiting the MIM training strategy, we reveal that human structure priors offer significant potential. Motivated by this insight, we further incorporate an intuitive human structure prior - human parts - into pre-training. Specifically, we employ this prior to guide the mask sampling process. Image patches, corresponding to human part regions, have high priority to be masked out. This encourages the model to concentrate more on body structure information during pre-training, yielding substantial benefits across a range of human-centric perception tasks. To further capture human characteristics, we propose a structure-invariant alignment loss that enforces different masked views, guided by the human part prior, to be closely aligned for the same image. We term the entire method as HAP. HAP simply uses a plain ViT as the encoder yet establishes new state-of-the-art performance on 11 human-centric benchmarks, and on-par result on one dataset. For example, HAP achieves 78.1% mAP on MSMT17 for person re-identification, 86.54% mA on PA-100K for pedestrian attribute recognition, 78.2% AP on MS COCO for 2D pose estimation, and 56.0 PA-MPJPE on 3DPW for 3D pose and shape estimation.

- **Summary**: Recently video generation has achieved substantial progress with realistic results. Nevertheless, existing AI-generated videos are usually very short clips ("shot-level") depicting a single scene. To deliver a coherent long video ("story-level"), it is desirable to have creative transition and prediction effects across different clips. This paper presents a short-to-long video diffusion model, SEINE, that focuses on generative transition and prediction. The goal is to generate high-quality long videos with smooth and creative transitions between scenes and varying lengths of shot-level videos. Specifically, we propose a random-mask video diffusion model to automatically generate transitions based on textual descriptions. By providing the images of different scenes as inputs, combined with text-based control, our model generates transition videos that ensure coherence and visual quality. Furthermore, the model can be readily extended to various tasks such as image-to-video animation and autoregressive video prediction. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this new generative task, we propose three assessing criteria for smooth and creative transition: temporal consistency, semantic similarity, and video-text semantic alignment. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods for generative transition and prediction, enabling the creation of story-level long videos.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become ubiquitous in computer vision. Despite their success, ViTs lack inductive biases, which can make it difficult to train them with limited data. To address this challenge, prior studies suggest training ViTs with self-supervised learning (SSL) and fine-tuning sequentially. However, we observe that jointly optimizing ViTs for the primary task and a Self-Supervised Auxiliary Task (SSAT) is surprisingly beneficial when the amount of training data is limited. We explore the appropriate SSL tasks that can be optimized alongside the primary task, the training schemes for these tasks, and the data scale at which they can be most effective. Our findings reveal that SSAT is a powerful technique that enables ViTs to leverage the unique characteristics of both the self-supervised and primary tasks, achieving better performance than typical ViTs pre-training with SSL and fine-tuning sequentially. Our experiments, conducted on 10 datasets, demonstrate that SSAT significantly improves ViT performance while reducing carbon footprint. We also confirm the effectiveness of SSAT in the video domain for deepfake detection, showcasing its generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/dominickrei/Limited-data-vits.

- **Summary**: Person search (PS) is a challenging computer vision problem where the objective is to achieve joint optimization for pedestrian detection and re-identification (ReID). Although previous advancements have shown promising performance in the field under fully and weakly supervised learning fashion, there exists a major gap in investigating the domain adaptation ability of PS models. In this paper, we propose a diligent domain adaptive mixer (DDAM) for person search (DDAP-PS) framework that aims to bridge a gap to improve knowledge transfer from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Specifically, we introduce a novel DDAM module that generates moderate mixed-domain representations by combining source and target domain representations. The proposed DDAM module encourages domain mixing to minimize the distance between the two extreme domains, thereby enhancing the ReID task. To achieve this, we introduce two bridge losses and a disparity loss. The objective of the two bridge losses is to guide the moderate mixed-domain representations to maintain an appropriate distance from both the source and target domain representations. The disparity loss aims to prevent the moderate mixed-domain representations from being biased towards either the source or target domains, thereby avoiding overfitting. Furthermore, we address the conflict between the two subtasks, localization and ReID, during domain adaptation. To handle this cross-task conflict, we forcefully decouple the norm-aware embedding, which aids in better learning of the moderate mixed-domain representation. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our approach demonstrates favorable performance on the challenging PRW and CUHK-SYSU datasets.

- **Summary**: Fourier PlenOctrees have shown to be an efficient representation for real-time rendering of dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Despite its many advantages, this method suffers from artifacts introduced by the involved compression when combining it with recent state-of-the-art techniques for training the static per-frame NeRF models. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of these artifacts and leverage the resulting insights to propose an improved representation. In particular, we present a novel density encoding that adapts the Fourier-based compression to the characteristics of the transfer function used by the underlying volume rendering procedure and leads to a substantial reduction of artifacts in the dynamic model. Furthermore, we show an augmentation of the training data that relaxes the periodicity assumption of the compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our enhanced Fourier PlenOctrees in the scope of quantitative and qualitative evaluations on synthetic and real-world scenes.

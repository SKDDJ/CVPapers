- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a style-based conditional video generative model. We introduce a novel temporal generator based on a set of learned sinusoidal bases. Our method learns dynamic representations of various actions that are independent of image content and can be transferred between different actors. Beyond the significant enhancement of video quality compared to prevalent methods, we demonstrate that the disentangled dynamic and content permit their independent manipulation, as well as temporal GAN-inversion to retrieve and transfer a video motion from one content or identity to another without further preprocessing such as landmark points.

- **Summary**: Recent works have demonstrated the importance of object completion in 3D Perception from Lidar signal. Several methods have been proposed in which modules were used to densify the point clouds produced by laser scanners, leading to better recall and more accurate results. Pursuing in that direction, we present, in this work, a counter-intuitive perspective: the widely-used full-shape completion approach actually leads to a higher error-upper bound especially for far away objects and small objects like pedestrians. Based on this observation, we introduce a visible part completion method that requires only 11.3\% of the prediction points that previous methods generate. To recover the dense representation, we propose a mesh-deformation-based method to augment the point set associated with visible foreground objects. Considering that our approach focuses only on the visible part of the foreground objects to achieve accurate 3D detection, we named our method What You See Is What You Detect (WYSIWYD). Our proposed method is thus a detector-independent model that consists of 2 parts: an Intra-Frustum Segmentation Transformer (IFST) and a Mesh Depth Completion Network(MDCNet) that predicts the foreground depth from mesh deformation. This way, our model does not require the time-consuming full-depth completion task used by most pseudo-lidar-based methods. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach can provide up to 12.2\% performance improvements over most of the public baseline models on the KITTI and NuScenes dataset bringing the state-of-the-art to a new level.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised representation learning for image clustering is essential in computer vision. Although the advancement of visual models has improved image clustering with efficient visual representations, challenges still remain. Firstly, these features often lack the ability to represent the internal structure of images, hindering the accurate clustering of visually similar images. Secondly, the existing features tend to lack finer-grained semantic labels, limiting the ability to capture nuanced differences and similarities between images.   In this paper, we first introduce Jigsaw based strategy method for image clustering called Grid Jigsaw Representation (GJR) with systematic exposition from pixel to feature in discrepancy against human and computer. We emphasize that this algorithm, which mimics human jigsaw puzzle, can effectively improve the model to distinguish the spatial feature between different samples and enhance the clustering ability. GJR modules are appended to a variety of deep convolutional networks and tested with significant improvements on a wide range of benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100/20, STL-10, ImageNet-10 and ImageNetDog-15.   On the other hand, convergence efficiency is always an important challenge for unsupervised image clustering. Recently, pretrained representation learning has made great progress and released models can extract mature visual representations. It is obvious that use the pretrained model as feature extractor can speed up the convergence of clustering where our aim is to provide new perspective in image clustering with reasonable resource application and provide new baseline. Further, we innovate pretrain-based Grid Jigsaw Representation (pGJR) with improvement by GJR. The experiment results show the effectiveness on the clustering task with respect to the ACC, NMI and ARI three metrics and super fast convergence speed.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised semantic segmentation is a challenging task that segments images into semantic groups without manual annotation. Prior works have primarily focused on leveraging prior knowledge of semantic consistency or priori concepts from self-supervised learning methods, which often overlook the coherence property of image segments. In this paper, we demonstrate that the smoothness prior, asserting that close features in a metric space share the same semantics, can significantly simplify segmentation by casting unsupervised semantic segmentation as an energy minimization problem. Under this paradigm, we propose a novel approach called SmooSeg that harnesses self-supervised learning methods to model the closeness relationships among observations as smoothness signals. To effectively discover coherent semantic segments, we introduce a novel smoothness loss that promotes piecewise smoothness within segments while preserving discontinuities across different segments. Additionally, to further enhance segmentation quality, we design an asymmetric teacher-student style predictor that generates smoothly updated pseudo labels, facilitating an optimal fit between observations and labeling outputs. Thanks to the rich supervision cues of the smoothness prior, our SmooSeg significantly outperforms STEGO in terms of pixel accuracy on three datasets: COCOStuff (+14.9%), Cityscapes (+13.0%), and Potsdam-3 (+5.7%).

- **Summary**: The ability to detect and track the dynamic objects in different scenes is fundamental to real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is limited to tracking objects belonging to the pre-defined closed-set categories. Recently, Open-Vocabulary MOT (OVMOT) and Generic MOT (GMOT) are proposed to track interested objects beyond pre-defined categories with the given text prompt and template image. However, the expensive well pre-trained (vision-)language model and fine-grained category annotations are required to train OVMOT models. In this paper, we focus on GMOT and propose a simple but effective method, Siamese-DETR, for GMOT. Only the commonly used detection datasets (e.g., COCO) are required for training. Different from existing GMOT methods, which train a Single Object Tracking (SOT) based detector to detect interested objects and then apply a data association based MOT tracker to get the trajectories, we leverage the inherent object queries in DETR variants. Specifically: 1) The multi-scale object queries are designed based on the given template image, which are effective for detecting different scales of objects with the same category as the template image; 2) A dynamic matching training strategy is introduced to train Siamese-DETR on commonly used detection datasets, which takes full advantage of provided annotations; 3) The online tracking pipeline is simplified through a tracking-by-query manner by incorporating the tracked boxes in previous frame as additional query boxes. The complex data association is replaced with the much simpler Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Extensive experimental results show that Siamese-DETR surpasses existing MOT methods on GMOT-40 dataset by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have proven to be powerful 3D representations, capable of high quality novel view synthesis of complex scenes. While NeRFs have been applied to graphics, vision, and robotics, problems with slow rendering speed and characteristic visual artifacts prevent adoption in many use cases. In this work, we investigate combining an autoencoder (AE) with a NeRF, in which latent features (instead of colours) are rendered and then convolutionally decoded. The resulting latent-space NeRF can produce novel views with higher quality than standard colour-space NeRFs, as the AE can correct certain visual artifacts, while rendering over three times faster. Our work is orthogonal to other techniques for improving NeRF efficiency. Further, we can control the tradeoff between efficiency and image quality by shrinking the AE architecture, achieving over 13 times faster rendering with only a small drop in performance. We hope that our approach can form the basis of an efficient, yet high-fidelity, 3D scene representation for downstream tasks, especially when retaining differentiability is useful, as in many robotics scenarios requiring continual learning.

- **Summary**: Is aesthetic impact different from beauty? Is visual salience a reflection of its capacity for effective communication? We present Impressions, a novel dataset through which to investigate the semiotics of images, and how specific visual features and design choices can elicit specific emotions, thoughts and beliefs. We posit that the impactfulness of an image extends beyond formal definitions of aesthetics, to its success as a communicative act, where style contributes as much to meaning formation as the subject matter. However, prior image captioning datasets are not designed to empower state-of-the-art architectures to model potential human impressions or interpretations of images. To fill this gap, we design an annotation task heavily inspired by image analysis techniques in the Visual Arts to collect 1,440 image-caption pairs and 4,320 unique annotations exploring impact, pragmatic image description, impressions, and aesthetic design choices. We show that existing multimodal image captioning and conditional generation models struggle to simulate plausible human responses to images. However, this dataset significantly improves their ability to model impressions and aesthetic evaluations of images through fine-tuning and few-shot adaptation.

- **Summary**: For capturing colored document images, e.g. posters and magazines, it is common that multiple degradations such as shadows, wrinkles, etc., are simultaneously introduced due to external factors. Restoring multi-degraded colored document images is a great challenge, yet overlooked, as most existing algorithms focus on enhancing color-ignored document images via binarization. Thus, we propose DocStormer, a novel algorithm designed to restore multi-degraded colored documents to their potential pristine PDF. The contributions are: firstly, we propose a "Perceive-then-Restore" paradigm with a reinforced transformer block, which more effectively encodes and utilizes the distribution of degradations. Secondly, we are the first to utilize GAN and pristine PDF magazine images to narrow the distribution gap between the enhanced results and PDF images, in pursuit of less degradation and better visual quality. Thirdly, we propose a non-parametric strategy, PFILI, which enables a smaller training scale and larger testing resolutions with acceptable detail trade-off, while saving memory and inference time. Fourthly, we are the first to propose a novel Multi-Degraded Colored Document image Enhancing dataset, named MD-CDE, for both training and evaluation. Experimental results show that the DocStormer exhibits superior performance, capable of revitalizing multi-degraded colored documents into their potential pristine digital versions, which fills the current academic gap from the perspective of method, data, and task.

- **Summary**: Despite rapid progress in Visual question answering (VQA), existing datasets and models mainly focus on testing reasoning in 2D. However, it is important that VQA models also understand the 3D structure of visual scenes, for example to support tasks like navigation or manipulation. This includes an understanding of the 3D object pose, their parts and occlusions. In this work, we introduce the task of 3D-aware VQA, which focuses on challenging questions that require a compositional reasoning over the 3D structure of visual scenes. We address 3D-aware VQA from both the dataset and the model perspective. First, we introduce Super-CLEVR-3D, a compositional reasoning dataset that contains questions about object parts, their 3D poses, and occlusions. Second, we propose PO3D-VQA, a 3D-aware VQA model that marries two powerful ideas: probabilistic neural symbolic program execution for reasoning and deep neural networks with 3D generative representations of objects for robust visual recognition. Our experimental results show our model PO3D-VQA outperforms existing methods significantly, but we still observe a significant performance gap compared to 2D VQA benchmarks, indicating that 3D-aware VQA remains an important open research area.

- **Summary**: Video domain generalization aims to learn generalizable video classification models for unseen target domains by training in a source domain. A critical challenge of video domain generalization is to defend against the heavy reliance on domain-specific cues extracted from the source domain when recognizing target videos. To this end, we propose to perceive diverse spatial-temporal cues in videos, aiming to discover potential domain-invariant cues in addition to domain-specific cues. We contribute a novel model named Spatial-Temporal Diversification Network (STDN), which improves the diversity from both space and time dimensions of video data. First, our STDN proposes to discover various types of spatial cues within individual frames by spatial grouping. Then, our STDN proposes to explicitly model spatial-temporal dependencies between video contents at multiple space-time scales by spatial-temporal relation modeling. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks of different types demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

- **Summary**: Occlusion is a long-standing problem in computer vision, particularly in instance segmentation. ACM MMSports 2023 DeepSportRadar has introduced a dataset that focuses on segmenting human subjects within a basketball context and a specialized evaluation metric for occlusion scenarios. Given the modest size of the dataset and the highly deformable nature of the objects to be segmented, this challenge demands the application of robust data augmentation techniques and wisely-chosen deep learning architectures. Our work (ranked 1st in the competition) first proposes a novel data augmentation technique, capable of generating more training samples with wider distribution. Then, we adopt a new architecture - Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) framework with CBNetV2 as backbone and MaskIoU head to improve segmentation performance. Furthermore, we employ a Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) training strategy to improve the model's generalization. As a result, we achieve a remarkable occlusion score (OM) of 0.533 on the challenge dataset, securing the top-1 position on the leaderboard.

### Understanding Parameter Saliency via Extreme Value Theory

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are being increasingly implemented throughout society in recent years. It is useful to identify which parameters trigger misclassification in diagnosing undesirable model behaviors. The concept of parameter saliency is proposed and used to diagnose convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by ranking convolution filters that may have caused misclassification on the basis of parameter saliency. It is also shown that fine-tuning the top ranking salient filters has efficiently corrected misidentification on ImageNet. However, there is still a knowledge gap in terms of understanding why parameter saliency ranking can find the filters inducing misidentification. In this work, we attempt to bridge the gap by analyzing parameter saliency ranking from a statistical viewpoint, namely, extreme value theory. We first show that the existing work implicitly assumes that the gradient norm computed for each filter follows a normal distribution. Then, we clarify the relationship between parameter saliency and the score based on the peaks-over-threshold (POT) method, which is often used to model extreme values. Finally, we reformulate parameter saliency in terms of the POT method, where this reformulation is regarded as statistical anomaly detection and does not require the implicit assumptions of the existing parameter-saliency formulation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our reformulation can detect malicious filters as well. Furthermore, we show that the existing parameter saliency method exhibits a bias against the depth of layers in deep neural networks. In particular, this bias has the potential to inhibit the discovery of filters that cause misidentification in situations where domain shift occurs. In contrast, parameter saliency based on POT shows less of this bias.

- **Summary**: Current Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) methods prioritize extracting distinguishing appearance features, ignoring the natural resistance of body shape against modality changes. Initially, we gauged the discriminative potential of shapes by a straightforward concatenation of shape and appearance features. However, two unresolved issues persist in the utilization of shape features. One pertains to the dependence on auxiliary models for shape feature extraction in the inference phase, along with the errors in generated infrared shapes due to the intrinsic modality disparity. The other issue involves the inadequately explored correlation between shape and appearance features. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose the Shape-centered Representation Learning framework (ScRL), which focuses on learning shape features and appearance features associated with shapes. Specifically, we devise the Shape Feature Propagation (SFP), facilitating direct extraction of shape features from original images with minimal complexity costs during inference. To restitute inaccuracies in infrared body shapes at the feature level, we present the Infrared Shape Restitution (ISR). Furthermore, to acquire appearance features related to shape, we design the Appearance Feature Enhancement (AFE), which accentuates identity-related features while suppressing identity-unrelated features guided by shape features. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ScRL. Achieving remarkable results, the Rank-1 (mAP) accuracy attains 76.1%, 71.2%, 92.4% (72.6%, 52.9%, 86.7%) on the SYSU-MM01, HITSZ-VCM, RegDB datasets respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Coronary angiography analysis is a common clinical task performed by cardiologists to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD) through an assessment of atherosclerotic plaque's accumulation. This study introduces an end-to-end machine learning solution developed as part of our solution for the MICCAI 2023 Automatic Region-based Coronary Artery Disease diagnostics using x-ray angiography imagEs (ARCADE) challenge, which aims to benchmark solutions for multivessel coronary artery segmentation and potential stenotic lesion localisation from X-ray coronary angiograms. We adopted a robust baseline model training strategy to progressively improve performance, comprising five successive stages of binary class pretraining, multivessel segmentation, fine-tuning using class frequency weighted dataloaders, fine-tuning using F1-based curriculum learning strategy (F1-CLS), and finally multi-target angiogram view classifier-based collective adaptation. Unlike many other medical imaging procedures, this task exhibits a notable degree of interobserver variability. %, making it particularly amenable to automated analysis. Our ensemble model combines the outputs from six baseline models using the weighted ensembling approach, which our analysis shows is found to double the predictive accuracy of the proposed solution. The final prediction was further refined, targeting the correction of misclassified blobs. Our solution achieved a mean F1 score of $37.69\%$ for coronary artery segmentation, and $39.41\%$ for stenosis localisation, positioning our team in the 5th position on both leaderboards. This work demonstrates the potential of automated tools to aid CAD diagnosis, guide interventions, and improve the accuracy of stent injections in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced a new era of proficiency in comprehending complex healthcare and biomedical topics. However, there is a noticeable lack of models in languages other than English and models that can interpret multi-modal input, which is crucial for global healthcare accessibility. In response, this study introduces Qilin-Med-VL, the first Chinese large vision-language model designed to integrate the analysis of textual and visual data. Qilin-Med-VL combines a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) with a foundational LLM. It undergoes a thorough two-stage curriculum training process that includes feature alignment and instruction tuning. This method enhances the model's ability to generate medical captions and answer complex medical queries. We also release ChiMed-VL, a dataset consisting of more than 1M image-text pairs. This dataset has been carefully curated to enable detailed and comprehensive interpretation of medical data using various types of images.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces an approach to enhance seismic fault recognition through self-supervised pretraining. Seismic fault interpretation holds great significance in the fields of geophysics and geology. However, conventional methods for seismic fault recognition encounter various issues, including dependence on data quality and quantity, as well as susceptibility to interpreter subjectivity. Currently, automated fault recognition methods proposed based on small synthetic datasets experience performance degradation when applied to actual seismic data. To address these challenges, we have introduced the concept of self-supervised learning, utilizing a substantial amount of relatively easily obtainable unlabeled seismic data for pretraining. Specifically, we have employed the Swin Transformer model as the core network and employed the SimMIM pretraining task to capture unique features related to discontinuities in seismic data. During the fine-tuning phase, inspired by edge detection techniques, we have also refined the structure of the Swin-UNETR model, enabling multiscale decoding and fusion for more effective fault detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance on the Thebe dataset, as measured by the OIS and ODS metrics.

- **Summary**: We introduce a 3D-aware diffusion model, ZeroNVS, for single-image novel view synthesis for in-the-wild scenes. While existing methods are designed for single objects with masked backgrounds, we propose new techniques to address challenges introduced by in-the-wild multi-object scenes with complex backgrounds. Specifically, we train a generative prior on a mixture of data sources that capture object-centric, indoor, and outdoor scenes. To address issues from data mixture such as depth-scale ambiguity, we propose a novel camera conditioning parameterization and normalization scheme. Further, we observe that Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) tends to truncate the distribution of complex backgrounds during distillation of 360-degree scenes, and propose "SDS anchoring" to improve the diversity of synthesized novel views. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art result in LPIPS on the DTU dataset in the zero-shot setting, even outperforming methods specifically trained on DTU. We further adapt the challenging Mip-NeRF 360 dataset as a new benchmark for single-image novel view synthesis, and demonstrate strong performance in this setting.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Visual Question Answering (VQA) has gained significant attention for its diverse applications, including intelligent car assistance, aiding visually impaired individuals, and document image information retrieval using natural language queries. VQA requires effective integration of information from questions and images to generate accurate answers. Neural models for VQA have made remarkable progress on large-scale datasets, with a primary focus on resource-rich languages like English. To address this, we introduce the ViCLEVR dataset, a pioneering collection for evaluating various visual reasoning capabilities in Vietnamese while mitigating biases. The dataset comprises over 26,000 images and 30,000 question-answer pairs (QAs), each question annotated to specify the type of reasoning involved. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of contemporary visual reasoning systems, offering valuable insights into their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we present PhoVIT, a comprehensive multimodal fusion that identifies objects in images based on questions. The architecture effectively employs transformers to enable simultaneous reasoning over textual and visual data, merging both modalities at an early model stage. The experimental findings demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance across four evaluation metrics. The accompanying code and dataset have been made publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/kvt0012/ViCLEVR}. This provision seeks to stimulate advancements within the research community, fostering the development of more multimodal fusion algorithms, specifically tailored to address the nuances of low-resource languages, exemplified by Vietnamese.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study a challenging task of zero-shot referring image segmentation. This task aims to identify the instance mask that is most related to a referring expression without training on pixel-level annotations. Previous research takes advantage of pre-trained cross-modal models, e.g., CLIP, to align instance-level masks with referring expressions. %Yet, CLIP only considers image-text pair level alignment, which neglects fine-grained image region and complex sentence matching. Yet, CLIP only considers the global-level alignment of image-text pairs, neglecting fine-grained matching between the referring sentence and local image regions. To address this challenge, we introduce a Text Augmented Spatial-aware (TAS) zero-shot referring image segmentation framework that is training-free and robust to various visual encoders. TAS incorporates a mask proposal network for instance-level mask extraction, a text-augmented visual-text matching score for mining the image-text correlation, and a spatial rectifier for mask post-processing. Notably, the text-augmented visual-text matching score leverages a $P$ score and an $N$-score in addition to the typical visual-text matching score. The $P$-score is utilized to close the visual-text domain gap through a surrogate captioning model, where the score is computed between the surrogate model-generated texts and the referring expression. The $N$-score considers the fine-grained alignment of region-text pairs via negative phrase mining, encouraging the masked image to be repelled from the mined distracting phrases. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, including RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg. The proposed method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot referring image segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt models trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without the access to source data. In medical imaging scenarios, the practical significance of SFDA methods has been emphasized due to privacy concerns. Recent State-of-the-art SFDA methods primarily rely on self-training based on pseudo-labels (PLs). Unfortunately, PLs suffer from accuracy deterioration caused by domain shift, and thus limit the effectiveness of the adaptation process. To address this issue, we propose a Chebyshev confidence guided SFDA framework to accurately assess the reliability of PLs and generate self-improving PLs for self-training. The Chebyshev confidence is estimated by calculating probability lower bound of the PL confidence, given the prediction and the corresponding uncertainty. Leveraging the Chebyshev confidence, we introduce two confidence-guided denoising methods: direct denoising and prototypical denoising. Additionally, we propose a novel teacher-student joint training scheme (TJTS) that incorporates a confidence weighting module to improve PLs iteratively. The TJTS, in collaboration with the denoising methods, effectively prevents the propagation of noise and enhances the accuracy of PLs. Extensive experiments in diverse domain scenarios validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and establish its superiority over state-of-the-art SFDA methods. Our paper contributes to the field of SFDA by providing a novel approach for precisely estimating the reliability of pseudo-labels and a framework for obtaining high-quality PLs, resulting in improved adaptation performance.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential when deploying neural networks in the real world. One main challenge is that neural networks often make overconfident predictions on OOD data. In this study, we propose an effective post-hoc OOD detection method based on a new feature masking strategy and a novel logit smoothing strategy. Feature masking determines the important features at the penultimate layer for each in-distribution (ID) class based on the weights of the ID class in the classifier head and masks the rest features. Logit smoothing computes the cosine similarity between the feature vector of the test sample and the prototype of the predicted ID class at the penultimate layer and uses the similarity as an adaptive temperature factor on the logit to alleviate the network's overconfidence prediction for OOD data. With these strategies, we can reduce feature activation of OOD data and enlarge the gap in OOD score between ID and OOD data. Extensive experiments on multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its compatibility with existing methods, with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method. The source code will be released publicly.

- **Summary**: Traditional supervised denoisers are trained using pairs of noisy input and clean target images. They learn to predict a central tendency of the posterior distribution over possible clean images. When, e.g., trained with the popular quadratic loss function, the network's output will correspond to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate. Unsupervised denoisers based on Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) have succeeded in achieving state-of-the-art results while requiring only unpaired noisy data as training input. In contrast to the traditional supervised approach, unsupervised denoisers do not directly produce a single prediction, such as the MMSE estimate, but allow us to draw samples from the posterior distribution of clean solutions corresponding to the noisy input. To approximate the MMSE estimate during inference, unsupervised methods have to create and draw a large number of samples - a computationally expensive process - rendering the approach inapplicable in many situations. Here, we present an alternative approach that trains a deterministic network alongside the VAE to directly predict a central tendency. Our method achieves results that surpass the results achieved by the unsupervised method at a fraction of the computational cost.



### End-to-end Video Gaze Estimation via Capturing Head-face-eye Spatial-temporal Interaction Context

- **Summary**: In this letter, we propose a new method, Multi-Clue Gaze (MCGaze), to facilitate video gaze estimation via capturing spatial-temporal interaction context among head, face, and eye in an end-to-end learning way, which has not been well concerned yet. The main advantage of MCGaze is that the tasks of clue localization of head, face, and eye can be solved jointly for gaze estimation in a one-step way, with joint optimization to seek optimal performance. During this, spatial-temporal context exchange happens among the clues on the head, face, and eye. Accordingly, the final gazes obtained by fusing features from various queries can be aware of global clues from heads and faces, and local clues from eyes simultaneously, which essentially leverages performance. Meanwhile, the one-step running way also ensures high running efficiency. Experiments on the challenging Gaze360 dataset verify the superiority of our proposition. The source code will be released at https://github.com/zgchen33/MCGaze.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel learning-based method for encoding and manipulating 3D surface meshes. Our method is specifically designed to create an interpretable embedding space for deformable shape collections. Unlike previous 3D mesh autoencoders that require meshes to be in a 1-to-1 correspondence, our approach is trained on diverse meshes in an unsupervised manner. Central to our method is a spectral pooling technique that establishes a universal latent space, breaking free from traditional constraints of mesh connectivity and shape categories. The entire process consists of two stages. In the first stage, we employ the functional map paradigm to extract point-to-point (p2p) maps between a collection of shapes in an unsupervised manner. These p2p maps are then utilized to construct a common latent space, which ensures straightforward interpretation and independence from mesh connectivity and shape category. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves excellent reconstructions and produces more realistic and smoother interpolations than baseline approaches.

- **Summary**: Despite considerable progress, the advancement of Panoptic Narrative Grounding (PNG) remains hindered by costly annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel Semi-Supervised Panoptic Narrative Grounding (SS-PNG) learning scheme, capitalizing on a smaller set of labeled image-text pairs and a larger set of unlabeled pairs to achieve competitive performance. Unlike visual segmentation tasks, PNG involves one pixel belonging to multiple open-ended nouns. As a result, existing multi-class based semi-supervised segmentation frameworks cannot be directly applied to this task. To address this challenge, we first develop a novel SS-PNG Network (SS-PNG-NW) tailored to the SS-PNG setting. We thoroughly investigate strategies such as Burn-In and data augmentation to determine the optimal generic configuration for the SS-PNG-NW. Additionally, to tackle the issue of imbalanced pseudo-label quality, we propose a Quality-Based Loss Adjustment (QLA) approach to adjust the semi-supervised objective, resulting in an enhanced SS-PNG-NW+. Employing our proposed QLA, we improve BCE Loss and Dice loss at pixel and mask levels, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on PNG datasets, with our SS-PNG-NW+ demonstrating promising results comparable to fully-supervised models across all data ratios. Remarkably, our SS-PNG-NW+ outperforms fully-supervised models with only 30% and 50% supervision data, exceeding their performance by 0.8% and 1.1% respectively. This highlights the effectiveness of our proposed SS-PNG-NW+ in overcoming the challenges posed by limited annotations and enhancing the applicability of PNG tasks.

- **Summary**: Whole slide images~(WSIs) are digitized images of tissues placed in glass slides using advanced scanners. The digital processing of WSIs is challenging as they are gigapixel images and stored in multi-resolution format. A common challenge with WSIs is that perturbations/artifacts are inevitable during storing the glass slides and digitizing them. These perturbations include motion, which often arises from slide movement during placement, and changes in hue and brightness due to variations in staining chemicals and the quality of digitizing scanners. In this work, a novel robust learning approach to account for these artifacts is presented. Due to the size and resolution of WSIs and to account for neighborhood information, graph-based methods are called for. We use graph convolutional network~(GCN) to extract features from the graph representing WSI. Through a denoiser {and pooling layer}, the effects of perturbations in WSIs are controlled and the output is followed by a transformer for the classification of different grades of prostate cancer. To compare the efficacy of the proposed approach, the model without denoiser is trained and tested with WSIs without any perturbation and then different perturbations are introduced in WSIs and passed through the network with the denoiser. The accuracy and kappa scores of the proposed model with prostate cancer dataset compared with non-robust algorithms show significant improvement in cancer diagnosis.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes applying a novel deep-learning model, TBDLNet, to recognize CT images to classify multidrug-resistant and drug-sensitive tuberculosis automatically. The pre-trained ResNet50 is selected to extract features. Three randomized neural networks are used to alleviate the overfitting problem. The ensemble of three RNNs is applied to boost the robustness via majority voting. The proposed model is evaluated by five-fold cross-validation. Five indexes are selected in this paper, which are accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1-score, and specificity. The TBDLNet achieves 0.9822 accuracy, 0.9815 specificity, 0.9823 precision, 0.9829 sensitivity, and 0.9826 F1-score, respectively. The TBDLNet is suitable for classifying multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and drug-sensitive tuberculosis. It can detect multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis as early as possible, which helps to adjust the treatment plan in time and improve the treatment effect.

- **Summary**: Assessing the condition and visibility of veins is a crucial step before obtaining intravenous access in the antecubital fossa, which is a common procedure to draw blood or administer intravenous therapies (IV therapies). Even though medical practitioners are highly skilled at intravenous cannulation, they usually struggle to perform the procedure in patients with low visible veins due to fluid retention, age, overweight, dark skin tone, or diabetes. Recently, several investigations proposed combining Near Infrared (NIR) imaging and deep learning (DL) techniques for forearm vein segmentation. Although they have demonstrated compelling results, their use has been rather limited owing to the portability and precision requirements to perform venipuncture. In this paper, we aim to contribute to bridging this gap using three strategies. First, we introduce a new NIR-based forearm vein segmentation dataset of 2,016 labelled images collected from 1,008 subjects with low visible veins. Second, we propose a modified U-Net architecture that locates veins specifically in the antecubital fossa region of the examined patient. Finally, a compressed version of the proposed architecture was deployed inside a bespoke, portable vein finder device after testing four common embedded microcomputers and four common quantization modalities. Experimental results showed that the model compressed with Dynamic Range Quantization and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4B card produced the best execution time and precision balance, with 5.14 FPS and 0.957 of latency and Intersection over Union (IoU), respectively. These results show promising performance inside a resource-restricted low-cost device.

- **Summary**: Evaluating text-to-image models is notoriously difficult. A strong recent approach for assessing text-image faithfulness is based on QG/A (question generation and answering), which uses pre-trained foundational models to automatically generate a set of questions and answers from the prompt, and output images are scored based on whether these answers extracted with a visual question answering model are consistent with the prompt-based answers. This kind of evaluation is naturally dependent on the quality of the underlying QG and QA models. We identify and address several reliability challenges in existing QG/A work: (a) QG questions should respect the prompt (avoiding hallucinations, duplications, and omissions) and (b) VQA answers should be consistent (not asserting that there is no motorcycle in an image while also claiming the motorcycle is blue). We address these issues with Davidsonian Scene Graph (DSG), an empirically grounded evaluation framework inspired by formal semantics. DSG is an automatic, graph-based QG/A that is modularly implemented to be adaptable to any QG/A module. DSG produces atomic and unique questions organized in dependency graphs, which (i) ensure appropriate semantic coverage and (ii) sidestep inconsistent answers. With extensive experimentation and human evaluation on a range of model configurations (LLM, VQA, and T2I), we empirically demonstrate that DSG addresses the challenges noted above. Finally, we present DSG-1k, an open-sourced evaluation benchmark that includes 1,060 prompts, covering a wide range of fine-grained semantic categories with a balanced distribution. We release the DSG-1k prompts and the corresponding DSG questions.

- **Summary**: Long-tail learning has received significant attention in recent years due to the challenge it poses with extremely imbalanced datasets. In these datasets, only a few classes (known as the head classes) have an adequate number of training samples, while the rest of the classes (known as the tail classes) are infrequent in the training data. Re-sampling is a classical and widely used approach for addressing class imbalance issues. Unfortunately, recent studies claim that re-sampling brings negligible performance improvements in modern long-tail learning tasks. This paper aims to investigate this phenomenon systematically. Our research shows that re-sampling can considerably improve generalization when the training images do not contain semantically irrelevant contexts. In other scenarios, however, it can learn unexpected spurious correlations between irrelevant contexts and target labels. We design experiments on two homogeneous datasets, one containing irrelevant context and the other not, to confirm our findings. To prevent the learning of spurious correlations, we propose a new context shift augmentation module that generates diverse training images for the tail class by maintaining a context bank extracted from the head-class images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed module can boost the generalization and outperform other approaches, including class-balanced re-sampling, decoupled classifier re-training, and data augmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Land use/land cover change (LULC) maps are integral resources in earth science and agricultural research. Due to the nature of such maps, the creation of LULC maps is often constrained by the time and human resources necessary to accurately annotate satellite imagery and remote sensing data. While computer vision models that perform semantic segmentation to create detailed labels from such data are not uncommon, litle research has been done on self-supervised and unsupervised approaches to labelling LULC maps without the use of ground-truth masks. Here, we demonstrate a self-supervised method of land cover segmentation that has no need for high-quality ground truth labels. The proposed deep learning employs a frozen pre-trained ViT backbone transferred from DINO in a STEGO architecture and is fine-tuned using a custom dataset consisting of very high resolution (VHR) sattelite imagery. After only 10 epochs of fine-tuning, an accuracy of roughly 52% was observed across 5 samples, signifying the feasibility of self-supervised models for the automated labelling of VHR LULC maps.

- **Summary**: Monitoring plantations is crucial for crop management and producing healthy harvests. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been used to collect multispectral images that aid in this monitoring. However, given the number of hectares to be monitored and the limitations of flight, plant disease signals become visually clear only in the later stages of plant growth and only if the disease has spread throughout a significant portion of the plantation. This limited amount of relevant data hampers the prediction models, as the algorithms struggle to generalize patterns with unbalanced or unrealistic augmented datasets effectively. To address this issue, we propose PlantPlotGAN, a physics-informed generative model capable of creating synthetic multispectral plot images with realistic vegetation indices. These indices served as a proxy for disease detection and were used to evaluate if our model could help increase the accuracy of prediction models. The results demonstrate that the synthetic imagery generated from PlantPlotGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding the Fr\'echet inception distance. Moreover, prediction models achieve higher accuracy metrics when trained with synthetic and original imagery for earlier plant disease detection compared to the training processes based solely on real imagery.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen growing interest in developing and applying perceptual similarity metrics. Research has shown the superiority of perceptual metrics over pixel-wise metrics in aligning with human perception and serving as a proxy for the human visual system. On the other hand, as perceptual metrics rely on neural networks, there is a growing concern regarding their resilience, given the established vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks. It is indeed logical to infer that perceptual metrics may inherit both the strengths and shortcomings of neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate the vulnerability of state-of-the-art perceptual similarity metrics based on an ensemble of ViT-based feature extractors to adversarial attacks. We then propose a framework to train a robust perceptual similarity metric called LipSim (Lipschitz Similarity Metric) with provable guarantees. By leveraging 1-Lipschitz neural networks as the backbone, LipSim provides guarded areas around each data point and certificates for all perturbations within an $\ell_2$ ball. Finally, a comprehensive set of experiments shows the performance of LipSim in terms of natural and certified scores and on the image retrieval application.

- **Summary**: Surface reconstruction from multi-view images is a challenging task, with solutions often requiring a large number of sampled images with high overlap. We seek to develop a method for few-view reconstruction, for the case of the human foot. To solve this task, we must extract rich geometric cues from RGB images, before carefully fusing them into a final 3D object. Our FOUND approach tackles this, with 4 main contributions: (i) SynFoot, a synthetic dataset of 50,000 photorealistic foot images, paired with ground truth surface normals and keypoints; (ii) an uncertainty-aware surface normal predictor trained on our synthetic dataset; (iii) an optimization scheme for fitting a generative foot model to a series of images; and (iv) a benchmark dataset of calibrated images and high resolution ground truth geometry. We show that our normal predictor outperforms all off-the-shelf equivalents significantly on real images, and our optimization scheme outperforms state-of-the-art photogrammetry pipelines, especially for a few-view setting. We release our synthetic dataset and baseline 3D scans to the research community.

- **Summary**: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in various machine-learning tasks, prompting their widespread adoption. In this paper, we explore their application in the context of federated learning (FL), with a particular focus on heterogeneous scenarios where individual clients possess diverse local datasets. To meet the computational and communication demands of FL, we leverage pre-trained Transformers and use an efficient prompt-tuning strategy. Our strategy introduces the concept of learning both shared and group prompts, enabling the acquisition of universal knowledge and group-specific knowledge simultaneously. Additionally, a prompt selection module assigns personalized group prompts to each input, aligning the global model with the data distribution of each client. This approach allows us to train a single global model that can automatically adapt to various local client data distributions without requiring local fine-tuning. In this way, our proposed method effectively bridges the gap between global and personalized local models in Federated Learning and surpasses alternative approaches that lack the capability to adapt to previously unseen clients. The effectiveness of our approach is rigorously validated through extensive experimentation and ablation studies.

- **Summary**: All-in-one adverse weather removal is an emerging topic on image restoration, which aims to restore multiple weather degradation in an unified model, and the challenging are twofold. First, discovering and handling the property of multi-domain in target distribution formed by multiple weather conditions. Second, design efficient and effective operations for different degradation types. To address this problem, most prior works focus on the multi-domain caused by weather type. Inspired by inter\&intra-domain adaptation literature, we observed that not only weather type but also weather severity introduce multi-domain within each weather type domain, which is ignored by previous methods, and further limit their performance. To this end, we proposed a degradation type and severity aware model, called \textbf{UtilityIR}, for blind all-in-one bad weather image restoration. To extract weather information from single image, we proposed a novel Marginal Quality Ranking Loss (MQRL) and utilized Contrastive Loss (CL) to guide weather severity and type extraction, and leverage a bag of novel techniques such as Multi-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) and Local-Global Adaptive Instance Normalization (LG-AdaIN) to efficiently restore spatial varying weather degradation. The proposed method can significantly outperform the SOTA methods subjectively and objectively on different weather restoration tasks with a large margin, and enjoy less model parameters. Proposed method even can restore \textbf{unseen} domain combined multiple degradation images, and modulating restoration level. Implementation code will be available at {https://github.com/fordevoted/UtilityIR}{\textit{this repository}}

- **Summary**: Classical clustering methods do not provide users with direct control of the clustering results, and the clustering results may not be consistent with the relevant criterion that a user has in mind. In this work, we present a new methodology for performing image clustering based on user-specified text criteria by leveraging modern vision-language models and large language models. We call our method Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria (IC$|$TC), and it represents a different paradigm of image clustering. IC$|$TC requires a minimal and practical degree of human intervention and grants the user significant control over the clustering results in return. Our experiments show that IC$|$TC can effectively cluster images with various criteria, such as human action, physical location, or the person's mood, while significantly outperforming baselines.

- **Summary**: Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) is a common and realistic problem since fashion constantly changes over time and people's aesthetic preferences are not set in stone. While most existing cloth-changing ReID methods focus on learning cloth-agnostic identity representations from coarse semantic cues (e.g. silhouettes and part segmentation maps), they neglect the continuous shape distributions at the pixel level. In this paper, we propose Continuous Surface Correspondence Learning (CSCL), a new shape embedding paradigm for cloth-changing ReID. CSCL establishes continuous correspondences between a 2D image plane and a canonical 3D body surface via pixel-to-vertex classification, which naturally aligns a person image to the surface of a 3D human model and simultaneously obtains pixel-wise surface embeddings. We further extract fine-grained shape features from the learned surface embeddings and then integrate them with global RGB features via a carefully designed cross-modality fusion module. The shape embedding paradigm based on 2D-3D correspondences remarkably enhances the model's global understanding of human body shape. To promote the study of ReID under clothing change, we construct 3D Dense Persons (DP3D), which is the first large-scale cloth-changing ReID dataset that provides densely annotated 2D-3D correspondences and a precise 3D mesh for each person image, while containing diverse cloth-changing cases over all four seasons. Experiments on both cloth-changing and cloth-consistent ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Although the number of gaze estimation datasets is growing, the application of appearance-based gaze estimation methods is mostly limited to estimating the point of gaze on a screen. This is in part because most datasets are generated in a similar fashion, where the gaze target is on a screen close to camera's origin. In other applications such as assistive robotics or marketing research, the 3D point of gaze might not be close to the camera's origin, meaning models trained on current datasets do not generalize well to these tasks. We therefore suggest generating a textured tridimensional mesh of the face and rendering the training images from a virtual camera at a specific position and orientation related to the application as a mean of augmenting the existing datasets. In our tests, this lead to an average 47% decrease in gaze estimation angular error.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present 3DCoMPaT$^{++}$, a multimodal 2D/3D dataset with 160 million rendered views of more than 10 million stylized 3D shapes carefully annotated at the part-instance level, alongside matching RGB point clouds, 3D textured meshes, depth maps, and segmentation masks. 3DCoMPaT$^{++}$ covers 41 shape categories, 275 fine-grained part categories, and 293 fine-grained material classes that can be compositionally applied to parts of 3D objects. We render a subset of one million stylized shapes from four equally spaced views as well as four randomized views, leading to a total of 160 million renderings. Parts are segmented at the instance level, with coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic levels. We introduce a new task, called Grounded CoMPaT Recognition (GCR), to collectively recognize and ground compositions of materials on parts of 3D objects. Additionally, we report the outcomes of a data challenge organized at CVPR2023, showcasing the winning method's utilization of a modified PointNet$^{++}$ model trained on 6D inputs, and exploring alternative techniques for GCR enhancement. We hope our work will help ease future research on compositional 3D Vision.



### Learning to recognize occluded and small objects with partial inputs

- **Summary**: Recognizing multiple objects in an image is challenging due to occlusions, and becomes even more so when the objects are small. While promising, existing multi-label image recognition models do not explicitly learn context-based representations, and hence struggle to correctly recognize small and occluded objects. Intuitively, recognizing occluded objects requires knowledge of partial input, and hence context. Motivated by this intuition, we propose Masked Supervised Learning (MSL), a single-stage, model-agnostic learning paradigm for multi-label image recognition. The key idea is to learn context-based representations using a masked branch and to model label co-occurrence using label consistency. Experimental results demonstrate the simplicity, applicability and more importantly the competitive performance of MSL against previous state-of-the-art methods on standard multi-label image recognition benchmarks. In addition, we show that MSL is robust to random masking and demonstrate its effectiveness in recognizing non-masked objects. Code and pretrained models are available on GitHub.

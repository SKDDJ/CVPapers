- **Summary**: Monocular depth inference is a fundamental problem for scene perception of robots. Specific robots may be equipped with a camera plus an optional depth sensor of any type and located in various scenes of different scales, whereas recent advances derived multiple individual sub-tasks. It leads to additional burdens to fine-tune models for specific robots and thereby high-cost customization in large-scale industrialization. This paper investigates a unified task of monocular depth inference, which infers high-quality depth maps from all kinds of input raw data from various robots in unseen scenes. A basic benchmark G2-MonoDepth is developed for this task, which comprises four components: (a) a unified data representation RGB+X to accommodate RGB plus raw depth with diverse scene scale/semantics, depth sparsity ([0%, 100%]) and errors (holes/noises/blurs), (b) a novel unified loss to adapt to diverse depth sparsity/errors of input raw data and diverse scales of output scenes, (c) an improved network to well propagate diverse scene scales from input to output, and (d) a data augmentation pipeline to simulate all types of real artifacts in raw depth maps for training. G2-MonoDepth is applied in three sub-tasks including depth estimation, depth completion with different sparsity, and depth enhancement in unseen scenes, and it always outperforms SOTA baselines on both real-world data and synthetic data.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training has shown promise in building robust models against adversarial examples. A major drawback of adversarial training is the computational overhead introduced by the generation of adversarial examples. To overcome this limitation, adversarial training based on single-step attacks has been explored. Previous work improves the single-step adversarial training from different perspectives, e.g., sample initialization, loss regularization, and training strategy. Almost all of them treat the underlying model as a black box. In this work, we propose to exploit the interior building blocks of the model to improve efficiency. Specifically, we propose to dynamically sample lightweight subnetworks as a surrogate model during training. By doing this, both the forward and backward passes can be accelerated for efficient adversarial training. Besides, we provide theoretical analysis to show the model robustness can be improved by the single-step adversarial training with sampled subnetworks. Furthermore, we propose a novel sampling strategy where the sampling varies from layer to layer and from iteration to iteration. Compared with previous methods, our method not only reduces the training cost but also achieves better model robustness. Evaluations on a series of popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FB-Better. Our code has been released at https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/FP-Better.

- **Summary**: Realistic reconstruction of 3D clothing from an image has wide applications, such as avatar creation and virtual try-on. This paper presents a novel framework that reconstructs the texture map for 3D garments from a single image with pose. Assuming that 3D garments are modeled by stitching 2D garment sewing patterns, our specific goal is to generate a texture image for the sewing patterns. A key component of our framework, the Texture Unwarper, infers the original texture image from the input clothing image, which exhibits warping and occlusion of texture due to the user's body shape and pose. The Texture Unwarper effectively transforms between the input and output images by mapping the latent spaces of the two images. By inferring the unwarped original texture of the input garment, our method helps reconstruct 3D garment models that can show high-quality texture images realistically deformed for new poses. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through a comparison with other methods and ablation studies.

- **Summary**: Given the widespread adoption of depth-sensing acquisition devices, RGB-D videos and related data/media have gained considerable traction in various aspects of daily life. Consequently, conducting salient object detection (SOD) in RGB-D videos presents a highly promising and evolving avenue. Despite the potential of this area, SOD in RGB-D videos remains somewhat under-explored, with RGB-D SOD and video SOD (VSOD) traditionally studied in isolation. To explore this emerging field, this paper makes two primary contributions: the dataset and the model. On one front, we construct the RDVS dataset, a new RGB-D VSOD dataset with realistic depth and characterized by its diversity of scenes and rigorous frame-by-frame annotations. We validate the dataset through comprehensive attribute and object-oriented analyses, and provide training and testing splits. Moreover, we introduce DCTNet+, a three-stream network tailored for RGB-D VSOD, with an emphasis on RGB modality and treats depth and optical flow as auxiliary modalities. In pursuit of effective feature enhancement, refinement, and fusion for precise final prediction, we propose two modules: the multi-modal attention module (MAM) and the refinement fusion module (RFM). To enhance interaction and fusion within RFM, we design a universal interaction module (UIM) and then integrate holistic multi-modal attentive paths (HMAPs) for refining multi-modal low-level features before reaching RFMs. Comprehensive experiments, conducted on pseudo RGB-D video datasets alongside our RDVS, highlight the superiority of DCTNet+ over 17 VSOD models and 14 RGB-D SOD models. Ablation experiments were performed on both pseudo and realistic RGB-D video datasets to demonstrate the advantages of individual modules as well as the necessity of introducing realistic depth. Our code together with RDVS dataset will be available at https://github.com/kerenfu/RDVS/.

- **Summary**: Cross-view self-localization is a challenging scenario of visual place recognition in which database images are provided from sparse viewpoints. Recently, an approach for synthesizing database images from unseen viewpoints using NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) technology has emerged with impressive performance. However, synthesized images provided by these techniques are often of lower quality than the original images, and furthermore they significantly increase the storage cost of the database. In this study, we explore a new hybrid scene model that combines the advantages of view-invariant appearance features computed from raw images and view-dependent spatial-semantic features computed from synthesized images. These two types of features are then fused into scene graphs, and compressively learned and recognized by a graph neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using a novel cross-view self-localization dataset with many unseen views generated using a photorealistic Habitat simulator.

- **Summary**: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) has been extensively studied, with existing approaches typically following a framework that alternates between clean sample selection and semi-supervised learning (SSL). However, this approach has a limitation: the clean set selected by the Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier, trained through self-training, inevitably contains noisy samples. This mixture of clean and noisy samples leads to misguidance in DNN training during SSL, resulting in impaired generalization performance due to confirmation bias caused by error accumulation in sample selection. To address this issue, we propose a method called Collaborative Sample Selection (CSS), which leverages the large-scale pre-trained model CLIP. CSS aims to remove the mixed noisy samples from the identified clean set. We achieve this by training a 2-Dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model (2D-GMM) that combines the probabilities from CLIP with the predictions from the DNN classifier. To further enhance the adaptation of CLIP to LNL, we introduce a co-training mechanism with a contrastive loss in semi-supervised learning. This allows us to jointly train the prompt of CLIP and the DNN classifier, resulting in improved feature representation, boosted classification performance of DNNs, and reciprocal benefits to our Collaborative Sample Selection. By incorporating auxiliary information from CLIP and utilizing prompt fine-tuning, we effectively eliminate noisy samples from the clean set and mitigate confirmation bias during training. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: The widespread use of face recognition technology has given rise to privacy concerns, as many individuals are worried about the collection and utilization of their facial data. To address these concerns, researchers are actively exploring the concept of ``unlearnable examples", by adding imperceptible perturbation to data in the model training stage, which aims to prevent the model from learning discriminate features of the target face. However, current methods are inefficient and cannot guarantee transferability and robustness at the same time, causing impracticality in the real world. To remedy it, we propose a novel method called Segue: Side-information guided generative unlearnable examples. Specifically, we leverage a once-trained multiple-used model to generate the desired perturbation rather than the time-consuming gradient-based method. To improve transferability, we introduce side information such as true labels and pseudo labels, which are inherently consistent across different scenarios. For robustness enhancement, a distortion layer is integrated into the training pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Segue is much faster than previous methods (1000$\times$) and achieves transferable effectiveness across different datasets and model architectures. Furthermore, it can resist JPEG compression, adversarial training, and some standard data augmentations.

- **Summary**: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely used, highly sensitive molecular imaging in clinical diagnosis. There is interest in reducing the radiation exposure from PET but also maintaining adequate image quality. Recent methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate synthesized high-quality PET images from low-dose counterparts have been reported to be state-of-the-art for low-to-high image recovery methods. However, these methods are prone to exhibiting discrepancies in texture and structure between synthesized and real images. Furthermore, the distribution shift between low-dose PET and standard PET has not been fully investigated. To address these issues, we developed a self-supervised adaptive residual estimation generative adversarial network (SS-AEGAN). We introduce (1) An adaptive residual estimation mapping mechanism, AE-Net, designed to dynamically rectify the preliminary synthesized PET images by taking the residual map between the low-dose PET and synthesized output as the input, and (2) A self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance the feature representation of the coarse generator. Our experiments with a public benchmark dataset of total-body PET images show that SS-AEGAN consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art synthesis methods with various dose reduction factors.

- **Summary**: Recent progresses on self-supervised 3D human action representation learning are largely attributed to contrastive learning. However, in conventional contrastive frameworks, the rich complementarity between different skeleton modalities remains under-explored. Moreover, optimized with distinguishing self-augmented samples, models struggle with numerous similar positive instances in the case of limited action categories. In this work, we tackle the aforementioned problems by introducing a general Inter- and Intra-modal Mutual Distillation (I$^2$MD) framework. In I$^2$MD, we first re-formulate the cross-modal interaction as a Cross-modal Mutual Distillation (CMD) process. Different from existing distillation solutions that transfer the knowledge of a pre-trained and fixed teacher to the student, in CMD, the knowledge is continuously updated and bidirectionally distilled between modalities during pre-training. To alleviate the interference of similar samples and exploit their underlying contexts, we further design the Intra-modal Mutual Distillation (IMD) strategy, In IMD, the Dynamic Neighbors Aggregation (DNA) mechanism is first introduced, where an additional cluster-level discrimination branch is instantiated in each modality. It adaptively aggregates highly-correlated neighboring features, forming local cluster-level contrasting. Mutual distillation is then performed between the two branches for cross-level knowledge exchange. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our approach sets a series of new records.

We investigate gradients computation when using VMAF as an objective function and demonstrate that training using this function does not result in ill-behaving gradients.

- **Summary**: Neural Module Networks (NMN) are a compelling method for visual question answering, enabling the translation of a question into a program consisting of a series of reasoning sub-tasks that are sequentially executed on the image to produce an answer. NMNs provide enhanced explainability compared to integrated models, allowing for a better understanding of the underlying reasoning process. To improve the effectiveness of NMNs we propose to exploit features obtained by a large-scale cross-modal encoder. Also, the current training approach of NMNs relies on the propagation of module outputs to subsequent modules, leading to the accumulation of prediction errors and the generation of false answers. To mitigate this, we introduce an NMN learning strategy involving scheduled teacher guidance. Initially, the model is fully guided by the ground-truth intermediate outputs, but gradually transitions to an autonomous behavior as training progresses. This reduces error accumulation, thus improving training efficiency and final performance.We demonstrate that by incorporating cross-modal features and employing more effective training techniques for NMN, we achieve a favorable balance between performance and transparency in the reasoning process.

- **Summary**: Face recognition service has been used in many fields and brings much convenience to people. However, once the user's facial data is transmitted to a service provider, the user will lose control of his/her private data. In recent years, there exist various security and privacy issues due to the leakage of facial data. Although many privacy-preserving methods have been proposed, they usually fail when they are not accessible to adversaries' strategies or auxiliary data. Hence, in this paper, by fully considering two cases of uploading facial images and facial features, which are very typical in face recognition service systems, we proposed a data privacy minimization transformation (PMT) method. This method can process the original facial data based on the shallow model of authorized services to obtain the obfuscated data. The obfuscated data can not only maintain satisfactory performance on authorized models and restrict the performance on other unauthorized models but also prevent original privacy data from leaking by AI methods and human visual theft. Additionally, since a service provider may execute preprocessing operations on the received data, we also propose an enhanced perturbation method to improve the robustness of PMT. Besides, to authorize one facial image to multiple service models simultaneously, a multiple restriction mechanism is proposed to improve the scalability of PMT. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PMT in defending against face reconstruction, data abuse, and face attribute estimation attacks. These experimental results demonstrate that PMT performs well in preventing facial data abuse and privacy leakage while maintaining face recognition accuracy.

- **Summary**: Vision-based emergent communication (EC) aims to learn to communicate through sketches and demystify the evolution of human communication. Ironically, previous works neglect multi-round interaction, which is indispensable in human communication. To fill this gap, we first introduce a novel Interactive Sketch Question Answering (ISQA) task, where two collaborative players are interacting through sketches to answer a question about an image in a multi-round manner. To accomplish this task, we design a new and efficient interactive EC system, which can achieve an effective balance among three evaluation factors, including the question answering accuracy, drawing complexity and human interpretability. Our experimental results including human evaluation demonstrate that multi-round interactive mechanism facilitates targeted and efficient communication between intelligent agents with decent human interpretability.

- **Summary**: The human hand's complex kinematics allow for simultaneous grasping and manipulation of multiple objects, essential for tasks like object transfer and in-hand manipulation. Despite its importance, robotic multi-object grasping remains underexplored and presents challenges in kinematics, dynamics, and object configurations. This paper introduces MultiGrasp, a two-stage method for multi-object grasping on a tabletop with a multi-finger dexterous hand. It involves (i) generating pre-grasp proposals and (ii) executing the grasp and lifting the objects. Experimental results primarily focus on dual-object grasping and report a 44.13% success rate, showcasing adaptability to unseen object configurations and imprecise grasps. The framework also demonstrates the capability to grasp more than two objects, albeit at a reduced inference speed.

- **Summary**: Geometry plays a significant role in monocular 3D object detection. It can be used to estimate object depth by using the perspective projection between object's physical size and 2D projection in the image plane, which can introduce mathematical priors into deep models. However, this projection process also introduces error amplification, where the error of the estimated height is amplified and reflected into the projected depth. It leads to unreliable depth inferences and also impairs training stability. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Geometry Uncertainty Propagation Network (GUPNet++) by modeling geometry projection in a probabilistic manner. This ensures depth predictions are well-bounded and associated with a reasonable uncertainty. The significance of introducing such geometric uncertainty is two-fold: (1). It models the uncertainty propagation relationship of the geometry projection during training, improving the stability and efficiency of the end-to-end model learning. (2). It can be derived to a highly reliable confidence to indicate the quality of the 3D detection result, enabling more reliable detection inference. Experiments show that the proposed approach not only obtains (state-of-the-art) SOTA performance in image-based monocular 3D detection but also demonstrates superiority in efficacy with a simplified framework.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation object detection(UDAOD) research on Detection Transformer(DETR) mainly focuses on feature alignment and existing methods can be divided into two kinds, each of which has its unresolved issues. One-stage feature alignment methods can easily lead to performance fluctuation and training stagnation. Two-stage feature alignment method based on mean teacher comprises a pretraining stage followed by a self-training stage, each facing problems in obtaining reliable pretrained model and achieving consistent performance gains. Methods mentioned above have not yet explore how to utilize the third related domain such as target-like domain to assist adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework named MTM, i.e. Mean Teacher-DETR with Masked Feature Alignment. In the pretraining stage, we utilize labeled target-like images produced by image style transfer to avoid performance fluctuation. In the self-training stage, we leverage unlabeled target images by pseudo labels based on mean teacher and propose a module called Object Queries Knowledge Transfer(OQKT) to ensure consistent performance gains of the student model. Most importantly, we propose masked feature alignment methods including Masked Domain Query-based Feature Alignment(MDQFA) and Masked Token-wise Feature Alignment(MTWFA) to alleviate domain shift in a more robust way, which not only prevent training stagnation and lead to a robust pretrained model in the pretraining stage, but also enhance the model's target performance in the self-training stage. Experiments on three challenging scenarios and a theoretical analysis verify the effectiveness of MTM.

- **Summary**: Sparse optical flow is widely used in various computer vision tasks, however assuming brightness consistency limits its performance in High Dynamic Range (HDR) environments. In this work, a lightweight network is used to extract illumination robust convolutional features and corners with strong invariance. Modifying the typical brightness consistency of the optical flow method to the convolutional feature consistency yields the light-robust hybrid optical flow method. The proposed network runs at 190 FPS on a commercial CPU because it uses only four convolutional layers to extract feature maps and score maps simultaneously. Since the shallow network is difficult to train directly, a deep network is designed to compute the reliability map that helps it. An end-to-end unsupervised training mode is used for both networks. To validate the proposed method, we compare corner repeatability and matching performance with origin optical flow under dynamic illumination. In addition, a more accurate visual inertial system is constructed by replacing the optical flow method in VINS-Mono. In a public HDR dataset, it reduces translation errors by 93\%.

- **Summary**: Image style transfer is a challenging task in computational vision. Existing algorithms transfer the color and texture of style images by controlling the neural network's feature layers. However, they fail to control the strength of textures in different regions of the content image. To address this issue, we propose a training method that uses a loss function to constrain the style intensity in different regions. This method guides the transfer strength of style features in different regions based on the gradient relationship between style and content images. Additionally, we introduce a novel feature fusion method that linearly transforms content features to resemble style features while preserving their semantic relationships. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: The excellent generalization, contextual learning, and emergence abilities in the pre-trained large models (PLMs) handle specific tasks without direct training data, making them the better foundation models in the adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) methods to transfer knowledge learned from the source domain to target domains. However, existing ADA methods fail to account for the confounder properly, which is the root cause of the source data distribution that differs from the target domains. This study proposes an adversarial domain adaptation with confounder balancing for PLMs fine-tuning (ADA-CBF). The ADA-CBF includes a PLM as the foundation model for a feature extractor, a domain classifier and a confounder classifier, and they are jointly trained with an adversarial loss. This loss is designed to improve the domain-invariant representation learning by diluting the discrimination in the domain classifier. At the same time, the adversarial loss also balances the confounder distribution among source and unmeasured domains in training. Compared to existing ADA methods, ADA-CBF can correctly identify confounders in domain-invariant features, thereby eliminating the confounder biases in the extracted features from PLMs. The confounder classifier in ADA-CBF is designed as a plug-and-play and can be applied in the confounder measurable, unmeasurable, or partially measurable environments. Empirical results on natural language processing and computer vision downstream tasks show that ADA-CBF outperforms the newest GPT-4, LLaMA2, ViT and ADA methods.

- **Summary**: Current research is primarily dedicated to advancing the accuracy of camera-only 3D object detectors (apprentice) through the knowledge transferred from LiDAR- or multi-modal-based counterparts (expert). However, the presence of the domain gap between LiDAR and camera features, coupled with the inherent incompatibility in temporal fusion, significantly hinders the effectiveness of distillation-based enhancements for apprentices. Motivated by the success of uni-modal distillation, an apprentice-friendly expert model would predominantly rely on camera features, while still achieving comparable performance to multi-modal models. To this end, we introduce VCD, a framework to improve the camera-only apprentice model, including an apprentice-friendly multi-modal expert and temporal-fusion-friendly distillation supervision. The multi-modal expert VCD-E adopts an identical structure as that of the camera-only apprentice in order to alleviate the feature disparity, and leverages LiDAR input as a depth prior to reconstruct the 3D scene, achieving the performance on par with other heterogeneous multi-modal experts. Additionally, a fine-grained trajectory-based distillation module is introduced with the purpose of individually rectifying the motion misalignment for each object in the scene. With those improvements, our camera-only apprentice VCD-A sets new state-of-the-art on nuScenes with a score of 63.1% NDS.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal 3D scene understanding has gained considerable attention due to its wide applications in many areas, such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction. Compared to conventional single-modal 3D understanding, introducing an additional modality not only elevates the richness and precision of scene interpretation but also ensures a more robust and resilient understanding. This becomes especially crucial in varied and challenging environments where solely relying on 3D data might be inadequate. While there has been a surge in the development of multi-modal 3D methods over past three years, especially those integrating multi-camera images (3D+2D) and textual descriptions (3D+language), a comprehensive and in-depth review is notably absent. In this article, we present a systematic survey of recent progress to bridge this gap. We begin by briefly introducing a background that formally defines various 3D multi-modal tasks and summarizes their inherent challenges. After that, we present a novel taxonomy that delivers a thorough categorization of existing methods according to modalities and tasks, exploring their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, comparative results of recent approaches on several benchmark datasets, together with insightful analysis, are offered. Finally, we discuss the unresolved issues and provide several potential avenues for future research.

- **Summary**: Stable imaging in adverse environments (e.g., total darkness) makes thermal infrared (TIR) cameras a prevalent option for night scene perception. However, the low contrast and lack of chromaticity of TIR images are detrimental to human interpretation and subsequent deployment of RGB-based vision algorithms. Therefore, it makes sense to colorize the nighttime TIR images by translating them into the corresponding daytime color images (NTIR2DC). Despite the impressive progress made in the NTIR2DC task, how to improve the translation performance of small object classes is under-explored. To address this problem, we propose a generative adversarial network incorporating feedback-based object appearance learning (FoalGAN). Specifically, an occlusion-aware mixup module and corresponding appearance consistency loss are proposed to reduce the context dependence of object translation. As a representative example of small objects in nighttime street scenes, we illustrate how to enhance the realism of traffic light by designing a traffic light appearance loss. To further improve the appearance learning of small objects, we devise a dual feedback learning strategy to selectively adjust the learning frequency of different samples. In addition, we provide pixel-level annotation for a subset of the Brno dataset, which can facilitate the research of NTIR image understanding under multiple weather conditions. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed FoalGAN is not only effective for appearance learning of small objects, but also outperforms other image translation methods in terms of semantic preservation and edge consistency for the NTIR2DC task.

- **Summary**: 3D scene segmentation based on neural implicit representation has emerged recently with the advantage of training only on 2D supervision. However, existing approaches still requires expensive per-scene optimization that prohibits generalization to novel scenes during inference. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a generalizable 3D segmentation framework based on implicit representation. Specifically, our framework takes in multi-view image features and semantic maps as the inputs instead of only spatial information to avoid overfitting to scene-specific geometric and semantic information. We propose a novel soft voting mechanism to aggregate the 2D semantic information from different views for each 3D point. In addition to the image features, view difference information is also encoded in our framework to predict the voting scores. Intuitively, this allows the semantic information from nearby views to contribute more compared to distant ones. Furthermore, a visibility module is also designed to detect and filter out detrimental information from occluded views. Due to the generalizability of our proposed method, we can synthesize semantic maps or conduct 3D semantic segmentation for novel scenes with solely 2D semantic supervision. Experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable performance with scene-specific approaches. More importantly, our approach can even outperform existing strong supervision-based approaches with only 2D annotations. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/HLinChen/GNeSF.



### Query-adaptive DETR for Crowded Pedestrian Detection

- **Summary**: DEtection TRansformer (DETR) and its variants (DETRs) have been successfully applied to crowded pedestrian detection, which achieved promising performance. However, we find that, in different degrees of crowded scenes, the number of DETRs' queries must be adjusted manually, otherwise, the performance would degrade to varying degrees. In this paper, we first analyze the two current query generation methods and summarize four guidelines for designing the adaptive query generation method. Then, we propose Rank-based Adaptive Query Generation (RAQG) to alleviate the problem. Specifically, we design a rank prediction head that can predict the rank of the lowest confidence positive training sample produced by the encoder. Based on the predicted rank, we design an adaptive selection method that can adaptively select coarse detection results produced by the encoder to generate queries. Moreover, to train the rank prediction head better, we propose Soft Gradient L1 Loss. The gradient of Soft Gradient L1 Loss is continuous, which can describe the relationship between the loss value and the updated value of model parameters granularly. Our method is simple and effective, which can be plugged into any DETRs to make it query-adaptive in theory. The experimental results on Crowdhuman dataset and Citypersons dataset show that our method can adaptively generate queries for DETRs and achieve competitive results. Especially, our method achieves state-of-the-art 39.4% MR on Crowdhuman dataset.

- **Summary**: Interpretability is often an essential requirement in medical imaging. Advanced deep learning methods are required to address this need for explainability and high performance. In this work, we investigate whether additional information available during the training process can be used to create an understandable and powerful model. We propose an innovative solution called Proto-Caps that leverages the benefits of capsule networks, prototype learning and the use of privileged information. Evaluating the proposed solution on the LIDC-IDRI dataset shows that it combines increased interpretability with above state-of-the-art prediction performance. Compared to the explainable baseline model, our method achieves more than 6 % higher accuracy in predicting both malignancy (93.0 %) and mean characteristic features of lung nodules. Simultaneously, the model provides case-based reasoning with prototype representations that allow visual validation of radiologist-defined attributes.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances on a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks. We observe that the LLMs provide effective priors in exploiting $\textit{linguistic shortcuts}$ for temporal and causal reasoning in Video Question Answering (VideoQA). However, such priors often cause suboptimal results on VideoQA by leading the model to over-rely on questions, $\textit{i.e.}$, $\textit{linguistic bias}$, while ignoring visual content. This is also known as `ungrounded guesses' or `hallucinations'. To address this problem while leveraging LLMs' prior on VideoQA, we propose a novel framework, Flipped-VQA, encouraging the model to predict all the combinations of $\langle$V, Q, A$\rangle$ triplet by flipping the source pair and the target label to understand their complex relationships, $\textit{i.e.}$, predict A, Q, and V given a VQ, VA, and QA pairs, respectively. In this paper, we develop LLaMA-VQA by applying Flipped-VQA to LLaMA, and it outperforms both LLMs-based and non-LLMs-based models on five challenging VideoQA benchmarks. Furthermore, our Flipped-VQA is a general framework that is applicable to various LLMs (OPT and GPT-J) and consistently improves their performances. We empirically demonstrate that Flipped-VQA not only enhances the exploitation of linguistic shortcuts but also mitigates the linguistic bias, which causes incorrect answers over-relying on the question.

- **Summary**: Recent studies on semi-supervised learning (SSL) have achieved great success. Despite their promising performance, current state-of-the-art methods tend toward increasingly complex designs at the cost of introducing more network components and additional training procedures. In this paper, we propose a simple method named Ensemble Projectors Aided for Semi-supervised Learning (EPASS), which focuses mainly on improving the learned embeddings to boost the performance of the existing contrastive joint-training semi-supervised learning frameworks. Unlike standard methods, where the learned embeddings from one projector are stored in memory banks to be used with contrastive learning, EPASS stores the ensemble embeddings from multiple projectors in memory banks. As a result, EPASS improves generalization, strengthens feature representation, and boosts performance. For instance, EPASS improves strong baselines for semi-supervised learning by 39.47\%/31.39\%/24.70\% top-1 error rate, while using only 100k/1\%/10\% of labeled data for SimMatch, and achieves 40.24\%/32.64\%/25.90\% top-1 error rate for CoMatch on the ImageNet dataset. These improvements are consistent across methods, network architectures, and datasets, proving the general effectiveness of the proposed methods.

- **Summary**: High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. Nonetheless, the inherent limitation of MRI resolution restricts its widespread applicability. Deep learning-based image super-resolution (SR) methods exhibit promise in improving MRI resolution without additional cost. However, these methods frequently require a substantial number of HR MRI images for training, which can be challenging to acquire. In this paper, we propose an unpaired MRI SR approach that employs self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance SR performance with limited training data. Our approach leverages both authentic HR images and synthetically generated SR images to construct positive and negative sample pairs, thus facilitating the learning of discriminative features. Empirical results presented in this study underscore significant enhancements in the peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index, even when a paucity of HR images is available. These findings accentuate the potential of our approach in addressing the challenge of limited training data, thereby contributing to the advancement of high-resolution MRI in clinical applications.

- **Summary**: MRI scans provide valuable medical information, however they also contain sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII) that needs to be protected. Whereas MRI metadata is easily sanitized, MRI image data is a privacy risk because it contains information to render highly-realistic 3D visualizations of a patient's head, enabling malicious actors to possibly identify the subject by cross-referencing a database. Data anonymization and de-identification is concerned with ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of individuals' personal information. Traditional MRI de-identification methods remove privacy-sensitive parts (e.g. eyes, nose etc.) from a given scan. This comes at the expense of introducing a domain shift that can throw off downstream analyses. Recently, a GAN-based approach was proposed to de-identify a patient's scan by remodeling it (e.g. changing the face) rather than by removing parts. In this work, we propose CP-MAE, a model that de-identifies the face using masked autoencoders and that outperforms all previous approaches in terms of downstream task performance as well as de-identification. With our method we are able to synthesize scans of resolution up to $256^3$ (previously 128 cubic) which constitutes an eight-fold increase in the number of voxels. Using our construction we were able to design a system that exhibits a highly robust training stage, making it easy to fit the network on novel data.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become popular in recent years because it allows the training of a model using a large amount of unlabeled data. However, one issue that many SSL methods face is the confirmation bias, which occurs when the model is overfitted to the small labeled training dataset and produces overconfident, incorrect predictions. To address this issue, we propose SequenceMatch, an efficient SSL method that utilizes multiple data augmentations. The key element of SequenceMatch is the inclusion of a medium augmentation for unlabeled data. By taking advantage of different augmentations and the consistency constraints between each pair of augmented examples, SequenceMatch helps reduce the divergence between the prediction distribution of the model for weakly and strongly augmented examples. In addition, SequenceMatch defines two different consistency constraints for high and low-confidence predictions. As a result, SequenceMatch is more data-efficient than ReMixMatch, and more time-efficient than both ReMixMatch ($\times4$) and CoMatch ($\times2$) while having higher accuracy. Despite its simplicity, SequenceMatch consistently outperforms prior methods on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and STL-10. It also surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, with a 38.46\% error rate.

- **Summary**: Automatic aorta segmentation from 3-D medical volumes is an important yet difficult task. Several factors make the problem challenging, e.g. the possibility of aortic dissection or the difficulty with segmenting and annotating the small branches. This work presents a contribution by the MedGIFT team to the SEG.A challenge organized during the MICCAI 2023 conference. We propose a fully automated algorithm based on deep encoder-decoder architecture. The main assumption behind our work is that data preprocessing and augmentation are much more important than the deep architecture, especially in low data regimes. Therefore, the solution is based on a variant of traditional convolutional U-Net. The proposed solution achieved a Dice score above 0.9 for all testing cases with the highest stability among all participants. The method scored 1st, 4th, and 3rd in terms of the clinical evaluation, quantitative results, and volumetric meshing quality, respectively. We freely release the source code, pretrained model, and provide access to the algorithm on the Grand-Challenge platform.

- **Summary**: Natural scene analysis and remote sensing imagery offer immense potential for advancements in large-scale language-guided context-aware data utilization. This potential is particularly significant for enhancing performance in downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation with designed language prompting. In light of this, we introduce the CPSeg, Chain-of-Thought Language Prompting for Finer-grained Semantic Segmentation), an innovative framework designed to augment image segmentation performance by integrating a novel "Chain-of-Thought" process that harnesses textual information associated with images. This groundbreaking approach has been applied to a flood disaster scenario. CPSeg encodes prompt texts derived from various sentences to formulate a coherent chain-of-thought. We propose a new vision-language dataset, FloodPrompt, which includes images, semantic masks, and corresponding text information. This not only strengthens the semantic understanding of the scenario but also aids in the key task of semantic segmentation through an interplay of pixel and text matching maps. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses validate the effectiveness of CPSeg.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made its way into various scientific fields, providing astonishing improvements over existing algorithms for a wide variety of tasks. In recent years, there have been severe concerns over the trustworthiness of AI technologies. The scientific community has focused on the development of trustworthy AI algorithms. However, machine and deep learning algorithms, popular in the AI community today, depend heavily on the data used during their development. These learning algorithms identify patterns in the data, learning the behavioral objective. Any flaws in the data have the potential to translate directly into algorithms. In this study, we discuss the importance of Responsible Machine Learning Datasets and propose a framework to evaluate the datasets through a responsible rubric. While existing work focuses on the post-hoc evaluation of algorithms for their trustworthiness, we provide a framework that considers the data component separately to understand its role in the algorithm. We discuss responsible datasets through the lens of fairness, privacy, and regulatory compliance and provide recommendations for constructing future datasets. After surveying over 100 datasets, we use 60 datasets for analysis and demonstrate that none of these datasets is immune to issues of fairness, privacy preservation, and regulatory compliance. We provide modifications to the ``datasheets for datasets" with important additions for improved dataset documentation. With governments around the world regularizing data protection laws, the method for the creation of datasets in the scientific community requires revision. We believe this study is timely and relevant in today's era of AI.

- **Summary**: Dynamic scene graph generation (SGG) from videos requires not only comprehensive understanding of objects across the scenes that are prone to temporal fluctuations but also a model the temporal motions and interactions with different objects. Moreover, the long-tailed distribution of visual relationships is the crucial bottleneck of most dynamic SGG methods, since most of them focus on capturing spatio-temporal context using complex architectures, which leads to the generation of biased scene graphs. To address these challenges, we propose FloCoDe: Flow-aware temporal consistency and Correlation Debiasing with uncertainty attenuation for unbiased dynamic scene graphs. FloCoDe employs feature warping using flow to detect temporally consistent objects across the frames. In addition, it uses correlation debiasing to learn the unbiased relation representation for long-tailed classes. Moreover, to attenuate the predictive uncertainties, it uses a mixture of sigmoidal cross-entropy loss and contrastive loss to incorporate label correlations to identify the commonly co-occurring relations and help debias the long-tailed ones. Extensive experimental evaluation shows a performance gain as high as 4.1% showing the superiority of generating more unbiased scene graphs.

- **Summary**: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis of coronary artery disease, the most common cause of death worldwide. While this procedure is performed more than 2 million times annually, there remain few methods for fast and accurate automated measurement of disease and localization of coronary anatomy. Here, we present our solution to the Automatic Region-based Coronary Artery Disease diagnostics using X-ray angiography images (ARCADE) challenge held at MICCAI 2023. For the artery segmentation task, our three-stage approach combines preprocessing and feature selection by classical computer vision to enhance vessel contrast, followed by an ensemble model based on YOLOv8 to propose possible vessel candidates by generating a vessel map. A final segmentation is based on a logic-based approach to reconstruct the coronary tree in a graph-based sorting method. Our entry to the ARCADE challenge placed 3rd overall. Using the official metric for evaluation, we achieved an F1 score of 0.422 and 0.4289 on the validation and hold-out sets respectively.

- **Summary**: While deep learning has significantly improved ReID model accuracy under the independent and identical distribution (IID) assumption, it has also become clear that such models degrade notably when applied to an unseen novel domain due to unpredictable/unknown domain shift. Contemporary domain generalization (DG) ReID models struggle in learning domain-invariant representation solely through training on an instance classification objective. We consider that a deep learning model is heavily influenced and therefore biased towards domain-specific characteristics, e.g., background clutter, scale and viewpoint variations, limiting the generalizability of the learned model, and hypothesize that the pedestrians are domain invariant owning they share the same structural characteristics. To enable the ReID model to be less domain-specific from these pure pedestrians, we introduce a method that guides model learning of the primary ReID instance classification objective by a concurrent auxiliary learning objective on weakly labeled pedestrian saliency detection. To solve the problem of conflicting optimization criteria in the model parameter space between the two learning objectives, we introduce a Primary-Auxiliary Objectives Association (PAOA) mechanism to calibrate the loss gradients of the auxiliary task towards the primary learning task gradients. Benefiting from the harmonious multitask learning design, our model can be extended with the recent test-time diagram to form the PAOA+, which performs on-the-fly optimization against the auxiliary objective in order to maximize the model's generative capacity in the test target domain. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PAOA model.

- **Summary**: Pose-guided person image synthesis task requires re-rendering a reference image, which should have a photorealistic appearance and flawless pose transfer. Since person images are highly structured, existing approaches require dense connections for complex deformations and occlusions because these are generally handled through multi-level warping and masking in latent space. But the feature maps generated by convolutional neural networks do not have equivariance, and hence even the multi-level warping does not have a perfect pose alignment. Inspired by the ability of the diffusion model to generate photorealistic images from the given conditional guidance, we propose recurrent pose alignment to provide pose-aligned texture features as conditional guidance. Moreover, we propose gradient guidance from pose interaction fields, which output the distance from the valid pose manifold given a target pose as input. This helps in learning plausible pose transfer trajectories that result in photorealism and undistorted texture details. Extensive results on two large-scale benchmarks and a user study demonstrate the ability of our proposed approach to generate photorealistic pose transfer under challenging scenarios. Additionally, we prove the efficiency of gradient guidance in pose-guided image generation on the HumanArt dataset with fine-tuned stable diffusion.

- **Summary**: Identifying individuals in unconstrained video settings is a valuable yet challenging task in biometric analysis due to variations in appearances, environments, degradations, and occlusions. In this paper, we present ShARc, a multimodal approach for video-based person identification in uncontrolled environments that emphasizes 3-D body shape, pose, and appearance. We introduce two encoders: a Pose and Shape Encoder (PSE) and an Aggregated Appearance Encoder (AAE). PSE encodes the body shape via binarized silhouettes, skeleton motions, and 3-D body shape, while AAE provides two levels of temporal appearance feature aggregation: attention-based feature aggregation and averaging aggregation. For attention-based feature aggregation, we employ spatial and temporal attention to focus on key areas for person distinction. For averaging aggregation, we introduce a novel flattening layer after averaging to extract more distinguishable information and reduce overfitting of attention. We utilize centroid feature averaging for gallery registration. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods on public datasets, including CCVID, MEVID, and BRIAR.

- **Summary**: Scene synthesis is a challenging problem with several industrial applications. Recently, substantial efforts have been directed to synthesize the scene using human motions, room layouts, or spatial graphs as the input. However, few studies have addressed this problem from multiple modalities, especially combining text prompts. In this paper, we propose a language-driven scene synthesis task, which is a new task that integrates text prompts, human motion, and existing objects for scene synthesis. Unlike other single-condition synthesis tasks, our problem involves multiple conditions and requires a strategy for processing and encoding them into a unified space. To address the challenge, we present a multi-conditional diffusion model, which differs from the implicit unification approach of other diffusion literature by explicitly predicting the guiding points for the original data distribution. We demonstrate that our approach is theoretically supportive. The intensive experiment results illustrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks and enables natural scene editing applications.

- **Summary**: While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success across a range of medical image analysis tasks, deployment of these models in real clinical contexts requires that they be robust to variability in the acquired images. While many methods apply predefined transformations to augment the training data to enhance test-time robustness, these transformations may not ensure the model's robustness to the diverse variability seen in patient images. In this paper, we introduce a novel three-stage approach based on transformers coupled with conditional diffusion models, with the goal of improving model robustness to the kinds of imaging variability commonly encountered in practice without the need for pre-determined data augmentation strategies. To this end, multiple image encoders first learn hierarchical feature representations to build discriminative latent spaces. Next, a reverse diffusion process, guided by the latent code, acts on an informative prior and proposes prediction candidates in a generative manner. Finally, several prediction candidates are aggregated in a bi-level aggregation protocol to produce the final output. Through extensive experiments on medical imaging benchmark datasets, we show that our method improves upon state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and confidence calibration. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to quantify the prediction uncertainty at the instance level, increasing their trustworthiness to clinicians using them in clinical practice.



### Decoupled DETR: Spatially Disentangling Localization and Classification for Improved End-to-End Object Detection

- **Summary**: The introduction of DETR represents a new paradigm for object detection. However, its decoder conducts classification and box localization using shared queries and cross-attention layers, leading to suboptimal results. We observe that different regions of interest in the visual feature map are suitable for performing query classification and box localization tasks, even for the same object. Salient regions provide vital information for classification, while the boundaries around them are more favorable for box regression. Unfortunately, such spatial misalignment between these two tasks greatly hinders DETR's training. Therefore, in this work, we focus on decoupling localization and classification tasks in DETR. To achieve this, we introduce a new design scheme called spatially decoupled DETR (SD-DETR), which includes a task-aware query generation module and a disentangled feature learning process. We elaborately design the task-aware query initialization process and divide the cross-attention block in the decoder to allow the task-aware queries to match different visual regions. Meanwhile, we also observe that the prediction misalignment problem for high classification confidence and precise localization exists, so we propose an alignment loss to further guide the spatially decoupled DETR training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant improvement in MSCOCO datasets compared to previous work. For instance, we improve the performance of Conditional DETR by 4.5 AP. By spatially disentangling the two tasks, our method overcomes the misalignment problem and greatly improves the performance of DETR for object detection.

- **Summary**: Dynamic Digital Humans (DDHs) are 3D digital models that are animated using predefined motions and are inevitably bothered by noise/shift during the generation process and compression distortion during the transmission process, which needs to be perceptually evaluated. Usually, DDHs are displayed as 2D rendered animation videos and it is natural to adapt video quality assessment (VQA) methods to DDH quality assessment (DDH-QA) tasks. However, the VQA methods are highly dependent on viewpoints and less sensitive to geometry-based distortions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel no-reference (NR) geometry-aware video quality assessment method for DDH-QA challenge. Geometry characteristics are described by the statistical parameters estimated from the DDHs' geometry attribute distributions. Spatial and temporal features are acquired from the rendered videos. Finally, all kinds of features are integrated and regressed into quality values. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DDH-QA database.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to Single-Positive Multi-label Learning. In general multi-label learning, a model learns to predict multiple labels or categories for a single input image. This is in contrast with standard multi-class image classification, where the task is predicting a single label from many possible labels for an image. Single-Positive Multi-label Learning (SPML) specifically considers learning to predict multiple labels when there is only a single annotation per image in the training data. Multi-label learning is in many ways a more realistic task than single-label learning as real-world data often involves instances belonging to multiple categories simultaneously; however, most common computer vision datasets predominantly contain single labels due to the inherent complexity and cost of collecting multiple high quality annotations for each instance. We propose a novel approach called Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling (VLPL), which uses a vision-language model to suggest strong positive and negative pseudo-labels, and outperforms the current SOTA methods by 5.5% on Pascal VOC, 18.4% on MS-COCO, 15.2% on NUS-WIDE, and 8.4% on CUB-Birds. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/mvrl/VLPL.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in fine-grained representation learning leverage local-to-global (emergent) relationships for achieving state-of-the-art results. The relational representations relied upon by such methods, however, are abstract. We aim to deconstruct this abstraction by expressing them as interpretable graphs over image views. We begin by theoretically showing that abstract relational representations are nothing but a way of recovering transitive relationships among local views. Based on this, we design Transitivity Recovering Decompositions (TRD), a graph-space search algorithm that identifies interpretable equivalents of abstract emergent relationships at both instance and class levels, and with no post-hoc computations. We additionally show that TRD is provably robust to noisy views, with empirical evidence also supporting this finding. The latter allows TRD to perform at par or even better than the state-of-the-art, while being fully interpretable. Implementation is available at https://github.com/abhrac/trd.

- **Summary**: In the field of image processing, applying intricate semantic modifications within existing images remains an enduring challenge. This paper introduces a pioneering framework that integrates viewpoint information to enhance the control of image editing tasks. By surveying existing object editing methodologies, we distill three essential criteria, consistency, controllability, and harmony, that should be met for an image editing method. In contrast to previous approaches, our method takes the lead in satisfying all three requirements for addressing the challenge of image synthesis. Through comprehensive experiments, encompassing both quantitative assessments and qualitative comparisons with contemporary state-of-the-art methods, we present compelling evidence of our framework's superior performance across multiple dimensions. This work establishes a promising avenue for advancing image synthesis techniques and empowering precise object modifications while preserving the visual coherence of the entire composition.

- **Summary**: Humans watch more than a billion hours of video per day. Most of this video was edited manually, which is a tedious process. However, AI-enabled video-generation and video-editing is on the rise. Building on text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion and Imagen, generative AI has improved dramatically on video tasks. But it's hard to evaluate progress in these video tasks because there is no standard benchmark. So, we propose a new dataset for text-guided video editing (TGVE), and we run a competition at CVPR to evaluate models on our TGVE dataset. In this paper we present a retrospective on the competition and describe the winning method. The competition dataset is available at https://sites.google.com/view/loveucvpr23/track4.

- **Summary**: Imitation learning from human demonstrations can teach robots complex manipulation skills, but is time-consuming and labor intensive. In contrast, Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) systems are automated and excel at solving long-horizon tasks, but they are difficult to apply to contact-rich tasks. In this paper, we present Human-in-the-Loop Task and Motion Planning (HITL-TAMP), a novel system that leverages the benefits of both approaches. The system employs a TAMP-gated control mechanism, which selectively gives and takes control to and from a human teleoperator. This enables the human teleoperator to manage a fleet of robots, maximizing data collection efficiency. The collected human data is then combined with an imitation learning framework to train a TAMP-gated policy, leading to superior performance compared to training on full task demonstrations. We compared HITL-TAMP to a conventional teleoperation system -- users gathered more than 3x the number of demos given the same time budget. Furthermore, proficient agents (75\%+ success) could be trained from just 10 minutes of non-expert teleoperation data. Finally, we collected 2.1K demos with HITL-TAMP across 12 contact-rich, long-horizon tasks and show that the system often produces near-perfect agents.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we develop a modular neural network for real-time semantic mapping in uncertain environments, which explicitly updates per-voxel probabilistic distributions within a neural network layer. Our approach combines the reliability of classical probabilistic algorithms with the performance and efficiency of modern neural networks. Although robotic perception is often divided between modern differentiable methods and classical explicit methods, a union of both is necessary for real-time and trustworthy performance. We introduce a novel Convolutional Bayesian Kernel Inference (ConvBKI) layer which incorporates semantic segmentation predictions online into a 3D map through a depthwise convolution layer by leveraging conjugate priors. We compare ConvBKI against state-of-the-art deep learning approaches and probabilistic algorithms for mapping to evaluate reliability and performance. We also create a Robot Operating System (ROS) package of ConvBKI and test it on real-world perceptually challenging off-road driving data.

- **Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously data-inefficient, which makes training on a real robot difficult. While model-based RL algorithms (world models) improve data-efficiency to some extent, they still require hours or days of interaction to learn skills. Recently, offline RL has been proposed as a framework for training RL policies on pre-existing datasets without any online interaction. However, constraining an algorithm to a fixed dataset induces a state-action distribution shift between training and inference, and limits its applicability to new tasks. In this work, we seek to get the best of both worlds: we consider the problem of pretraining a world model with offline data collected on a real robot, and then finetuning the model on online data collected by planning with the learned model. To mitigate extrapolation errors during online interaction, we propose to regularize the planner at test-time by balancing estimated returns and (epistemic) model uncertainty. We evaluate our method on a variety of visuo-motor control tasks in simulation and on a real robot, and find that our method enables few-shot finetuning to seen and unseen tasks even when offline data is limited.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved promising zero-shot accuracy on visual question answering (VQA) -- a fundamental task affecting various downstream applications and domains. Given the great potential for the broad use of these models, it is important to investigate their limitations in dealing with different image and question properties. In this work, we investigate whether multimodal LLMs can perceive small details as well as large details in images. In particular, we show that their zero-shot accuracy in answering visual questions is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, declining up to $46\%$ with size. Furthermore, we show that this effect is causal by observing that human visual cropping can significantly mitigate their sensitivity to size. Inspired by the usefulness of human cropping, we then propose three automatic visual cropping methods as inference time mechanisms to improve the zero-shot performance of multimodal LLMs. We study their effectiveness on four popular VQA datasets, and a subset of the VQAv2 dataset tailored towards fine visual details. Our findings suggest that multimodal LLMs should be used with caution in detail-sensitive VQA applications, and that visual cropping is a promising direction to improve their zero-shot performance. Our code and data are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recent works such as VisProg and ViperGPT have smartly composed foundation models for visual reasoning-using large language models (LLMs) to produce programs that can be executed by pre-trained vision-language models. However, they operate in limited domains, such as 2D images, not fully exploiting the generalization of language: abstract concepts like "left" can also be grounded in 3D, temporal, and action data, as in moving to your left. This limited generalization stems from these inference-only methods' inability to learn or adapt pre-trained models to a new domain. We propose the Logic-Enhanced Foundation Model (LEFT), a unified framework that learns to ground and reason with concepts across domains with a differentiable, domain-independent, first-order logic-based program executor. LEFT has an LLM interpreter that outputs a program represented in a general, logic-based reasoning language, which is shared across all domains and tasks. LEFT's executor then executes the program with trainable domain-specific grounding modules. We show that LEFT flexibly learns concepts in four domains: 2D images, 3D scenes, human motions, and robotic manipulation. It exhibits strong reasoning ability in a wide variety of tasks, including those that are complex and not seen during training, and can be easily applied to new domains.

- **Summary**: We introduce Stanford-ORB, a new real-world 3D Object inverse Rendering Benchmark. Recent advances in inverse rendering have enabled a wide range of real-world applications in 3D content generation, moving rapidly from research and commercial use cases to consumer devices. While the results continue to improve, there is no real-world benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of various inverse rendering methods. Existing real-world datasets typically only consist of the shape and multi-view images of objects, which are not sufficient for evaluating the quality of material recovery and object relighting. Methods capable of recovering material and lighting often resort to synthetic data for quantitative evaluation, which on the other hand does not guarantee generalization to complex real-world environments. We introduce a new dataset of real-world objects captured under a variety of natural scenes with ground-truth 3D scans, multi-view images, and environment lighting. Using this dataset, we establish the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for object inverse rendering tasks from in-the-wild scenes, and compare the performance of various existing methods.

- **Summary**: Hallucination is a big shadow hanging over the rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), referring to the phenomenon that the generated text is inconsistent with the image content. In order to mitigate hallucinations, existing studies mainly resort to an instruction-tuning manner that requires retraining the models with specific data. In this paper, we pave a different way, introducing a training-free method named Woodpecker. Like a woodpecker heals trees, it picks out and corrects hallucinations from the generated text. Concretely, Woodpecker consists of five stages: key concept extraction, question formulation, visual knowledge validation, visual claim generation, and hallucination correction. Implemented in a post-remedy manner, Woodpecker can easily serve different MLLMs, while being interpretable by accessing intermediate outputs of the five stages. We evaluate Woodpecker both quantitatively and qualitatively and show the huge potential of this new paradigm. On the POPE benchmark, our method obtains a 30.66%/24.33% improvement in accuracy over the baseline MiniGPT-4/mPLUG-Owl. The source code is released at https://github.com/BradyFU/Woodpecker.

- **Summary**: Image restoration problems are typically ill-posed in the sense that each degraded image can be restored in infinitely many valid ways. To accommodate this, many works generate a diverse set of outputs by attempting to randomly sample from the posterior distribution of natural images given the degraded input. Here we argue that this strategy is commonly of limited practical value because of the heavy tail of the posterior distribution. Consider for example inpainting a missing region of the sky in an image. Since there is a high probability that the missing region contains no object but clouds, any set of samples from the posterior would be entirely dominated by (practically identical) completions of sky. However, arguably, presenting users with only one clear sky completion, along with several alternative solutions such as airships, birds, and balloons, would better outline the set of possibilities. In this paper, we initiate the study of meaningfully diverse image restoration. We explore several post-processing approaches that can be combined with any diverse image restoration method to yield semantically meaningful diversity. Moreover, we propose a practical approach for allowing diffusion based image restoration methods to generate meaningfully diverse outputs, while incurring only negligent computational overhead. We conduct extensive user studies to analyze the proposed techniques, and find the strategy of reducing similarity between outputs to be significantly favorable over posterior sampling.

- **Summary**: This study leverages synthetic data as a validation set to reduce overfitting and ease the selection of the best model in AI development. While synthetic data have been used for augmenting the training set, we find that synthetic data can also significantly diversify the validation set, offering marked advantages in domains like healthcare, where data are typically limited, sensitive, and from out-domain sources (i.e., hospitals). In this study, we illustrate the effectiveness of synthetic data for early cancer detection in computed tomography (CT) volumes, where synthetic tumors are generated and superimposed onto healthy organs, thereby creating an extensive dataset for rigorous validation. Using synthetic data as validation can improve AI robustness in both in-domain and out-domain test sets. Furthermore, we establish a new continual learning framework that continuously trains AI models on a stream of out-domain data with synthetic tumors. The AI model trained and validated in dynamically expanding synthetic data can consistently outperform models trained and validated exclusively on real-world data. Specifically, the DSC score for liver tumor segmentation improves from 26.7% (95% CI: 22.6%-30.9%) to 34.5% (30.8%-38.2%) when evaluated on an in-domain dataset and from 31.1% (26.0%-36.2%) to 35.4% (32.1%-38.7%) on an out-domain dataset. Importantly, the performance gain is particularly significant in identifying very tiny liver tumors (radius < 5mm) in CT volumes, with Sensitivity improving from 33.1% to 55.4% on an in-domain dataset and 33.9% to 52.3% on an out-domain dataset, justifying the efficacy in early detection of cancer. The application of synthetic data, from both training and validation perspectives, underlines a promising avenue to enhance AI robustness when dealing with data from varying domains.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. A prominent way to exploit unlabeled data is to regularize model predictions. Since the predictions of unlabeled data can be unreliable, uncertainty-aware schemes are typically employed to gradually learn from meaningful and reliable predictions. Uncertainty estimation methods, however, rely on multiple inferences from the model predictions that must be computed for each training step, which is computationally expensive. Moreover, these uncertainty maps capture pixel-wise disparities and do not consider global information. This work proposes a novel method to estimate segmentation uncertainty by leveraging global information from the segmentation masks. More precisely, an anatomically-aware representation is first learnt to model the available segmentation masks. The learnt representation thereupon maps the prediction of a new segmentation into an anatomically-plausible segmentation. The deviation from the plausible segmentation aids in estimating the underlying pixel-level uncertainty in order to further guide the segmentation network. The proposed method consequently estimates the uncertainty using a single inference from our representation, thereby reducing the total computation. We evaluate our method on two publicly available segmentation datasets of left atria in cardiac MRIs and of multiple organs in abdominal CTs. Our anatomically-aware method improves the segmentation accuracy over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods in terms of two commonly used evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: While unsupervised domain adaptation has been explored to leverage the knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, existing methods focus on the distribution alignment between two domains. However, how to better align source and target features is not well addressed. In this paper, we propose a deep feature registration (DFR) model to generate registered features that maintain domain invariant features and simultaneously minimize the domain-dissimilarity of registered features and target features via histogram matching. We further employ a pseudo label refinement process, which considers both probabilistic soft selection and center-based hard selection to improve the quality of pseudo labels in the target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple UDA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our DFR model, resulting in new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is a powerful imaging tool that has been a critical enabler for live tissue imaging. However, since most multiphoton microscopy platforms rely on point scanning, there is an inherent trade-off between acquisition time, field of view (FOV), phototoxicity, and image quality, often resulting in noisy measurements when fast, large FOV, and/or gentle imaging is needed. Deep learning could be used to denoise multiphoton microscopy measurements, but these algorithms can be prone to hallucination, which can be disastrous for medical and scientific applications. We propose a method to simultaneously denoise and predict pixel-wise uncertainty for multiphoton imaging measurements, improving algorithm trustworthiness and providing statistical guarantees for the deep learning predictions. Furthermore, we propose to leverage this learned, pixel-wise uncertainty to drive an adaptive acquisition technique that rescans only the most uncertain regions of a sample. We demonstrate our method on experimental noisy MPM measurements of human endometrium tissues, showing that we can maintain fine features and outperform other denoising methods while predicting uncertainty at each pixel. Finally, with our adaptive acquisition technique, we demonstrate a 120X reduction in acquisition time and total light dose while successfully recovering fine features in the sample. We are the first to demonstrate distribution-free uncertainty quantification for a denoising task with real experimental data and the first to propose adaptive acquisition based on reconstruction uncertainty

- **Summary**: The majority of road accidents occur because of human errors, including distraction, recklessness, and drunken driving. One of the effective ways to overcome this dangerous situation is by implementing self-driving technologies in vehicles. In this paper, we focus on building an efficient deep-learning model for self-driving cars. We propose a new and effective convolutional neural network model called `LaksNet' consisting of four convolutional layers and two fully connected layers. We conduct extensive experiments using our LaksNet model with the training data generated from the Udacity simulator. Our model outperforms many existing pre-trained ImageNet and NVIDIA models in terms of the duration of the car for which it drives without going off the track on the simulator.

- **Summary**: Achieving high-performance audio denoising is still a challenging task in real-world applications. Existing time-frequency methods often ignore the quality of generated frequency domain images. This paper converts the audio denoising problem into an image generation task. We first develop a complex image generation SwinTransformer network to capture more information from the complex Fourier domain. We then impose structure similarity and detailed loss functions to generate high-quality images and develop an SDR loss to minimize the difference between denoised and clean audios. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model is better than state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Many real-world image recognition problems, such as diagnostic medical imaging exams, are "long-tailed" $\unicode{x2013}$ there are a few common findings followed by many more relatively rare conditions. In chest radiography, diagnosis is both a long-tailed and multi-label problem, as patients often present with multiple findings simultaneously. While researchers have begun to study the problem of long-tailed learning in medical image recognition, few have studied the interaction of label imbalance and label co-occurrence posed by long-tailed, multi-label disease classification. To engage with the research community on this emerging topic, we conducted an open challenge, CXR-LT, on long-tailed, multi-label thorax disease classification from chest X-rays (CXRs). We publicly release a large-scale benchmark dataset of over 350,000 CXRs, each labeled with at least one of 26 clinical findings following a long-tailed distribution. We synthesize common themes of top-performing solutions, providing practical recommendations for long-tailed, multi-label medical image classification. Finally, we use these insights to propose a path forward involving vision-language foundation models for few- and zero-shot disease classification.

- **Summary**: Not forgetting old class knowledge is a key challenge for class-incremental learning (CIL) when the model continuously adapts to new classes. A common technique to address this is knowledge distillation (KD), which penalizes prediction inconsistencies between old and new models. Such prediction is made with almost new class data, as old class data is extremely scarce due to the strict memory limitation in CIL. In this paper, we take a deep dive into KD losses and find that "using new class data for KD" not only hinders the model adaption (for learning new classes) but also results in low efficiency for preserving old class knowledge. We address this by "using the placebos of old classes for KD", where the placebos are chosen from a free image stream, such as Google Images, in an automatical and economical fashion. To this end, we train an online placebo selection policy to quickly evaluate the quality of streaming images (good or bad placebos) and use only good ones for one-time feed-forward computation of KD. We formulate the policy training process as an online Markov Decision Process (MDP), and introduce an online learning algorithm to solve this MDP problem without causing much computation costs. In experiments, we show that our method 1) is surprisingly effective even when there is no class overlap between placebos and original old class data, 2) does not require any additional supervision or memory budget, and 3) significantly outperforms a number of top-performing CIL methods, in particular when using lower memory budgets for old class exemplars, e.g., five exemplars per class.

- **Summary**: Both humans and computational methods struggle to discriminate the depths of objects hidden beneath foliage. However, such discrimination becomes feasible when we combine computational optical synthetic aperture sensing with the human ability to fuse stereoscopic images. For object identification tasks, as required in search and rescue, wildlife observation, surveillance, and early wildfire detection, depth assists in differentiating true from false findings, such as people, animals, or vehicles vs. sun-heated patches at the ground level or in the tree crowns, or ground fires vs. tree trunks. We used video captured by a drone above dense woodland to test users' ability to discriminate depth. We found that this is impossible when viewing monoscopic video and relying on motion parallax. The same was true with stereoscopic video because of the occlusions caused by foliage. However, when synthetic aperture sensing was used to reduce occlusions and disparity-scaled stereoscopic video was presented, whereas computational (stereoscopic matching) methods were unsuccessful, human observers successfully discriminated depth. This shows the potential of systems which exploit the synergy between computational methods and human vision to perform tasks that neither can perform alone.

- **Summary**: Non-nutritive sucking (NNS), which refers to the act of sucking on a pacifier, finger, or similar object without nutrient intake, plays a crucial role in assessing healthy early development. In the case of preterm infants, NNS behavior is a key component in determining their readiness for feeding. In older infants, the characteristics of NNS behavior offer valuable insights into neural and motor development. Additionally, NNS activity has been proposed as a potential safeguard against sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However, the clinical application of NNS assessment is currently hindered by labor-intensive and subjective finger-in-mouth evaluations. Consequently, researchers often resort to expensive pressure transducers for objective NNS signal measurement. To enhance the accessibility and reliability of NNS signal monitoring for both clinicians and researchers, we introduce a vision-based algorithm designed for non-contact detection of NNS activity using baby monitor footage in natural settings. Our approach involves a comprehensive exploration of optical flow and temporal convolutional networks, enabling the detection and amplification of subtle infant-sucking signals. We successfully classify short video clips of uniform length into NNS and non-NNS periods. Furthermore, we investigate manual and learning-based techniques to piece together local classification results, facilitating the segmentation of longer mixed-activity videos into NNS and non-NNS segments of varying duration. Our research introduces two novel datasets of annotated infant videos, including one sourced from our clinical study featuring 19 infant subjects and 183 hours of overnight baby monitor footage.

- **Summary**: Accurately capturing dynamic scenes with wide-ranging motion and light intensity is crucial for many vision applications. However, acquiring high-speed high dynamic range (HDR) video is challenging because the camera's frame rate restricts its dynamic range. Existing methods sacrifice speed to acquire multi-exposure frames. Yet, misaligned motion in these frames can still pose complications for HDR fusion algorithms, resulting in artifacts. Instead of frame-based exposures, we sample the videos using individual pixels at varying exposures and phase offsets. Implemented on a pixel-wise programmable image sensor, our sampling pattern simultaneously captures fast motion at a high dynamic range. We then transform pixel-wise outputs into an HDR video using end-to-end learned weights from deep neural networks, achieving high spatiotemporal resolution with minimized motion blurring. We demonstrate aliasing-free HDR video acquisition at 1000 FPS, resolving fast motion under low-light conditions and against bright backgrounds - both challenging conditions for conventional cameras. By combining the versatility of pixel-wise sampling patterns with the strength of deep neural networks at decoding complex scenes, our method greatly enhances the vision system's adaptability and performance in dynamic conditions.

- **Summary**: Computer vision in general presented several advances such as training optimizations, new architectures (pure attention, efficient block, vision language models, generative models, among others). This have improved performance in several tasks such as classification, and others. However, the majority of these models focus on modifications that are taking distance from realistic neuroscientific approaches related to the brain. In this work, we adopt a more bio-inspired approach and present the Yin Yang Convolutional Network, an architecture that extracts visual manifold, its blocks are intended to separate analysis of colors and forms at its initial layers, simulating occipital lobe's operations. Our results shows that our architecture provides State-of-the-Art efficiency among low parameter architectures in the dataset CIFAR-10. Our first model reached 93.32\% test accuracy, 0.8\% more than the older SOTA in this category, while having 150k less parameters (726k in total). Our second model uses 52k parameters, losing only 3.86\% test accuracy. We also performed an analysis on ImageNet, where we reached 66.49\% validation accuracy with 1.6M parameters. We make the code publicly available at: https://github.com/NoSavedDATA/YinYang_CNN.

- **Summary**: Active Learning (AL) and Few Shot Learning (FSL) are two label-efficient methods which have achieved excellent results recently. However, most prior arts in both learning paradigms fail to explore the wealth of the vast unlabelled data. In this study, we address this issue in the scenario where the annotation budget is very limited, yet a large amount of unlabelled data for the target task is available. We frame this work in the context of histopathology where labelling is prohibitively expensive. To this end, we introduce an active few shot learning framework, Myriad Active Learning (MAL), including a contrastive-learning encoder, pseudo-label generation, and novel query sample selection in the loop. Specifically, we propose to massage unlabelled data in a self-supervised manner, where the obtained data representations and clustering knowledge form the basis to activate the AL loop. With feedback from the oracle in each AL cycle, the pseudo-labels of the unlabelled data are refined by optimizing a shallow task-specific net on top of the encoder. These updated pseudo-labels serve to inform and improve the active learning query selection process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel recipe to combine existing uncertainty measures and utilize the entire uncertainty list to reduce sample redundancy in AL. Extensive experiments on two public histopathology datasets show that MAL has superior test accuracy, macro F1-score, and label efficiency compared to prior works, and can achieve a comparable test accuracy to a fully supervised algorithm while labelling only 5% of the dataset.

- **Summary**: We present a method for generating consistent novel views from a single source image. Our approach focuses on maximizing the reuse of visible pixels from the source image. To achieve this, we use a monocular depth estimator that transfers visible pixels from the source view to the target view. Starting from a pre-trained 2D inpainting diffusion model, we train our method on the large-scale Objaverse dataset to learn 3D object priors. While training we use a novel masking mechanism based on epipolar lines to further improve the quality of our approach. This allows our framework to perform zero-shot novel view synthesis on a variety of objects. We evaluate the zero-shot abilities of our framework on three challenging datasets: Google Scanned Objects, Ray Traced Multiview, and Common Objects in 3D.

- **Summary**: In recent years, medical image segmentation has become an important application in the field of computer-aided diagnosis. In this paper, we are the first to propose a new graph convolution-based decoder namely, Cascaded Graph Convolutional Attention Decoder (G-CASCADE), for 2D medical image segmentation. G-CASCADE progressively refines multi-stage feature maps generated by hierarchical transformer encoders with an efficient graph convolution block. The encoder utilizes the self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies, while the decoder refines the feature maps preserving long-range information due to the global receptive fields of the graph convolution block. Rigorous evaluations of our decoder with multiple transformer encoders on five medical image segmentation tasks (i.e., Abdomen organs, Cardiac organs, Polyp lesions, Skin lesions, and Retinal vessels) show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We also demonstrate that our decoder achieves better DICE scores than the SOTA CASCADE decoder with 80.8% fewer parameters and 82.3% fewer FLOPs. Our decoder can easily be used with other hierarchical encoders for general-purpose semantic and medical image segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: The autoencoder is an unsupervised learning paradigm that aims to create a compact latent representation of data by minimizing the reconstruction loss. However, it tends to overlook the fact that most data (images) are embedded in a lower-dimensional space, which is crucial for effective data representation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Low-Rank Autoencoder (LoRAE). In LoRAE, we incorporated a low-rank regularizer to adaptively reconstruct a low-dimensional latent space while preserving the basic objective of an autoencoder. This helps embed the data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving important information. It is a simple autoencoder extension that learns low-rank latent space. Theoretically, we establish a tighter error bound for our model. Empirically, our model's superiority shines through various tasks such as image generation and downstream classification. Both theoretical and practical outcomes highlight the importance of acquiring low-dimensional embeddings.

- **Summary**: Satellites are increasingly adopting on-board Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance platforms' autonomy through edge inference. In this context, the utilization of deep learning (DL) techniques for segmentation in HS satellite imagery offers advantages for remote sensing applications, and therefore, we train 16 different models, whose codes are made available through our study, which we consider to be relevant for on-board multi-class segmentation of HS imagery, focusing on classifying oceanic (sea), terrestrial (land), and cloud formations. We employ the HYPSO-1 mission as an illustrative case for sea-land-cloud segmentation, and to demonstrate the utility of the segments, we introduce a novel sea-land-cloud ranking application scenario. Our system prioritizes HS image downlink based on sea, land, and cloud coverage levels from the segmented images. We comparatively evaluate the models for in-orbit deployment, considering performance, parameter count, and inference time. The models include both shallow and deep models, and after we propose four new DL models, we demonstrate that segmenting single spectral signatures (1D) outperforms 3D data processing comprising both spectral (1D) and spatial (2D) contexts. We conclude that our lightweight DL model, called 1D-Justo-LiuNet, consistently surpasses state-of-the-art models for sea-land-cloud segmentation, such as U-Net and its variations, in terms of performance (0.93 accuracy) and parameter count (4,563). However, the 1D models present longer inference time (15s) in the tested processing architecture, which is clearly suboptimal. Finally, after demonstrating that in-orbit image segmentation should occur post L1b radiance calibration rather than on raw data, we additionally show that reducing spectral channels down to 3 lowers models' parameters and inference time, at the cost of weaker segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Accurate detection of individual tree crowns from remote sensing data poses a significant challenge due to the dense nature of forest canopy and the presence of diverse environmental variations, e.g., overlapping canopies, occlusions, and varying lighting conditions. Additionally, the lack of data for training robust models adds another limitation in effectively studying complex forest conditions. This paper presents a novel method for detecting shadowed tree crowns and provides a challenging dataset comprising roughly 50k paired RGB-thermal images to facilitate future research for illumination-invariant detection. The proposed method (ShadowSense) is entirely self-supervised, leveraging domain adversarial training without source domain annotations for feature extraction and foreground feature alignment for feature pyramid networks to adapt domain-invariant representations by focusing on visible foreground regions, respectively. It then fuses complementary information of both modalities to effectively improve upon the predictions of an RGB-trained detector and boost the overall accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over both the baseline RGB-trained detector and state-of-the-art techniques that rely on unsupervised domain adaptation or early image fusion.

- **Summary**: Real-world data is complex and often consists of objects that can be decomposed into multiple entities (e.g. images into pixels, graphs into interconnected nodes). Randomized smoothing is a powerful framework for making models provably robust against small changes to their inputs - by guaranteeing robustness of the majority vote when randomly adding noise before classification. Yet, certifying robustness on such complex data via randomized smoothing is challenging when adversaries do not arbitrarily perturb entire objects (e.g. images) but only a subset of their entities (e.g. pixels). As a solution, we introduce hierarchical randomized smoothing: We partially smooth objects by adding random noise only on a randomly selected subset of their entities. By adding noise in a more targeted manner than existing methods we obtain stronger robustness guarantees while maintaining high accuracy. We initialize hierarchical smoothing using different noising distributions, yielding novel robustness certificates for discrete and continuous domains. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of hierarchical smoothing in image and node classification, where it yields superior robustness-accuracy trade-offs. Overall, hierarchical smoothing is an important contribution towards models that are both - certifiably robust to perturbations and accurate.

- **Summary**: Keeping large foundation models up to date on latest data is inherently expensive. To avoid the prohibitive costs of constantly retraining, it is imperative to continually train these models. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of any large scale continual learning benchmarks or baselines. We introduce the first set of web-scale Time-Continual (TiC) benchmarks for training vision-language models: TiC-DataCompt, TiC-YFCC, and TiC-RedCaps with over 12.7B timestamped image-text pairs spanning 9 years (2014--2022). We first use our benchmarks to curate various dynamic evaluations to measure temporal robustness of existing models. We show OpenAI's CLIP (trained on data up to 2020) loses $\approx 8\%$ zero-shot accuracy on our curated retrieval task from 2021--2022 compared with more recently trained models in OpenCLIP repository. We then study how to efficiently train models on time-continuous data. We demonstrate that a simple rehearsal-based approach that continues training from the last checkpoint and replays old data reduces compute by $2.5\times$ when compared to the standard practice of retraining from scratch.

- **Summary**: Deep-learning models can extract a rich assortment of features from data. Which features a model uses depends not only on predictivity-how reliably a feature indicates train-set labels-but also on availability-how easily the feature can be extracted, or leveraged, from inputs. The literature on shortcut learning has noted examples in which models privilege one feature over another, for example texture over shape and image backgrounds over foreground objects. Here, we test hypotheses about which input properties are more available to a model, and systematically study how predictivity and availability interact to shape models' feature use. We construct a minimal, explicit generative framework for synthesizing classification datasets with two latent features that vary in predictivity and in factors we hypothesize to relate to availability, and quantify a model's shortcut bias-its over-reliance on the shortcut (more available, less predictive) feature at the expense of the core (less available, more predictive) feature. We find that linear models are relatively unbiased, but introducing a single hidden layer with ReLU or Tanh units yields a bias. Our empirical findings are consistent with a theoretical account based on Neural Tangent Kernels. Finally, we study how models used in practice trade off predictivity and availability in naturalistic datasets, discovering availability manipulations which increase models' degree of shortcut bias. Taken together, these findings suggest that the propensity to learn shortcut features is a fundamental characteristic of deep nonlinear architectures warranting systematic study given its role in shaping how models solve tasks.

- **Summary**: While image segmentation is crucial in various computer vision applications, such as autonomous driving, grasping, and robot navigation, annotating all objects at the pixel-level for training is nearly impossible. Therefore, the study of unsupervised image segmentation methods is essential. In this paper, we present a pixel-level clustering framework for segmenting images into regions without using ground truth annotations. The proposed framework includes feature embedding modules with an attention mechanism, a feature statistics computing module, image reconstruction, and superpixel segmentation to achieve accurate unsupervised segmentation. Additionally, we propose a training strategy that utilizes intra-consistency within each superpixel, inter-similarity/dissimilarity between neighboring superpixels, and structural similarity between images. To avoid potential over-segmentation caused by superpixel-based losses, we also propose a post-processing method. Furthermore, we present an extension of the proposed method for unsupervised semantic segmentation. We conducted experiments on three publicly available datasets (Berkeley segmentation dataset, PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and COCO-Stuff dataset) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

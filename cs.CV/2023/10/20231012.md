- **Summary**: A major obstacle when attempting to train a machine learning system to evaluate facial clefts is the scarcity of large datasets of high-quality, ethics board-approved patient images. In response, we have built a deep learning-based cleft lip generator designed to produce an almost unlimited number of artificial images exhibiting high-fidelity facsimiles of cleft lip with wide variation. We undertook a transfer learning protocol testing different versions of StyleGAN-ADA (a generative adversarial network image generator incorporating adaptive data augmentation (ADA)) as the base model. Training images depicting a variety of cleft deformities were pre-processed to adjust for rotation, scaling, color adjustment and background blurring. The ADA modification of the primary algorithm permitted construction of our new generative model while requiring input of a relatively small number of training images. Adversarial training was carried out using 514 unique frontal photographs of cleft-affected faces to adapt a pre-trained model based on 70,000 normal faces. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) was used to measure the similarity of the newly generated facial images to the cleft training dataset, while Perceptual Path Length (PPL) and the novel Divergence Index of Severity Histograms (DISH) measures were also used to assess the performance of the image generator that we dub CleftGAN. We found that StyleGAN3 with translation invariance (StyleGAN3-t) performed optimally as a base model. Generated images achieved a low FID reflecting a close similarity to our training input dataset of genuine cleft images. Low PPL and DISH measures reflected a smooth and semantically valid interpolation of images through the transfer learning process and a similar distribution of severity in the training and generated images, respectively.

- **Summary**: Automated visual firearms classification from RGB images is an important real-world task with applications in public space security, intelligence gathering and law enforcement investigations. When applied to images massively crawled from the World Wide Web (including social media and dark Web sites), it can serve as an important component of systems that attempt to identify criminal firearms trafficking networks, by analyzing Big Data from open-source intelligence. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are the state-of-the-art methodology for achieving this, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) being typically employed. The common transfer learning approach consists of pretraining on a large-scale, generic annotated dataset for whole-image classification, such as ImageNet-1k, and then finetuning the DNN on a smaller, annotated, task-specific, downstream dataset for visual firearms classification. Neither Visual Transformer (ViT) neural architectures nor Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approaches have been so far evaluated on this critical task. SSL essentially consists of replacing the traditional supervised pretraining objective with an unsupervised pretext task that does not require ground-truth labels..

- **Summary**: Height estimation has long been a pivotal topic within measurement and remote sensing disciplines, proving critical for endeavours such as 3D urban modelling, MR and autonomous driving. Traditional methods utilise stereo matching or multisensor fusion, both well-established techniques that typically necessitate multiple images from varying perspectives and adjunct sensors like SAR, leading to substantial deployment costs. Single image height estimation has emerged as an attractive alternative, boasting a larger data source variety and simpler deployment. However, current methods suffer from limitations such as fixed receptive fields, a lack of global information interaction, leading to noticeable instance-level height deviations. The inherent complexity of height prediction can result in a blurry estimation of object edge depth when using mainstream regression methods based on fixed height division. This paper presents a comprehensive solution for monocular height estimation in remote sensing, termed HeightFormer, combining multilevel interactions and image-adaptive classification-regression. It features the Multilevel Interaction Backbone (MIB) and Image-adaptive Classification-regression Height Generator (ICG). MIB supplements the fixed sample grid in CNN of the conventional backbone network with tokens of different interaction ranges. It is complemented by a pixel-, patch-, and feature map-level hierarchical interaction mechanism, designed to relay spatial geometry information across different scales and introducing a global receptive field to enhance the quality of instance-level height estimation. The ICG dynamically generates height partition for each image and reframes the traditional regression task, using a refinement from coarse to fine classification-regression that significantly mitigates the innate ill-posedness issue and drastically improves edge sharpness.

- **Summary**: This work identifies a simple pre-training mechanism that leads to representations exhibiting better continual and transfer learning. This mechanism -- the repeated resetting of weights in the last layer, which we nickname "zapping" -- was originally designed for a meta-continual-learning procedure, yet we show it is surprisingly applicable in many settings beyond both meta-learning and continual learning. In our experiments, we wish to transfer a pre-trained image classifier to a new set of classes, in a few shots. We show that our zapping procedure results in improved transfer accuracy and/or more rapid adaptation in both standard fine-tuning and continual learning settings, while being simple to implement and computationally efficient. In many cases, we achieve performance on par with state of the art meta-learning without needing the expensive higher-order gradients, by using a combination of zapping and sequential learning. An intuitive explanation for the effectiveness of this zapping procedure is that representations trained with repeated zapping learn features that are capable of rapidly adapting to newly initialized classifiers. Such an approach may be considered a computationally cheaper type of, or alternative to, meta-learning rapidly adaptable features with higher-order gradients. This adds to recent work on the usefulness of resetting neural network parameters during training, and invites further investigation of this mechanism.



### Point-NeuS: Point-Guided Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction by Volume Rendering

- **Summary**: Recently, learning neural implicit surface by volume rendering has been a promising way for multi-view reconstruction. However, limited accuracy and excessive time complexity remain bottlenecks that current methods urgently need to overcome. To address these challenges, we propose a new method called Point-NeuS, utilizing point-guided mechanisms to achieve accurate and efficient reconstruction. Point modeling is organically embedded into the volume rendering to enhance and regularize the representation of implicit surface. Specifically, to achieve precise point guidance and noise robustness, aleatoric uncertainty of the point cloud is modeled to capture the distribution of noise and estimate the reliability of points. Additionally, a Neural Projection module connecting points and images is introduced to add geometric constraints to the Signed Distance Function (SDF). To better compensate for geometric bias between volume rendering and point modeling, high-fidelity points are filtered into an Implicit Displacement Network to improve the representation of SDF. Benefiting from our effective point guidance, lightweight networks are employed to achieve an impressive 11x speedup compared to NeuS. Extensive experiments show that our method yields high-quality surfaces, especially for fine-grained details and smooth regions. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness to both noisy and sparse data.

- **Summary**: Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) system has great advantages over traditional methods in dynamically acquiring Hyper-Spectral Image (HSI), but there are the following problems. 1) Traditional mask relies on random patterns or analytical design, both of which limit the performance improvement of CASSI. 2) Existing high-quality reconstruction algorithms are slow in reconstruction and can only reconstruct scene information offline. To address the above two problems, this paper designs the AMDC-CASSI system, introducing RGB camera with CASSI based on Adaptive-Mask as multimodal input to improve the reconstruction quality. The existing SOTA reconstruction schemes are based on transformer, but the operation of self-attention pulls down the operation efficiency of the network. In order to improve the inference speed of the reconstruction network, this paper proposes An MLP Architecture for Adaptive-Mask-based Dual-Camera (MLP-AMDC) to replace the transformer structure of the network. Numerous experiments have shown that MLP performs no less well than transformer-based structures for HSI reconstruction, while MLP greatly improves the network inference speed and has less number of parameters and operations, our method has a 8 db improvement over SOTA and at least a 5-fold improvement in reconstruction speed.

### Dual-Stream Knowledge-Preserving Hashing for Unsupervised Video Retrieval

- **Summary**: Unsupervised video hashing usually optimizes binary codes by learning to reconstruct input videos. Such reconstruction constraint spends much effort on frame-level temporal context changes without focusing on video-level global semantics that are more useful for retrieval. Hence, we address this problem by decomposing video information into reconstruction-dependent and semantic-dependent information, which disentangles the semantic extraction from reconstruction constraint. Specifically, we first design a simple dual-stream structure, including a temporal layer and a hash layer. Then, with the help of semantic similarity knowledge obtained from self-supervision, the hash layer learns to capture information for semantic retrieval, while the temporal layer learns to capture the information for reconstruction. In this way, the model naturally preserves the disentangled semantics into binary codes. Validated by comprehensive experiments, our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts on three video benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Owing to the capacity of performing full-time target search, cross-modality vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is gaining more attention in both video surveillance and public security. However, this promising and innovative research has not been studied sufficiently due to the data inadequacy issue. Meanwhile, the cross-modality discrepancy and orientation discrepancy challenges further aggravate the difficulty of this task. To this end, we pioneer a cross-modality vehicle Re-ID benchmark named UAV Cross-Modality Vehicle Re-ID (UCM-VeID), containing 753 identities with 16015 RGB and 13913 infrared images. Moreover, to meet cross-modality discrepancy and orientation discrepancy challenges, we present a hybrid weights decoupling network (HWDNet) to learn the shared discriminative orientation-invariant features. For the first challenge, we proposed a hybrid weights siamese network with a well-designed weight restrainer and its corresponding objective function to learn both modality-specific and modality shared information. In terms of the second challenge, three effective decoupling structures with two pretext tasks are investigated to learn orientation-invariant feature. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The dataset and codes will be released at https://github.com/moonstarL/UAV-CM-VeID.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable and trustworthy machine learning. Recent multi-modal OOD detection leverages textual information from in-distribution (ID) class names for visual OOD detection, yet it currently neglects the rich contextual information of ID classes. Large language models (LLMs) encode a wealth of world knowledge and can be prompted to generate descriptive features for each class. Indiscriminately using such knowledge causes catastrophic damage to OOD detection due to LLMs' hallucinations, as is observed by our analysis. In this paper, we propose to apply world knowledge to enhance OOD detection performance through selective generation from LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a consistency-based uncertainty calibration method to estimate the confidence score of each generation. We further extract visual objects from each image to fully capitalize on the aforementioned world knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art.



### BaSAL: Size Balanced Warm Start Active Learning for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: Active learning strives to reduce the need for costly data annotation, by repeatedly querying an annotator to label the most informative samples from a pool of unlabeled data and retraining a model from these samples. We identify two problems with existing active learning methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation. First, they ignore the severe class imbalance inherent in LiDAR semantic segmentation datasets. Second, to bootstrap the active learning loop, they train their initial model from randomly selected data samples, which leads to low performance and is referred to as the cold start problem. To address these problems we propose BaSAL, a size-balanced warm start active learning model, based on the observation that each object class has a characteristic size. By sampling object clusters according to their size, we can thus create a size-balanced dataset that is also more class-balanced. Furthermore, in contrast to existing information measures like entropy or CoreSet, size-based sampling does not require an already trained model and thus can be used to address the cold start problem. Results show that we are able to improve the performance of the initial model by a large margin. Combining size-balanced sampling and warm start with established information measures, our approach achieves a comparable performance to training on the entire SemanticKITTI dataset, despite using only 5% of the annotations, which outperforms existing active learning methods. We also match the existing state-of-the-art in active learning on nuScenes. Our code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

- **Summary**: In continual learning, the learner learns multiple tasks in sequence, with data being acquired only once for each task. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to continual learning. To reduce forgetting, some existing rehearsal-based methods use episodic memory to replay samples of previous tasks. However, in the process of knowledge integration when learning a new task, this strategy also suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to an imbalance between old and new knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a novel replay strategy called Manifold Expansion Replay (MaER). We argue that expanding the implicit manifold of the knowledge representation in the episodic memory helps to improve the robustness and expressiveness of the model. To this end, we propose a greedy strategy to keep increasing the diameter of the implicit manifold represented by the knowledge in the buffer during memory management. In addition, we introduce Wasserstein distance instead of cross entropy as distillation loss to preserve previous knowledge. With extensive experimental validation on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, we show that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in continual learning setup, outperforming the state of the arts.

- **Summary**: High-resolution representation is necessary for human pose estimation to achieve high performance, and the ensuing problem is high computational complexity. In particular, predominant pose estimation methods estimate human joints by 2D single-peak heatmaps. Each 2D heatmap can be horizontally and vertically projected to and reconstructed by a pair of 1D heat vectors. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a lightweight and powerful alternative, Spatially Unidimensional Self-Attention (SUSA), to the pointwise (1x1) convolution that is the main computational bottleneck in the depthwise separable 3c3 convolution. Our SUSA reduces the computational complexity of the pointwise (1x1) convolution by 96% without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we use the SUSA as the main module to build our lightweight pose estimation backbone X-HRNet, where `X' represents the estimated cross-shape attention vectors. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our X-HRNet, and comprehensive ablation studies show the effectiveness of the SUSA modules. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/cool-xuan/x-hrnet.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation holds significant importance in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods are typically designed to train and test on clear and pristine datasets, overlooking the impact of various adverse conditions prevalent in real-world scenarios. As a result, it is commonly observed that most self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods struggle to perform adequately under challenging conditions. To address this issue, we present EC-Depth, a novel self-supervised two-stage training framework to achieve a robust depth estimation, starting from the foundation of depth prediction consistency under different perturbations. Leveraging the proposed perturbation-invariant depth consistency constraint module and the consistency-based pseudo-label selection module, our model attains accurate and consistent depth predictions in both standard and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on KITTI, KITTI-C and DrivingStereo benchmarks, demonstrating its potential for enhancing the reliability of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Age estimation technology is a part of facial recognition and has been applied to identity authentication. This technology achieves the development and application of a juvenile anti-addiction system by authenticating users in the game. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer algorithms are widely used in this application scenario. However, these two models cannot flexibly extract and model features of faces with irregular shapes, and they are ineffective in capturing key information. Furthermore, the above methods will contain a lot of background information while extracting features, which will interfere with the model. In consequence, it is easy to extract redundant information from images. In this paper, a new modeling idea is proposed to solve this problem, which can flexibly model irregular objects. The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is used to extract features from irregular face images effectively, and multi-head attention mechanisms are added to avoid redundant features and capture key region information in the image. This model can effectively improve the accuracy of age estimation and reduce the MAE error value to about 3.64, which is better than the effect of today's age estimation model, to improve the accuracy of face recognition and identity authentication.

- **Summary**: Over-fitting-based image compression requires weights compactness for compression and fast convergence for practical use, posing challenges for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods. This paper presents a simple re-parameterization method to train CNNs with reduced weights storage and accelerated convergence. The convolution kernels are re-parameterized as a weighted sum of discrete cosine transform (DCT) kernels enabling direct optimization in the frequency domain. Combined with L1 regularization, the proposed method surpasses vanilla convolutions by achieving a significantly improved rate-distortion with low computational cost. The proposed method is verified with extensive experiments of over-fitting-based image restoration on various datasets, achieving up to -46.12% BD-rate on top of HEIF with only 200 iterations.

- **Summary**: Despite the great progress of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with the deep neural networks, current UDA models are opaque and cannot provide promising explanations, limiting their applications in the scenarios that require safe and controllable model decisions. At present, a surge of work focuses on designing deep interpretable methods with adequate data annotations and only a few methods consider the distributional shift problem. Most existing interpretable UDA methods are post-hoc ones, which cannot facilitate the model learning process for performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose an inherently interpretable method, named Transferable Conceptual Prototype Learning (TCPL), which could simultaneously interpret and improve the processes of knowledge transfer and decision-making in UDA. To achieve this goal, we design a hierarchically prototypical module that transfers categorical basic concepts from the source domain to the target domain and learns domain-shared prototypes for explaining the underlying reasoning process. With the learned transferable prototypes, a self-predictive consistent pseudo-label strategy that fuses confidence, predictions, and prototype information, is designed for selecting suitable target samples for pseudo annotations and gradually narrowing down the domain gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method can not only provide effective and intuitive explanations but also outperform previous state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Neural network pruning has shown to be an effective technique for reducing the network size, trading desirable properties like generalization and robustness to adversarial attacks for higher sparsity. Recent work has claimed that adversarial pruning methods can produce sparse networks while also preserving robustness to adversarial examples. In this work, we first re-evaluate three state-of-the-art adversarial pruning methods, showing that their robustness was indeed overestimated. We then compare pruned and dense versions of the same models, discovering that samples on thin ice, i.e., closer to the unpruned model's decision boundary, are typically misclassified after pruning. We conclude by discussing how this intuition may lead to designing more effective adversarial pruning methods in future work.

- **Summary**: Radiotherapy is one of the primary treatment methods for tumors, but the organ movement caused by respiratory motion limits its accuracy. Recently, 3D imaging from single X-ray projection receives extensive attentions as a promising way to address this issue. However, current methods can only reconstruct 3D image without direct location of the tumor and are only validated for fixed-angle imaging, which fails to fully meet the requirement of motion control in radiotherapy. In this study, we propose a novel imaging method RT-SRTS which integrates 3D imaging and tumor segmentation into one network based on the multi-task learning (MTL) and achieves real-time simultaneous 3D reconstruction and tumor segmentation from single X-ray projection at any angle. Futhermore, we propose the attention enhanced calibrator (AEC) and uncertain-region elaboration (URE) modules to aid feature extraction and improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluated the proposed method on ten patient cases and compared it with two state-of-the-art methods. Our approach not only delivered superior 3D reconstruction but also demonstrated commendable tumor segmentation results. The simultaneous reconstruction and segmentation could be completed in approximately 70 ms, significantly faster than the required time threshold for real-time tumor tracking. The efficacy of both AEC and URE was also validated through ablation studies.

- **Summary**: Navigation and localization of UAVs present a challenge when global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are disrupted and unreliable. Traditional techniques, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and visual odometry (VO), exhibit certain limitations in furnishing absolute coordinates and mitigating error accumulation. Existing visual localization methods achieve autonomous visual localization without error accumulation by matching with ortho satellite images. However, doing so cannot guarantee real-time performance due to the complex matching process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Global-Local Visual Localization (GLVL) network. Our GLVL network is a two-stage visual localization approach, combining a large-scale retrieval module that finds similar regions with the UAV flight scene, and a fine-grained matching module that localizes the precise UAV coordinate, enabling real-time and precise localization. The training process is jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner to further enhance the model capability. Experiments on six UAV flight scenes encompassing both texture-rich and texture-sparse regions demonstrate the ability of our model to achieve the real-time precise localization requirements of UAVs. Particularly, our method achieves a localization error of only 2.39 meters in 0.48 seconds in a village scene with sparse texture features.

- **Summary**: Recently, weakly-supervised image segmentation using weak annotations like scribbles has gained great attention in computer vision and medical image analysis, since such annotations are much easier to obtain compared to time-consuming and labor-intensive labeling at the pixel/voxel level. However, due to a lack of structure supervision on regions of interest (ROIs), existing scribble-based methods suffer from poor boundary localization. Furthermore, most current methods are designed for 2D image segmentation, which do not fully leverage the volumetric information if directly applied to each image slice. In this paper, we propose a scribble-based volumetric image segmentation, Scribble2D5, which tackles 3D anisotropic image segmentation and aims to its improve boundary prediction. To achieve this, we augment a 2.5D attention UNet with a proposed label propagation module to extend semantic information from scribbles and use a combination of static and active boundary prediction to learn ROI's boundary and regularize its shape. Also, we propose an optional add-on component, which incorporates the shape prior information from unpaired segmentation masks to further improve model accuracy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and one private dataset demonstrate our Scribble2D5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on volumetric image segmentation using scribbles and shape prior if available.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in learning techniques that employ coordinate-based neural representations have yielded remarkable results in multi-view 3D reconstruction tasks. However, these approaches often require a substantial number of input views (typically several tens) and computationally intensive optimization procedures to achieve their effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations specifically for the problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. We accomplish this by incorporating a probabilistic shape and appearance prior into coordinate-based representations, enabling faster convergence and improved generalization when working with only a few input images (even as low as a single image). During testing, we leverage this prior to guide the fitting process of a signed distance function using a differentiable renderer. By incorporating the statistical prior alongside parallelizable ray tracing and dynamic caching strategies, we achieve an efficient and accurate approach to few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. Moreover, we extend the H3DS dataset, which now comprises 60 high-resolution 3D full head scans and their corresponding posed images and masks, which we use for evaluation purposes. By leveraging this dataset, we demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art results in geometry reconstruction while being an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches.

- **Summary**: Large image diffusion models enable novel view synthesis with high quality and excellent zero-shot capability. However, such models based on image-to-image translation have no guarantee of view consistency, limiting the performance for downstream tasks like 3D reconstruction and image-to-3D generation. To empower consistency, we propose Consistent123 to synthesize novel views simultaneously by incorporating additional cross-view attention layers and the shared self-attention mechanism. The proposed attention mechanism improves the interaction across all synthesized views, as well as the alignment between the condition view and novel views. In the sampling stage, such architecture supports simultaneously generating an arbitrary number of views while training at a fixed length. We also introduce a progressive classifier-free guidance strategy to achieve the trade-off between texture and geometry for synthesized object views. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that Consistent123 outperforms baselines in view consistency by a large margin. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant improvement of Consistent123 on varying downstream tasks, showing its great potential in the 3D generation field.

### SingleInsert: Inserting New Concepts from a Single Image into Text-to-Image Models for Flexible Editing

- **Summary**: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) models enables high-quality image generation with flexible textual control. To utilize the abundant visual priors in the off-the-shelf T2I models, a series of methods try to invert an image to proper embedding that aligns with the semantic space of the T2I model. However, these image-to-text (I2T) inversion methods typically need multiple source images containing the same concept or struggle with the imbalance between editing flexibility and visual fidelity. In this work, we point out that the critical problem lies in the foreground-background entanglement when learning an intended concept, and propose a simple and effective baseline for single-image I2T inversion, named SingleInsert. SingleInsert adopts a two-stage scheme. In the first stage, we regulate the learned embedding to concentrate on the foreground area without being associated with the irrelevant background. In the second stage, we finetune the T2I model for better visual resemblance and devise a semantic loss to prevent the language drift problem. With the proposed techniques, SingleInsert excels in single concept generation with high visual fidelity while allowing flexible editing. Additionally, SingleInsert can perform single-image novel view synthesis and multiple concepts composition without requiring joint training. To facilitate evaluation, we design an editing prompt list and introduce a metric named Editing Success Rate (ESR) for quantitative assessment of editing flexibility.

- **Summary**: Foundation models like CLIP allow zero-shot transfer on various tasks without additional training data. Yet, the zero-shot performance is less competitive than a fully supervised one. Thus, to enhance the performance, fine-tuning and ensembling are also commonly adopted to better fit the downstream tasks. However, we argue that such prior work has overlooked the inherent biases in foundation models. Due to the highly imbalanced Web-scale training set, these foundation models are inevitably skewed toward frequent semantics, and thus the subsequent fine-tuning or ensembling is still biased. In this study, we systematically examine the biases in foundation models and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed Generalized Logit Adjustment (GLA) method. Note that bias estimation in foundation models is challenging, as most pre-train data cannot be explicitly accessed like in traditional long-tailed classification tasks. To this end, GLA has an optimization-based bias estimation approach for debiasing foundation models. As our work resolves a fundamental flaw in the pre-training, the proposed GLA demonstrates significant improvements across a diverse range of tasks: it achieves 1.5 pp accuracy gains on ImageNet, an large average improvement (1.4-4.6 pp) on 11 few-shot datasets, 2.4 pp gains on long-tailed classification.

- **Summary**: For safe and sophisticated physical human-robot interactions (pHRI), a robot needs to estimate the accurate body pose or mesh of the target person. However, in these pHRI scenarios, the robot cannot fully observe the target person's body with equipped cameras because the target person is usually close to the robot. This leads to severe truncation and occlusions, and results in poor accuracy of human pose estimation. For better accuracy of human pose estimation or mesh recovery on this limited information from cameras, we propose an active measurement and sensor fusion framework of the equipped cameras and other sensors such as touch sensors and 2D LiDAR. These touch and LiDAR sensing are obtained attendantly through pHRI without additional costs. These sensor measurements are sparse but reliable and informative cues for human mesh recovery. In our active measurement process, camera viewpoints and sensor placements are optimized based on the uncertainty of the estimated pose, which is closely related to the truncated or occluded areas. In our sensor fusion process, we fuse the sensor measurements to the camera-based estimated pose by minimizing the distance between the estimated mesh and measured positions. Our method is agnostic to robot configurations. Experiments were conducted using the Toyota Human Support Robot, which has a camera, 2D LiDAR, and a touch sensor on the robot arm. Our proposed method demonstrated the superiority in the human pose estimation accuracy on the quantitative comparison. Furthermore, our proposed method reliably estimated the pose of the target person in practical settings such as target people occluded by a blanket and standing aid with the robot arm.

- **Summary**: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception is crucial for autonomous driving. However, achieving high-precision V2X perception requires a significant amount of annotated real-world data, which can always be expensive and hard to acquire. Simulated data have raised much attention since they can be massively produced at an extremely low cost. Nevertheless, the significant domain gap between simulated and real-world data, including differences in sensor type, reflectance patterns, and road surroundings, often leads to poor performance of models trained on simulated data when evaluated on real-world data. In addition, there remains a domain gap between real-world collaborative agents, e.g. different types of sensors may be installed on autonomous vehicles and roadside infrastructures with different extrinsics, further increasing the difficulty of sim2real generalization. To take full advantage of simulated data, we present a new unsupervised sim2real domain adaptation method for V2X collaborative detection named Decoupled Unsupervised Sim2Real Adaptation (DUSA). Our new method decouples the V2X collaborative sim2real domain adaptation problem into two sub-problems: sim2real adaptation and inter-agent adaptation. For sim2real adaptation, we design a Location-adaptive Sim2Real Adapter (LSA) module to adaptively aggregate features from critical locations of the feature map and align the features between simulated data and real-world data via a sim/real discriminator on the aggregated global feature. For inter-agent adaptation, we further devise a Confidence-aware Inter-agent Adapter (CIA) module to align the fine-grained features from heterogeneous agents under the guidance of agent-wise confidence maps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DUSA approach on unsupervised sim2real adaptation from the simulated V2XSet dataset to the real-world DAIR-V2X-C dataset.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel perspective of viewing large pretrained models as search engines, thereby enabling the repurposing of techniques previously used to enhance search engine performance. As an illustration, we employ a personalized query rewriting technique in the realm of text-to-image generation. Despite significant progress in the field, it is still challenging to create personalized visual representations that align closely with the desires and preferences of individual users. This process requires users to articulate their ideas in words that are both comprehensible to the models and accurately capture their vision, posing difficulties for many users. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by leveraging historical user interactions with the system to enhance user prompts. We propose a novel approach that involves rewriting user prompts based a new large-scale text-to-image dataset with over 300k prompts from 3115 users. Our rewriting model enhances the expressiveness and alignment of user prompts with their intended visual outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods over baseline approaches, as evidenced in our new offline evaluation method and online tests. Our approach opens up exciting possibilities of applying more search engine techniques to build truly personalized large pretrained models.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is a dominant method for reducing model overfitting and improving generalization. Most existing data augmentation methods tend to find a compromise in augmenting the data, \textit{i.e.}, increasing the amplitude of augmentation carefully to avoid degrading some data too much and doing harm to the model performance. We delve into the relationship between data augmentation and model performance, revealing that the performance drop with heavy augmentation comes from the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Nonetheless, as the same data transformation has different effects for different training samples, even for heavy augmentation, there remains part of in-distribution data which is beneficial to model training. Based on the observation, we propose a novel data augmentation method, named \textbf{DualAug}, to keep the augmentation in distribution as much as possible at a reasonable time and computational cost. We design a data mixing strategy to fuse augmented data from both the basic- and the heavy-augmentation branches. Extensive experiments on supervised image classification benchmarks show that DualAug improve various automated data augmentation method. Moreover, the experiments on semi-supervised learning and contrastive self-supervised learning demonstrate that our DualAug can also improve related method.

- **Summary**: Face anti-spoofing plays a critical role in safeguarding facial recognition systems against presentation attacks. While existing deep learning methods show promising results, they still suffer from the lack of fine-grained annotations, which lead models to learn task-irrelevant or unfaithful features. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained annotation method for face anti-spoofing. Specifically, we first leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain pixel-wise segmentation masks by utilizing face landmarks as point prompts. The face landmarks provide segmentation semantics, which segments the face into regions. We then adopt these regions as masks and assemble them into three separate annotation maps: spoof, living, and background maps. Finally, we combine three separate maps into a three-channel map as annotations for model training. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-Channel Region Exchange Augmentation (MCREA) to diversify training data and reduce overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound Localization Microscopy can resolve the microvascular bed down to a few micrometers. To achieve such performance microbubble contrast agents must perfuse the entire microvascular network. Microbubbles are then located individually and tracked over time to sample individual vessels, typically over hundreds of thousands of images. To overcome the fundamental limit of diffraction and achieve a dense reconstruction of the network, low microbubble concentrations must be used, which lead to acquisitions lasting several minutes. Conventional processing pipelines are currently unable to deal with interference from multiple nearby microbubbles, further reducing achievable concentrations. This work overcomes this problem by proposing a Deep Learning approach to recover dense vascular networks from ultrasound acquisitions with high microbubble concentrations. A realistic mouse brain microvascular network, segmented from 2-photon microscopy, was used to train a three-dimensional convolutional neural network based on a V-net architecture. Ultrasound data sets from multiple microbubbles flowing through the microvascular network were simulated and used as ground truth to train the 3D CNN to track microbubbles. The 3D-CNN approach was validated in silico using a subset of the data and in vivo on a rat brain acquisition. In silico, the CNN reconstructed vascular networks with higher precision (81%) than a conventional ULM framework (70%). In vivo, the CNN could resolve micro vessels as small as 10 $\mu$m with an increase in resolution when compared against a conventional approach.

- **Summary**: The accurate and efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 is of paramount importance, particularly in the context of large-scale medical imaging datasets. In this preprint paper, we propose a novel approach for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT images that leverages the power of Swin Transformer models, state-of-the-art solutions in computer vision tasks. Our method includes a systematic approach for patient-level predictions, where individual CT slices are classified as COVID-19 or non-COVID, and the patient's overall diagnosis is determined through majority voting. The application of the Swin Transformer in this context results in patient-level predictions that demonstrate exceptional diagnostic accuracy. In terms of evaluation metrics, our approach consistently outperforms the baseline, as well as numerous competing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in COVID-19 diagnosis. The macro F1 score achieved by our model exceeds the baseline and offers a robust solution for accurate diagnosis.

In this work, we show that hyperparameter optimization can improve fast minimum-norm attacks by automating the selection of the loss function, the optimizer and the step-size scheduler, along with the corresponding hyperparameters. Our extensive evaluation involving several robust models demonstrates the improved efficacy of fast minimum-norm attacks when hyper-up with hyperparameter optimization.

- **Summary**: The lack of standardized robustness metrics and the widespread reliance on numerous unrelated benchmark datasets for testing have created a gap between academically validated robust models and their often problematic practical adoption. To address this, we introduce XIMAGENET-12, an explainable benchmark dataset with over 200K images and 15,600 manual semantic annotations. Covering 12 categories from ImageNet to represent objects commonly encountered in practical life and simulating six diverse scenarios, including overexposure, blurring, color changing, etc., we further propose a novel robustness criterion that extends beyond model generation ability assessment. This benchmark dataset, along with related code, is available at https://sites.google.com/view/ximagenet-12/home. Researchers and practitioners can leverage this resource to evaluate the robustness of their visual models under challenging conditions and ultimately benefit from the demands of practical computer vision systems.

- **Summary**: We present a lifelong audio-video masked autoencoder that continually learns the multimodal representations from a video stream containing audio-video pairs, while its distribution continually shifts over time. Specifically, we propose two novel ideas to tackle the problem: (1) Localized Alignment: We introduce a small trainable multimodal encoder that predicts the audio and video tokens that are well-aligned with each other. This allows the model to learn only the highly correlated audiovisual patches with accurate multimodal relationships. (2) Forget-robust multimodal patch selection: We compare the relative importance of each audio-video patch between the current and past data pair to mitigate unintended drift of the previously learned audio-video representations. Our proposed method, FLAVA (Forget-robust Localized Audio-Video Alignment), therefore, captures the complex relationships between the audio and video modalities during training on a sequence of pre-training tasks while alleviating the forgetting of learned audiovisual correlations. Our experiments validate that FLAVA outperforms the state-of-the-art continual learning methods on several benchmark datasets under continual audio-video representation learning scenarios.

- **Summary**: Long-tailed(LT) classification is an unavoidable and challenging problem in the real world. Most of the existing long-tailed classification methods focus only on solving the inter-class imbalance in which there are more samples in the head class than in the tail class, while ignoring the intra-lass imbalance in which the number of samples of the head attribute within the same class is much larger than the number of samples of the tail attribute. The deviation in the model is caused by both of these factors, and due to the fact that attributes are implicit in most datasets and the combination of attributes is very complex, the intra-class imbalance is more difficult to handle. For this purpose, we proposed a long-tailed classification framework, known as \textbf{\textsc{Cognisance}}, which is founded on Coarse-Grained Leading Forest (CLF) and Multi-Center Loss (MCL), aiming to build a multi-granularity joint solution model by means of invariant feature learning. In this method, we designed an unsupervised learning method, i.e., CLF, to better characterize the distribution of attributes within a class. Depending on the distribution of attributes, we can flexibly construct sampling strategies suitable for different environments. In addition, we introduce a new metric learning loss (MCL), which aims to gradually eliminate confusing attributes during the feature learning process. More importantly, this approach does not depend on a specific model structure and can be integrated with existing LT methods as an independent component. We have conducted extensive experiments and our approach has state-of-the-art performance in both existing benchmarks ImageNet-GLT and MSCOCO-GLT, and can improve the performance of existing LT methods.

- **Summary**: Continual learning (CL) has remained a persistent challenge for deep neural networks due to catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned tasks. Several techniques such as weight regularization, experience rehearsal, and parameter isolation have been proposed to alleviate CF. Despite their relative success, these research directions have predominantly remained orthogonal and suffer from several shortcomings, while missing out on the advantages of competing strategies. On the contrary, the brain continually learns, accommodates, and transfers knowledge across tasks by simultaneously leveraging several neurophysiological processes, including neurogenesis, active forgetting, neuromodulation, metaplasticity, experience rehearsal, and context-dependent gating, rarely resulting in CF. Inspired by how the brain exploits multiple mechanisms concurrently, we propose TriRE, a novel CL paradigm that encompasses retaining the most prominent neurons for each task, revising and solidifying the extracted knowledge of current and past tasks, and actively promoting less active neurons for subsequent tasks through rewinding and relearning. Across CL settings, TriRE significantly reduces task interference and surpasses different CL approaches considered in isolation.

- **Summary**: Direction properties of online strokes are used to analyze them in terms of homogeneous regions or sub-strokes with points satisfying common geometric properties. Such sub-strokes are called sub-units. These properties are used to extract sub-units from Hindi ideal online characters. These properties along with some heuristics are used to extract sub-units from Hindi online handwritten characters.\\ A method is developed to extract point stroke, clockwise curve stroke, counter-clockwise curve stroke and loop stroke segments as sub-units from Hindi online handwritten characters. These extracted sub-units are close in structure to the sub-units of the corresponding Hindi online ideal characters.\\ Importance of local representation of online handwritten characters in terms of sub-units is assessed by training a classifier with sub-unit level local and character level global features extracted from characters for character recognition. The classifier has the recognition accuracy of 93.5\% on the testing set. This accuracy is the highest when compared with that of the classifiers trained only with global features extracted from characters in the same training set and evaluated on the same testing set.\\ Sub-unit extraction algorithm and the sub-unit based character classifier are tested on Hindi online handwritten character dataset. This dataset consists of samples from 96 different characters. There are 12832 and 2821 samples in the training and testing sets, respectively.

- **Summary**: In this work we propose to combine the advantages of learning-based and combinatorial formalisms for 3D shape matching. While learning-based shape matching solutions lead to state-of-the-art matching performance, they do not ensure geometric consistency, so that obtained matchings are locally unsmooth. On the contrary, axiomatic methods allow to take geometric consistency into account by explicitly constraining the space of valid matchings. However, existing axiomatic formalisms are impractical since they do not scale to practically relevant problem sizes, or they require user input for the initialisation of non-convex optimisation problems. In this work we aim to close this gap by proposing a novel combinatorial solver that combines a unique set of favourable properties: our approach is (i) initialisation free, (ii) massively parallelisable powered by a quasi-Newton method, (iii) provides optimality gaps, and (iv) delivers decreased runtime and globally optimal results for many instances.



### Distilling from Vision-Language Models for Improved OOD Generalization in Vision Tasks

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are trained on large amounts of image-text pairs, resulting in remarkable generalization across several data distributions. The prohibitively expensive training and data collection/curation costs of these models make them valuable Intellectual Property (IP) for organizations. This motivates a vendor-client paradigm, where a vendor trains a large-scale VLM and grants only input-output access to clients on a pay-per-query basis in a black-box setting. The client aims to minimize inference cost by distilling the VLM to a student model using the limited available task-specific data, and further deploying this student model in the downstream application. While naive distillation largely improves the In-Domain (ID) accuracy of the student, it fails to transfer the superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of the VLM teacher using the limited available labeled images. To mitigate this, we propose Vision-Language to Vision-Align, Distill, Predict (VL2V-ADiP), which first aligns the vision and language modalities of the teacher model with the vision modality of a pre-trained student model, and further distills the aligned VLM embeddings to the student. This maximally retains the pre-trained features of the student, while also incorporating the rich representations of the VLM image encoder and the superior generalization of the text embeddings. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard Domain Generalization benchmarks in a black-box teacher setting, and also when weights of the VLM are accessible.

- **Summary**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a widely used tool to extract text from scanned documents. Today, the state-of-the-art is achieved by exploiting deep neural networks. However, the cost of this performance is paid at the price of system vulnerability. For instance, in backdoor attacks, attackers compromise the training phase by inserting a backdoor in the victim's model that will be activated at testing time by specific patterns while leaving the overall model performance intact. This work proposes a backdoor attack for OCR resulting in the injection of non-readable characters from malicious input images. This simple but effective attack exposes the state-of-the-art OCR weakness, making the extracted text correct to human eyes but simultaneously unusable for the NLP application that uses OCR as a preprocessing step. Experimental results show that the attacked models successfully output non-readable characters for around 90% of the poisoned instances without harming their performance for the remaining instances.

- **Summary**: LiDAR and cameras are complementary sensors for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. However, it is challenging to explore the unnatural interaction between point clouds and images, and the critical factor is how to conduct feature alignment of heterogeneous modalities. Currently, many methods achieve feature alignment by projection calibration only, without considering the problem of coordinate conversion accuracy errors between sensors, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we present GraphAlign, a more accurate feature alignment strategy for 3D object detection by graph matching. Specifically, we fuse image features from a semantic segmentation encoder in the image branch and point cloud features from a 3D Sparse CNN in the LiDAR branch. To save computation, we construct the nearest neighbor relationship by calculating Euclidean distance within the subspaces that are divided into the point cloud features. Through the projection calibration between the image and point cloud, we project the nearest neighbors of point cloud features onto the image features. Then by matching the nearest neighbors with a single point cloud to multiple images, we search for a more appropriate feature alignment. In addition, we provide a self-attention module to enhance the weights of significant relations to fine-tune the feature alignment between heterogeneous modalities. Extensive experiments on nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our GraphAlign.

- **Summary**: Image-text retrieval has developed rapidly in recent years. However, it is still a challenge in remote sensing due to visual-semantic imbalance, which leads to incorrect matching of non-semantic visual and textual features. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Direction-Oriented Visual-semantic Embedding Model (DOVE) to mine the relationship between vision and language. Concretely, a Regional-Oriented Attention Module (ROAM) adaptively adjusts the distance between the final visual and textual embeddings in the latent semantic space, oriented by regional visual features. Meanwhile, a lightweight Digging Text Genome Assistant (DTGA) is designed to expand the range of tractable textual representation and enhance global word-level semantic connections using less attention operations. Ultimately, we exploit a global visual-semantic constraint to reduce single visual dependency and serve as an external constraint for the final visual and textual representations. The effectiveness and superiority of our method are verified by extensive experiments including parameter evaluation, quantitative comparison, ablation studies and visual analysis, on two benchmark datasets, RSICD and RSITMD.

- **Summary**: We propose an Explicit Conditional Multimodal Variational Auto-Encoder (ECMVAE) for audio-visual segmentation (AVS), aiming to segment sound sources in the video sequence. Existing AVS methods focus on implicit feature fusion strategies, where models are trained to fit the discrete samples in the dataset. With a limited and less diverse dataset, the resulting performance is usually unsatisfactory. In contrast, we address this problem from an effective representation learning perspective, aiming to model the contribution of each modality explicitly. Specifically, we find that audio contains critical category information of the sound producers, and visual data provides candidate sound producer(s). Their shared information corresponds to the target sound producer(s) shown in the visual data. In this case, cross-modal shared representation learning is especially important for AVS. To achieve this, our ECMVAE factorizes the representations of each modality with a modality-shared representation and a modality-specific representation. An orthogonality constraint is applied between the shared and specific representations to maintain the exclusive attribute of the factorized latent code. Further, a mutual information maximization regularizer is introduced to achieve extensive exploration of each modality. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the AVSBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, leading to a new state-of-the-art for AVS, with a 3.84 mIOU performance leap on the challenging MS3 subset for multiple sound source segmentation.

- **Summary**: Few-shot object classification is the task of classifying objects in an image with limited number of examples as supervision. We propose a one-shot/few-shot classification model that can classify an object of any unseen class into a relatively general category in an hierarchically based classification. Our model uses a three-level hierarchical contrastive loss based ResNet152 classifier for classifying an object based on its features extracted from Image embedding, not used during the training phase. For our experimentation, we have used a subset of the ImageNet (ILSVRC-12) dataset that contains only the animal classes for training our model and created our own dataset of unseen classes for evaluating our trained model. Our model provides satisfactory results in classifying the unknown objects into a generic category which has been later discussed in greater detail.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of future step anticipation in procedural videos. Given a video of an ongoing procedural activity, we predict a plausible next procedure step described in rich natural language. While most previous work focus on the problem of data scarcity in procedural video datasets, another core challenge of future anticipation is how to account for multiple plausible future realizations in natural settings. This problem has been largely overlooked in previous work. To address this challenge, we frame future step prediction as modelling the distribution of all possible candidates for the next step. Specifically, we design a generative model that takes a series of video clips as input, and generates multiple plausible and diverse candidates (in natural language) for the next step. Following previous work, we side-step the video annotation scarcity by pretraining our model on a large text-based corpus of procedural activities, and then transfer the model to the video domain. Our experiments, both in textual and video domains, show that our model captures diversity in the next step prediction and generates multiple plausible future predictions. Moreover, our model establishes new state-of-the-art results on YouCookII, where it outperforms existing baselines on the next step anticipation. Finally, we also show that our model can successfully transfer from text to the video domain zero-shot, ie, without fine-tuning or adaptation, and produces good-quality future step predictions from video.

- **Summary**: This paper considers the problem of detecting and tracking objects in a sequence of images. The problem is formulated in a filtering framework, using the output of object-detection algorithms as measurements. An extension to the filtering formulation is proposed that incorporates class information from the previous frame to robustify the classification, even if the object-detection algorithm outputs an incorrect prediction. Further, the properties of the object-detection algorithm are exploited to quantify the uncertainty of the bounding box detection in each frame. The complete filtering method is evaluated on camera trap images of the four large Swedish carnivores, bear, lynx, wolf, and wolverine. The experiments show that the class tracking formulation leads to a more robust classification.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of large AI models trained on uncurated, often sensitive web-scraped data has raised significant privacy concerns. One of the concerns is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using privacy attacks. Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information such as names of individuals from models, and focus in this work on text encoders. Specifically, through strategic insertion of backdoors, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's name. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides not only a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks, but also presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.

- **Summary**: Understanding 4D point cloud sequences online is of significant practical value in various scenarios such as VR/AR, robotics, and autonomous driving. The key goal is to continuously analyze the geometry and dynamics of a 3D scene as unstructured and redundant point cloud sequences arrive. And the main challenge is to effectively model the long-term history while keeping computational costs manageable. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a generic online 4D perception paradigm called NSM4D. NSM4D serves as a plug-and-play strategy that can be adapted to existing 4D backbones, significantly enhancing their online perception capabilities for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. To efficiently capture the redundant 4D history, we propose a neural scene model that factorizes geometry and motion information by constructing geometry tokens separately storing geometry and motion features. Exploiting the history becomes as straightforward as querying the neural scene model. As the sequence progresses, the neural scene model dynamically deforms to align with new observations, effectively providing the historical context and updating itself with the new observations. By employing token representation, NSM4D also exhibits robustness to low-level sensor noise and maintains a compact size through a geometric sampling scheme. We integrate NSM4D with state-of-the-art 4D perception backbones, demonstrating significant improvements on various online perception benchmarks in indoor and outdoor settings. Notably, we achieve a 9.6% accuracy improvement for HOI4D online action segmentation and a 3.4% mIoU improvement for SemanticKITTI online semantic segmentation. Furthermore, we show that NSM4D inherently offers excellent scalability to longer sequences beyond the training set, which is crucial for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel compact and efficient neural BRDF offering highly versatile material representation, yet with very-light memory and neural computation consumption towards achieving real-time rendering. The results in Figure 1, rendered at full HD resolution on a current desktop machine, show that our system achieves real-time rendering with a wide variety of appearances, which is approached by the following two designs. On the one hand, noting that bidirectional reflectance is distributed in a very sparse high-dimensional subspace, we propose to project the BRDF into two low-dimensional components, i.e., two hemisphere feature-grids for incoming and outgoing directions, respectively. On the other hand, learnable neural reflectance primitives are distributed on our highly-tailored spherical surface grid, which offer informative features for each component and alleviate the conventional heavy feature learning network to a much smaller one, leading to very fast evaluation. These primitives are centrally stored in a codebook and can be shared across multiple grids and even across materials, based on the low-cost indices stored in material-specific spherical surface grids. Our neural BRDF, which is agnostic to the material, provides a unified framework that can represent a variety of materials in consistent manner. Comprehensive experimental results on measured BRDF compression, Monte Carlo simulated BRDF acceleration, and extension to spatially varying effect demonstrate the superior quality and generalizability achieved by the proposed scheme.

- **Summary**: This system paper presents a software framework for the support of topological analysis pipelines in a distributed-memory model. While several recent papers introduced topology-based approaches for distributed-memory environments, these were reporting experiments obtained with tailored, mono-algorithm implementations. In contrast, we describe in this paper a general-purpose, generic framework for topological analysis pipelines, i.e. a sequence of topological algorithms interacting together, possibly on distinct numbers of processes. Specifically, we instantiated our framework with the MPI model, within the Topology ToolKit (TTK). While developing this framework, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. We provide a taxonomy for the distributed-memory topological algorithms supported by TTK, depending on their communication needs and provide examples of hybrid MPI+thread parallelizations. Detailed performance analyses show that parallel efficiencies range from $20\%$ to $80\%$ (depending on the algorithms), and that the MPI-specific preconditioning introduced by our framework induces a negligible computation time overhead. We illustrate the new distributed-memory capabilities of TTK with an example of advanced analysis pipeline, combining multiple algorithms, run on the largest publicly available dataset we have found (120 billion vertices) on a standard cluster with 64 nodes (for a total of 1,536 cores). Finally, we provide a roadmap for the completion of TTK's MPI extension, along with generic recommendations for each algorithm communication category.

- **Summary**: To pursue the goal of creating an open-ended agent in Minecraft, an open-ended game environment with unlimited possibilities, this paper introduces a task-centric framework named MCU for Minecraft agent evaluation. The MCU framework leverages the concept of atom tasks as fundamental building blocks, enabling the generation of diverse or even arbitrary tasks. Within the MCU framework, each task is measured with six distinct difficulty scores (time consumption, operational effort, planning complexity, intricacy, creativity, novelty). These scores offer a multi-dimensional assessment of a task from different angles, and thus can reveal an agent's capability on specific facets. The difficulty scores also serve as the feature of each task, which creates a meaningful task space and unveils the relationship between tasks. For efficient evaluation of Minecraft agents employing the MCU framework, we maintain a unified benchmark, namely SkillForge, which comprises representative tasks with diverse categories and difficulty distribution. We also provide convenient filters for users to select tasks to assess specific capabilities of agents. We show that MCU has the high expressivity to cover all tasks used in recent literature on Minecraft agent, and underscores the need for advancements in areas such as creativity, precise control, and out-of-distribution generalization under the goal of open-ended Minecraft agent development.

- **Summary**: Multimodal image-text memes are prevalent on the internet, serving as a unique form of communication that combines visual and textual elements to convey humor, ideas, or emotions. However, some memes take a malicious turn, promoting hateful content and perpetuating discrimination. Detecting hateful memes within this multimodal context is a challenging task that requires understanding the intertwined meaning of text and images. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a novel approach named ISSUES for multimodal hateful meme classification. ISSUES leverages a pre-trained CLIP vision-language model and the textual inversion technique to effectively capture the multimodal semantic content of the memes. The experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Hateful Memes Challenge and HarMeme datasets. The code and the pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/miccunifi/ISSUES.

- **Summary**: In the context of autonomous driving, the significance of effective feature learning is widely acknowledged. While conventional 3D self-supervised pre-training methods have shown widespread success, most methods follow the ideas originally designed for 2D images. In this paper, we present UniPAD, a novel self-supervised learning paradigm applying 3D volumetric differentiable rendering. UniPAD implicitly encodes 3D space, facilitating the reconstruction of continuous 3D shape structures and the intricate appearance characteristics of their 2D projections. The flexibility of our method enables seamless integration into both 2D and 3D frameworks, enabling a more holistic comprehension of the scenes. We manifest the feasibility and effectiveness of UniPAD by conducting extensive experiments on various downstream 3D tasks. Our method significantly improves lidar-, camera-, and lidar-camera-based baseline by 9.1, 7.7, and 6.9 NDS, respectively. Notably, our pre-training pipeline achieves 73.2 NDS for 3D object detection and 79.4 mIoU for 3D semantic segmentation on the nuScenes validation set, achieving state-of-the-art results in comparison with previous methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/Nightmare-n/UniPAD.

- **Summary**: A morph is a combination of two separate facial images and contains identity information of two different people. When used in an identity document, both people can be authenticated by a biometric Face Recognition (FR) system. Morphs can be generated using either a landmark-based approach or approaches based on deep learning such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In a recent paper, we introduced a \emph{worst-case} upper bound on how challenging morphing attacks can be for an FR system. The closer morphs are to this upper bound, the bigger the challenge they pose to FR. We introduced an approach with which it was possible to generate morphs that approximate this upper bound for a known FR system (white box), but not for unknown (black box) FR systems.   In this paper, we introduce a morph generation method that can approximate worst-case morphs even when the FR system is not known. A key contribution is that we include the goal of generating difficult morphs \emph{during} training. Our method is based on Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI) and uses concepts from Wasserstein GANs trained with Gradient Penalty, which were introduced to stabilise the training of GANs. We include these concepts to achieve similar improvement in training stability and call the resulting method Wasserstein ALI (WALI). We finetune WALI using loss functions designed specifically to improve the ability to manipulate identity information in facial images and show how it can generate morphs that are more challenging for FR systems than landmark- or GAN-based morphs. We also show how our findings can be used to improve MIPGAN, an existing StyleGAN-based morph generator.

- **Summary**: Visual prompting (VP) is an emerging parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to adapting pre-trained vision models to solve various downstream image-classification tasks. However, there has hitherto been little systematic study of the design space of VP and no clear benchmark for evaluating its performance. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoVP, an end-to-end expandable framework for automating VP design choices, along with 12 downstream image-classification tasks that can serve as a holistic VP-performance benchmark. Our design space covers 1) the joint optimization of the prompts; 2) the selection of pre-trained models, including image classifiers and text-image encoders; and 3) model output mapping strategies, including nonparametric and trainable label mapping. Our extensive experimental results show that AutoVP outperforms the best-known current VP methods by a substantial margin, having up to 6.7% improvement in accuracy; and attains a maximum performance increase of 27.5% compared to linear-probing (LP) baseline. AutoVP thus makes a two-fold contribution: serving both as an efficient tool for hyperparameter tuning on VP design choices, and as a comprehensive benchmark that can reasonably be expected to accelerate VP's development.

- **Summary**: Active learning presents a promising avenue for training high-performance models with minimal labeled data, achieved by judiciously selecting the most informative instances to label and incorporating them into the task learner. Despite notable advancements in active learning for image recognition, metrics devised or learned to gauge the information gain of data, crucial for query strategy design, do not consistently align with task model performance metrics, such as Mean Average Precision (MeanAP) in object detection tasks. This paper introduces MeanAP-Guided Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MAGRAL), a novel approach that directly utilizes the MeanAP metric of the task model to devise a sampling strategy employing a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent. Built upon LSTM architecture, the agent efficiently explores and selects subsequent training instances, and optimizes the process through policy gradient with MeanAP serving as reward. Recognizing the time-intensive nature of MeanAP computation at each step, we propose fast look-up tables to expedite agent training. We assess MAGRAL's efficacy across popular benchmarks, PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, utilizing different backbone architectures. Empirical findings substantiate MAGRAL's superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods, showcasing substantial performance gains. MAGRAL establishes a robust baseline for reinforced active object detection, signifying its potential in advancing the field.

- **Summary**: Metric learning plays a critical role in training image retrieval and classification. It is also a key algorithm in representation learning, e.g., for feature learning and its alignment in metric space. Hyperbolic embedding has been recently developed, compared to the conventional Euclidean embedding in most of the previously developed models, and can be more effective in representing the hierarchical data structure. Second, uncertainty estimation/measurement is a long-lasting challenge in artificial intelligence. Successful uncertainty estimation can improve a machine learning model's performance, robustness, and security. In Hyperbolic space, uncertainty measurement is at least with equivalent, if not more, critical importance. In this paper, we develop a Hyperbolic image embedding with uncertainty-aware metric learning for image retrieval. We call our method Hyp-UML: Hyperbolic Uncertainty-aware Metric Learning. Our contribution are threefold: we propose an image embedding algorithm based on Hyperbolic space, with their corresponding uncertainty value; we propose two types of uncertainty-aware metric learning, for the popular Contrastive learning and conventional margin-based metric learning, respectively. We perform extensive experimental validations to prove that the proposed algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art results among related methods. The comprehensive ablation study validates the effectiveness of each component of the proposed algorithm.

- **Summary**: In this paper, with the goal of quantifying the qualitative image outputs of a Vision-based Tactile Sensor (VTS), we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a novel Quantitative Surface Tactile Sensor (called QS-TS). QS-TS directly estimates the sensor's gel layer deformation in real-time enabling safe and autonomous tactile manipulation and servoing of delicate objects using robotic manipulators. The core of the proposed sensor is the utilization of miniature 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm synthetic square markers with inner binary patterns and a broad black border, called ArUco Markers. Each ArUco marker can provide real-time camera pose estimation that, in our design, is used as a quantitative measure for obtaining deformation of the QS-TS gel layer. Moreover, thanks to the use of ArUco markers, we propose a unique fabrication procedure that mitigates various challenges associated with the fabrication of the existing marker-based VTSs and offers an intuitive and less-arduous method for the construction of the VTS. Remarkably, the proposed fabrication facilitates the integration and adherence of markers with the gel layer to robustly and reliably obtain a quantitative measure of deformation in real-time regardless of the orientation of ArUco Markers. The performance and efficacy of the proposed QS-TS in estimating the deformation of the sensor's gel layer were experimentally evaluated and verified. Results demonstrate the phenomenal performance of the QS-TS in estimating the deformation of the gel layer with a relative error of <5%.

- **Summary**: Explanation(attention)-guided learning is a method that enhances a model's predictive power by incorporating human understanding during the training phase. While attention-guided learning has shown promising results, it often involves time-consuming and computationally expensive model retraining. To address this issue, we introduce the attention-prompted prediction technique, which enables direct prediction guided by the attention prompt without the need for model retraining. However, this approach presents several challenges, including: 1) How to incorporate the visual attention prompt into the model's decision-making process and leverage it for future predictions even in the absence of a prompt? and 2) How to handle the incomplete information from the visual attention prompt? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Visual Attention-Prompted Prediction and Learning, which seamlessly integrates visual attention prompts into the model's decision-making process and adapts to images both with and without attention prompts for prediction. To address the incomplete information of the visual attention prompt, we introduce a perturbation-based attention map modification method. Additionally, we propose an optimization-based mask aggregation method with a new weight learning function for adaptive perturbed annotation aggregation in the attention map modification process. Our overall framework is designed to learn in an attention-prompt guided multi-task manner to enhance future predictions even for samples without attention prompts and trained in an alternating manner for better convergence. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing predictions for samples, both with and without provided prompts.

- **Summary**: Lately, remarkable advancements of artificial intelligence have been attributed to the integration of self-supervised learning scheme. Despite impressive achievements within NLP, yet SSL in computer vision has not been able to stay on track comparatively. Recently, integration of contrastive learning on top of existing SSL models has established considerable progress in computer vision through which visual SSL models have outperformed their supervised counterparts. Nevertheless, most of these improvements were limited to classification tasks, and also, few works have been dedicated to evaluation of SSL models in real-world scenarios of computer vision, while the majority of works are centered around datasets containing class-wise portrait images, most notably, ImageNet. Consequently, in this work, we have considered dense prediction task of semantic segmentation in security inspection x-ray images to evaluate our proposed model Segmentation Localization. Based upon the model Instance Localization, our model SegLoc has managed to address one of the most challenging downsides of contrastive learning, i.e., false negative pairs of query embeddings. In order to do so, in contrast to baseline model InsLoc, our pretraining dataset is synthesized by cropping, transforming, then pasting already labeled segments from an available labeled dataset, foregrounds, onto instances of an unlabeled dataset, backgrounds. In our case, PIDray and SIXray datasets are considered as labeled and unlabeled datasets, respectively. Moreover, we fully harness labels by avoiding false negative pairs through implementing the idea, one queue per class, in MoCo-v2 whereby negative pairs corresponding to each query are extracted from its corresponding queue within the memory bank. Our approach has outperformed random initialization by 3% to 6%, while having underperformed supervised initialization.

- **Summary**: Text-guided image editing faces significant challenges to training and inference flexibility. Much literature collects large amounts of annotated image-text pairs to train text-conditioned generative models from scratch, which is expensive and not efficient. After that, some approaches that leverage pre-trained vision-language models are put forward to avoid data collection, but they are also limited by either per text-prompt optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. To address these issues, we investigate and identify a specific space, referred to as CLIP DeltaSpace, where the CLIP visual feature difference of two images is semantically aligned with the CLIP textual feature difference of their corresponding text descriptions. Based on DeltaSpace, we propose a novel framework called DeltaEdit, which maps the CLIP visual feature differences to the latent space directions of a generative model during the training phase, and predicts the latent space directions from the CLIP textual feature differences during the inference phase. And this design endows DeltaEdit with two advantages: (1) text-free training; (2) generalization to various text prompts for zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of DeltaEdit with different generative models, including both the GAN model and the diffusion model, in achieving flexible text-guided image editing.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) offer state of the art performance in various computer vision tasks. Many of those tasks require different subtypes of affine invariances (scale, rotational, translational) to image transformations. Convolutional layers are translation equivariant by design, but in their basic form lack invariances. In this work we investigate how best to include rotational invariance in a CNN for image classification. Our experiments show that networks trained with data augmentation alone can classify rotated images nearly as well as in the normal unrotated case; this increase in representational power comes only at the cost of training time. We also compare data augmentation versus two modified CNN models for achieving rotational invariance or equivariance, Spatial Transformer Networks and Group Equivariant CNNs, finding no significant accuracy increase with these specialized methods. In the case of data augmented networks, we also analyze which layers help the network to encode the rotational invariance, which is important for understanding its limitations and how to best retrain a network with data augmentation to achieve invariance to rotation.

- **Summary**: During past decades a marked manifestation of widespread erosion phenomena was studied worldwide. Global conservation community has launched campaigns at local, regional and continental level in developing countries for preservation of soil resources in order not only to stop or mitigate human impact on nature but also to improve life in rural areas introducing new approaches for soil cultivation. After the adoption of Sustainable Development Goals of UNs and launching several world initiatives such as the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) the world came to realize the very importance of the soil resources on which the biosphere relies for its existence. The main goal of the chapter is to review different types and structures erosion models as well as their applications. Several methods using spatial analysis capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS) are in operation for soil erosion risk assessment, such as Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in operation worldwide and in the USA and MESALES model. These and more models are being discussed in the present work alongside more experimental models and methods for assessing soil erosion risk such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine and Deep Learning, etc. At the end of this work, a prospectus for the future development of soil erosion risk assessment is drawn.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated compelling generation quality by optimizing the variational lower bound through a simple denoising score matching loss. In this paper, we provide theoretical evidence that the prevailing practice of using a constant loss weight strategy in diffusion models leads to biased estimation during the training phase. Simply optimizing the denoising network to predict Gaussian noise with constant weighting may hinder precise estimations of original images. To address the issue, we propose an elegant and effective weighting strategy grounded in the theoretically unbiased principle. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic exploration to dissect the inherent bias problem deriving from constant weighting loss from the perspectives of its existence, impact and reasons. These analyses are expected to advance our understanding and demystify the inner workings of diffusion models. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed debiased estimation method significantly enhances sample quality without the reliance on complex techniques, and exhibits improved efficiency compared to the baseline method both in training and sampling processes.

- **Summary**: In manufacturing sectors such as textiles and electronics, manual processes are a fundamental part of production. The analysis and monitoring of the processes is necessary for efficient production design. Traditional methods for analyzing manual processes are complex, expensive, and inflexible. Compared to established approaches such as Methods-Time-Measurement (MTM), machine learning (ML) methods promise: Higher flexibility, self-sufficient & permanent use, lower costs. In this work, based on a video stream, the current motion class in a manual assembly process is detected. With information on the current motion, Key-Performance-Indicators (KPIs) can be derived easily. A skeleton-based action recognition approach is taken, as this field recently shows major success in machine vision tasks. For skeleton-based action recognition in manual assembly, no sufficient pre-work could be found. Therefore, a ML pipeline is developed, to enable extensive research on different (pre-) processing methods and neural nets. Suitable well generalizing approaches are found, proving the potential of ML to enhance analyzation of manual processes. Models detect the current motion, performed by an operator in manual assembly, but the results can be transferred to all kinds of manual processes.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generations. Given a set of video clips of the same motion concept, the task of Motion Customization is to adapt existing text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos with this motion. For example, generating a video with a car moving in a prescribed manner under specific camera movements to make a movie, or a video illustrating how a bear would lift weights to inspire creators. Adaptation methods have been developed for customizing appearance like subject or style, yet unexplored for motion. It is straightforward to extend mainstream adaption methods for motion customization, including full model tuning, parameter-efficient tuning of additional layers, and Low-Rank Adaptions (LoRAs). However, the motion concept learned by these methods is often coupled with the limited appearances in the training videos, making it difficult to generalize the customized motion to other appearances. To overcome this challenge, we propose MotionDirector, with a dual-path LoRAs architecture to decouple the learning of appearance and motion. Further, we design a novel appearance-debiased temporal loss to mitigate the influence of appearance on the temporal training objective. Experimental results show the proposed method can generate videos of diverse appearances for the customized motions. Our method also supports various downstream applications, such as the mixing of different videos with their appearance and motion respectively, and animating a single image with customized motions. Our code and model weights will be released.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we focus on editing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Compared to editing single-modal LLMs, multimodal model editing is more challenging, which demands a higher level of scrutiny and careful consideration in the editing process. To facilitate research in this area, we construct a new benchmark, dubbed MMEdit, for editing multimodal LLMs and establishing a suite of innovative metrics for evaluation. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving various model editing baselines and analyze the impact of editing different components for multimodal LLMs. Empirically, we notice that previous baselines can implement editing multimodal LLMs to some extent, but the effect is still barely satisfactory, indicating the potential difficulty of this task. We hope that our work can provide the NLP community with insights. Code and dataset are available in https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.

We introduce object-centric embeddings (OCEs), which embed image patches such that the spatial offsets between patches cropped from the same object are preserved. Those learnt embeddings can be used to delineate individual objects and thus obtain instance segmentations. Here, we show theoretically that, under assumptions commonly found in microscopy images, OCEs can be learnt through a self-supervised task that predicts the spatial offset between image patches. Together, this forms an unsupervised cell instance segmentation method which we evaluate on nine diverse large-scale microscopy datasets. Segmentations obtained with our method lead to substantially improved results, compared to state-of-the-art baselines on six out of nine datasets, and perform on par on the remaining three datasets. If ground-truth annotations are available, our method serves as an excellent starting point for supervised training, reducing the required amount of ground-truth needed by one order of magnitude, thus substantially increasing the practical applicability of our method.

- **Summary**: Representing and rendering dynamic scenes has been an important but challenging task. Especially, to accurately model complex motions, high efficiency is usually hard to maintain. We introduce the 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) to achieve real-time dynamic scene rendering while also enjoying high training and storage efficiency. An efficient deformation field is constructed to model both Gaussian motions and shape deformations. Different adjacent Gaussians are connected via a HexPlane to produce more accurate position and shape deformations. Our 4D-GS method achieves real-time rendering under high resolutions, 70 FPS at a 800$\times$800 resolution on an RTX 3090 GPU, while maintaining comparable or higher quality than previous state-of-the-art methods. More demos and code are available at https://guanjunwu.github.io/4dgs/.

- **Summary**: In recent times, the generation of 3D assets from text prompts has shown impressive results. Both 2D and 3D diffusion models can generate decent 3D objects based on prompts. 3D diffusion models have good 3D consistency, but their quality and generalization are limited as trainable 3D data is expensive and hard to obtain. 2D diffusion models enjoy strong abilities of generalization and fine generation, but the 3D consistency is hard to guarantee. This paper attempts to bridge the power from the two types of diffusion models via the recent explicit and efficient 3D Gaussian splatting representation. A fast 3D generation framework, named as \name, is proposed, where the 3D diffusion model provides point cloud priors for initialization and the 2D diffusion model enriches the geometry and appearance. Operations of noisy point growing and color perturbation are introduced to enhance the initialized Gaussians. Our \name can generate a high-quality 3D instance within 25 minutes on one GPU, much faster than previous methods, while the generated instances can be directly rendered in real time.

- **Summary**: This work proposes a unified framework called UniPose to detect keypoints of any articulated (e.g., human and animal), rigid, and soft objects via visual or textual prompts for fine-grained vision understanding and manipulation. Keypoint is a structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representation of any object, especially articulated objects. Existing fine-grained promptable tasks mainly focus on object instance detection and segmentation but often fail to identify fine-grained granularity and structured information of image and instance, such as eyes, leg, paw, etc. Meanwhile, prompt-based keypoint detection is still under-explored. To bridge the gap, we make the first attempt to develop an end-to-end prompt-based keypoint detection framework called UniPose to detect keypoints of any objects. As keypoint detection tasks are unified in this framework, we can leverage 13 keypoint detection datasets with 338 keypoints across 1,237 categories over 400K instances to train a generic keypoint detection model. UniPose can effectively align text-to-keypoint and image-to-keypoint due to the mutual enhancement of textual and visual prompts based on the cross-modality contrastive learning optimization objectives. Our experimental results show that UniPose has strong fine-grained localization and generalization abilities across image styles, categories, and poses. Based on UniPose as a generalist keypoint detector, we hope it could serve fine-grained visual perception, understanding, and generation.

- **Summary**: We present a system that automatically brings street view imagery to life by populating it with naturally behaving, animated pedestrians and vehicles. Our approach is to remove existing people and vehicles from the input image, insert moving objects with proper scale, angle, motion, and appearance, plan paths and traffic behavior, as well as render the scene with plausible occlusion and shadowing effects. The system achieves these by reconstructing the still image street scene, simulating crowd behavior, and rendering with consistent lighting, visibility, occlusions, and shadows. We demonstrate results on a diverse range of street scenes including regular still images and panoramas.

- **Summary**: The rise of deep learning algorithms has led to significant advancements in computer vision tasks, but their "black box" nature has raised concerns regarding interpretability. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a critical area of research aiming to open this "black box", and shed light on the decision-making process of AI models. Visual explanations, as a subset of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), provide intuitive insights into the decision-making processes of AI models handling visual data by highlighting influential areas in an input image. Despite extensive research conducted on visual explanations, most evaluations are model-centered since the availability of corresponding real-world datasets with ground truth explanations is scarce in the context of image data. To bridge this gap, we introduce an XAI Benchmark comprising a dataset collection from diverse topics that provide both class labels and corresponding explanation annotations for images. We have processed data from diverse domains to align with our unified visual explanation framework. We introduce a comprehensive Visual Explanation pipeline, which integrates data loading, preprocessing, experimental setup, and model evaluation processes. This structure enables researchers to conduct fair comparisons of various visual explanation techniques. In addition, we provide a comprehensive review of over 10 evaluation methods for visual explanation to assist researchers in effectively utilizing our dataset collection. To further assess the performance of existing visual explanation methods, we conduct experiments on selected datasets using various model-centered and ground truth-centered evaluation metrics. We envision this benchmark could facilitate the advancement of visual explanation models. The XAI dataset collection and easy-to-use code for evaluation are publicly accessible at https://xaidataset.github.io.

- **Summary**: The Pavement Condition Index (PCI) is a widely used metric for evaluating pavement performance based on the type, extent and severity of distresses detected on a pavement surface. In recent times, significant progress has been made in utilizing deep-learning approaches to automate PCI estimation process. However, the current approaches rely on at least two separate models to estimate PCI values -- one model dedicated to determining the type and extent and another for estimating their severity. This approach presents several challenges, including complexities, high computational resource demands, and maintenance burdens that necessitate careful consideration and resolution. To overcome these challenges, the current study develops a unified multi-tasking model that predicts the PCI directly from a top-down pavement image. The proposed architecture is a multi-task model composed of one encoder for feature extraction and four decoders to handle specific tasks: two detection heads, one segmentation head and one PCI estimation head. By multitasking, we are able to extract features from the detection and segmentation heads for automatically estimating the PCI directly from the images. The model performs very well on our benchmarked and open pavement distress dataset that is annotated for multitask learning (the first of its kind). To our best knowledge, this is the first work that can estimate PCI directly from an image at real time speeds while maintaining excellent accuracy on all related tasks for crack detection and segmentation.

- **Summary**: We introduce ``Idea to Image,'' a system that enables multimodal iterative self-refinement with GPT-4V(ision) for automatic image design and generation. Humans can quickly identify the characteristics of different text-to-image (T2I) models via iterative explorations. This enables them to efficiently convert their high-level generation ideas into effective T2I prompts that can produce good images. We investigate if systems based on large multimodal models (LMMs) can develop analogous multimodal self-refinement abilities that enable exploring unknown models or environments via self-refining tries. Idea2Img cyclically generates revised T2I prompts to synthesize draft images, and provides directional feedback for prompt revision, both conditioned on its memory of the probed T2I model's characteristics. The iterative self-refinement brings Idea2Img various advantages over vanilla T2I models. Notably, Idea2Img can process input ideas with interleaved image-text sequences, follow ideas with design instructions, and generate images of better semantic and visual qualities. The user preference study validates the efficacy of multimodal iterative self-refinement on automatic image design and generation.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present an approach to construct a video-based robot policy capable of reliably executing diverse tasks across different robots and environments from few video demonstrations without using any action annotations. Our method leverages images as a task-agnostic representation, encoding both the state and action information, and text as a general representation for specifying robot goals. By synthesizing videos that ``hallucinate'' robot executing actions and in combination with dense correspondences between frames, our approach can infer the closed-formed action to execute to an environment without the need of any explicit action labels. This unique capability allows us to train the policy solely based on RGB videos and deploy learned policies to various robotic tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in learning policies on table-top manipulation and navigation tasks. Additionally, we contribute an open-source framework for efficient video modeling, enabling the training of high-fidelity policy models with four GPUs within a single day.



### Visual Data-Type Understanding does not emerge from Scaling Vision-Language Models

- **Summary**: Recent advances in the development of vision-language models (VLMs) are yielding remarkable success in recognizing visual semantic content, including impressive instances of compositional image understanding. Here, we introduce the novel task of Visual Data-Type Identification, a basic perceptual skill with implications for data curation (e.g., noisy data-removal from large datasets, domain-specific retrieval) and autonomous vision (e.g., distinguishing changing weather conditions from camera lens staining). We develop two datasets consisting of animal images altered across a diverse set of 27 visual data-types, spanning four broad categories. An extensive zero-shot evaluation of 39 VLMs, ranging from 100M to 80B parameters, shows a nuanced performance landscape. While VLMs are reasonably good at identifying certain stylistic \textit{data-types}, such as cartoons and sketches, they struggle with simpler data-types arising from basic manipulations like image rotations or additive noise. Our findings reveal that (i) model scaling alone yields marginal gains for contrastively-trained models like CLIP, and (ii) there is a pronounced drop in performance for the largest auto-regressively trained VLMs like OpenFlamingo. This finding points to a blind spot in current frontier VLMs: they excel in recognizing semantic content but fail to acquire an understanding of visual data-types through scaling. By analyzing the pre-training distributions of these models and incorporating data-type information into the captions during fine-tuning, we achieve a significant enhancement in performance. By exploring this previously uncharted task, we aim to set the stage for further advancing VLMs to equip them with visual data-type understanding.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advances in large-scale text-to-image models, achieving hyper-realistic human image generation remains a desirable yet unsolved task. Existing models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 tend to generate human images with incoherent parts or unnatural poses. To tackle these challenges, our key insight is that human image is inherently structural over multiple granularities, from the coarse-level body skeleton to fine-grained spatial geometry. Therefore, capturing such correlations between the explicit appearance and latent structure in one model is essential to generate coherent and natural human images. To this end, we propose a unified framework, HyperHuman, that generates in-the-wild human images of high realism and diverse layouts. Specifically, 1) we first build a large-scale human-centric dataset, named HumanVerse, which consists of 340M images with comprehensive annotations like human pose, depth, and surface normal. 2) Next, we propose a Latent Structural Diffusion Model that simultaneously denoises the depth and surface normal along with the synthesized RGB image. Our model enforces the joint learning of image appearance, spatial relationship, and geometry in a unified network, where each branch in the model complements to each other with both structural awareness and textural richness. 3) Finally, to further boost the visual quality, we propose a Structure-Guided Refiner to compose the predicted conditions for more detailed generation of higher resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework yields the state-of-the-art performance, generating hyper-realistic human images under diverse scenarios.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach named OmniControl for incorporating flexible spatial control signals into a text-conditioned human motion generation model based on the diffusion process. Unlike previous methods that can only control the pelvis trajectory, OmniControl can incorporate flexible spatial control signals over different joints at different times with only one model. Specifically, we propose analytic spatial guidance that ensures the generated motion can tightly conform to the input control signals. At the same time, realism guidance is introduced to refine all the joints to generate more coherent motion. Both the spatial and realism guidance are essential and they are highly complementary for balancing control accuracy and motion realism. By combining them, OmniControl generates motions that are realistic, coherent, and consistent with the spatial constraints. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets show that OmniControl not only achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on pelvis control but also shows promising results when incorporating the constraints over other joints.

- **Summary**: Real-world robotic tasks stretch over extended horizons and encompass multiple stages. Learning long-horizon manipulation tasks, however, is a long-standing challenge, and demands decomposing the overarching task into several manageable subtasks to facilitate policy learning and generalization to unseen tasks. Prior task decomposition methods require task-specific knowledge, are computationally intensive, and cannot readily be applied to new tasks. To address these shortcomings, we propose Universal Visual Decomposer (UVD), an off-the-shelf task decomposition method for visual long horizon manipulation using pre-trained visual representations designed for robotic control. At a high level, UVD discovers subgoals by detecting phase shifts in the embedding space of the pre-trained representation. Operating purely on visual demonstrations without auxiliary information, UVD can effectively extract visual subgoals embedded in the videos, while incurring zero additional training cost on top of standard visuomotor policy training. Goal-conditioned policies learned with UVD-discovered subgoals exhibit significantly improved compositional generalization at test time to unseen tasks. Furthermore, UVD-discovered subgoals can be used to construct goal-based reward shaping that jump-starts temporally extended exploration for reinforcement learning. We extensively evaluate UVD on both simulation and real-world tasks, and in all cases, UVD substantially outperforms baselines across imitation and reinforcement learning settings on in-domain and out-of-domain task sequences alike, validating the clear advantage of automated visual task decomposition within the simple, compact UVD framework.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning has unlocked the potential of scaling up pretraining to billions of images, since annotation is unnecessary. But are we making the best use of data? How more economical can we be? In this work, we attempt to answer this question by making two contributions. First, we investigate first-person videos and introduce a "Walking Tours" dataset. These videos are high-resolution, hours-long, captured in a single uninterrupted take, depicting a large number of objects and actions with natural scene transitions. They are unlabeled and uncurated, thus realistic for self-supervision and comparable with human learning.   Second, we introduce a novel self-supervised image pretraining method tailored for learning from continuous videos. Existing methods typically adapt image-based pretraining approaches to incorporate more frames. Instead, we advocate a "tracking to learn to recognize" approach. Our method called DoRA, leads to attention maps that Discover and tRAck objects over time in an end-to-end manner, using transformer cross-attention. We derive multiple views from the tracks and use them in a classical self-supervised distillation loss. Using our novel approach, a single Walking Tours video remarkably becomes a strong competitor to ImageNet for several image and video downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to tackle the challenge of dynamic view synthesis from multi-view videos. The key observation is that while previous grid-based methods offer consistent rendering, they fall short in capturing appearance details of a complex dynamic scene, a domain where multi-view image-based rendering methods demonstrate the opposite properties. To combine the best of two worlds, we introduce Im4D, a hybrid scene representation that consists of a grid-based geometry representation and a multi-view image-based appearance representation. Specifically, the dynamic geometry is encoded as a 4D density function composed of spatiotemporal feature planes and a small MLP network, which globally models the scene structure and facilitates the rendering consistency. We represent the scene appearance by the original multi-view videos and a network that learns to predict the color of a 3D point from image features, instead of memorizing detailed appearance totally with networks, thereby naturally making the learning of networks easier. Our method is evaluated on five dynamic view synthesis datasets including DyNeRF, ZJU-MoCap, NHR, DNA-Rendering and ENeRF-Outdoor datasets. The results show that Im4D exhibits state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality and can be trained efficiently, while realizing real-time rendering with a speed of 79.8 FPS for 512x512 images, on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

- **Summary**: In contrast to numerous NLP and 2D computer vision foundational models, the learning of a robust and highly generalized 3D foundational model poses considerably greater challenges. This is primarily due to the inherent data variability and the diversity of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive 3D pre-training framework designed to facilitate the acquisition of efficient 3D representations, thereby establishing a pathway to 3D foundational models. Motivated by the fact that informative 3D features should be able to encode rich geometry and appearance cues that can be utilized to render realistic images, we propose a novel universal paradigm to learn point cloud representations by differentiable neural rendering, serving as a bridge between 3D and 2D worlds. We train a point cloud encoder within a devised volumetric neural renderer by comparing the rendered images with the real images. Notably, our approach demonstrates the seamless integration of the learned 3D encoder into diverse downstream tasks. These tasks encompass not only high-level challenges such as 3D detection and segmentation but also low-level objectives like 3D reconstruction and image synthesis, spanning both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Besides, we also illustrate the capability of pre-training a 2D backbone using the proposed universal methodology, surpassing conventional pre-training methods by a large margin. For the first time, PonderV2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 indoor and outdoor benchmarks. The consistent improvements in various settings imply the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Rendering scenes observed in a monocular video from novel viewpoints is a challenging problem. For static scenes the community has studied both scene-specific optimization techniques, which optimize on every test scene, and generalized techniques, which only run a deep net forward pass on a test scene. In contrast, for dynamic scenes, scene-specific optimization techniques exist, but, to our best knowledge, there is currently no generalized method for dynamic novel view synthesis from a given monocular video. To answer whether generalized dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular videos is possible today, we establish an analysis framework based on existing techniques and work toward the generalized approach. We find a pseudo-generalized process without scene-specific appearance optimization is possible, but geometrically and temporally consistent depth estimates are needed. Despite no scene-specific appearance optimization, the pseudo-generalized approach improves upon some scene-specific methods.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved substantial progress in multimodal perception and reasoning. Furthermore, when seamlessly integrated into an embodied agent, it signifies a crucial stride towards the creation of autonomous and context-aware systems capable of formulating plans and executing commands with precision. In this paper, we introduce Octopus, a novel VLM designed to proficiently decipher an agent's vision and textual task objectives and to formulate intricate action sequences and generate executable code. Our design allows the agent to adeptly handle a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games. Octopus is trained by leveraging GPT-4 to control an explorative agent to generate training data, i.e., action blueprints and the corresponding executable code, within our experimental environment called OctoVerse. We also collect the feedback that allows the enhanced training scheme of Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we illuminate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, and the proposed RLEF turns out to refine the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our model architecture, simulator, and dataset, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.

- **Summary**: Additive manufacturing (AM) is gaining attention across various industries like healthcare, aerospace, and automotive. However, identifying defects early in the AM process can reduce production costs and improve productivity - a key challenge. This study explored the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) approaches, specifically transfer learning (TL) models, for defect detection in 3D-printed cylinders. Images of cylinders were analyzed using models including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionResNetV2, and MobileNetV2. Performance was compared across two datasets using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. In the first study, VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, and MobileNetV2 achieved perfect scores. In contrast, ResNet50 had the lowest performance, with an average F1-score of 0.32. Similarly, in the second study, MobileNetV2 correctly classified all instances, while ResNet50 struggled with more false positives and fewer true positives, resulting in an F1-score of 0.75. Overall, the findings suggest certain TL models like MobileNetV2 can deliver high accuracy for AM defect classification, although performance varies across algorithms. The results provide insights into model optimization and integration needs for reliable automated defect analysis during 3D printing. By identifying the top-performing TL techniques, this study aims to enhance AM product quality through robust image-based monitoring and inspection.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the safety and reliability of artificial intelligence algorithms, especially in the medical domain. In the context of the Medical OOD (MOOD) detection challenge 2023, we propose a pipeline that combines a histogram-based method and a diffusion-based method. The histogram-based method is designed to accurately detect homogeneous anomalies in the toy examples of the challenge, such as blobs with constant intensity values. The diffusion-based method is based on one of the latest methods for unsupervised anomaly detection, called DDPM-OOD. We explore this method and propose extensive post-processing steps for pixel-level and sample-level anomaly detection on brain MRI and abdominal CT data provided by the challenge. Our results show that the proposed DDPM method is sensitive to blur and bias field samples, but faces challenges with anatomical deformation, black slice, and swapped patches. These findings suggest that further research is needed to improve the performance of DDPM for OOD detection in medical images.

- **Summary**: Recent efforts to enable visual navigation using large language models have mainly focused on developing complex prompt systems. These systems incorporate instructions, observations, and history into massive text prompts, which are then combined with pre-trained large language models to facilitate visual navigation. In contrast, our approach aims to fine-tune large language models for visual navigation without extensive prompt engineering. Our design involves a simple text prompt, current observations, and a history collector model that gathers information from previous observations as input. For output, our design provides a probability distribution of possible actions that the agent can take during navigation. We train our model using human demonstrations and collision signals from the Habitat-Matterport 3D Dataset (HM3D). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art behavior cloning methods and effectively reduces collision rates.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art models in semantic segmentation primarily operate on single, static images, generating corresponding segmentation masks. This one-shot approach leaves little room for error correction, as the models lack the capability to integrate multiple observations for enhanced accuracy. Inspired by work on semantic change detection, we address this limitation by introducing a methodology that leverages a sequence of observables generated for each static input image. By adding this "temporal" dimension, we exploit strong signal correlations between successive observations in the sequence to reduce error rates. Our framework, dubbed SSG2 (Semantic Segmentation Generation 2), employs a dual-encoder, single-decoder base network augmented with a sequence model. The base model learns to predict the set intersection, union, and difference of labels from dual-input images. Given a fixed target input image and a set of support images, the sequence model builds the predicted mask of the target by synthesizing the partial views from each sequence step and filtering out noise. We evaluate SSG2 across three diverse datasets: UrbanMonitor, featuring orthoimage tiles from Darwin, Australia with five spectral bands and 0.2m spatial resolution; ISPRS Potsdam, which includes true orthophoto images with multiple spectral bands and a 5cm ground sampling distance; and ISIC2018, a medical dataset focused on skin lesion segmentation, particularly melanoma. The SSG2 model demonstrates rapid convergence within the first few tens of epochs and significantly outperforms UNet-like baseline models with the same number of gradient updates. However, the addition of the temporal dimension results in an increased memory footprint. While this could be a limitation, it is offset by the advent of higher-memory GPUs and coding optimizations.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the security aspects of federated learning applications in medical image analysis. Current robustness-oriented methods like adversarial training, secure aggregation, and homomorphic encryption often risk privacy compromises. The central aim is to defend the network against potential privacy breaches while maintaining model robustness against adversarial manipulations. We show that incorporating distributed noise, grounded in the privacy guarantees in federated settings, enables the development of a adversarially robust model that also meets federated privacy standards. We conducted comprehensive evaluations across diverse attack scenarios, parameters, and use cases in cancer imaging, concentrating on pathology, meningioma, and glioma. The results reveal that the incorporation of distributed noise allows for the attainment of security levels comparable to those of conventional adversarial training while requiring fewer retraining samples to establish a robust model.

- **Summary**: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are widely used in remote sensing. Interpreting SAR images can be challenging due to their intrinsic speckle noise and grayscale nature. To address this issue, SAR colorization has emerged as a research direction to colorize gray scale SAR images while preserving the original spatial information and radiometric information. However, this research field is still in its early stages, and many limitations can be highlighted. In this paper, we propose a full research line for supervised learning-based approaches to SAR colorization. Our approach includes a protocol for generating synthetic color SAR images, several baselines, and an effective method based on the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) for SAR colorization. We also propose numerical assessment metrics for the problem at hand. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a research line for SAR colorization that includes a protocol, a benchmark, and a complete performance evaluation. Our extensive tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed cGAN-based network for SAR colorization. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) is a tumor agnostic biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. However, MSI status is not routinely tested in prostate cancer, in part due to low prevalence and assay cost. As such, prediction of MSI status from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) could identify prostate cancer patients most likely to benefit from confirmatory testing and becoming eligible for immunotherapy. Prostate biopsies and surgical resections from de-identified records of consecutive prostate cancer patients referred to our institution were analyzed. Their MSI status was determined by next generation sequencing. Patients before a cutoff date were split into an algorithm development set (n=4015, MSI-H 1.8%) and a paired validation set (n=173, MSI-H 19.7%) that consisted of two serial sections from each sample, one stained and scanned internally and the other at an external site. Patients after the cutoff date formed the temporal validation set (n=1350, MSI-H 2.3%). Attention-based multiple instance learning models were trained to predict MSI-H from H&E WSIs. The MSI-H predictor achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.78 (95% CI [0.69-0.86]), 0.72 (95% CI [0.63-0.81]), and 0.72 (95% CI [0.62-0.82]) on the internally prepared, externally prepared, and temporal validation sets, respectively. While MSI-H status is significantly correlated with Gleason score, the model remained predictive within each Gleason score subgroup. In summary, we developed and validated an AI-based MSI-H diagnostic model on a large real-world cohort of routine H&E slides, which effectively generalized to externally stained and scanned samples and a temporally independent validation cohort. This algorithm has the potential to direct prostate cancer patients toward immunotherapy and to identify MSI-H cases secondary to Lynch syndrome.

- **Summary**: Tactile exploration plays a crucial role in understanding object structures for fundamental robotics tasks such as grasping and manipulation. However, efficiently exploring such objects using tactile sensors is challenging, primarily due to the large-scale unknown environments and limited sensing coverage of these sensors. To this end, we present AcTExplore, an active tactile exploration method driven by reinforcement learning for object reconstruction at scales that automatically explores the object surfaces in a limited number of steps. Through sufficient exploration, our algorithm incrementally collects tactile data and reconstructs 3D shapes of the objects as well, which can serve as a representation for higher-level downstream tasks. Our method achieves an average of 95.97% IoU coverage on unseen YCB objects while just being trained on primitive shapes.

- **Summary**: While the recent advancements in deep-learning-based point cloud upsampling methods improve the input to autonomous driving systems, they still suffer from the uncertainty of denser point generation resulting from end-to-end learning. For example, due to the vague training objectives of the models, their performance depends on the point distributions of the input and the ground truth. This causes problems of domain dependency between synthetic and real-scanned point clouds and issues with substantial model sizes and dataset requirements. Additionally, many existing methods upsample point clouds with a fixed scaling rate, making them inflexible and computationally redundant. This paper addresses the above problems by proposing a ray-based upsampling approach with an arbitrary rate, where a depth prediction is made for each query ray. The method simulates the ray marching algorithm to achieve more precise and stable ray-depth predictions through implicit surface learning. The rule-based mid-point query sampling method enables a uniform output point distribution without requiring model training using the Chamfer distance loss function, which can exhibit bias towards the training dataset. Self-supervised learning becomes possible with accurate ground truths within the input point cloud. The results demonstrate the method's versatility across different domains and training scenarios with limited computational resources and training data. This allows the upsampling task to transition from academic research to real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based object detectors (DETR) have shown significant performance across machine vision tasks, ultimately in object detection. This detector is based on a self-attention mechanism along with the transformer encoder-decoder architecture to capture the global context in the image. The critical issue to be addressed is how this model architecture can handle different image nuisances, such as occlusion and adversarial perturbations. We studied this issue by measuring the performance of DETR with different experiments and benchmarking the network with convolutional neural network (CNN) based detectors like YOLO and Faster-RCNN. We found that DETR performs well when it comes to resistance to interference from information loss in occlusion images. Despite that, we found that the adversarial stickers put on the image require the network to produce a new unnecessary set of keys, queries, and values, which in most cases, results in a misdirection of the network. DETR also performed poorer than YOLOv5 in the image corruption benchmark. Furthermore, we found that DETR depends heavily on the main query when making a prediction, which leads to imbalanced contributions between queries since the main query receives most of the gradient flow.

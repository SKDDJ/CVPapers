- **Summary**: Most face identification approaches employ a Siamese neural network to compare two images at the image embedding level. Yet, this technique can be subject to occlusion (e.g. faces with masks or sunglasses) and out-of-distribution data. DeepFace-EMD (Phan et al. 2022) reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on out-of-distribution data by first comparing two images at the image level, and then at the patch level. Yet, its later patch-wise re-ranking stage admits a large $O(n^3 \log n)$ time complexity (for $n$ patches in an image) due to the optimal transport optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel, 2-image Vision Transformers (ViTs) that compares two images at the patch level using cross-attention. After training on 2M pairs of images on CASIA Webface (Yi et al. 2014), our model performs at a comparable accuracy as DeepFace-EMD on out-of-distribution data, yet at an inference speed more than twice as fast as DeepFace-EMD (Phan et al. 2022). In addition, via a human study, our model shows promising explainability through the visualization of cross-attention. We believe our work can inspire more explorations in using ViTs for face identification.

- **Summary**: The goal of 2D human pose estimation (HPE) is to localize anatomical landmarks, given an image of a person in a pose. SOTA techniques make use of thousands of labeled figures (finetuning transformers or training deep CNNs), acquired using labor-intensive crowdsourcing. On the other hand, self-supervised methods re-frame the HPE task as a reconstruction problem, enabling them to leverage the vast amount of unlabeled visual data, though at the present cost of accuracy. In this work, we explore ways to improve self-supervised HPE. We (1) analyze the relationship between reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy, (2) develop a model pipeline that outperforms the baseline which inspired our work, using less than one-third the amount of training data, and (3) offer a new metric suitable for self-supervised settings that measures the consistency of predicted body part length proportions. We show that a combination of well-engineered reconstruction losses and inductive priors can help coordinate pose learning alongside reconstruction in a self-supervised paradigm.

- **Summary**: Modeling and synthesizing textures are essential for enhancing the realism of virtual environments. Methods that directly synthesize textures in 3D offer distinct advantages to the UV-mapping-based methods as they can create seamless textures and align more closely with the ways textures form in nature. We propose Mesh Neural Cellular Automata (MeshNCA), a method for directly synthesizing dynamic textures on 3D meshes without requiring any UV maps. MeshNCA is a generalized type of cellular automata that can operate on a set of cells arranged on a non-grid structure such as vertices of a 3D mesh. While only being trained on an Icosphere mesh, MeshNCA shows remarkable generalization and can synthesize textures on any mesh in real time after the training. Additionally, it accommodates multi-modal supervision and can be trained using different targets such as images, text prompts, and motion vector fields. Moreover, we conceptualize a way of grafting trained MeshNCA instances, enabling texture interpolation. Our MeshNCA model enables real-time 3D texture synthesis on meshes and allows several user interactions including texture density/orientation control, a grafting brush, and motion speed/direction control. Finally, we implement the forward pass of our MeshNCA model using the WebGL shading language and showcase our trained models in an online interactive demo which is accessible on personal computers and smartphones.

- **Summary**: With the success of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) in 3D-aware portrait editing, a variety of works have achieved promising results regarding both quality and 3D consistency. However, these methods heavily rely on per-prompt optimization when handling natural language as editing instructions. Due to the lack of labeled human face 3D datasets and effective architectures, the area of human-instructed 3D-aware editing for open-world portraits in an end-to-end manner remains under-explored. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end diffusion-based framework termed InstructPix2NeRF, which enables instructed 3D-aware portrait editing from a single open-world image with human instructions. At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Loop closure, as one of the crucial components in SLAM, plays an essential role in correcting the accumulated errors. Traditional appearance-based methods, such as bag-of-words models, are often limited by local 2D features and the volume of training data, making them less versatile and robust in real-world scenarios, leading to missed detections or false positives detections in loop closure. To address these issues, we first propose a object-level data association method based on multi-level verification, which can associate 2D semantic features of current frame with 3D objects landmarks of map. Next, taking advantage of these association relations, we introduce a semantic loop closure method based on quadric-level object map topology, which represents scenes through the topological graph of objects and achieves accurate loop closure at a wide field of view by comparing differences in the topological graphs. Finally, we integrate these two methods into a complete object-aware SLAM system. Qualitative experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed object-level data association algorithm. Quantitative experiments show that our semantic loop closure method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall and localization accuracy metrics.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction plays a vital role in automotive radar systems, facilitating precise tracking and decision-making in autonomous driving. Generative adversarial networks with the ability to learn a distribution over future trajectories tend to predict out-of-distribution samples, which typically occurs when the distribution of forthcoming paths comprises a blend of various manifolds that may be disconnected. To address this issue, we propose a trajectory prediction framework, which can capture the social interaction variations and model disconnected manifolds of pedestrian trajectories. Our framework is based on a fused spatiotemporal graph to better model the complex interactions of pedestrians in a scene, and a multi-generator architecture that incorporates a flexible generator selector network on generated trajectories to learn a distribution over multiple generators. We show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with several baselines on different challenging datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present Consistent4D, a novel approach for generating 4D dynamic objects from uncalibrated monocular videos. Uniquely, we cast the 360-degree dynamic object reconstruction as a 4D generation problem, eliminating the need for tedious multi-view data collection and camera calibration. This is achieved by leveraging the object-level 3D-aware image diffusion model as the primary supervision signal for training Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (DyNeRF). Specifically, we propose a Cascade DyNeRF to facilitate stable convergence and temporal continuity under the supervision signal which is discrete along the time axis. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, we further introduce an Interpolation-driven Consistency Loss. It is optimized by minimizing the discrepancy between rendered frames from DyNeRF and interpolated frames from a pre-trained video interpolation model. Extensive experiments show that our Consistent4D can perform competitively to prior art alternatives, opening up new possibilities for 4D dynamic object generation from monocular videos, whilst also demonstrating advantage for conventional text-to-3D generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Studying the solar system and especially the Sun relies on the data gathered daily from space missions. These missions are data-intensive and compressing this data to make them efficiently transferable to the ground station is a twofold decision to make. Stronger compression methods, by distorting the data, can increase data throughput at the cost of accuracy which could affect scientific analysis of the data. On the other hand, preserving subtle details in the compressed data requires a high amount of data to be transferred, reducing the desired gains from compression. In this work, we propose a neural network-based lossy compression method to be used in NASA's data-intensive imagery missions. We chose NASA's SDO mission which transmits 1.4 terabytes of data each day as a proof of concept for the proposed algorithm. In this work, we propose an adversarially trained neural network, equipped with local and non-local attention modules to capture both the local and global structure of the image resulting in a better trade-off in rate-distortion (RD) compared to conventional hand-engineered codecs. The RD variational autoencoder used in this work is jointly trained with a channel-dependent entropy model as a shared prior between the analysis and synthesis transforms to make the entropy coding of the latent code more effective. Our neural image compression algorithm outperforms currently-in-use and state-of-the-art codecs such as JPEG and JPEG-2000 in terms of the RD performance when compressing extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) data. As a proof of concept for use of this algorithm in SDO data analysis, we have performed coronal hole (CH) detection using our compressed images, and generated consistent segmentations, even at a compression rate of $\sim0.1$ bits per pixel (compared to 8 bits per pixel on the original data) using EUV data from SDO.

- **Summary**: Falls are a major cause of injuries and deaths among older adults worldwide. Accurate fall detection can help reduce potential injuries and additional health complications. Different types of video modalities can be used in a home setting to detect falls, including RGB, Infrared, and Thermal cameras. Anomaly detection frameworks using autoencoders and their variants can be used for fall detection due to the data imbalance that arises from the rarity and diversity of falls. However, the use of reconstruction error in autoencoders can limit the application of networks' structures that propagate information. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective loss function called Temporal Shift, which aims to predict both future and reconstructed frames within a window of sequential frames. The proposed loss function is evaluated on a semi-naturalistic fall detection dataset containing multiple camera modalities. The autoencoders were trained on normal activities of daily living (ADL) performed by older adults and tested on ADLs and falls performed by young adults. Temporal shift shows significant improvement to a baseline 3D Convolutional autoencoder, an attention U-Net CAE, and a multi-modal neural network. The greatest improvement was observed in an attention U-Net model improving by 0.20 AUC ROC for a single camera when compared to reconstruction alone. With significant improvement across different models, this approach has the potential to be widely adopted and improve anomaly detection capabilities in other settings besides fall detection.

- **Summary**: We propose FocusTune, a focus-guided sampling technique to improve the performance of visual localization algorithms. FocusTune directs a scene coordinate regression model towards regions critical for 3D point triangulation by exploiting key geometric constraints. Specifically, rather than uniformly sampling points across the image for training the scene coordinate regression model, we instead re-project 3D scene coordinates onto the 2D image plane and sample within a local neighborhood of the re-projected points. While our proposed sampling strategy is generally applicable, we showcase FocusTune by integrating it with the recently introduced Accelerated Coordinate Encoding (ACE) model. Our results demonstrate that FocusTune both improves or matches state-of-the-art performance whilst keeping ACE's appealing low storage and compute requirements, for example reducing translation error from 25 to 19 and 17 to 15 cm for single and ensemble models, respectively, on the Cambridge Landmarks dataset. This combination of high performance and low compute and storage requirements is particularly promising for applications in areas like mobile robotics and augmented reality. We made our code available at \url{https://github.com/sontung/focus-tune}.

- **Summary**: This work presents OVIR-3D, a straightforward yet effective method for open-vocabulary 3D object instance retrieval without using any 3D data for training. Given a language query, the proposed method is able to return a ranked set of 3D object instance segments based on the feature similarity of the instance and the text query. This is achieved by a multi-view fusion of text-aligned 2D region proposals into 3D space, where the 2D region proposal network could leverage 2D datasets, which are more accessible and typically larger than 3D datasets. The proposed fusion process is efficient as it can be performed in real-time for most indoor 3D scenes and does not require additional training in 3D space. Experiments on public datasets and a real robot show the effectiveness of the method and its potential for applications in robot navigation and manipulation.

- **Summary**: We present a method for fast biomedical image atlas construction using neural fields. Atlases are key to biomedical image analysis tasks, yet conventional and deep network estimation methods remain time-intensive. In this preliminary work, we frame subject-specific atlas building as learning a neural field of deformable spatiotemporal observations. We apply our method to learning subject-specific atlases and motion stabilization of dynamic BOLD MRI time-series of fetuses in utero. Our method yields high-quality atlases of fetal BOLD time-series with $\sim$5-7$\times$ faster convergence compared to existing work. While our method slightly underperforms well-tuned baselines in terms of anatomical overlap, it estimates templates significantly faster, thus enabling rapid processing and stabilization of large databases of 4D dynamic MRI acquisitions.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of detectors, Bounding Box Regression (BBR) loss function has constantly updated and optimized. However, the existing IoU-based BBR still focus on accelerating convergence by adding new loss terms, ignoring the limitations of IoU loss term itself. Although theoretically IoU loss can effectively describe the state of bounding box regression,in practical applications, it cannot adjust itself according to different detectors and detection tasks, and does not have strong generalization. Based on the above, we first analyzed the BBR model and concluded that distinguishing different regression samples and using different scales of auxiliary bounding boxes to calculate losses can effectively accelerate the bounding box regression process. For high IoU samples, using smaller auxiliary bounding boxes to calculate losses can accelerate convergence, while larger auxiliary bounding boxes are suitable for low IoU samples. Then, we propose Inner-IoU loss, which calculates IoU loss through auxiliary bounding boxes. For different datasets and detectors, we introduce a scaling factor ratio to control the scale size of the auxiliary bounding boxes for calculating losses. Finally, integrate Inner-IoU into the existing IoU-based loss functions for simulation and comparative experiments. The experiment result demonstrate a further enhancement in detection performance with the utilization of the method proposed in this paper, verifying the effectiveness and generalization ability of Inner-IoU loss.

- **Summary**: In this paper we are proposing classification algorithm for multifrequency Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) image. Using PolSAR decomposition algorithms 33 features are extracted from each frequency band of the given image. Then, a two-layer autoencoder is used to reduce the dimensionality of input feature vector while retaining useful features of the input. This reduced dimensional feature vector is then applied to generate superpixels using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm. Next, a robust feature representation is constructed using both pixel as well as superpixel information. Finally, softmax classifier is used to perform classification task. The advantage of using superpixels is that it preserves spatial information between neighbouring PolSAR pixels and therefore minimises the effect of speckle noise during classification. Experiments have been conducted on Flevoland dataset and the proposed method was found to be superior to other methods available in the literature.

- **Summary**: The latest trends in the research field of single-view human reconstruction devote to learning deep implicit functions constrained by explicit body shape priors. Despite the remarkable performance improvements compared with traditional processing pipelines, existing learning approaches still show different aspects of limitations in terms of flexibility, generalizability, robustness, and/or representation capability. To comprehensively address the above issues, in this paper, we investigate an explicit point-based human reconstruction framework called HaP, which adopts point clouds as the intermediate representation of the target geometric structure. Technically, our approach is featured by fully-explicit point cloud estimation, manipulation, generation, and refinement in the 3D geometric space, instead of an implicit learning process that can be ambiguous and less controllable. The overall workflow is carefully organized with dedicated designs of the corresponding specialized learning components as well as processing procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves quantitative performance improvements of 20% to 40% over current state-of-the-art methods, and better qualitative results. Our promising results may indicate a paradigm rollback to the fully-explicit and geometry-centric algorithm design, which enables to exploit various powerful point cloud modeling architectures and processing techniques. We will make our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/yztang4/HaP.

- **Summary**: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial part of human-computer interaction. Existing FER methods achieve high accuracy and generalization based on different open-source deep models and training approaches. However, the performance of these methods is not always good when encountering practical settings, which are seldom explored. In this paper, we collected a new in-the-wild facial expression dataset for cross-domain validation. Twenty-three commonly used network architectures were implemented and evaluated following a uniform protocol. Moreover, various setups, in terms of input resolutions, class balance management, and pre-trained strategies, were verified to show the corresponding performance contribution. Based on extensive experiments on three large-scale FER datasets and our practical cross-validation, we ranked network architectures and summarized a set of recommendations on deploying deep FER methods in real scenarios. In addition, potential ethical rules, privacy issues, and regulations were discussed in practical FER applications such as marketing, education, and entertainment business.

- **Summary**: In computer vision, models must be able to adapt to changes in image resolution to effectively carry out tasks such as image segmentation; This is known as scale-equivariance. Recent works have made progress in developing scale-equivariant convolutional neural networks, e.g., through weight-sharing and kernel resizing. However, these networks are not truly scale-equivariant in practice. Specifically, they do not consider anti-aliasing as they formulate the down-scaling operation in the continuous domain. To address this shortcoming, we directly formulate down-scaling in the discrete domain with consideration of anti-aliasing. We then propose a novel architecture based on Fourier layers to achieve truly scale-equivariant deep nets, i.e., absolute zero equivariance-error. Following prior works, we test this model on MNIST-scale and STL-10 datasets. Our proposed model achieves competitive classification performance while maintaining zero equivariance-error.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligent Internet of Things (AIoT), the image data from AIoT devices has been witnessing the explosive increasing. In this paper, a novel deep image semantic communication model is proposed for the efficient image communication in AIoT. Particularly, at the transmitter side, a high-precision image semantic segmentation algorithm is proposed to extract the semantic information of the image to achieve significant compression of the image data. At the receiver side, a semantic image restoration algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed to convert the semantic image to a real scene image with detailed information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed image semantic communication model can improve the image compression ratio and recovery accuracy by 71.93% and 25.07% on average in comparison with WebP and CycleGAN, respectively. More importantly, our demo experiment shows that the proposed model reduces the total delay by 95.26% in the image communication, when comparing with the original image transmission.

- **Summary**: Auroral classification plays a crucial role in polar research. However, current auroral classification studies are predominantly based on images taken at a single wavelength, typically 557.7 nm. Images obtained at other wavelengths have been comparatively overlooked, and the integration of information from multiple wavelengths remains an underexplored area. This limitation results in low classification rates for complex auroral patterns. Furthermore, these studies, whether employing traditional machine learning or deep learning approaches, have not achieved a satisfactory trade-off between accuracy and speed. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight auroral multi-wavelength fusion classification network, MLCNet, based on a multi-view approach. Firstly, we develop a lightweight feature extraction backbone, called LCTNet, to improve the classification rate and cope with the increasing amount of auroral observation data. Secondly, considering the existence of multi-scale spatial structures in auroras, we design a novel multi-scale reconstructed feature module named MSRM. Finally, to highlight the discriminative information between auroral classes, we propose a lightweight attention feature enhancement module called LAFE. The proposed method is validated using observational data from the Arctic Yellow River Station during 2003-2004. Experimental results demonstrate that the fusion of multi-wavelength information effectively improves the auroral classification performance. In particular, our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy compared to previous auroral classification studies, and superior results in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing multi-view methods.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, deep learning has proven to be a highly effective tool for learning meaningful features from raw data. However, it remains an open question how deep networks perform hierarchical feature learning across layers. In this work, we attempt to unveil this mystery by investigating the structures of intermediate features. Motivated by our empirical findings that linear layers mimic the roles of deep layers in nonlinear networks for feature learning, we explore how deep linear networks transform input data into output by investigating the output (i.e., features) of each layer after training in the context of multi-class classification problems. Toward this goal, we first define metrics to measure within-class compression and between-class discrimination of intermediate features, respectively. Through theoretical analysis of these two metrics, we show that the evolution of features follows a simple and quantitative pattern from shallow to deep layers when the input data is nearly orthogonal and the network weights are minimum-norm, balanced, and approximate low-rank: Each layer of the linear network progressively compresses within-class features at a geometric rate and discriminates between-class features at a linear rate with respect to the number of layers that data have passed through. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative characterization of feature evolution in hierarchical representations of deep linear networks. Empirically, our extensive experiments not only validate our theoretical results numerically but also reveal a similar pattern in deep nonlinear networks which aligns well with recent empirical studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical implications of our results in transfer learning. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/Heimine/PNC_DLN}.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL) has successfully automated dose distribution prediction in radiotherapy planning, enhancing both efficiency and quality. However, existing methods suffer from the over-smoothing problem for their commonly used L1 or L2 loss with posterior average calculations. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a diffusion model-based method (DiffDose) for predicting the radiotherapy dose distribution of cancer patients. Specifically, the DiffDose model contains a forward process and a reverse process. In the forward process, DiffDose transforms dose distribution maps into pure Gaussian noise by gradually adding small noise and a noise predictor is simultaneously trained to estimate the noise added at each timestep. In the reverse process, it removes the noise from the pure Gaussian noise in multiple steps with the well-trained noise predictor and finally outputs the predicted dose distribution maps...

- **Summary**: Clinical neuroimaging data is naturally hierarchical. Different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences within a series, different slices covering the head, and different regions within each slice all confer different information. In this work we present a hierarchical attention network for abnormality detection using MRI scans obtained in a clinical hospital setting. The proposed network is suitable for non-volumetric data (i.e. stacks of high-resolution MRI slices), and can be trained from binary examination-level labels. We show that this hierarchical approach leads to improved classification, while providing interpretability through either coarse inter- and intra-slice abnormality localisation, or giving importance scores for different slices and sequences, making our model suitable for use as an automated triaging system in radiology departments.

- **Summary**: Two difficulties here make low-light image enhancement a challenging task; firstly, it needs to consider not only luminance restoration but also image contrast, image denoising and color distortion issues simultaneously. Second, the effectiveness of existing low-light enhancement methods depends on paired or unpaired training data with poor generalization performance.   To solve these difficult problems, we propose in this paper a new learning-based Retinex decomposition of zero-shot low-light enhancement method, called ZERRINNet. To this end, we first designed the N-Net network, together with the noise loss term, to be used for denoising the original low-light image by estimating the noise of the low-light image. Moreover, RI-Net is used to estimate the reflection component and illumination component, and in order to solve the color distortion and contrast, we use the texture loss term and segmented smoothing loss to constrain the reflection component and illumination component. Finally, our method is a zero-reference enhancement method that is not affected by the training data of paired and unpaired datasets, so our generalization performance is greatly improved, and in the paper, we have effectively validated it with a homemade real-life low-light dataset and additionally with advanced vision tasks, such as face detection, target recognition, and instance segmentation. We conducted comparative experiments on a large number of public datasets and the results show that the performance of our method is competitive compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The paper investigates the utility of text-to-image inpainting models for satellite image data. Two technical challenges of injecting structural guiding signals into the generative process as well as translating the inpainted RGB pixels to a wider set of MSI bands are addressed by introducing a novel inpainting framework based on StableDiffusion and ControlNet as well as a novel method for RGB-to-MSI translation. The results on a wider set of data suggest that the inpainting synthesized via StableDiffusion suffers from undesired artefacts and that a simple alternative of self-supervised internal inpainting achieves higher quality of synthesis.

- **Summary**: LiDAR semantic segmentation for autonomous driving has been a growing field of interest in the past few years. Datasets and methods have appeared and expanded very quickly, but methods have not been updated to exploit this new availability of data and continue to rely on the same classical datasets.   Different ways of performing LIDAR semantic segmentation training and inference can be divided into several subfields, which include the following: domain generalization, the ability to segment data coming from unseen domains ; source-to-source segmentation, the ability to segment data coming from the training domain; and pre-training, the ability to create re-usable geometric primitives.   In this work, we aim to improve results in all of these subfields with the novel approach of multi-source training. Multi-source training relies on the availability of various datasets at training time and uses them together rather than relying on only one dataset.   To overcome the common obstacles found for multi-source training, we introduce the coarse labels and call the newly created multi-source dataset COLA. We propose three applications of this new dataset that display systematic improvement over single-source strategies: COLA-DG for domain generalization (up to +10%), COLA-S2S for source-to-source segmentation (up to +5.3%), and COLA-PT for pre-training (up to +12%).

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision, yet their deployments on resource-constrained devices remain challenging due to high computational demands. To expedite pre-trained ViTs, token pruning and token merging approaches have been developed, which aim at reducing the number of tokens involved in the computation. However, these methods still have some limitations, such as image information loss from pruned tokens and inefficiency in the token-matching process. In this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-based Token Propagation (GTP) method to resolve the challenge of balancing model efficiency and information preservation for efficient ViTs. Inspired by graph summarization algorithms, GTP meticulously propagates less significant tokens' information to spatially and semantically connected tokens that are of greater importance. Consequently, the remaining few tokens serve as a summarization of the entire token graph, allowing the method to reduce computational complexity while preserving essential information of eliminated tokens. Combined with an innovative token selection strategy, GTP can efficiently identify image tokens to be propagated. Extensive experiments have validated GTP's effectiveness, demonstrating both efficiency and performance improvements. Specifically, GTP decreases the computational complexity of both DeiT-S and DeiT-B by up to 26% with only a minimal 0.3% accuracy drop on ImageNet-1K without finetuning, and remarkably surpasses the state-of-the-art token merging method on various backbones at an even faster inference speed.

- **Summary**: For classifying digital whole slide images in the absence of pixel level annotation, typically multiple instance learning methods are applied. Due to the generic applicability, such methods are currently of very high interest in the research community, however, the issue of data augmentation in this context is rarely explored. Here we investigate linear and multilinear interpolation between feature vectors, a data augmentation technique, which proved to be capable of improving the generalization performance classification networks and also for multiple instance learning. Experiments, however, have been performed on only two rather small data sets and one specific feature extraction approach so far and a strong dependence on the data set has been identified. Here we conduct a large study incorporating 10 different data set configurations, two different feature extraction approaches (supervised and self-supervised), stain normalization and two multiple instance learning architectures. The results showed an extraordinarily high variability in the effect of the method. We identified several interesting aspects to bring light into the darkness and identified novel promising fields of research.

- **Summary**: The presence of undesired background areas associated with potential noise and unknown spectral characteristics degrades the performance of hyperspectral data processing. Masking out unwanted regions is key to addressing this issue. Processing only regions of interest yields notable improvements in terms of computational costs, required memory, and overall performance. The proposed processing pipeline encompasses two fundamental parts: regions of interest mask generation, followed by the application of hyperspectral data processing techniques solely on the newly masked hyperspectral cube. The novelty of our work lies in the methodology adopted for the preliminary image segmentation. We employ the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to extract all objects within the dataset, and subsequently refine the segments with a zero-shot Grounding Dino object detector, followed by intersection and exclusion filtering steps, without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. To illustrate the efficacy of the masking procedure, the proposed method is deployed on three challenging applications scenarios that demand accurate masking; shredded plastics characterization, drill core scanning, and litter monitoring. The numerical evaluation of the proposed masking method on the three applications is provided along with the used hyperparameters. The scripts for the method will be available at https://github.com/hifexplo/Masking.

- **Summary**: Diffusion model based Text-to-Image has achieved impressive achievements recently. Although current technology for synthesizing images is highly advanced and capable of generating images with high fidelity, it is still possible to give the show away when focusing on the text area in the generated image. To address this issue, we introduce AnyText, a diffusion-based multilingual visual text generation and editing model, that focuses on rendering accurate and coherent text in the image. AnyText comprises a diffusion pipeline with two primary elements: an auxiliary latent module and a text embedding module. The former uses inputs like text glyph, position, and masked image to generate latent features for text generation or editing. The latter employs an OCR model for encoding stroke data as embeddings, which blend with image caption embeddings from the tokenizer to generate texts that seamlessly integrate with the background. We employed text-control diffusion loss and text perceptual loss for training to further enhance writing accuracy. AnyText can write characters in multiple languages, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address multilingual visual text generation. It is worth mentioning that AnyText can be plugged into existing diffusion models from the community for rendering or editing text accurately. After conducting extensive evaluation experiments, our method has outperformed all other approaches by a significant margin. Additionally, we contribute the first large-scale multilingual text images dataset, AnyWord-3M, containing 3 million image-text pairs with OCR annotations in multiple languages. Based on AnyWord-3M dataset, we propose AnyText-benchmark for the evaluation of visual text generation accuracy and quality. Our project will be open-sourced on https://github.com/tyxsspa/AnyText to improve and promote the development of text generation technology.

- **Summary**: Accurate quantification of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is critical for understanding carbon accounting in the context of climate change. In this study, we presented a novel attention-based deep learning approach for forest AGB estimation, primarily utilizing openly accessible EO data, including: GEDI LiDAR data, C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, and Sentinel-2 multispectral data. The attention UNet (AU) model achieved markedly higher accuracy for biomass estimation compared to the conventional RF algorithm. Specifically, the AU model attained an R2 of 0.66, RMSE of 43.66 Mg ha-1, and bias of 0.14 Mg ha-1, while RF resulted in lower scores of R2 0.62, RMSE 45.87 Mg ha-1, and bias 1.09 Mg ha-1. However, the superiority of the deep learning approach was not uniformly observed across all tested models. ResNet101 only achieved an R2 of 0.50, an RMSE of 52.93 Mg ha-1, and a bias of 0.99 Mg ha-1, while the UNet reported an R2 of 0.65, an RMSE of 44.28 Mg ha-1, and a substantial bias of 1.84 Mg ha-1. Moreover, to explore the performance of AU in the absence of spatial information, fully connected (FC) layers were employed to eliminate spatial information from the remote sensing data. AU-FC achieved intermediate R2 of 0.64, RMSE of 44.92 Mgha-1, and bias of -0.56 Mg ha-1, outperforming RF but underperforming AU model using spatial information. We also generated 10m forest AGB maps across Guangdong for the year 2019 using AU and compared it with that produced by RF. The AGB distributions from both models showed strong agreement with similar mean values; the mean forest AGB estimated by AU was 102.18 Mg ha-1 while that of RF was 104.84 Mg ha-1. Additionally, it was observed that the AGB map generated by AU provided superior spatial information. Overall, this research substantiates the feasibility of employing deep learning for biomass estimation based on satellite data.

- **Summary**: Designing an effective channel attention mechanism implores one to find a lossy-compression method allowing for optimal feature representation. Despite recent progress in the area, it remains an open problem. FcaNet, the current state-of-the-art channel attention mechanism, attempted to find such an information-rich compression using Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCTs). One drawback of FcaNet is that there is no natural choice of the DCT frequencies. To circumvent this issue, FcaNet experimented on ImageNet to find optimal frequencies. We hypothesize that the choice of frequency plays only a supporting role and the primary driving force for the effectiveness of their attention filters is the orthogonality of the DCT kernels. To test this hypothesis, we construct an attention mechanism using randomly initialized orthogonal filters. Integrating this mechanism into ResNet, we create OrthoNet. We compare OrthoNet to FcaNet (and other attention mechanisms) on Birds, MS-COCO, and Places356 and show superior performance. On the ImageNet dataset, our method competes with or surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Our results imply that an optimal choice of filter is elusive and generalization can be achieved with a sufficiently large number of orthogonal filters. We further investigate other general principles for implementing channel attention, such as its position in the network and channel groupings. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hady1011/OrthoNets/

- **Summary**: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors is critical for medical diagnosis. However, current supervised learning methods require extensively annotated images and the state-of-the-art generative models used in unsupervised methods often have limitations in covering the whole data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Two-Stage Generative Model (TSGM) that combines Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) and Variance Exploding stochastic differential equation using joint probability (VE-JP) to improve brain tumor detection and segmentation. The CycleGAN is trained on unpaired data to generate abnormal images from healthy images as data prior. Then VE-JP is implemented to reconstruct healthy images using synthetic paired abnormal images as a guide, which alters only pathological regions but not regions of healthy. Notably, our method directly learned the joint probability distribution for conditional generation. The residual between input and reconstructed images suggests the abnormalities and a thresholding method is subsequently applied to obtain segmentation results. Furthermore, the multimodal results are weighted with different weights to improve the segmentation accuracy further. We validated our method on three datasets, and compared with other unsupervised methods for anomaly detection and segmentation. The DSC score of 0.8590 in BraTs2020 dataset, 0.6226 in ITCS dataset and 0.7403 in In-house dataset show that our method achieves better segmentation performance and has better generalization.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing and artificial intelligence are pivotal technologies of precision agriculture nowadays. The efficient retrieval of large-scale field imagery combined with machine learning techniques shows success in various tasks like phenotyping, weeding, cropping, and disease control. This work will introduce a machine learning framework for automatized large-scale plant-specific trait annotation for the use case disease severity scoring for Cercospora Leaf Spot (CLS) in sugar beet. With concepts of Deep Label Distribution Learning (DLDL), special loss functions, and a tailored model architecture, we develop an efficient Vision Transformer based model for disease severity scoring called SugarViT. One novelty in this work is the combination of remote sensing data with environmental parameters of the experimental sites for disease severity prediction. Although the model is evaluated on this special use case, it is held as generic as possible to also be applicable to various image-based classification and regression tasks. With our framework, it is even possible to learn models on multi-objective problems as we show by a pretraining on environmental metadata.

Different from the popular shallow alignment method which maps image features into the input space of language model, CogVLM bridges the gap between the frozen pretrained language model and image encoder by a trainable visual expert module in the attention and FFN layers. As a result, CogVLM enables deep fusion of vision language features without sacrificing any performance on NLP tasks. CogVLM-17B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 classic cross-modal benchmarks, including NoCaps, Flicker30k captioning, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, Visual7W, GQA, ScienceQA, VizWiz VQA and TDIUC, and ranks the 2nd on VQAv2, OKVQA, TextVQA, COCO captioning, etc., surpassing or matching PaLI-X 55B.

- **Summary**: A face model is a mathematical representation of the distinct features of a human face. Traditionally, face models were built using a set of fiducial points or landmarks, each point ideally located on a facial feature, i.e., corner of the eye, tip of the nose, etc. Face alignment is the process of fitting the landmarks in a face model to the respective ground truth positions in an input image containing a face. Despite significant research on face alignment in the past decades, no review analyses various face models used in the literature. Catering to three types of readers - beginners, practitioners and researchers in face alignment, we provide a comprehensive analysis of different face models used for face alignment. We include the interpretation and training of the face models along with the examples of fitting the face model to a new face image. We found that 3D-based face models are preferred in cases of extreme face pose, whereas deep learning-based methods often use heatmaps. Moreover, we discuss the possible future directions of face models in the field of face alignment.

- **Summary**: The semantic segmentation of pelvic organs via MRI has important clinical significance. Recently, deep learning-enabled semantic segmentation has facilitated the three-dimensional geometric reconstruction of pelvic floor organs, providing clinicians with accurate and intuitive diagnostic results. However, the task of labeling pelvic floor MRI segmentation, typically performed by clinicians, is labor-intensive and costly, leading to a scarcity of labels. Insufficient segmentation labels limit the precise segmentation and reconstruction of pelvic floor organs. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised framework for pelvic organ segmentation. The implementation of this framework comprises two stages. In the first stage, it performs self-supervised pre-training using image restoration tasks. Subsequently, fine-tuning of the self-supervised model is performed, using labeled data to train the segmentation model. In the second stage, the self-supervised segmentation model is used to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Ultimately, both labeled and unlabeled data are utilized in semi-supervised training. Upon evaluation, our method significantly enhances the performance in the semantic segmentation and geometric reconstruction of pelvic organs, Dice coefficient can increase by 2.65% averagely. Especially for organs that are difficult to segment, such as the uterus, the accuracy of semantic segmentation can be improved by up to 3.70%.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised pre-training has shown great success in skeleton-based action understanding recently. Existing works typically train separate modality-specific models, then integrate the multi-modal information for action understanding by a late-fusion strategy. Although these approaches have achieved significant performance, they suffer from the complex yet redundant multi-stream model designs, each of which is also limited to the fixed input skeleton modality. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we propose a Unified Multimodal Unsupervised Representation Learning framework, called UmURL, which exploits an efficient early-fusion strategy to jointly encode the multi-modal features in a single-stream manner. Specifically, instead of designing separate modality-specific optimization processes for uni-modal unsupervised learning, we feed different modality inputs into the same stream with an early-fusion strategy to learn their multi-modal features for reducing model complexity. To ensure that the fused multi-modal features do not exhibit modality bias, i.e., being dominated by a certain modality input, we further propose both intra- and inter-modal consistency learning to guarantee that the multi-modal features contain the complete semantics of each modal via feature decomposition and distinct alignment. In this manner, our framework is able to learn the unified representations of uni-modal or multi-modal skeleton input, which is flexible to different kinds of modality input for robust action understanding in practical cases. Extensive experiments conducted on three large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD II, demonstrate that UmURL is highly efficient, possessing the approximate complexity with the uni-modal methods, while achieving new state-of-the-art performance across various downstream task scenarios in skeleton-based action representation learning.

- **Summary**: Due to the steadily rising amount of valuable goods in supply chains, tampering detection for parcels is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we focus on the use-case last-mile delivery, where only a single RGB image is taken and compared against a reference from an existing database to detect potential appearance changes that indicate tampering. We propose a tampering detection pipeline that utilizes keypoint detection to identify the eight corner points of a parcel. This permits applying a perspective transformation to create normalized fronto-parallel views for each visible parcel side surface. These viewpoint-invariant parcel side surface representations facilitate the identification of signs of tampering on parcels within the supply chain, since they reduce the problem to parcel side surface matching with pair-wise appearance change detection. Experiments with multiple classical and deep learning-based change detection approaches are performed on our newly collected TAMpering detection dataset for PARcels, called TAMPAR. We evaluate keypoint and change detection separately, as well as in a unified system for tampering detection. Our evaluation shows promising results for keypoint (Keypoint AP 75.76) and tampering detection (81% accuracy, F1-Score 0.83) on real images. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for tampering types, lens distortion and viewing angles is presented. Code and dataset are available at https://a-nau.github.io/tampar.

- **Summary**: Creating high-quality controllable 3D human models from multi-view RGB videos poses a significant challenge. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable quality in reconstructing and free-viewpoint rendering of static as well as dynamic scenes. The extension to a controllable synthesis of dynamic human performances poses an exciting research question. In this paper, we introduce a novel NeRF-based framework for pose-dependent rendering of human performances. In our approach, the radiance field is warped around an SMPL body mesh, thereby creating a new surface-aligned representation. Our representation can be animated through skeletal joint parameters that are provided to the NeRF in addition to the viewpoint for pose dependent appearances. To achieve this, our representation includes the corresponding 2D UV coordinates on the mesh texture map and the distance between the query point and the mesh. To enable efficient learning despite mapping ambiguities and random visual variations, we introduce a novel remapping process that refines the mapped coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that our approach results in high-quality renderings for novel-view and novel-pose synthesis.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised foundation models have shown great potential in computer vision thanks to the pre-training paradigm of masked autoencoding. Scale is a primary factor influencing the performance of these foundation models. However, these large foundation models often result in high computational cost that might limit their deployment. This paper focuses on pre-training relatively small vision transformer models that could be efficiently adapted to downstream tasks. Specifically, taking inspiration from knowledge distillation in model compression, we propose a new asymmetric masked distillation(AMD) framework for pre-training relatively small models with autoencoding. The core of AMD is to devise an asymmetric masking strategy, where the teacher model is enabled to see more context information with a lower masking ratio, while the student model still with high masking ratio to the original masked pre-training. We design customized multi-layer feature alignment between the teacher encoder and student encoder to regularize the pre-training of student MAE. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of AMD, we apply it to both ImageMAE and VideoMAE for pre-training relatively small ViT models. AMD achieved 84.6% classification accuracy on IN1K using the ViT-B model. And AMD achieves 73.3% classification accuracy using the ViT-B model on the Something-in-Something V2 dataset, a 3.7% improvement over the original ViT-B model from VideoMAE. We also transfer AMD pre-trained models to downstream tasks and obtain consistent performance improvement over the standard pre-training.

- **Summary**: Medical Image-to-image translation is a key task in computer vision and generative artificial intelligence, and it is highly applicable to medical image analysis. GAN-based methods are the mainstream image translation methods, but they often ignore the variation and distribution of images in the frequency domain, or only take simple measures to align high-frequency information, which can lead to distortion and low quality of the generated images. To solve these problems, we propose a novel method called frequency domain decomposition translation (FDDT). This method decomposes the original image into a high-frequency component and a low-frequency component, with the high-frequency component containing the details and identity information, and the low-frequency component containing the style information. Next, the high-frequency and low-frequency components of the transformed image are aligned with the transformed results of the high-frequency and low-frequency components of the original image in the same frequency band in the spatial domain, thus preserving the identity information of the image while destroying as little stylistic information of the image as possible. We conduct extensive experiments on MRI images and natural images with FDDT and several mainstream baseline models, and we use four evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the generated images. Compared with the baseline models, optimally, FDDT can reduce Fr\'echet inception distance by up to 24.4%, structural similarity by up to 4.4%, peak signal-to-noise ratio by up to 5.8%, and mean squared error by up to 31%. Compared with the previous method, optimally, FDDT can reduce Fr\'echet inception distance by up to 23.7%, structural similarity by up to 1.8%, peak signal-to-noise ratio by up to 6.8%, and mean squared error by up to 31.6%.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an efficient deep neural network model for diagnosing Parkinson's disease from gait. More specifically, we introduce a hybrid ConvNet-Transformer architecture to accurately diagnose the disease by detecting the severity stage. The proposed architecture exploits the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers in a single end-to-end model, where the former is able to extract relevant local features from Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) signal, while the latter allows to capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies in data. In this manner, our hybrid architecture achieves an improved performance compared to using either models individually. Our experimental results show that our approach is effective for detecting the different stages of Parkinson's disease from gait data, with a final accuracy of 88%, outperforming other state-of-the-art AI methods on the Physionet gait dataset. Moreover, our method can be generalized and adapted for other classification problems to jointly address the feature relevance and spatio-temporal dependency problems in 1D signals.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) that tackle the time series classification (TSC) task have provided a promising framework in signal processing. In real-world applications, as a data-driven model, DNNs are suffered from insufficient data. Few-shot learning has been studied to deal with this limitation. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework through data augmentation, which involves transformation through the time-frequency domain and the generation of synthetic images through random erasing. Additionally, we develop a sequence-spectrogram neural network (SSNN). This neural network model composes of two sub-networks: one utilizing 1D residual blocks to extract features from the input sequence while the other one employing 2D residual blocks to extract features from the spectrogram representation. In the experiments, comparison studies of different existing DNN models with/without data augmentation are conducted on an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) dataset and a wind turbine fault (WTF) dataset. The experimental results manifest that our proposed method achieves 93.75% F1 score and 93.33% accuracy on the ALS datasets while 95.48% F1 score and 95.59% accuracy on the WTF datasets. Our methodology demonstrates its applicability of addressing the few-shot problems for time series classification.

- **Summary**: Place recognition is one of the most crucial modules for autonomous vehicles to identify places that were previously visited in GPS-invalid environments. Sensor fusion is considered an effective method to overcome the weaknesses of individual sensors. In recent years, multimodal place recognition fusing information from multiple sensors has gathered increasing attention. However, most existing multimodal place recognition methods only use limited field-of-view camera images, which leads to an imbalance between features from different modalities and limits the effectiveness of sensor fusion. In this paper, we present a novel neural network named LCPR for robust multimodal place recognition, which fuses LiDAR point clouds with multi-view RGB images to generate discriminative and yaw-rotation invariant representations of the environment. A multi-scale attention-based fusion module is proposed to fully exploit the panoramic views from different modalities of the environment and their correlations. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset, and the experimental results show that our method can effectively utilize multi-view camera and LiDAR data to improve the place recognition performance while maintaining strong robustness to viewpoint changes.

- **Summary**: In this letter, we aim to investigate whether laboratory rats' pain can be automatically assessed through their facial expressions. To this end, we began by presenting a publicly available dataset called RatsPain, consisting of 1,138 facial images captured from six rats that underwent an orthodontic treatment operation. Each rat' facial images in RatsPain were carefully selected from videos recorded either before or after the operation and well labeled by eight annotators according to the Rat Grimace Scale (RGS). We then proposed a novel deep learning method called PainSeeker for automatically assessing pain in rats via facial expressions. PainSeeker aims to seek pain-related facial local regions that facilitate learning both pain discriminative and head pose robust features from facial expression images. To evaluate the PainSeeker, we conducted extensive experiments on the RatsPain dataset. The results demonstrate the feasibility of assessing rats' pain from their facial expressions and also verify the effectiveness of the proposed PainSeeker in addressing this emerging but intriguing problem. The RasPain dataset can be freely obtained from https://github.com/xhzongyuan/RatsPain.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer screening, primarily conducted through mammography, is often supplemented with ultrasound for women with dense breast tissue. However, existing deep learning models analyze each modality independently, missing opportunities to integrate information across imaging modalities and time. In this study, we present Multi-modal Transformer (MMT), a neural network that utilizes mammography and ultrasound synergistically, to identify patients who currently have cancer and estimate the risk of future cancer for patients who are currently cancer-free. MMT aggregates multi-modal data through self-attention and tracks temporal tissue changes by comparing current exams to prior imaging. Trained on 1.3 million exams, MMT achieves an AUROC of 0.943 in detecting existing cancers, surpassing strong uni-modal baselines. For 5-year risk prediction, MMT attains an AUROC of 0.826, outperforming prior mammography-based risk models. Our research highlights the value of multi-modal and longitudinal imaging in cancer diagnosis and risk stratification.

- **Summary**: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into shared airspace for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations presents significant challenges but holds transformative potential for sectors like transportation, construction, energy and defense. A critical prerequisite for this integration is equipping UAVs with enhanced situational awareness to ensure safe operations. Current approaches mainly target single object detection or classification, or simpler sensing outputs that offer limited perceptual understanding and lack the rapid end-to-end processing needed to convert sensor data into safety-critical insights. In contrast, our study leverages radar technology for novel end-to-end semantic segmentation of aerial point clouds to simultaneously identify multiple collision hazards. By adapting and optimizing the PointNet architecture and integrating aerial domain insights, our framework distinguishes five distinct classes: mobile drones (DJI M300 and DJI Mini) and airplanes (Ikarus C42), and static returns (ground and infrastructure) which results in enhanced situational awareness for UAVs. To our knowledge, this is the first approach addressing simultaneous identification of multiple collision threats in an aerial setting, achieving a robust 94% accuracy. This work highlights the potential of radar technology to advance situational awareness in UAVs, facilitating safe and efficient BVLOS operations.

- **Summary**: Latent diffusion models have proven to be state-of-the-art in the creation and manipulation of visual outputs. However, as far as we know, the generation of depth maps jointly with RGB is still limited. We introduce LDM3D-VR, a suite of diffusion models targeting virtual reality development that includes LDM3D-pano and LDM3D-SR. These models enable the generation of panoramic RGBD based on textual prompts and the upscaling of low-resolution inputs to high-resolution RGBD, respectively. Our models are fine-tuned from existing pretrained models on datasets containing panoramic/high-resolution RGB images, depth maps and captions. Both models are evaluated in comparison to existing related methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the state-of-the-art in deep learning has been dominated by very large models that have been pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The paradigm is very simple: Investing more computational resources (optimally) leads to better performance, and even predictably so; neural scaling laws have been derived that accurately forecast the performance of a network for a desired level of compute. This leads to the notion of a "compute-optimal" model, i.e. a model that allocates a given level of compute during training optimally to maximise performance. In this work, we extend the concept of optimality by allowing for an "adaptive" model, i.e. a model that can change its shape during the course of training. By allowing the shape to adapt, we can optimally traverse between the underlying scaling laws, leading to a significant reduction in the required compute to reach a given target performance. We focus on vision tasks and the family of Vision Transformers, where the patch size as well as the width naturally serve as adaptive shape parameters. We demonstrate that, guided by scaling laws, we can design compute-optimal adaptive models that beat their "static" counterparts.

Moreover, this paper also reviews models like Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), Residual Neural Network (ResNet)-50V2, YOLOv5, YOLOv7, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep CNN, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), MobileNetv2, and Lesion-Aware Visual Transformer. These machine-learning models have been tested on various datasets, demonstrating their real-world applicability. This review study not only highlights current progress in the field but also provides valuable insights for future research directions in the machine learning-based detection and classification of tea leaf diseases.

- **Summary**: While GPT-4V(ision) impressively models both visual and textual information simultaneously, it's hallucination behavior has not been systematically assessed. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, namely, the Bias and Interference Challenges in Visual Language Models (Bingo). This benchmark is designed to evaluate and shed light on the two common types of hallucinations in visual language models: bias and interference. Here, bias refers to the model's tendency to hallucinate certain types of responses, possibly due to imbalance in its training data. Interference pertains to scenarios where the judgment of GPT-4V(ision) can be disrupted due to how the text prompt is phrased or how the input image is presented. We identify a notable regional bias, whereby GPT-4V(ision) is better at interpreting Western images or images with English writing compared to images from other countries or containing text in other languages. Moreover, GPT-4V(ision) is vulnerable to leading questions and is often confused when interpreting multiple images together. Popular mitigation approaches, such as self-correction and chain-of-thought reasoning, are not effective in resolving these challenges. We also identified similar biases and interference vulnerabilities with LLaVA and Bard. Our results characterize the hallucination challenges in GPT-4V(ision) and state-of-the-art visual-language models, and highlight the need for new solutions. The Bingo benchmark is available at https://github.com/gzcch/Bingo.

- **Summary**: The dominant paradigm in 3D human pose estimation that lifts a 2D pose sequence to 3D heavily relies on long-term temporal clues (i.e., using a daunting number of video frames) for improved accuracy, which incurs performance saturation, intractable computation and the non-causal problem. This can be attributed to their inherent inability to perceive spatial context as plain 2D joint coordinates carry no visual cues. To address this issue, we propose a straightforward yet powerful solution: leveraging the readily available intermediate visual representations produced by off-the-shelf (pre-trained) 2D pose detectors -- no finetuning on the 3D task is even needed. The key observation is that, while the pose detector learns to localize 2D joints, such representations (e.g., feature maps) implicitly encode the joint-centric spatial context thanks to the regional operations in backbone networks. We design a simple baseline named Context-Aware PoseFormer to showcase its effectiveness. Without access to any temporal information, the proposed method significantly outperforms its context-agnostic counterpart, PoseFormer, and other state-of-the-art methods using up to hundreds of video frames regarding both speed and precision.

- **Summary**: While model architectures and training strategies have become more generic and flexible with respect to different data modalities over the past years, a persistent limitation lies in the assumption of fixed quantities and arrangements of input features. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in scenarios where the attributes captured during data acquisition vary across different samples. In this work, we aim at effectively leveraging data with varying features, without the need to constrain the input space to the intersection of potential feature sets or to expand it to their union. We propose a novel architecture that can directly process data without the necessity of aligned feature modalities by learning a general embedding space that captures the relationship between features across data samples with varying sets of features. This is achieved via a set-transformer architecture augmented by feature-encoder layers, thereby enabling the learning of a shared latent feature space from data originating from heterogeneous feature spaces. The advantages of the model are demonstrated for automatic cancer cell detection in acute myeloid leukemia in flow cytometry data, where the features measured during acquisition often vary between samples. Our proposed architecture's capacity to operate seamlessly across incongruent feature spaces is particularly relevant in this context, where data scarcity arises from the low prevalence of the disease.

- **Summary**: People counting system in crowded places has become a very useful practical application that can be accomplished in various ways which include many traditional methods using sensors. Examining the case of real time scenarios, the algorithm espoused should be steadfast and accurate. People counting algorithm presented in this paper, is centered on blob assessment, devoted to yield the count of the people through a path along with the direction of traversal. The system depicted is often ensconced at the entrance of a building so that the unmitigated frequency of visitors can be recorded. The core premise of this work is to extricate count of people inflow and outflow pertaining to a particular area. The tot-up achieved can be exploited for purpose of statistics in the circumstances of any calamity occurrence in that zone. Relying upon the count totaled, the population in that vicinity can be assimilated in order to take on relevant measures to rescue the people.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in text-to-image generative models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture a deep semantic understanding of images. In this work, we leverage this semantic knowledge to transfer the visual appearance between objects that share similar semantics but may differ significantly in shape. To achieve this, we build upon the self-attention layers of these generative models and introduce a cross-image attention mechanism that implicitly establishes semantic correspondences across images. Specifically, given a pair of images -- one depicting the target structure and the other specifying the desired appearance -- our cross-image attention combines the queries corresponding to the structure image with the keys and values of the appearance image. This operation, when applied during the denoising process, leverages the established semantic correspondences to generate an image combining the desired structure and appearance. In addition, to improve the output image quality, we harness three mechanisms that either manipulate the noisy latent codes or the model's internal representations throughout the denoising process. Importantly, our approach is zero-shot, requiring no optimization or training. Experiments show that our method is effective across a wide range of object categories and is robust to variations in shape, size, and viewpoint between the two input images.

- **Summary**: Over the last decade there has been an increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires across the globe, posing significant threats to human and animal lives, ecosystems, and socio-economic stability. Therefore urgent action is required to mitigate their devastating impact and safeguard Earth's natural resources. Robust Machine Learning methods combined with the abundance of high-resolution satellite imagery can provide accurate and timely mappings of the affected area in order to assess the scale of the event, identify the impacted assets and prioritize and allocate resources effectively for the proper restoration of the damaged region. In this work, we create and introduce a machine-learning ready dataset we name FLOGA (Forest wiLdfire Observations for the Greek Area). This dataset is unique as it comprises of satellite imagery acquired before and after a wildfire event, it contains information from Sentinel-2 and MODIS modalities with variable spatial and spectral resolution, and contains a large number of events where the corresponding burnt area ground truth has been annotated by domain experts. FLOGA covers the wider region of Greece, which is characterized by a Mediterranean landscape and climatic conditions. We use FLOGA to provide a thorough comparison of multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms for the automatic extraction of burnt areas, approached as a change detection task. We also compare the results to those obtained using standard specialized spectral indices for burnt area mapping. Finally, we propose a novel Deep Learning model, namely BAM-CD. Our benchmark results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique in the automatic extraction of burnt areas, outperforming all other methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

- **Summary**: Modern learning-based visual feature extraction networks perform well in intra-domain localization, however, their performance significantly declines when image pairs are captured across long-term visual domain variations, such as different seasonal and daytime variations. In this paper, our first contribution is a benchmark to investigate the performance impact of long-term variations on visual localization. We conduct a thorough analysis of the performance of current state-of-the-art feature extraction networks under various domain changes and find a significant performance gap between intra- and cross-domain localization. We investigate different methods to close this gap by improving the supervision of modern feature extractor networks. We propose a novel data-centric method, Implicit Cross-Domain Correspondences (iCDC). iCDC represents the same environment with multiple Neural Radiance Fields, each fitting the scene under individual visual domains. It utilizes the underlying 3D representations to generate accurate correspondences across different long-term visual conditions. Our proposed method enhances cross-domain localization performance, significantly reducing the performance gap. When evaluated on popular long-term localization benchmarks, our trained networks consistently outperform existing methods. This work serves as a substantial stride toward more robust visual localization pipelines for long-term deployments, and opens up research avenues in the development of long-term invariant descriptors.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we highlight a problem of evaluation metrics adopted in the open-vocabulary segmentation. That is, the evaluation process still heavily relies on closed-set metrics on zero-shot or cross-dataset pipelines without considering the similarity between predicted and ground truth categories. To tackle this issue, we first survey eleven similarity measurements between two categorical words using WordNet linguistics statistics, text embedding, and language models by comprehensive quantitative analysis and user study. Built upon those explored measurements, we designed novel evaluation metrics, namely Open mIoU, Open AP, and Open PQ, tailored for three open-vocabulary segmentation tasks. We benchmarked the proposed evaluation metrics on 12 open-vocabulary methods of three segmentation tasks. Even though the relative subjectivity of similarity distance, we demonstrate that our metrics can still well evaluate the open ability of the existing open-vocabulary segmentation methods. We hope that our work can bring with the community new thinking about how to evaluate the open ability of models. The evaluation code is released in github.

- **Summary**: A remarkable ability of human beings resides in compositional reasoning, i.e., the capacity to make "infinite use of finite means". However, current large vision-language foundation models (VLMs) fall short of such compositional abilities due to their "bag-of-words" behaviors and inability to construct words that correctly represent visual entities and the relations among the entities. To this end, we propose CoVLM, which can guide the LLM to explicitly compose visual entities and relationships among the text and dynamically communicate with the vision encoder and detection network to achieve vision-language communicative decoding. Specifically, we first devise a set of novel communication tokens for the LLM, for dynamic communication between the visual detection system and the language system. A communication token is generated by the LLM following a visual entity or a relation, to inform the detection network to propose regions that are relevant to the sentence generated so far. The proposed regions-of-interests (ROIs) are then fed back into the LLM for better language generation contingent on the relevant regions. The LLM is thus able to compose the visual entities and relationships through the communication tokens. The vision-to-language and language-to-vision communication are iteratively performed until the entire sentence is generated. Our framework seamlessly bridges the gap between visual perception and LLMs and outperforms previous VLMs by a large margin on compositional reasoning benchmarks (e.g., ~20% in HICO-DET mAP, ~14% in Cola top-1 accuracy, and ~3% on ARO top-1 accuracy). We also achieve state-of-the-art performances on traditional vision-language tasks such as referring expression comprehension and visual question answering.

- **Summary**: We propose SegGen, a highly-effective training data generation method for image segmentation, which pushes the performance limits of state-of-the-art segmentation models to a significant extent. SegGen designs and integrates two data generation strategies: MaskSyn and ImgSyn. (i) MaskSyn synthesizes new mask-image pairs via our proposed text-to-mask generation model and mask-to-image generation model, greatly improving the diversity in segmentation masks for model supervision; (ii) ImgSyn synthesizes new images based on existing masks using the mask-to-image generation model, strongly improving image diversity for model inputs. On the highly competitive ADE20K and COCO benchmarks, our data generation method markedly improves the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models in semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Notably, in terms of the ADE20K mIoU, Mask2Former R50 is largely boosted from 47.2 to 49.9 (+2.7); Mask2Former Swin-L is also significantly increased from 56.1 to 57.4 (+1.3). These promising results strongly suggest the effectiveness of our SegGen even when abundant human-annotated training data is utilized. Moreover, training with our synthetic data makes the segmentation models more robust towards unseen domains. Project website: https://seggenerator.github.io

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models to the vision domain. Initial efforts towards LMMs used holistic images and text prompts to generate ungrounded textual responses. Very recently, region-level LMMs have been used to generate visually grounded responses. However, they are limited to only referring a single object category at a time, require users to specify the regions in inputs, or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding. In this work, we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM), the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks. GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input. This empowers users to interact with the model at various levels of granularity, both in textual and visual domains. Due to the lack of standard benchmarks for the novel setting of generating visually grounded detailed conversations, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol with our curated grounded conversations. Our proposed Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) task requires densely grounded concepts in natural scenes at a large-scale. To this end, we propose a densely annotated Grounding-anything Dataset (GranD) using our proposed automated annotation pipeline that encompasses 7.5M unique concepts grounded in a total of 810M regions available with segmentation masks. Besides GCG, GLaMM also performs effectively on several downstream tasks e.g., referring expression segmentation, image and region-level captioning and vision-language conversations.

- **Summary**: In the recent progress in embodied navigation and sim-to-robot transfer, modular policies have emerged as a de facto framework. However, there is more to compositionality beyond the decomposition of the learning load into modular components. In this work, we investigate a principled way to syntactically combine these components. Particularly, we propose Exploitation-Guided Exploration (XGX) where separate modules for exploration and exploitation come together in a novel and intuitive manner. We configure the exploitation module to take over in the deterministic final steps of navigation i.e. when the goal becomes visible. Crucially, an exploitation module teacher-forces the exploration module and continues driving an overridden policy optimization. XGX, with effective decomposition and novel guidance, improves the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging object navigation task from 70% to 73%. Along with better accuracy, through targeted analysis, we show that XGX is also more efficient at goal-conditioned exploration. Finally, we show sim-to-real transfer to robot hardware and XGX performs over two-fold better than the best baseline from simulation benchmarking. Project page: xgxvisnav.github.io

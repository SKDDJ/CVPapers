- **Summary**: Temporal action detection (TAD) involves the localization and classification of action instances within untrimmed videos. While standard TAD follows fully supervised learning with closed-set setting on large training data, recent zero-shot TAD methods showcase the promising of open-set setting by leveraging large-scale contrastive visual-language (ViL) pretrained models. However, existing zero-shot TAD methods have limitations on how to properly construct the strong relationships between two interdependent tasks of localization and classification and adapt ViL model to video understanding. In this work, we present ZEETAD, featuring two modules: dual-localization and zero-shot proposal classification. The former is a Transformer-based module that detects action events while selectively collecting crucial semantic embeddings for later recognition. The latter one, CLIP-based module, generates semantic embeddings from text and frame inputs for each temporal unit. Additionally, we enhance discriminative capability on unseen classes by minimally updating the frozen CLIP encoder with lightweight adapters. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets demonstrate our approach's superior performance in zero-shot TAD and effective knowledge transfer from ViL models to unseen action categories.

- **Summary**: The zero-shot open-vocabulary challenge in image classification is tackled by pretrained vision-language models like CLIP, which benefit from incorporating class-specific knowledge from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. However, biases in CLIP lead to similar descriptions for distinct but related classes, prompting our novel image classification framework via hierarchical comparisons: using LLMs to recursively group classes into hierarchies and classifying images by comparing image-text embeddings at each hierarchy level, resulting in an intuitive, effective, and explainable approach.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel and efficient approach for text-based video-to-video editing that eliminates the need for resource-intensive per-video-per-model finetuning. At the core of our approach is a synthetic paired video dataset tailored for video-to-video transfer tasks. Inspired by Instruct Pix2Pix's image transfer via editing instruction, we adapt this paradigm to the video domain. Extending the Prompt-to-Prompt to videos, we efficiently generate paired samples, each with an input video and its edited counterpart. Alongside this, we introduce the Long Video Sampling Correction during sampling, ensuring consistent long videos across batches. Our method surpasses current methods like Tune-A-Video, heralding substantial progress in text-based video-to-video editing and suggesting exciting avenues for further exploration and deployment.

- **Summary**: Utilizing visual place recognition (VPR) technology to ascertain the geographical location of publicly available images is a pressing issue for real-world VPR applications. Although most current VPR methods achieve favorable results under ideal conditions, their performance in complex environments, characterized by lighting variations, seasonal changes, and occlusions caused by moving objects, is generally unsatisfactory. In this study, we utilize the DINOv2 model as the backbone network for trimming and fine-tuning to extract robust image features. We propose a novel VPR architecture called DINO-Mix, which combines a foundational vision model with feature aggregation. This architecture relies on the powerful image feature extraction capabilities of foundational vision models. We employ an MLP-Mixer-based mix module to aggregate image features, resulting in globally robust and generalizable descriptors that enable high-precision VPR. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed DINO-Mix architecture significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In test sets having lighting variations, seasonal changes, and occlusions (Tokyo24/7, Nordland, SF-XL-Testv1), our proposed DINO-Mix architecture achieved Top-1 accuracy rates of 91.75%, 80.18%, and 82%, respectively. Compared with SOTA methods, our architecture exhibited an average accuracy improvement of 5.14%.

- **Summary**: Recently, heatmap regression methods based on 1D landmark representations have shown prominent performance on locating facial landmarks. However, previous methods ignored to make deep explorations on the good potentials of 1D landmark representations for sequential and structural modeling of multiple landmarks to track facial landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose a Transformer architecture, namely 1DFormer, which learns informative 1D landmark representations by capturing the dynamic and the geometric patterns of landmarks via token communications in both temporal and spatial dimensions for facial landmark tracking. For temporal modeling, we propose a recurrent token mixing mechanism, an axis-landmark-positional embedding mechanism, as well as a confidence-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism to adaptively and robustly embed long-term landmark dynamics into their 1D representations; for structure modeling, we design intra-group and inter-group structure modeling mechanisms to encode the component-level as well as global-level facial structure patterns as a refinement for the 1D representations of landmarks through token communications in the spatial dimension via 1D convolutional layers. Experimental results on the 300VW and the TF databases show that 1DFormer successfully models the long-range sequential patterns as well as the inherent facial structures to learn informative 1D representations of landmark sequences, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on facial landmark tracking.

- **Summary**: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) poses challenges due to distinctive properties of the underwater environment, including low contrast, high turbidity, visual blurriness, and color distortion. In recent years, the application of deep learning has quietly revolutionized various areas of scientific research, including UIE. However, existing deep learning-based UIE methods generally suffer from issues of weak robustness and limited adaptability. In this paper, inspired by residual and attention mechanisms, we propose a more reliable and reasonable UIE network called RAUNE-Net by employing residual learning of high-level features at the network's bottle-neck and two aspects of attention manipulations in the down-sampling procedure. Furthermore, we collect and create two datasets specifically designed for evaluating UIE methods, which contains different types of underwater distortions and degradations. The experimental validation demonstrates that our method obtains promising objective performance and consistent visual results across various real-world underwater images compared to other eight UIE methods. Our example code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/fansuregrin/RAUNE-Net.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging deep learning and neural networks to address scientific problems, particularly in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, current neural network-based PDE solvers often rely on extensive training data or labeled input-output pairs, making them prone to challenges in generalizing to out-of-distribution examples. To mitigate the generalization gap encountered by conventional neural network-based methods in estimating PDE solutions, we formulate a fully unsupervised approach, requiring no training data, to estimate finite difference solutions for PDEs directly via small convolutional neural networks. Our proposed algorithms demonstrate a comparable accuracy to the true solution for several selected elliptic and parabolic problems compared to the finite difference method.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal images play a crucial role in comprehensive evaluations in medical image analysis providing complementary information for identifying clinically important biomarkers. However, in clinical practice, acquiring multiple modalities can be challenging due to reasons such as scan cost, limited scan time, and safety considerations. In this paper, we propose a model based on the latent diffusion model (LDM) that leverages switchable blocks for image-to-image translation in 3D medical images without patch cropping. The 3D LDM combined with conditioning using the target modality allows generating high-quality target modality in 3D overcoming the shortcoming of the missing out-of-slice information in 2D generation methods. The switchable block, noted as multiple switchable spatially adaptive normalization (MS-SPADE), dynamically transforms source latents to the desired style of the target latents to help with the diffusion process. The MS-SPADE block allows us to have one single model to tackle many translation tasks of one source modality to various targets removing the need for many translation models for different scenarios. Our model exhibited successful image synthesis across different source-target modality scenarios and surpassed other models in quantitative evaluations tested on multi-modal brain magnetic resonance imaging datasets of four different modalities and an independent IXI dataset. Our model demonstrated successful image synthesis across various modalities even allowing for one-to-many modality translations. Furthermore, it outperformed other one-to-one translation models in quantitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Forests play a crucial role in Earth's system processes and provide a suite of social and economic ecosystem services, but are significantly impacted by human activities, leading to a pronounced disruption of the equilibrium within ecosystems. Advancing forest monitoring worldwide offers advantages in mitigating human impacts and enhancing our comprehension of forest composition, alongside the effects of climate change. While statistical modeling has traditionally found applications in forest biology, recent strides in machine learning and computer vision have reached important milestones using remote sensing data, such as tree species identification, tree crown segmentation and forest biomass assessments. For this, the significance of open access data remains essential in enhancing such data-driven algorithms and methodologies. Here, we provide a comprehensive and extensive overview of 86 open access forest datasets across spatial scales, encompassing inventories, ground-based, aerial-based, satellite-based recordings, and country or world maps. These datasets are grouped in OpenForest, a dynamic catalogue open to contributions that strives to reference all available open access forest datasets. Moreover, in the context of these datasets, we aim to inspire research in machine learning applied to forest biology by establishing connections between contemporary topics, perspectives and challenges inherent in both domains. We hope to encourage collaborations among scientists, fostering the sharing and exploration of diverse datasets through the application of machine learning methods for large-scale forest monitoring.

- **Summary**: Few-shot object detection, which focuses on detecting novel objects with few labels, is an emerging challenge in the community. Recent studies show that adapting a pre-trained model or modified loss function can improve performance. In this paper, we explore leveraging the power of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) and hard negative classification loss in low data setting. Specifically, we propose Re-scoring using Image-language Similarity for Few-shot object detection (RISF) which extends Faster R-CNN by introducing Calibration Module using CLIP (CM-CLIP) and Background Negative Re-scale Loss (BNRL). The former adapts CLIP, which performs zero-shot classification, to re-score the classification scores of a detector using image-class similarities, the latter is modified classification loss considering the punishment for fake backgrounds as well as confusing categories on a generalized few-shot object detection dataset. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC show that the proposed RISF substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The code will be available.

- **Summary**: Medical Image Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (MI-HMC) is of paramount importance in modern healthcare, presenting two significant challenges: data imbalance and \textit{hierarchy constraint}. Existing solutions involve complex model architecture design or domain-specific preprocessing, demanding considerable expertise or effort in implementation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Transfer Learning with Maximum Constraint Module (TLMCM) network for the MI-HMC task. The TLMCM network offers a novel approach to overcome the aforementioned challenges, outperforming existing methods based on the Area Under the Average Precision and Recall Curve($AU\overline{(PRC)}$) metric. In addition, this research proposes two novel accuracy metrics, $EMR$ and $HammingAccuracy$, which have not been extensively explored in the context of the MI-HMC task. Experimental results demonstrate that the TLMCM network achieves high multi-label prediction accuracy($80\%$-$90\%$) for MI-HMC tasks, making it a valuable contribution to healthcare domain applications.

- **Summary**: Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to cope with the distribution and label shifts between the source and target domains simultaneously, performing accurate classification for known classes while identifying unknown class samples in the target domain. Most existing OSDA approaches, depending on the final image feature space of deep models, require manually-tuned thresholds, and may easily misclassify unknown samples as known classes. Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) could be a remedy. Within an MoE, different experts address different input features, producing unique expert routing patterns for different classes in a routing feature space. As a result, unknown class samples may also display different expert routing patterns to known classes. This paper proposes Dual-Space Detection, which exploits the inconsistencies between the image feature space and the routing feature space to detect unknown class samples without any threshold. Graph Router is further introduced to better make use of the spatial information among image patches. Experiments on three different datasets validated the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. The code will come soon.



### Graph Representation Learning for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to extract complementary features to synthesize a single fused image. Many methods employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features due to its translation invariance and locality. However, CNNs fail to consider the image's non-local self-similarity (NLss), though it can expand the receptive field by pooling operations, it still inevitably leads to information loss. In addition, the transformer structure extracts long-range dependence by considering the correlativity among all image patches, leading to information redundancy of such transformer-based methods. However, graph representation is more flexible than grid (CNN) or sequence (transformer structure) representation to address irregular objects, and graph can also construct the relationships among the spatially repeatable details or texture with far-space distance. Therefore, to address the above issues, it is significant to convert images into the graph space and thus adopt graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract NLss. This is because the graph can provide a fine structure to aggregate features and propagate information across the nearest vertices without introducing redundant information. Concretely, we implement a cascaded NLss extraction pattern to extract NLss of intra- and inter-modal by exploring interactions of different image pixels in intra- and inter-image positional distance. We commence by preforming GCNs on each intra-modal to aggregate features and propagate information to extract independent intra-modal NLss. Then, GCNs are performed on the concatenate intra-modal NLss features of infrared and visible images, which can explore the cross-domain NLss of inter-modal to reconstruct the fused image. Ablation studies and extensive experiments illustrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method on three datasets.

- **Summary**: Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) aims to find the most relevant video in a large video gallery given a query text. The intricate and abundant context of the video challenges the performance and efficiency of TVR. To handle the serialized video contexts, existing methods typically select a subset of frames within a video to represent the video content for TVR. How to select the most representative frames is a crucial issue, whereby the selected frames are required to not only retain the semantic information of the video but also promote retrieval efficiency by excluding temporally redundant frames. In this paper, we make the first empirical study of frame selection for TVR. We systemically classify existing frame selection methods into text-free and text-guided ones, under which we detailedly analyze six different frame selections in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Among them, two frame selections are first developed in this paper. According to the comprehensive analysis on multiple TVR benchmarks, we empirically conclude that the TVR with proper frame selections can significantly improve the retrieval efficiency without sacrificing the retrieval performance.

- **Summary**: The multimodal task of Visual Question Answering (VQA) encompassing elements of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to generate answers to questions on any visual input. Over time, the scope of VQA has expanded from datasets focusing on an extensive collection of natural images to datasets featuring synthetic images, video, 3D environments, and various other visual inputs. The emergence of large pre-trained networks has shifted the early VQA approaches relying on feature extraction and fusion schemes to vision language pre-training (VLP) techniques. However, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that encompass both traditional VQA architectures and contemporary VLP-based methods. Furthermore, the VLP challenges in the lens of VQA haven't been thoroughly explored, leaving room for potential open problems to emerge. Our work presents a survey in the domain of VQA that delves into the intricacies of VQA datasets and methods over the field's history, introduces a detailed taxonomy to categorize the facets of VQA, and highlights the recent trends, challenges, and scopes for improvement. We further generalize VQA to multimodal question answering, explore tasks related to VQA, and present a set of open problems for future investigation. The work aims to navigate both beginners and experts by shedding light on the potential avenues of research and expanding the boundaries of the field.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable performance in image generation. However, GAN training suffers from the problem of instability. One of the main approaches to address this problem is to modify the loss function, often using regularization terms in addition to changing the type of adversarial losses. This paper focuses on directly regularizing the adversarial loss function. We propose a method that applies flooding, an overfitting suppression method in supervised learning, to GANs to directly prevent the discriminator's loss from becoming excessively low. Flooding requires tuning the flood level, but when applied to GANs, we propose that the appropriate range of flood level settings is determined by the adversarial loss function, supported by theoretical analysis of GANs using the binary cross entropy loss. We experimentally verify that flooding stabilizes GAN training and can be combined with other stabilization techniques. We also reveal that by restricting the discriminator's loss to be no greater than flood level, the training proceeds stably even when the flood level is somewhat high.



### Enhancing Clustering Representations with Positive Proximity and Cluster Dispersion Learning

- **Summary**: Contemporary deep clustering approaches often rely on either contrastive or non-contrastive techniques to acquire effective representations for clustering tasks. Contrastive methods leverage negative pairs to achieve homogenous representations but can introduce class collision issues, potentially compromising clustering performance. On the contrary, non-contrastive techniques prevent class collisions but may produce non-uniform representations that lead to clustering collapse. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end deep clustering approach named PIPCDR, designed to harness the strengths of both approaches while mitigating their limitations. PIPCDR incorporates a positive instance proximity loss and a cluster dispersion regularizer. The positive instance proximity loss ensures alignment between augmented views of instances and their sampled neighbors, enhancing within-cluster compactness by selecting genuinely positive pairs within the embedding space. Meanwhile, the cluster dispersion regularizer maximizes inter-cluster distances while minimizing within-cluster compactness, promoting uniformity in the learned representations. PIPCDR excels in producing well-separated clusters, generating uniform representations, avoiding class collision issues, and enhancing within-cluster compactness. We extensively validate the effectiveness of PIPCDR within an end-to-end Majorize-Minimization framework, demonstrating its competitive performance on moderate-scale clustering benchmark datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art results on large-scale datasets.

- **Summary**: Congenital heart disease (CHD) encompasses a spectrum of cardiovascular structural abnormalities, often requiring customized treatment plans for individual patients. Computational modeling and analysis of these unique cardiac anatomies can improve diagnosis and treatment planning and may ultimately lead to improved outcomes. Deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated the potential to enable efficient treatment planning by automating cardiac segmentation and mesh construction for patients with normal cardiac anatomies. However, CHDs are often rare, making it challenging to acquire sufficiently large patient cohorts for training such DL models. Generative modeling of cardiac anatomies has the potential to fill this gap via the generation of virtual cohorts; however, prior approaches were largely designed for normal anatomies and cannot readily capture the significant topological variations seen in CHD patients. Therefore, we propose a type- and shape-disentangled generative approach suitable to capture the wide spectrum of cardiac anatomies observed in different CHD types and synthesize differently shaped cardiac anatomies that preserve the unique topology for specific CHD types. Our DL approach represents generic whole heart anatomies with CHD type-specific abnormalities implicitly using signed distance fields (SDF) based on CHD type diagnosis, which conveniently captures divergent anatomical variations across different types and represents meaningful intermediate CHD states. To capture the shape-specific variations, we then learn invertible deformations to morph the learned CHD type-specific anatomies and reconstruct patient-specific shapes. Our approach has the potential to augment the image-segmentation pairs for rarer CHD types for cardiac segmentation and generate cohorts of CHD cardiac meshes for computational simulation.

- **Summary**: The consistent mapping from poems to paintings is essential for the research and restoration of traditional Chinese gardens. But the lack of firsthand ma-terial is a great challenge to the reconstruction work. In this paper, we pro-pose a method to generate garden paintings based on text descriptions using deep learning method. Our image-text pair dataset consists of more than one thousand Ming Dynasty Garden paintings and their inscriptions and post-scripts. A latent text-to-image diffusion model learns the mapping from de-scriptive texts to garden paintings of the Ming Dynasty, and then the text description of Jichang Garden guides the model to generate new garden paintings. The cosine similarity between the guide text and the generated image is the evaluation criterion for the generated images. Our dataset is used to fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model using Low-Rank Adapta-tion of Large Language Models (LoRA). We also transformed the generated images into a panorama and created a free-roam scene in Unity 3D. Our post-trained model is capable of generating garden images in the style of Ming Dynasty landscape paintings based on textual descriptions. The gener-ated images are compatible with three-dimensional presentation in Unity 3D.

- **Summary**: The exploration of brain activity and its decoding from fMRI data has been a longstanding pursuit, driven by its potential applications in brain-computer interfaces, medical diagnostics, and virtual reality. Previous approaches have primarily focused on individual subject analysis, highlighting the need for a more universal and adaptable framework, which is the core motivation behind our work. In this work, we propose fMRI-PTE, an innovative auto-encoder approach for fMRI pre-training, with a focus on addressing the challenges of varying fMRI data dimensions due to individual brain differences. Our approach involves transforming fMRI signals into unified 2D representations, ensuring consistency in dimensions and preserving distinct brain activity patterns. We introduce a novel learning strategy tailored for pre-training 2D fMRI images, enhancing the quality of reconstruction. fMRI-PTE's adaptability with image generators enables the generation of well-represented fMRI features, facilitating various downstream tasks, including within-subject and cross-subject brain activity decoding. Our contributions encompass introducing fMRI-PTE, innovative data transformation, efficient training, a novel learning strategy, and the universal applicability of our approach. Extensive experiments validate and support our claims, offering a promising foundation for further research in this domain.

- **Summary**: We propose a system that estimates people's body and head orientations using low-resolution point cloud data from two LiDAR sensors. Our models make accurate estimations in real-world conversation settings where the subject moves naturally with varying head and body poses. The body orientation estimation model uses ellipse fitting while the head orientation estimation model is a pipeline of geometric feature extraction and an ensemble of neural network regressors. Compared with other body and head orientation estimation systems using RGB cameras, our proposed system uses LiDAR sensors to preserve user privacy, while achieving comparable accuracy. Unlike other body/head orientation estimation systems, our sensors do not require a specified placement in front of the subject. Our models achieve a mean absolute estimation error of 5.2 degrees for body orientation and 13.7 degrees for head orientation. We use our models to quantify behavioral differences between neurotypical and autistic individuals in triadic conversations. Tests of significance show that people with autism spectrum disorder display significantly different behavior compared to neurotypical individuals in terms of distributing attention between participants in a conversation, suggesting that the approach could be a component of a behavioral analysis or coaching system.

- **Summary**: Leveraging the generative ability of image diffusion models offers great potential for zero-shot video-to-video translation. The key lies in how to maintain temporal consistency across generated video frames by image diffusion models. Previous methods typically adopt cross-frame attention, \emph{i.e.,} sharing the \textit{key} and \textit{value} tokens across attentions of different frames, to encourage the temporal consistency. However, in those works, temporal inconsistency issue may not be thoroughly solved, rendering the fidelity of generated videos limited.%The current state of the art cross-frame attention method aims at maintaining fine-grained visual details across frames, but it is still challenged by the temporal coherence problem. In this paper, we find the bottleneck lies in the unconstrained query tokens and propose a new zero-shot video-to-video translation framework, named \textit{LatentWarp}. Our approach is simple: to constrain the query tokens to be temporally consistent, we further incorporate a warping operation in the latent space to constrain the query tokens. Specifically, based on the optical flow obtained from the original video, we warp the generated latent features of last frame to align with the current frame during the denoising process. As a result, the corresponding regions across the adjacent frames can share closely-related query tokens and attention outputs, which can further improve latent-level consistency to enhance visual temporal coherence of generated videos. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the superiority of \textit{LatentWarp} in achieving video-to-video translation with temporal coherence.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning predicts whether two images belong to the same category by training a model to make their feature representations as close or as far away as possible. In this paper, we rethink how to mine samples in contrastive learning, unlike other methods, our approach is more comprehensive, taking into account both positive and negative samples, and mining potential samples from two aspects: First, for positive samples, we consider both the augmented sample views obtained by data augmentation and the mined sample views through data mining. Then, we weight and combine them using both soft and hard weighting strategies. Second, considering the existence of uninformative negative samples and false negative samples in the negative samples, we analyze the negative samples from the gradient perspective and finally mine negative samples that are neither too hard nor too easy as potential negative samples, i.e., those negative samples that are close to positive samples. The experiments show the obvious advantages of our method compared with some traditional self-supervised methods. Our method achieves 88.57%, 61.10%, and 36.69% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImagenet, respectively.

- **Summary**: Motion forecasting is an essential task for autonomous driving, and the effective information utilization from infrastructure and other vehicles can enhance motion forecasting capabilities. Existing research have primarily focused on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction information of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we first propose the cooperative trajectory representations learning paradigm. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, the first interpretable and end-to-end learning framework for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph employs an interpretable graph to fully leverage the cooperative motion and interaction contexts. Experimental results on the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) motion forecasting dataset, V2X-Seq, demonstrate the effectiveness of V2X-Graph. To further evaluate on V2X scenario, we construct the first real-world vehicle-to-everything (V2X) motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, and the performance shows the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj can facilitate the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.

- **Summary**: Normal estimation for 3D point clouds is a fundamental task in 3D geometry processing. The state-of-the-art methods rely on priors of fitting local surfaces learned from normal supervision. However, normal supervision in benchmarks comes from synthetic shapes and is usually not available from real scans, thereby limiting the learned priors of these methods. In addition, normal orientation consistency across shapes remains difficult to achieve without a separate post-processing procedure. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel method for estimating oriented normals directly from point clouds without using ground truth normals as supervision. We achieve this by introducing a new paradigm for learning neural gradient functions, which encourages the neural network to fit the input point clouds and yield unit-norm gradients at the points. Specifically, we introduce loss functions to facilitate query points to iteratively reach the moving targets and aggregate onto the approximated surface, thereby learning a global surface representation of the data. Meanwhile, we incorporate gradients into the surface approximation to measure the minimum signed deviation of queries, resulting in a consistent gradient field associated with the surface. These techniques lead to our deep unsupervised oriented normal estimator that is robust to noise, outliers and density variations. Our excellent results on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method can learn more accurate normals for both unoriented and oriented normal estimation tasks than the latest methods.

- **Summary**: This study proposes a novel self-calibration method for eye tracking in a virtual reality (VR) headset. The proposed method is based on the assumptions that the user's viewpoint can freely move and that the points of regard (PoRs) from different viewpoints are distributed within a small area on an object surface during visual fixation. In the method, fixations are first detected from the time-series data of uncalibrated gaze directions using an extension of the I-VDT (velocity and dispersion threshold identification) algorithm to a three-dimensional (3D) scene. Then, the calibration parameters are optimized by minimizing the sum of a dispersion metrics of the PoRs. The proposed method can potentially identify the optimal calibration parameters representing the user-dependent offset from the optical axis to the visual axis without explicit user calibration, image processing, or marker-substitute objects. For the gaze data of 18 participants walking in two VR environments with many occlusions, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 2.1$^\circ$, which was significantly lower than the average offset. Our method is the first self-calibration method with an average error lower than 3$^\circ$ in 3D environments. Further, the accuracy of the proposed method can be improved by up to 1.2$^\circ$ by refining the fixation detection or optimization algorithm.

- **Summary**: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is an emerging task in computer vision, which segments the target instances in images based on text descriptions. However, its development is plagued by the expensive segmentation labels. To address this issue, we propose a new learning task for RES called Omni-supervised Referring Expression Segmentation (Omni-RES), which aims to make full use of unlabeled, fully labeled and weakly labeled data, e.g., referring points or grounding boxes, for efficient RES training. To accomplish this task, we also propose a novel yet strong baseline method for Omni-RES based on the recently popular teacher-student learning, where where the weak labels are not directly transformed into supervision signals but used as a yardstick to select and refine high-quality pseudo-masks for teacher-student learning. To validate the proposed Omni-RES method, we apply it to a set of state-of-the-art RES models and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of RES datasets. The experimental results yield the obvious merits of Omni-RES than the fully-supervised and semi-supervised training schemes. For instance, with only 10% fully labeled data, Omni-RES can help the base model achieve 100% fully supervised performance, and it also outperform the semi-supervised alternative by a large margin, e.g., +14.93% on RefCOCO and +14.95% on RefCOCO+, respectively. More importantly, Omni-RES also enable the use of large-scale vision-langauges like Visual Genome to facilitate low-cost RES training, and achieve new SOTA performance of RES, e.g., 80.66 on RefCOCO.

- **Summary**: Automatic generation of radiology reports holds crucial clinical value, as it can alleviate substantial workload on radiologists and remind less experienced ones of potential anomalies. Despite the remarkable performance of various image captioning methods in the natural image field, generating accurate reports for medical images still faces challenges, i.e., disparities in visual and textual data, and lack of accurate domain knowledge. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced knowledge injection framework, which utilizes two branches to extract different types of knowledge. The Weighted Concept Knowledge (WCK) branch is responsible for introducing clinical medical concepts weighted by TF-IDF scores. The Multimodal Retrieval Knowledge (MRK) branch extracts triplets from similar reports, emphasizing crucial clinical information related to entity positions and existence. By integrating this finer-grained and well-structured knowledge with the current image, we are able to leverage the multi-source knowledge gain to ultimately facilitate more accurate report generation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two public benchmarks, demonstrating that our method achieves superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of two extracted knowledge sources.

- **Summary**: Open-set face recognition characterizes a scenario where unknown individuals, unseen during the training and enrollment stages, appear on operation time. This work concentrates on watchlists, an open-set task that is expected to operate at a low False Positive Identification Rate and generally includes only a few enrollment samples per identity. We introduce a compact adapter network that benefits from additional negative face images when combined with distinct cost functions, such as Objectosphere Loss (OS) and the proposed Maximal Entropy Loss (MEL). MEL modifies the traditional Cross-Entropy loss in favor of increasing the entropy for negative samples and attaches a penalty to known target classes in pursuance of gallery specialization. The proposed approach adopts pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) for face recognition as feature extractors. Then, the adapter network takes deep feature representations and acts as a substitute for the output layer of the pre-trained DNN in exchange for an agile domain adaptation. Promising results have been achieved following open-set protocols for three different datasets: LFW, IJB-C, and UCCS as well as state-of-the-art performance when supplementary negative data is properly selected to fine-tune the adapter network.

- **Summary**: Human pose assessment and correction play a crucial role in applications across various fields, including computer vision, robotics, sports analysis, healthcare, and entertainment. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Transformer based Framework (STTF) for human pose assessment and correction in education scenarios such as physical exercises and science experiment. The framework comprising skeletal tracking, pose estimation, posture assessment, and posture correction modules to educate students with professional, quick-to-fix feedback. We also create a pose correction method to provide corrective feedback in the form of visual aids. We test the framework with our own dataset. It comprises (a) new recordings of five exercises, (b) existing recordings found on the internet of the same exercises, and (c) corrective feedback on the recordings by professional athletes and teachers. Results show that our model can effectively measure and comment on the quality of students' actions. The STTF leverages the power of transformer models to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in human poses, enabling accurate assessment and effective correction of students' movements.

- **Summary**: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is routinely collected during image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to provide updated patient anatomy information for cancer treatments. However, CBCT images often suffer from streaking artifacts and noise caused by under-rate sampling projections and low-dose exposure, resulting in low clarity and information loss. While recent deep learning-based CBCT enhancement methods have shown promising results in suppressing artifacts, they have limited performance on preserving anatomical details since conventional pixel-to-pixel loss functions are incapable of describing detailed anatomy. To address this issue, we propose a novel feature-oriented deep learning framework that translates low-quality CBCT images into high-quality CT-like imaging via a multi-task customized feature-to-feature perceptual loss function. The framework comprises two main components: a multi-task learning feature-selection network(MTFS-Net) for customizing the perceptual loss function; and a CBCT-to-CT translation network guided by feature-to-feature perceptual loss, which uses advanced generative models such as U-Net, GAN and CycleGAN. Our experiments showed that the proposed framework can generate synthesized CT (sCT) images for the lung that achieved a high similarity to CT images, with an average SSIM index of 0.9869 and an average PSNR index of 39.9621. The sCT images also achieved visually pleasing performance with effective artifacts suppression, noise reduction, and distinctive anatomical details preservation. Our experiment results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models for pulmonary CBCT enhancement. This framework holds great promise for generating high-quality anatomical imaging from CBCT that is suitable for various clinical applications.

- **Summary**: The 3D scene editing method based on neural implicit field has gained wide attention. It has achieved excellent results in 3D editing tasks. However, existing methods often blend the interaction between objects and scene environment. The change of scene appearance like shadows is failed to be displayed in the rendering view. In this paper, we propose an Object and Scene environment Interaction aware (OSI-aware) system, which is a novel two-stream neural rendering system considering object and scene environment interaction. To obtain illuminating conditions from the mixture soup, the system successfully separates the interaction between objects and scene environment by intrinsic decomposition method. To study the corresponding changes to the scene appearance from object-level editing tasks, we introduce a depth map guided scene inpainting method and shadow rendering method by point matching strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our novel pipeline produce reasonable appearance changes in scene editing tasks. It also achieve competitive performance for the rendering quality in novel-view synthesis tasks.

- **Summary**: Schlieren imaging is an optical technique to observe the flow of transparent media, such as air or water, without any particle seeding. However, conventional frame-based techniques require both high spatial and temporal resolution cameras, which impose bright illumination and expensive computation limitations. Event cameras offer potential advantages (high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and data efficiency) to overcome such limitations due to their bio-inspired sensing principle. This paper presents a novel technique for perceiving air convection using events and frames by providing the first theoretical analysis that connects event data and schlieren. We formulate the problem as a variational optimization one combining the linearized event generation model with a physically-motivated parameterization that estimates the temporal derivative of the air density. The experiments with accurately aligned frame- and event camera data reveal that the proposed method enables event cameras to obtain on par results with existing frame-based optical flow techniques. Moreover, the proposed method works under dark conditions where frame-based schlieren fails, and also enables slow-motion analysis by leveraging the event camera's advantages. Our work pioneers and opens a new stack of event camera applications, as we publish the source code as well as the first schlieren dataset with high-quality frame and event data. https://github.com/tub-rip/event_based_bos

- **Summary**: Traffic object detection under variable illumination is challenging due to the information loss caused by the limited dynamic range of conventional frame-based cameras. To address this issue, we introduce bio-inspired event cameras and propose a novel Structure-aware Fusion Network (SFNet) that extracts sharp and complete object structures from the event stream to compensate for the lost information in images through cross-modality fusion, enabling the network to obtain illumination-robust representations for traffic object detection. Specifically, to mitigate the sparsity or blurriness issues arising from diverse motion states of traffic objects in fixed-interval event sampling methods, we propose the Reliable Structure Generation Network (RSGNet) to generate Speed Invariant Frames (SIF), ensuring the integrity and sharpness of object structures. Next, we design a novel Adaptive Feature Complement Module (AFCM) which guides the adaptive fusion of two modality features to compensate for the information loss in the images by perceiving the global lightness distribution of the images, thereby generating illumination-robust representations. Finally, considering the lack of large-scale and high-quality annotations in the existing event-based object detection datasets, we build a DSEC-Det dataset, which consists of 53 sequences with 63,931 images and more than 208,000 labels for 8 classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SFNet can overcome the perceptual boundaries of conventional cameras and outperform the frame-based method by 8.0% in mAP50 and 5.9% in mAP50:95. Our code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/YN-Yang/SFNet.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) has demonstrated promising performance in computer vision tasks, comparable to state-of-the-art neural networks. Yet, this new type of deep neural network architecture is vulnerable to adversarial attacks limiting its capabilities in terms of robustness. This article presents a novel contribution aimed at further improving the accuracy and robustness of ViT, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks. We propose an augmentation technique called `Dynamic Scanning Augmentation' that leverages dynamic input sequences to adaptively focus on different patches, thereby maintaining performance and robustness. Our detailed investigations reveal that this adaptability to the input sequence induces significant changes in the attention mechanism of ViT, even for the same image. We introduce four variations of Dynamic Scanning Augmentation, outperforming ViT in terms of both robustness to adversarial attacks and accuracy against natural images, with one variant showing comparable results. By integrating our augmentation technique, we observe a substantial increase in ViT's robustness, improving it from $17\%$ to $92\%$ measured across different types of adversarial attacks. These findings, together with other comprehensive tests, indicate that Dynamic Scanning Augmentation enhances accuracy and robustness by promoting a more adaptive type of attention. In conclusion, this work contributes to the ongoing research on Vision Transformers by introducing Dynamic Scanning Augmentation as a technique for improving the accuracy and robustness of ViT. The observed results highlight the potential of this approach in advancing computer vision tasks and merit further exploration in future studies.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have gained attention for image editing yielding impressive results in text-to-image tasks. On the downside, one might notice that generated images of stable diffusion models suffer from deteriorated details. This pitfall impacts image editing tasks that require information preservation e.g., scene text editing. As a desired result, the model must show the capability to replace the text on the source image to the target text while preserving the details e.g., color, font size, and background. To leverage the potential of diffusion models, in this work, we introduce Diffusion-BasEd Scene Text manipulation Network so-called DBEST. Specifically, we design two adaptation strategies, namely one-shot style adaptation and text-recognition guidance. In experiments, we thoroughly assess and compare our proposed method against state-of-the-arts on various scene text datasets, then provide extensive ablation studies for each granularity to analyze our performance gain. Also, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to synthesize scene text indicated by competitive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) accuracy. Our method achieves 94.15% and 98.12% on COCO-text and ICDAR2013 datasets for character-level evaluation.

- **Summary**: This paper considers zero-shot Anomaly Detection (AD), a valuable yet under-studied task, which performs AD without any reference images of the test objects. Specifically, we employ a language-guided strategy and propose a simple-yet-effective architecture CLIP-AD, leveraging the superior zero-shot classification capabilities of the large vision-language model CLIP. A natural idea for anomaly segmentation is to directly calculate the similarity between text/image features, but we observe opposite predictions and irrelevant highlights in the results. Inspired by the phenomena, we introduce a Staged Dual-Path model (SDP) that effectively uses features from various levels and applies architecture and feature surgery to address these issues. Furthermore, delving beyond surface phenomena, we identify the problem arising from misalignment of text/image features in the joint embedding space. Thus, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy by adding linear layers and construct an extended model SDP+, further enhancing the performance. Abundant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, e.g., on VisA, SDP outperforms SOTA by +1.0/+1.2 in classification/segmentation F1 scores, while SDP+ achieves +1.9/+11.7 improvements.

- **Summary**: Single-image shadow removal is a significant task that is still unresolved. Most existing deep learning-based approaches attempt to remove the shadow directly, which can not deal with the shadow well. To handle this issue, we consider removing the shadow in a coarse-to-fine fashion and propose a simple but effective Progressive Recurrent Network (PRNet). The network aims to remove the shadow progressively, enabing us to flexibly adjust the number of iterations to strike a balance between performance and time. Our network comprises two parts: shadow feature extraction and progressive shadow removal. Specifically, the first part is a shallow ResNet which constructs the representations of the input shadow image on its original size, preventing the loss of high-frequency details caused by the downsampling operation. The second part has two critical components: the re-integration module and the update module. The proposed re-integration module can fully use the outputs of the previous iteration, providing input for the update module for further shadow removal. In this way, the proposed PRNet makes the whole process more concise and only uses 29% network parameters than the best published method. Extensive experiments on the three benchmarks, ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD, demonstrate that our method can effectively remove shadows and achieve superior performance.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing detailed 3D scenes from single-view images remains a challenging task due to limitations in existing approaches, which primarily focus on geometric shape recovery, overlooking object appearances and fine shape details. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous high-fidelity recovery of object shapes and textures from single-view images. Our approach utilizes the proposed Single-view neural implicit Shape and Radiance field (SSR) representations to leverage both explicit 3D shape supervision and volume rendering of color, depth, and surface normal images. To overcome shape-appearance ambiguity under partial observations, we introduce a two-stage learning curriculum incorporating both 3D and 2D supervisions. A distinctive feature of our framework is its ability to generate fine-grained textured meshes while seamlessly integrating rendering capabilities into the single-view 3D reconstruction model. This integration enables not only improved textured 3D object reconstruction by 27.7% and 11.6% on the 3D-FRONT and Pix3D datasets, respectively, but also supports the rendering of images from novel viewpoints. Beyond individual objects, our approach facilitates composing object-level representations into flexible scene representations, thereby enabling applications such as holistic scene understanding and 3D scene editing. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Positron emission tomography (PET), as an imaging technique with high biochemical sensitivity, has been widely used in diagnosis of encephalopathy and brain science research used in brain disease diagnosis and brain science research. Since different tracers present different effects on the same focal area, the choice of tracers is getting more significant for PET imaging. Nowadays, with the wide application of PET imaging in neuropsychiatric treatment, 6-18F-fluoro-3, 4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA) has been found to be more effective than 18F-labeled fluorine-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) in this field. However, due to the complexity of its preparation and other limitations, DOPA is far less widely used than FDG. To address this issue, a tracer conversion invertible neural network (TC-INN) for image projection is developed to map FDG images to DOPA images through deep learning. More diagnostic information is obtained by generating PET images from FDG to DOPA. Specifically, the proposed TC-INN consists of two separate phases, one for training the traceable data, the other for re-building the new data. The reference DOPA PET image is used as the learning target for the corresponding network during the training process of tracer conversion. Mean-while, the invertible network iteratively estimates the resultant DOPA PET data and compares it to the reference DOPA PET data. Notably, the reversible model employed variable enhancement techniques to achieve better power generation. Moreover, image registration needs to be performed before training due to the angular deviation of the acquired FDG and DOPA data information. Experimental results show generative ability in mapping be-tween FDG images and DOPA images. It demonstrates great potential for PET image conversion in the case of limited tracer applications.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to improve the reliability of machine learning models by detecting samples that do not belong to the training distribution. Detecting OOD samples effectively in certain tasks can pose a challenge because of the substantial heterogeneity within the in-distribution (ID), and the high structural similarity between ID and OOD classes. For instance, when detecting heart views in fetal ultrasound videos there is a high structural similarity between the heart and other anatomies such as the abdomen, and large in-distribution variance as a heart has 5 distinct views and structural variations within each view. To detect OOD samples in this context, the resulting model should generalise to the intra-anatomy variations while rejecting similar OOD samples. In this paper, we introduce dual-conditioned diffusion models (DCDM) where we condition the model on in-distribution class information and latent features of the input image for reconstruction-based OOD detection. This constrains the generative manifold of the model to generate images structurally and semantically similar to those within the in-distribution. The proposed model outperforms reference methods with a 12% improvement in accuracy, 22% higher precision, and an 8% better F1 score.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation enables fast and effective transfer of features learned from a bigger model to a smaller one. However, distillation objectives are susceptible to sub-population shifts, a common scenario in medical imaging analysis which refers to groups/domains of data that are underrepresented in the training set. For instance, training models on health data acquired from multiple scanners or hospitals can yield subpar performance for minority groups. In this paper, inspired by distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques, we address this shortcoming by proposing a group-aware distillation loss. During optimization, a set of weights is updated based on the per-group losses at a given iteration. This way, our method can dynamically focus on groups that have low performance during training. We empirically validate our method, GroupDistil on two benchmark datasets (natural images and cardiac MRIs) and show consistent improvement in terms of worst-group accuracy.

- **Summary**: The spatial and quantitative parameters of macular holes are vital for diagnosis, surgical choices, and post-op monitoring. Macular hole diagnosis and treatment rely heavily on spatial and quantitative data, yet the scarcity of such data has impeded the progress of deep learning techniques for effective segmentation and real-time 3D reconstruction. To address this challenge, we assembled the world's largest macular hole dataset, Retinal OCTfor Macular Hole Enhancement (ROME-3914), and a Comprehensive Archive for Retinal Segmentation (CARS-30k), both expertly annotated. In addition, we developed an innovative 3D segmentation network, the Dual-Encoder FuGH Network (DEFN), which integrates three innovative modules: Fourier Group Harmonics (FuGH), Simplified 3D Spatial Attention (S3DSA) and Harmonic Squeeze-and-Excitation Module (HSE). These three modules synergistically filter noise, reduce computational complexity, emphasize detailed features, and enhance the network's representation ability. We also proposed a novel data augmentation method, Stochastic Retinal Defect Injection (SRDI), and a network optimization strategy DynamicWeightCompose (DWC), to further improve the performance of DEFN. Compared with 13 baselines, our DEFN shows the best performance. We also offer precise 3D retinal reconstruction and quantitative metrics, bringing revolutionary diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making tools for ophthalmologists, and is expected to completely reshape the diagnosis and treatment patterns of difficult-to-treat macular degeneration.

- **Summary**: While deep neural networks have shown impressive results in automatic speaker recognition and related tasks, it is dissatisfactory how little is understood about what exactly is responsible for these results. Part of the success has been attributed in prior work to their capability to model supra-segmental temporal information (SST), i.e., learn rhythmic-prosodic characteristics of speech in addition to spectral features. In this paper, we (i) present and apply a novel test to quantify to what extent the performance of state-of-the-art neural networks for speaker recognition can be explained by modeling SST; and (ii) present several means to force respective nets to focus more on SST and evaluate their merits. We find that a variety of CNN- and RNN-based neural network architectures for speaker recognition do not model SST to any sufficient degree, even when forced. The results provide a highly relevant basis for impactful future research into better exploitation of the full speech signal and give insights into the inner workings of such networks, enhancing explainability of deep learning for speech technologies.

- **Summary**: Data attribution seeks to trace model outputs back to training data. With the recent development of diffusion models, data attribution has become a desired module to properly assign valuations for high-quality or copyrighted training samples, ensuring that data contributors are fairly compensated or credited. Several theoretically motivated methods have been proposed to implement data attribution, in an effort to improve the trade-off between computational scalability and effectiveness. In this work, we conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on attributing diffusion models, specifically focusing on DDPMs trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, as well as a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on ArtBench. Intriguingly, we report counter-intuitive observations that theoretically unjustified design choices for attribution empirically outperform previous baselines by a large margin, in terms of both linear datamodeling score and counterfactual evaluation. Our work presents a significantly more efficient approach for attributing diffusion models, while the unexpected findings suggest that at least in non-convex settings, constructions guided by theoretical assumptions may lead to inferior attribution performance.

- **Summary**: Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality in the contemporary world. Its association with smoking, elevated blood pressure, and cholesterol levels underscores the significance of these risk factors. This study addresses the challenge of predicting myocardial illness, a formidable task in medical research. Accurate predictions are pivotal for refining healthcare strategies. This investigation conducts a comparative analysis of six distinct machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Bagging, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The attained outcomes exhibit promise, with accuracy rates as follows: Logistic Regression (81.00%), Support Vector Machine (75.01%), XGBoost (92.72%), LightGBM (90.60%), Decision Tree (82.30%), and Bagging (83.01%). Notably, XGBoost emerges as the top-performing model. These findings underscore its potential to enhance predictive precision for coronary infarction. As the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors persists, incorporating advanced machine learning techniques holds the potential to refine proactive medical interventions.

- **Summary**: Continual learning (CL) methods designed for natural image classification often fail to reach basic quality standards for medical image segmentation. Atlas-based segmentation, a well-established approach in medical imaging, incorporates domain knowledge on the region of interest, leading to semantically coherent predictions. This is especially promising for CL, as it allows us to leverage structural information and strike an optimal balance between model rigidity and plasticity over time. When combined with privacy-preserving prototypes, this process offers the advantages of rehearsal-based CL without compromising patient privacy. We propose Atlas Replay, an atlas-based segmentation approach that uses prototypes to generate high-quality segmentation masks through image registration that maintain consistency even as the training distribution changes. We explore how our proposed method performs compared to state-of-the-art CL methods in terms of knowledge transferability across seven publicly available prostate segmentation datasets. Prostate segmentation plays a vital role in diagnosing prostate cancer, however, it poses challenges due to substantial anatomical variations, benign structural differences in older age groups, and fluctuating acquisition parameters. Our results show that Atlas Replay is both robust and generalizes well to yet-unseen domains while being able to maintain knowledge, unlike end-to-end segmentation methods. Our code base is available under https://github.com/MECLabTUDA/Atlas-Replay.

The advent of modern intelligent systems has led to notable progress in various domains. Consequently, we embarked on an investigation of intelligent monitoring systems as a means of tackling the issue of the reproducibility crisis. Specifically, we first curate a comprehensive multimodal dataset, named ProBio, as an initial step towards this objective. This dataset comprises fine-grained hierarchical annotations intended for the purpose of studying activity understanding in BioLab. Next, we devise two challenging benchmarks, transparent solution tracking and multimodal action recognition, to emphasize the unique characteristics and difficulties associated with activity understanding in BioLab settings. Finally, we provide a thorough experimental evaluation of contemporary video understanding models and highlight their limitations in this specialized domain to identify potential avenues for future research. We hope ProBio with associated benchmarks may garner increased focus on modern AI techniques in the realm of molecular biology.

- **Summary**: In contrastive self-supervised learning, positive samples are typically drawn from the same image but in different augmented views, resulting in a relatively limited source of positive samples. An effective way to alleviate this problem is to incorporate the relationship between samples, which involves including the top-k nearest neighbors of positive samples in the framework. However, the problem of false neighbors (i.e., neighbors that do not belong to the same category as the positive sample) is an objective but often overlooked challenge due to the query of neighbor samples without human supervision. In this paper, we present a simple Self-supervised learning framework called Mixed Nearest-Neighbors for Self-Supervised Learning (MNN). MNN optimizes the influence of neighbor samples on the semantics of positive samples through an intuitive weighting approach and image mixture operations. The results of our study demonstrate that MNN exhibits exceptional generalization performance and training efficiency on four benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Intensive Care Units (ICU) provide close supervision and continuous care to patients with life-threatening conditions. However, continuous patient assessment in the ICU is still limited due to time constraints and the workload on healthcare providers. Existing patient assessments in the ICU such as pain or mobility assessment are mostly sporadic and administered manually, thus introducing the potential for human errors. Developing Artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can augment human assessments in the ICU can be beneficial for providing more objective and granular monitoring capabilities. For example, capturing the variations in a patient's facial cues related to pain or agitation can help in adjusting pain-related medications or detecting agitation-inducing conditions such as delirium. Additionally, subtle changes in visual cues during or prior to adverse clinical events could potentially aid in continuous patient monitoring when combined with high-resolution physiological signals and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. In this paper, we examined the association between visual cues and patient condition including acuity status, acute brain dysfunction, and pain. We leveraged our AU-ICU dataset with 107,064 frames collected in the ICU annotated with facial action units (AUs) labels by trained annotators. We developed a new "masked loss computation" technique that addresses the data imbalance problem by maximizing data resource utilization. We trained the model using our AU-ICU dataset in conjunction with three external datasets to detect 18 AUs. The SWIN Transformer model achieved 0.57 mean F1-score and 0.89 mean accuracy on the test set. Additionally, we performed AU inference on 634,054 frames to evaluate the association between facial AUs and clinically important patient conditions such as acuity status, acute brain dysfunction, and pain.

- **Summary**: A vital and rapidly growing application, remote sensing offers vast yet sparsely labeled, spatially aligned multimodal data; this makes self-supervised learning algorithms invaluable. We present CROMA: a framework that combines contrastive and reconstruction self-supervised objectives to learn rich unimodal and multimodal representations. Our method separately encodes masked-out multispectral optical and synthetic aperture radar samples -- aligned in space and time -- and performs cross-modal contrastive learning. Another encoder fuses these sensors, producing joint multimodal encodings that are used to predict the masked patches via a lightweight decoder. We show that these objectives are complementary when leveraged on spatially aligned multimodal data. We also introduce X- and 2D-ALiBi, which spatially biases our cross- and self-attention matrices. These strategies improve representations and allow our models to effectively extrapolate to images up to 17.6x larger at test-time. CROMA outperforms the current SoTA multispectral model, evaluated on: four classification benchmarks -- finetuning (avg. 1.8%), linear (avg. 2.4%) and nonlinear (avg. 1.4%) probing, kNN classification (avg. 3.5%), and K-means clustering (avg. 8.4%); and three segmentation benchmarks (avg. 6.4%). CROMA's rich, optionally multimodal representations can be widely leveraged across remote sensing applications.

- **Summary**: Objectives To develop and validate a deep learning-based diagnostic model incorporating uncertainty estimation so as to facilitate radiologists in the preoperative differentiation of the pathological subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on CT images. Methods Data from 668 consecutive patients, pathologically proven RCC, were retrospectively collected from Center 1. By using five-fold cross-validation, a deep learning model incorporating uncertainty estimation was developed to classify RCC subtypes into clear cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), and chromophobe RCC (chRCC). An external validation set of 78 patients from Center 2 further evaluated the model's performance. Results In the five-fold cross-validation, the model's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the classification of ccRCC, pRCC, and chRCC was 0.868 (95% CI: 0.826-0.923), 0.846 (95% CI: 0.812-0.886), and 0.839 (95% CI: 0.802-0.88), respectively. In the external validation set, the AUCs were 0.856 (95% CI: 0.838-0.882), 0.787 (95% CI: 0.757-0.818), and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.758-0.831) for ccRCC, pRCC, and chRCC, respectively. Conclusions The developed deep learning model demonstrated robust performance in predicting the pathological subtypes of RCC, while the incorporated uncertainty emphasized the importance of understanding model confidence, which is crucial for assisting clinical decision-making for patients with renal tumors. Clinical relevance statement Our deep learning approach, integrated with uncertainty estimation, offers clinicians a dual advantage: accurate RCC subtype predictions complemented by diagnostic confidence references, promoting informed decision-making for patients with RCC.

- **Summary**: LLaVA-Interactive is a research prototype for multimodal human-AI interaction. The system can have multi-turn dialogues with human users by taking multimodal user inputs and generating multimodal responses. Importantly, LLaVA-Interactive goes beyond language prompt, where visual prompt is enabled to align human intents in the interaction. The development of LLaVA-Interactive is extremely cost-efficient as the system combines three multimodal skills of pre-built AI models without additional model training: visual chat of LLaVA, image segmentation from SEEM, as well as image generation and editing from GLIGEN. A diverse set of application scenarios is presented to demonstrate the promises of LLaVA-Interactive and to inspire future research in multimodal interactive systems.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of improving the efficiency of segmentation transformers by using disparate amounts of computation for different parts of the image. Our method, PAUMER, accomplishes this by pausing computation for patches that are deemed to not need any more computation before the final decoder. We use the entropy of predictions computed from intermediate activations as the pausing criterion, and find this aligns well with semantics of the image. Our method has a unique advantage that a single network trained with the proposed strategy can be effortlessly adapted at inference to various run-time requirements by modulating its pausing parameters. On two standard segmentation datasets, Cityscapes and ADE20K, we show that our method operates with about a $50\%$ higher throughput with an mIoU drop of about $0.65\%$ and $4.6\%$ respectively.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (Re-ID) technology plays an increasingly crucial role in intelligent surveillance systems. Widespread occlusion significantly impacts the performance of person Re-ID. Occluded person Re-ID refers to a pedestrian matching method that deals with challenges such as pedestrian information loss, noise interference, and perspective misalignment. It has garnered extensive attention from researchers. Over the past few years, several occlusion-solving person Re-ID methods have been proposed, tackling various sub-problems arising from occlusion. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that compare, summarize, and evaluate the potential of occluded person Re-ID methods in detail. In this review, we start by providing a detailed overview of the datasets and evaluation scheme used for occluded person Re-ID. Next, we scientifically classify and analyze existing deep learning-based occluded person Re-ID methods from various perspectives, summarizing them concisely. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic comparison among these methods, identify the state-of-the-art approaches, and present an outlook on the future development of occluded person Re-ID.

- **Summary**: We demonstrate text as a strong cross-modal interface. Rather than relying on deep embeddings to connect image and language as the interface representation, our approach represents an image as text, from which we enjoy the interpretability and flexibility inherent to natural language. We employ an autoencoder that uses a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for decoding. The encoder is trained to transform an input image into text, which is then fed into the fixed text-to-image diffusion decoder to reconstruct the original input -- a process we term De-Diffusion. Experiments validate both the precision and comprehensiveness of De-Diffusion text representing images, such that it can be readily ingested by off-the-shelf text-to-image tools and LLMs for diverse multi-modal tasks. For example, a single De-Diffusion model can generalize to provide transferable prompts for different text-to-image tools, and also achieves a new state of the art on open-ended vision-language tasks by simply prompting large language models with few-shot examples.

- **Summary**: Rain generation algorithms have the potential to improve the generalization of deraining methods and scene understanding in rainy conditions. However, in practice, they produce artifacts and distortions and struggle to control the amount of rain generated due to a lack of proper constraints. In this paper, we propose an unpaired image-to-image translation framework for generating realistic rainy images. We first introduce a Triangular Probability Similarity (TPS) constraint to guide the generated images toward clear and rainy images in the discriminator manifold, thereby minimizing artifacts and distortions during rain generation. Unlike conventional contrastive learning approaches, which indiscriminately push negative samples away from the anchors, we propose a Semantic Noise Contrastive Estimation (SeNCE) strategy and reassess the pushing force of negative samples based on the semantic similarity between the clear and the rainy images and the feature similarity between the anchor and the negative samples. Experiments demonstrate realistic rain generation with minimal artifacts and distortions, which benefits image deraining and object detection in rain. Furthermore, the method can be used to generate realistic snowy and night images, underscoring its potential for broader applicability.

- **Summary**: Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods aim at learning an embedding space in which distances are closely related to the inherent semantic similarity of the inputs. Previous studies have shown that popular benchmark datasets often contain numerous wrong labels, and DML methods are susceptible to them. Intending to study the effect of realistic noise, we create an ontology of the classes in a dataset and use it to simulate semantically coherent labeling mistakes. To train robust DML models, we propose ProcSim, a simple framework that assigns a confidence score to each sample using the normalized distance to its class representative. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DML benchmark datasets injected with uniform and the proposed semantically coherent noise.

- **Summary**: The understanding of visual analytics process can benefit visualization researchers from multiple aspects, including improving visual designs and developing advanced interaction functions. However, the log files of user behaviors are still hard to analyze due to the complexity of sensemaking and our lack of knowledge on the related user behaviors. This work presents a study on a comprehensive data collection of user behaviors, and our analysis approach with time-series classification methods. We have chosen a classical visualization application, Covid-19 data analysis, with common analysis tasks covering geo-spatial, time-series and multi-attributes. Our user study collects user behaviors on a diverse set of visualization tasks with two comparable systems, desktop and immersive visualizations. We summarize the classification results with three time-series machine learning algorithms at two scales, and explore the influences of behavior features. Our results reveal that user behaviors can be distinguished during the process of visual analytics and there is a potentially strong association between the physical behaviors of users and the visualization tasks they perform. We also demonstrate the usage of our models by interpreting open sessions of visual analytics, which provides an automatic way to study sensemaking without tedious manual annotations.

- **Summary**: The human visual system can effortlessly recognize an object under different extrinsic factors such as lighting, object poses, and background, yet current computer vision systems often struggle with these variations. An important step to understanding and improving artificial vision systems is to measure image similarity purely based on intrinsic object properties that define object identity. This problem has been studied in the computer vision literature as re-identification, though mostly restricted to specific object categories such as people and cars. We propose to extend it to general object categories, exploring an image similarity metric based on object intrinsics. To benchmark such measurements, we collect the Common paired objects Under differenT Extrinsics (CUTE) dataset of $18,000$ images of $180$ objects under different extrinsic factors such as lighting, poses, and imaging conditions. While existing methods such as LPIPS and CLIP scores do not measure object intrinsics well, we find that combining deep features learned from contrastive self-supervised learning with foreground filtering is a simple yet effective approach to approximating the similarity. We conduct an extensive survey of pre-trained features and foreground extraction methods to arrive at a strong baseline that best measures intrinsic object-centric image similarity among current methods. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can aid in downstream applications such as acting as an analog for human subjects and improving generalizable re-identification.

- **Summary**: There have been recent advances in computer-based recognition of isolated, citation-form signs from video. There are many challenges for such a task, not least the naturally occurring inter- and intra- signer synchronic variation in sign production, including sociolinguistic variation in the realization of certain signs. However, there are several significant factors that make recognition of signs from continuous signing an even more difficult problem. This article presents an overview of such challenges, based in part on findings from a large corpus of linguistically annotated video data for American Sign Language (ASL). Some linguistic regularities in the structure of signs that can boost handshape and sign recognition are also discussed.

- **Summary**: In forest industry, mechanical site preparation by mounding is widely used prior to planting operations. One of the main problems when planning planting operations is the difficulty in estimating the number of mounds present on a planting block, as their number may greatly vary depending on site characteristics. This estimation is often carried out through field surveys by several forestry workers. However, this procedure is prone to error and slowness. Motivated by recent advances in UAV imagery and artificial intelligence, we propose a fully automated framework to estimate the number of mounds on a planting block. Using computer vision and machine learning, we formulate the counting task as a supervised learning problem using two prediction models. A local detection model is firstly used to detect visible mounds based on deep features, while a global prediction function is subsequently applied to provide a final estimation based on block-level features. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed a challenging UAV dataset representing several plantation blocks with different characteristics. The performed experiments demonstrated the robustness of the proposed method, which outperforms manual methods in precision, while significantly reducing time and cost.

- **Summary**: A defining characteristic of natural vision is its ability to withstand a variety of input alterations, resulting in the creation of an invariant representation of the surroundings. While convolutional neural networks exhibit resilience to certain forms of spatial input variation, modifications in the spatial and temporal aspects can significantly affect the representations of video content in deep neural networks. Inspired by the resilience of natural vision to input variations, we employ a simple multi-stream model to explore its potential to address spatiotemporal changes by including temporal features. Our primary goal is to introduce a video-trained model and evaluate its robustness to diverse image and video inputs, with a particular focus on exploring the role of temporal features in invariant recognition. Results show that including videos and the temporal stream during training mitigates the decline in accuracy and mAP in image and video understanding tasks by 1.36% and 3.14%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Visual question answering (VQA) models are designed to demonstrate visual-textual reasoning capabilities. However, their real-world applicability is hindered by a lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets. Existing domain generalization datasets for VQA exhibit a unilateral focus on textual shifts while VQA being a multi-modal task contains shifts across both visual and textual domains. We propose VQA-GEN, the first ever multi-modal benchmark dataset for distribution shift generated through a shift induced pipeline. Experiments demonstrate VQA-GEN dataset exposes the vulnerability of existing methods to joint multi-modal distribution shifts. validating that comprehensive multi-modal shifts are critical for robust VQA generalization. Models trained on VQA-GEN exhibit improved cross-domain and in-domain performance, confirming the value of VQA-GEN. Further, we analyze the importance of each shift technique of our pipeline contributing to the generalization of the model.

- **Summary**: The massive proliferation of social media data represents a transformative moment in conflict studies. This data can provide unique insights into the spread and use of weaponry, but the scale and types of data are problematic for traditional open-source intelligence. This paper presents preliminary, transdisciplinary work using computer vision to identify specific weapon systems and the insignias of the armed groups using them. There is potential to not only track how weapons are distributed through networks of armed units but also to track which types of weapons are being used by the different types of state and non-state military actors in Ukraine. Such a system could ultimately be used to understand conflicts in real-time, including where humanitarian and medical aid is most needed. We believe that using AI to help automate such processes should be a high-priority goal for our community, with near-term real-world payoffs.

- **Summary**: In this paper we introduce SemiGPC, a distribution-aware label refinement strategy based on Gaussian Processes where the predictions of the model are derived from the labels posterior distribution. Differently from other buffer-based semi-supervised methods such as CoMatch and SimMatch, our SemiGPC includes a normalization term that addresses imbalances in the global data distribution while maintaining local sensitivity. This explicit control allows SemiGPC to be more robust to confirmation bias especially under class imbalance. We show that SemiGPC improves performance when paired with different Semi-Supervised methods such as FixMatch, ReMixMatch, SimMatch and FreeMatch and different pre-training strategies including MSN and Dino. We also show that SemiGPC achieves state of the art results under different degrees of class imbalance on standard CIFAR10-LT/CIFAR100-LT especially in the low data-regime. Using SemiGPC also results in about 2% avg.accuracy increase compared to a new competitive baseline on the more challenging benchmarks SemiAves, SemiCUB, SemiFungi and Semi-iNat.

- **Summary**: We present a model-based feature extractor to describe neighborhoods around keypoints by finite expansion, estimating the spatially varying orientation by harmonic functions. The iso-curves of such functions are highly symmetric w.r.t. the origin (a keypoint) and the estimated parameters have well defined geometric interpretations. The origin is also a unique singularity of all harmonic functions, helping to determine the location of a keypoint precisely, whereas the functions describe the object shape of the neighborhood. This is novel and complementary to traditional texture features which describe texture-shape properties i.e. they are purposively invariant to translation (within a texture). We report on experiments of verification and identification of keypoints in forensic fingerprints by using publicly available data (NIST SD27) and discuss the results in comparison to other studies. These support our conclusions that the novel features can equip single cores or single minutia with a significant verification power at 19% EER, and an identification power of 24-78% for ranks of 1-20. Additionally, we report verification results of periocular biometrics using near-infrared images, reaching an EER performance of 13%, which is comparable to the state of the art. More importantly, fusion of two systems, our and texture features (Gabor), result in a measurable performance improvement. We report reduction of the EER to 9%, supporting the view that the novel features capture relevant visual information, which traditional texture features do not.

- **Summary**: Computed Tomography (CT) with its remarkable capability for three-dimensional imaging from multiple projections, enjoys a broad range of applications in clinical diagnosis, scientific observation, and industrial detection. Neural Adaptive Tomography (NeAT) is a recently proposed 3D rendering method based on neural radiance field for CT, and it demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional methods. However, it still faces challenges when dealing with the substantial perturbations and pose shifts encountered in CT scanning processes. Here, we propose a neural rendering method for CT reconstruction, named Iterative Neural Adaptive Tomography (INeAT), which incorporates iterative posture optimization to effectively counteract the influence of posture perturbations in data, particularly in cases involving significant posture variations. Through the implementation of a posture feedback optimization strategy, INeAT iteratively refines the posture corresponding to the input images based on the reconstructed 3D volume. We demonstrate that INeAT achieves artifact-suppressed and resolution-enhanced reconstruction in scenarios with significant pose disturbances. Furthermore, we show that our INeAT maintains comparable reconstruction performance to stable-state acquisitions even using data from unstable-state acquisitions, which significantly reduces the time required for CT scanning and relaxes the stringent requirements on imaging hardware systems, underscoring its immense potential for applications in short-time and low-cost CT technology.

- **Summary**: Often machine learning models tend to automatically learn associations present in the training data without questioning their validity or appropriateness. This undesirable property is the root cause of the manifestation of spurious correlations, which render models unreliable and prone to failure in the presence of distribution shifts. Research shows that most methods attempting to remedy spurious correlations are only effective for a model's known spurious associations. Current spurious correlation detection algorithms either rely on extensive human annotations or are too restrictive in their formulation. Moreover, they rely on strict definitions of visual artifacts that may not apply to data produced by generative models, as they are known to hallucinate contents that do not conform to standard specifications. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose method that efficiently detects potential spurious correlations, and requires significantly less human interference in comparison to the prior art. Additionally, the proposed method provides intuitive explanations while eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations. We demonstrate the proposed method's tolerance to the peculiarity of AI-generated images, which is a considerably challenging task, one where most of the existing methods fall short. Consequently, our method is also suitable for detecting spurious correlations that may propagate to downstream applications originating from generative models.

- **Summary**: Since their introduction in 2020, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have taken the computer vision community by storm. They provide a multi-view representation of a scene or object that is ideal for eXtended Reality (XR) applications and for creative endeavors such as virtual production, as well as change detection operations in geospatial analytics. The computational cost of these generative AI models is quite high, however, and the construction of cloud pipelines to generate NeRFs is neccesary to realize their potential in client applications. In this paper, we present pipelines on a high performance academic computing cluster and compare it with a pipeline implemented on Microsoft Azure. Along the way, we describe some uses of NeRFs in enabling novel user interaction scenarios.

- **Summary**: We explore how to capture the significance of a sub-text block in an article and how it may be used for text mining tasks. A sub-text block is a sub-sequence of sentences in the article. We formulate the notion of content significance distribution (CSD) of sub-text blocks, referred to as CSD of the first kind and denoted by CSD-1. In particular, we leverage Hugging Face's SentenceTransformer to generate contextual sentence embeddings, and use MoverScore over text embeddings to measure how similar a sub-text block is to the entire text. To overcome the exponential blowup on the number of sub-text blocks, we present an approximation algorithm and show that the approximated CSD-1 is almost identical to the exact CSD-1. Under this approximation, we show that the average and median CSD-1's for news, scholarly research, argument, and narrative articles share the same pattern. We also show that under a certain linear transformation, the complement of the cumulative distribution function of the beta distribution with certain values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ resembles a CSD-1 curve. We then use CSD-1's to extract linguistic features to train an SVC classifier for assessing how well an article is organized. Through experiments, we show that this method achieves high accuracy for assessing student essays. Moreover, we study CSD of sentence locations, referred to as CSD of the second kind and denoted by CSD-2, and show that average CSD-2's for different types of articles possess distinctive patterns, which either conform common perceptions of article structures or provide rectification with minor deviation.

- **Summary**: Assessing the environmental impact of the mineral extraction industry plays a critical role in understanding and mitigating the ecological consequences of extractive activities. This paper presents MineSegSAT, a model that presents a novel approach to predicting environmentally impacted areas of mineral extraction sites using the SegFormer deep learning segmentation architecture trained on Sentinel-2 data. The data was collected from non-overlapping regions over Western Canada in 2021 containing areas of land that have been environmentally impacted by mining activities that were identified from high-resolution satellite imagery in 2021. The SegFormer architecture, a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation framework, is employed to leverage its advanced spatial understanding capabilities for accurate land cover classification. We investigate the efficacy of loss functions including Dice, Tversky, and Lovasz loss respectively. The trained model was utilized for inference over the test region in the ensuing year to identify potential areas of expansion or contraction over these same periods. The Sentinel-2 data is made available on Amazon Web Services through a collaboration with Earth Daily Analytics which provides corrected and tiled analytics-ready data on the AWS platform. The model and ongoing API to access the data on AWS allow the creation of an automated tool to monitor the extent of disturbed areas surrounding known mining sites to ensure compliance with their environmental impact goals.

- **Summary**: Cooperatively utilizing both ego-vehicle and infrastructure sensor data can significantly enhance autonomous driving perception abilities. However, the uncertain temporal asynchrony and limited communication conditions can lead to fusion misalignment and constrain the exploitation of infrastructure data. To address these issues in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection, we propose the Feature Flow Net (FFNet), a novel cooperative detection framework. FFNet is a flow-based feature fusion framework that uses a feature flow prediction module to predict future features and compensate for asynchrony. Instead of transmitting feature maps extracted from still-images, FFNet transmits feature flow, leveraging the temporal coherence of sequential infrastructure frames. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised training approach that enables FFNet to generate feature flow with feature prediction ability from raw infrastructure sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing cooperative detection methods while only requiring about 1/100 of the transmission cost of raw data and covers all latency in one model on the DAIR-V2X dataset.

- **Summary**: Encoding only the task-related information from the raw data, \ie, disentangled representation learning, can greatly contribute to the robustness and generalizability of models. Although significant advances have been made by regularizing the information in representations with information theory, two major challenges remain: 1) the representation compression inevitably leads to performance drop; 2) the disentanglement constraints on representations are in complicated optimization. To these issues, we introduce Bayesian networks with transmitted information to formulate the interaction among input and representations during disentanglement. Building upon this framework, we propose \textbf{DisTIB} (\textbf{T}ransmitted \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck for \textbf{Dis}entangled representation learning), a novel objective that navigates the balance between information compression and preservation. We employ variational inference to derive a tractable estimation for DisTIB. This estimation can be simply optimized via standard gradient descent with a reparameterization trick. Moreover, we theoretically prove that DisTIB can achieve optimal disentanglement, underscoring its superior efficacy. To solidify our claims, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks to demonstrate the appealing efficacy of DisTIB and validate our theoretical analyses.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are demonstrated to be vulnerable to universal perturbation, a single quasi-perceptible perturbation that can deceive the DNN on most images. However, the previous works are focused on using universal perturbation to perform adversarial attacks, while the potential usability of universal perturbation as data carriers in data hiding is less explored, especially for the key-controlled data hiding method. In this paper, we propose a novel universal perturbation-based secret key-controlled data-hiding method, realizing data hiding with a single universal perturbation and data decoding with the secret key-controlled decoder. Specifically, we optimize a single universal perturbation, which serves as a data carrier that can hide multiple secret images and be added to most cover images. Then, we devise a secret key-controlled decoder to extract different secret images from the single container image constructed by the universal perturbation by using different secret keys. Moreover, a suppress loss function is proposed to prevent the secret image from leakage. Furthermore, we adopt a robust module to boost the decoder's capability against corruption. Finally, A co-joint optimization strategy is proposed to find the optimal universal perturbation and decoder. Extensive experiments are conducted on different datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, the physical test performed on platforms (e.g., WeChat and Twitter) verifies the usability of the proposed method in practice.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL) has shown remarkable success in various medical imaging data analysis applications. However, it remains challenging for DL models to achieve good generalization, especially when the training and testing datasets are collected at sites with different scanners, due to domain shift caused by differences in data distributions. Domain adaptation has emerged as an effective means to address this challenge by mitigating domain gaps in medical imaging applications. In this review, we specifically focus on domain adaptation approaches for DL-based medical image segmentation. We first present the motivation and background knowledge underlying domain adaptations, then provide a comprehensive review of domain adaptation applications in medical image segmentations, and finally discuss the challenges, limitations, and future research trends in the field to promote the methodology development of domain adaptation in the context of medical image segmentation. Our goal was to provide researchers with up-to-date references on the applications of domain adaptation in medical image segmentation studies.

- **Summary**: The escalating risk of collisions and the accumulation of space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) has reached critical concern due to the ever increasing number of spacecraft. Addressing this crisis, especially in dealing with non-cooperative and unidentified space debris, is of paramount importance. This paper contributes to efforts in enabling autonomous swarms of small chaser satellites for target geometry determination and safe flight trajectory planning for proximity operations in LEO. Our research explores on-orbit use of the You Only Look Once v5 (YOLOv5) object detection model trained to detect satellite components. While this model has shown promise, its inherent lack of interpretability hinders human understanding, a critical aspect of validating algorithms for use in safety-critical missions. To analyze the decision processes, we introduce Probabilistic Explanations for Entropic Knowledge extraction (PEEK), a method that utilizes information theoretic analysis of the latent representations within the hidden layers of the model. Through both synthetic in hardware-in-the-loop experiments, PEEK illuminates the decision-making processes of the model, helping identify its strengths, limitations and biases.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper presents a new text-guided technique for generating 3D shapes. The technique leverages a hybrid 3D shape representation, namely EXIM, combining the strengths of explicit and implicit representations. Specifically, the explicit stage controls the topology of the generated 3D shapes and enables local modifications, whereas the implicit stage refines the shape and paints it with plausible colors. Also, the hybrid approach separates the shape and color and generates color conditioned on shape to ensure shape-color consistency. Unlike the existing state-of-the-art methods, we achieve high-fidelity shape generation from natural-language descriptions without the need for time-consuming per-shape optimization or reliance on human-annotated texts during training or test-time optimization. Further, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to generate indoor scenes with consistent styles using text-induced 3D shapes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the compelling quality of our results and the high coherency of our generated shapes with the input texts, surpassing the performance of existing methods by a significant margin. Codes and models are released at https://github.com/liuzhengzhe/EXIM.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: While fine-tuning unlocks the potential of a pre-trained model for a specific task, it compromises the model's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To mitigate this, robust fine-tuning aims to ensure performance on OOD datasets as well as on an in-distribution (ID) dataset for which the model is being tuned. However, another criterion for reliable machine learning (ML), confidence calibration, has been overlooked despite its increasing demand for real-world high-stakes ML applications (e.g., autonomous driving and medical diagnosis). For the first time, we raise concerns about the calibration of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) under distribution shift by showing that naive fine-tuning and even state-of-the-art robust fine-tuning methods hurt the calibration of pre-trained VLMs, especially on OOD datasets. To address this issue, we provide a simple approach, called calibrated robust fine-tuning (CaRot), that incentivizes calibration and robustness on both ID and OOD datasets. Empirical results on ImageNet-1K distribution shift evaluation verify the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a groundbreaking classification model called the Controllable Ensemble Transformer and CNN (CETC) for the analysis of medical images. The CETC model combines the powerful capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to effectively capture both local and global features present in medical images. The model architecture comprises three main components: a convolutional encoder block (CEB), a transposed-convolutional decoder block (TDB), and a transformer classification block (TCB). The CEB is responsible for capturing multi-local features at different scales and draws upon components from VGGNet, ResNet, and MobileNet as backbones. By leveraging this combination, the CEB is able to effectively detect and encode local features. The TDB, on the other hand, consists of sub-decoders that decode and sum the captured features using ensemble coefficients. This enables the model to efficiently integrate the information from multiple scales. Finally, the TCB utilizes the SwT backbone and a specially designed prediction head to capture global features, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the entire image. The paper provides detailed information on the experimental setup and implementation, including the use of transfer learning, data preprocessing techniques, and training settings. The CETC model is trained and evaluated using two publicly available COVID-19 datasets. Remarkably, the model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across various evaluation metrics. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the CETC model, emphasizing its potential for accurately and efficiently analyzing medical images.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for 3D open-world understanding, jointly with text, image, and point cloud. In this paper, we introduce MixCon3D, which combines the complementary information between 2D images and 3D point clouds to enhance contrastive learning. With the further integration of multi-view 2D images, MixCon3D enhances the traditional tri-modal representation by offering a more accurate and comprehensive depiction of real-world 3D objects and bolstering text alignment. Additionally, we pioneer the first thorough investigation of various training recipes for the 3D contrastive learning paradigm, building a solid baseline with improved performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative benchmarks reveal that our method renders significant improvement over the baseline, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art performance on the challenging 1,156-category Objaverse-LVIS dataset by 5.7%. We further showcase the effectiveness of our approach in more applications, including text-to-3D retrieval and point cloud captioning.

- **Summary**: In the context of the long-tail scenario, models exhibit a strong demand for high-quality data. Data-centric approaches aim to enhance both the quantity and quality of data to improve model performance. Among these approaches, information augmentation has been progressively introduced as a crucial category. It achieves a balance in model performance by augmenting the richness and quantity of samples in the tail classes. However, there is currently a lack of research into the underlying mechanisms explaining the effectiveness of information augmentation methods. Consequently, the utilization of information augmentation in long-tail recognition tasks relies heavily on empirical and intricate fine-tuning. This work makes two primary contributions. Firstly, we approach the problem from the perspectives of feature diversity and distribution shift, introducing the concept of Feature Diversity Gain (FDG) to elucidate why information augmentation is effective. We find that the performance of information augmentation can be explained by FDG, and its performance peaks when FDG achieves an appropriate balance. Experimental results demonstrate that by using FDG to select augmented data, we can further enhance model performance without the need for any modifications to the model's architecture. Thus, data-centric approaches hold significant potential in the field of long-tail recognition, beyond the development of new model structures. Furthermore, we systematically introduce the core components and fundamental tasks of a data-centric long-tail learning framework for the first time. These core components guide the implementation and deployment of the system, while the corresponding fundamental tasks refine and expand the research area.

- **Summary**: Scene graph generation (SGG) and human-object interaction (HOI) detection are two important visual tasks aiming at localising and recognising relationships between objects, and interactions between humans and objects, respectively.   Prevailing works treat these tasks as distinct tasks, leading to the development of task-specific models tailored to individual datasets. However, we posit that the presence of visual relationships can furnish crucial contextual and intricate relational cues that significantly augment the inference of human-object interactions. This motivates us to think if there is a natural intrinsic relationship between the two tasks, where scene graphs can serve as a source for inferring human-object interactions. In light of this, we introduce SG2HOI+, a unified one-step model based on the Transformer architecture. Our approach employs two interactive hierarchical Transformers to seamlessly unify the tasks of SGG and HOI detection. Concretely, we initiate a relation Transformer tasked with generating relation triples from a suite of visual features. Subsequently, we employ another transformer-based decoder to predict human-object interactions based on the generated relation triples. A comprehensive series of experiments conducted across established benchmark datasets including Visual Genome, V-COCO, and HICO-DET demonstrates the compelling performance of our SG2HOI+ model in comparison to prevalent one-stage SGG models. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art HOI methods. Additionally, we observe that our SG2HOI+ jointly trained on both SGG and HOI tasks in an end-to-end manner yields substantial improvements for both tasks compared to individualized training paradigms.

- **Summary**: Mis- and disinformation online have become a major societal problem as major sources of online harms of different kinds. One common form of mis- and disinformation is out-of-context (OOC) information, where different pieces of information are falsely associated, e.g., a real image combined with a false textual caption or a misleading textual description. Although some past studies have attempted to defend against OOC mis- and disinformation through external evidence, they tend to disregard the role of different pieces of evidence with different stances. Motivated by the intuition that the stance of evidence represents a bias towards different detection results, we propose a stance extraction network (SEN) that can extract the stances of different pieces of multi-modal evidence in a unified framework. Moreover, we introduce a support-refutation score calculated based on the co-occurrence relations of named entities into the textual SEN. Extensive experiments on a public large-scale dataset demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines, with the best model achieving a performance gain of 3.2% in accuracy.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised pose estimation is a practically challenging task for computer vision. Although numerous excellent semi-supervised classification methods have emerged, these methods typically use confidence to evaluate the quality of pseudo-labels, which is difficult to achieve in pose estimation tasks. For example, in pose estimation, confidence represents only the possibility that a position of the heatmap is a keypoint, not the quality of that prediction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient framework to estimate the quality of pseudo-labels in semi-supervised pose estimation tasks from the perspective of modeling the uncertainty of the pseudo-labels. Concretely, under the dual mean-teacher framework, we construct the two maximum discrepant students (MDSs) to effectively push two teachers to generate different decision boundaries for the same sample. Moreover, we create multiple uncertainties to assess the quality of the pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the performance of semi-supervised pose estimation on three datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in implicit neural representations have achieved impressive results by sampling and fusing individual points along sampling rays in the sampling space. However, due to the explosively growing sampling space, finely representing and synthesizing detailed textures remains a challenge for unbounded large-scale outdoor scenes. To alleviate the dilemma of using individual points to perceive the entire colossal space, we explore learning the surface distribution of the scene to provide structural priors and reduce the samplable space and propose a Point Diffusion implicit Function, PDF, for large-scale scene neural representation. The core of our method is a large-scale point cloud super-resolution diffusion module that enhances the sparse point cloud reconstructed from several training images into a dense point cloud as an explicit prior. Then in the rendering stage, only sampling points with prior points within the sampling radius are retained. That is, the sampling space is reduced from the unbounded space to the scene surface. Meanwhile, to fill in the background of the scene that cannot be provided by point clouds, the region sampling based on Mip-NeRF 360 is employed to model the background representation. Expensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method for large-scale scene novel view synthesis, which outperforms relevant state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: The global challenge in chest radiograph X-ray (CXR) abnormalities often being misdiagnosed is primarily associated with perceptual errors, where healthcare providers struggle to accurately identify the location of abnormalities, rather than misclassification errors. We currently address this problem through disease-specific segmentation models. Unfortunately, these models cannot be released in the field due to their lack of generalizability across all thoracic diseases. A binary model tends to perform poorly when it encounters a disease that isn't represented in the dataset. We present CheX-nomaly: a binary localization U-net model that leverages transfer learning techniques with the incorporation of an innovative contrastive learning approach. Trained on the VinDr-CXR dataset, which encompasses 14 distinct diseases in addition to 'no finding' cases, my model achieves generalizability across these 14 diseases and others it has not seen before. We show that we can significantly improve the generalizability of an abnormality localization model by incorporating a contrastive learning method and dissociating the bounding boxes with its disease class. We also introduce a new loss technique to apply to enhance the U-nets performance on bounding box segmentation. By introducing CheX-nomaly, we offer a promising solution to enhance the precision of chest disease diagnosis, with a specific focus on reducing the significant number of perceptual errors in healthcare.



### Generating Unbiased Pseudo-labels via a Theoretically Guaranteed Chebyshev Constraint to Unify Semi-supervised Classification and Regression

- **Summary**: Both semi-supervised classification and regression are practically challenging tasks for computer vision. However, semi-supervised classification methods are barely applied to regression tasks. Because the threshold-to-pseudo label process (T2L) in classification uses confidence to determine the quality of label. It is successful for classification tasks but inefficient for regression tasks. In nature, regression also requires unbiased methods to generate high-quality labels. On the other hand, T2L for classification often fails if the confidence is generated by a biased method. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a theoretically guaranteed constraint for generating unbiased labels based on Chebyshev's inequality, combining multiple predictions to generate superior quality labels from several inferior ones. In terms of high-quality labels, the unbiased method naturally avoids the drawback of T2L. Specially, we propose an Unbiased Pseudo-labels network (UBPL network) with multiple branches to combine multiple predictions as pseudo-labels, where a Feature Decorrelation loss (FD loss) is proposed based on Chebyshev constraint. In principle, our method can be used for both classification and regression and can be easily extended to any semi-supervised framework, e.g. Mean Teacher, FixMatch, DualPose. Our approach achieves superior performance over SOTAs on the pose estimation datasets Mouse, FLIC and LSP, as well as the classification datasets CIFAR10/100 and SVHN.

- **Summary**: Manga, a form of Japanese comics and distinct visual storytelling, has captivated readers worldwide. Traditionally presented in black and white, manga's appeal lies in its ability to convey complex narratives and emotions through intricate line art and shading. Yet, the desire to experience manga in vibrant colors has sparked the pursuit of manga colorization, a task of paramount significance for artists. However, existing methods, originally designed for line art and sketches, face challenges when applied to manga. These methods often fall short in achieving the desired results, leading to the need for specialized manga-specific solutions. Existing approaches frequently rely on a single training step or extensive manual artist intervention, which can yield less satisfactory outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose a specialized framework for manga colorization. Leveraging established models for shading and vibrant coloring, our approach aligns both using a multi-encoder VAE. This structured workflow ensures clear and colorful results, with the option to incorporate reference images and manual hints.

- **Summary**: Generating high-quality and person-generic visual dubbing remains a challenge. Recent innovation has seen the advent of a two-stage paradigm, decoupling the rendering and lip synchronization process facilitated by intermediate representation as a conduit. Still, previous methodologies rely on rough landmarks or are confined to a single speaker, thus limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose DiffDub: Diffusion-based dubbing. We first craft the Diffusion auto-encoder by an inpainting renderer incorporating a mask to delineate editable zones and unaltered regions. This allows for seamless filling of the lower-face region while preserving the remaining parts. Throughout our experiments, we encountered several challenges. Primarily, the semantic encoder lacks robustness, constricting its ability to capture high-level features. Besides, the modeling ignored facial positioning, causing mouth or nose jitters across frames. To tackle these issues, we employ versatile strategies, including data augmentation and supplementary eye guidance. Moreover, we encapsulated a conformer-based reference encoder and motion generator fortified by a cross-attention mechanism. This enables our model to learn person-specific textures with varying references and reduces reliance on paired audio-visual data. Our rigorous experiments comprehensively highlight that our ground-breaking approach outpaces existing methods with considerable margins and delivers seamless, intelligible videos in person-generic and multilingual scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recently, open-domain text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made remarkable progress. However, the promising results are mainly shown by the qualitative cases of generated videos, while the quantitative evaluation of T2V models still faces two critical problems. Firstly, existing studies lack fine-grained evaluation of T2V models on different categories of text prompts. Although some benchmarks have categorized the prompts, their categorization either only focuses on a single aspect or fails to consider the temporal information in video generation. Secondly, it is unclear whether the automatic evaluation metrics are consistent with human standards. To address these problems, we propose FETV, a benchmark for Fine-grained Evaluation of Text-to-Video generation. FETV is multi-aspect, categorizing the prompts based on three orthogonal aspects: the major content, the attributes to control and the prompt complexity. FETV is also temporal-aware, which introduces several temporal categories tailored for video generation. Based on FETV, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of four representative T2V models, revealing their pros and cons on different categories of prompts from different aspects. We also extend FETV as a testbed to evaluate the reliability of automatic T2V metrics. The multi-aspect categorization of FETV enables fine-grained analysis of the metrics' reliability in different scenarios. We find that existing automatic metrics (e.g., CLIPScore and FVD) correlate poorly with human evaluation. To address this problem, we explore several solutions to improve CLIPScore and FVD, and develop two automatic metrics that exhibit significant higher correlation with humans than existing metrics.

- **Summary**: Current methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) significantly lack the capacity to quantify uncertainty in their predictions, particularly on the unseen space including the occluded and outside scene content. This limitation hinders their extensive applications in robotics, where the reliability of model predictions has to be considered for tasks such as robotic exploration and planning in unknown environments. To address this, we propose a novel approach to estimate a 3D Uncertainty Field based on the learned incomplete scene geometry, which explicitly identifies these unseen regions. By considering the accumulated transmittance along each camera ray, our Uncertainty Field infers 2D pixel-wise uncertainty, exhibiting high values for rays directly casting towards occluded or outside the scene content. To quantify the uncertainty on the learned surface, we model a stochastic radiance field. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is the only one that can explicitly reason about high uncertainty both on 3D unseen regions and its involved 2D rendered pixels, compared with recent methods. Furthermore, we illustrate that our designed uncertainty field is ideally suited for real-world robotics tasks, such as next-best-view selection.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles require accurate and robust localization and mapping algorithms to navigate safely and reliably in urban environments. We present a novel sensor fusion-based pipeline for offline mapping and online localization based on LiDAR sensors. The proposed approach leverages four LiDAR sensors. Mapping and localization algorithms are based on the KISS-ICP, enabling real-time performance and high accuracy. We introduce an approach to generate semantic maps for driving tasks such as path planning. The presented pipeline is integrated into the ROS 2 based Autoware software stack, providing a robust and flexible environment for autonomous driving applications. We show that our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for a given research vehicle and real-world autonomous driving application.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection deals with the recognition of abnormal events in videos. Apart from the visual signal, video anomaly detection has also been addressed with the use of skeleton sequences. We propose a holistic representation of skeleton trajectories to learn expected motions across segments at different times. Our approach uses multitask learning to reconstruct any continuous unobserved temporal segment of the trajectory allowing the extrapolation of past or future segments and the interpolation of in-between segments. We use an end-to-end attention-based encoder-decoder. We encode temporally occluded trajectories, jointly learn latent representations of the occluded segments, and reconstruct trajectories based on expected motions across different temporal segments. Extensive experiments on three trajectory-based video anomaly detection datasets show the advantages and effectiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art results on anomaly detection in skeleton trajectories.

- **Summary**: The rapid spread of COVID-19 and the emergence of new variants underscore the importance of effective screening measures. Rapid diagnosis and subsequent quarantine of infected individuals can prevent further spread of the virus in society. While PCR tests are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, they are costly and time-consuming. In contrast, urine test strips are an inexpensive, non-invasive, and rapidly obtainable screening method that can provide important information about a patient's health status. In this study, we collected a new dataset and used the RGB (Red Green Blue) color space of urine test strips parameters to detect the health status of individuals. To improve the accuracy of our model, we converted the RGB space to 10 additional color spaces. After evaluating four different machine learning models, we proposed a new ensemble model based on a multi-layer perceptron neural network. Although the initial results were not strong, we were able to improve the model's screening performance for COVID-19 by removing uncertain regions of the model space. Ultimately, our model achieved a screening accuracy of 80% based on urine parameters. Our results suggest that urine test strips can be a useful tool for COVID-19 screening, particularly in resource-constrained settings where PCR testing may not be feasible. Further research is needed to validate our findings and explore the potential role of urine test strips in COVID-19 diagnosis and management.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal image fusion (MMIF) integrates valuable information from different modality images into a fused one. However, the fusion of multiple visible images with different focal regions and infrared images is a unprecedented challenge in real MMIF applications. This is because of the limited depth of the focus of visible optical lenses, which impedes the simultaneous capture of the focal information within the same scene. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a MMIF framework for joint focused integration and modalities information extraction. Specifically, a semi-sparsity-based smoothing filter is introduced to decompose the images into structure and texture components. Subsequently, a novel multi-scale operator is proposed to fuse the texture components, capable of detecting significant information by considering the pixel focus attributes and relevant data from various modal images. Additionally, to achieve an effective capture of scene luminance and reasonable contrast maintenance, we consider the distribution of energy information in the structural components in terms of multi-directional frequency variance and information entropy. Extensive experiments on existing MMIF datasets, as well as the object detection and depth estimation tasks, consistently demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can surpass the state-of-the-art methods in visual perception and quantitative evaluation.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To provide a simulation framework for routine neuroimaging test data, which allows for "stress testing" of deep segmentation networks against acquisition shifts that commonly occur in clinical practice for T2 weighted (T2w) fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) protocols.   Approach: The approach simulates "acquisition shift derivatives" of MR images based on MR signal equations. Experiments comprise the validation of the simulated images by real MR scans and example stress tests on state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation networks to explore a generic model function to describe the F1 score in dependence of the contrast-affecting sequence parameters echo time (TE) and inversion time (TI).   Results: The differences between real and simulated images range up to 19 % in gray and white matter for extreme parameter settings. For the segmentation networks under test the F1 score dependency on TE and TI can be well described by quadratic model functions (R^2 > 0.9). The coefficients of the model functions indicate that changes of TE have more influence on the model performance than TI.   Conclusions: We show that these deviations are in the range of values as may be caused by erroneous or individual differences of relaxation times as described by literature. The coefficients of the F1 model function allow for quantitative comparison of the influences of TE and TI. Limitations arise mainly from tissues with the low baseline signal (like CSF) and when the protocol contains contrast-affecting measures that cannot be modelled due to missing information in the DICOM header.

- **Summary**: Sensor fusion is vital for the safe and robust operation of autonomous vehicles. Accurate extrinsic sensor to sensor calibration is necessary to accurately fuse multiple sensor's data in a common spatial reference frame. In this paper, we propose a target free extrinsic calibration algorithm that requires no ground truth training data, artificially constrained motion trajectories, hand engineered features or offline optimization and that is accurate, precise and extremely robust to initialization error.   Most current research on online camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration requires ground truth training data which is impossible to capture at scale. We revisit analytical mutual information based methods first proposed in 2012 and demonstrate that geometric features provide a robust information metric for camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration. We demonstrate our proposed improvement using the KITTI and KITTI-360 fisheye data set.

- **Summary**: Target volume contouring for radiation therapy is considered significantly more challenging than the normal organ segmentation tasks as it necessitates the utilization of both image and text-based clinical information. Inspired by the recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) that can facilitate the integration of the textural information and images, here we present a novel LLM-driven multi-modal AI that utilizes the clinical text information and is applicable to the challenging task of target volume contouring for radiation therapy, and validate it within the context of breast cancer radiation therapy target volume contouring. Using external validation and data-insufficient environments, which attributes highly conducive to real-world applications, we demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits markedly improved performance compared to conventional vision-only AI models, particularly exhibiting robust generalization performance and data-efficiency. To our best knowledge, this is the first LLM-driven multimodal AI model that integrates the clinical text information into target volume delineation for radiation oncology.

- **Summary**: Augmented Reality (AR) has emerged as a significant advancement in surgical procedures, offering a solution to the challenges posed by traditional neuronavigation methods. These conventional techniques often necessitate surgeons to split their focus between the surgical site and a separate monitor that displays guiding images. Over the years, many systems have been developed to register and track the hologram at the targeted locations, each employed its own evaluation technique. On the other hand, hologram displacement measurement is not a straightforward task because of various factors such as occlusion, Vengence-Accomodation Conflict, and unstable holograms in space. In this study, we explore and classify different techniques for assessing an AR-assisted neurosurgery system and propose a new technique to systematize the assessment procedure. Moreover, we conduct a deeper investigation to assess surgeon error in the pre- and intra-operative phases of the surgery based on the respective feedback given. We found that although the system can undergo registration and tracking errors, physical feedback can significantly reduce the error caused by hologram displacement. However, the lack of visual feedback on the hologram does not have a significant effect on the user 3D perception.

- **Summary**: Quantitative cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly important diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases. Yet, co-registration of all baseline images within the quantitative MRI sequence is essential for the accuracy and precision of quantitative maps. However, co-registering all baseline images from a quantitative cardiac MRI sequence remains a nontrivial task because of the simultaneous changes in intensity and contrast, in combination with cardiac and respiratory motion. To address the challenge, we propose a novel motion correction framework based on robust principle component analysis (rPCA) that decomposes quantitative cardiac MRI into low-rank and sparse components, and we integrate the groupwise CNN-based registration backbone within the rPCA framework. The low-rank component of rPCA corresponds to the quantitative mapping (i.e. limited degree of freedom in variation), while the sparse component corresponds to the residual motion, making it easier to formulate and solve the groupwise registration problem. We evaluated our proposed method on cardiac T1 mapping by the modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) sequence, both before and after the Gadolinium contrast agent administration. Our experiments showed that our method effectively improved registration performance over baseline methods without introducing rPCA, and reduced quantitative mapping error in both in-domain (pre-contrast MOLLI) and out-of-domain (post-contrast MOLLI) inference. The proposed rPCA framework is generic and can be integrated with other registration backbones.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach, called Prototype-based Self-Distillation (ProS), for unsupervised face representation learning. The existing supervised methods heavily rely on a large amount of annotated training facial data, which poses challenges in terms of data collection and privacy concerns. To address these issues, we propose ProS, which leverages a vast collection of unlabeled face images to learn a comprehensive facial omni-representation. In particular, ProS consists of two vision-transformers (teacher and student models) that are trained with different augmented images (cropping, blurring, coloring, etc.). Besides, we build a face-aware retrieval system along with augmentations to obtain the curated images comprising predominantly facial areas. To enhance the discrimination of learned features, we introduce a prototype-based matching loss that aligns the similarity distributions between features (teacher or student) and a set of learnable prototypes. After pre-training, the teacher vision transformer serves as a backbone for downstream tasks, including attribute estimation, expression recognition, and landmark alignment, achieved through simple fine-tuning with additional layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, both in full and few-shot settings. Furthermore, we investigate pre-training with synthetic face images, and ProS exhibits promising performance in this scenario as well.

- **Summary**: The evaluation of the fidelity of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to their underlying models is a challenging task, primarily due to the absence of a ground truth for explanations. However, assessing fidelity is a necessary step for ensuring a correct XAI methodology. In this study, we conduct a fair and objective comparison of the current state-of-the-art XAI methods by introducing three novel image datasets with reliable ground truth for explanations. The primary objective of this comparison is to identify methods with low fidelity and eliminate them from further research, thereby promoting the development of more trustworthy and effective XAI techniques. Our results demonstrate that XAI methods based on the backpropagation of output information to input yield higher accuracy and reliability compared to methods relying on sensitivity analysis or Class Activation Maps (CAM). However, the backpropagation method tends to generate more noisy saliency maps. These findings have significant implications for the advancement of XAI methods, enabling the elimination of erroneous explanations and fostering the development of more robust and reliable XAI.

- **Summary**: Accurate indoor free-space segmentation is a challenging task due to the complexity and the dynamic nature that indoor environments exhibit. We propose an indoors free-space segmentation method that associates large depth values with navigable regions. Our method leverages an unsupervised masking technique that, using positive instances, generates segmentation labels based on textural homogeneity and depth uniformity. Moreover, we generate superpixels corresponding to areas of higher depth and align them with features extracted from a Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT). Using the estimated free-space masks and the DPT feature representation, a SegFormer model is fine-tuned on our custom-collected indoor dataset. Our experiments demonstrate sufficient performance in intricate scenarios characterized by cluttered obstacles and challenging identification of free space.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we derive a novel optimal image transport algorithm over sparse dictionaries by taking advantage of Sparse Representation (SR) and Optimal Transport (OT). Concisely, we design a unified optimization framework in which the individual image features (color, textures, styles, etc.) are encoded using sparse representation compactly, and an optimal transport plan is then inferred between two learned dictionaries in accordance with the encoding process. This paradigm gives rise to a simple but effective way for simultaneous image representation and transformation, which is also empirically solvable because of the moderate size of sparse coding and optimal transport sub-problems. We demonstrate its versatility and many benefits to different image-to-image translation tasks, in particular image color transform and artistic style transfer, and show the plausible results for photo-realistic transferred effects.

- **Summary**: Recently, large-scale pre-trained models such as Segment-Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable success and revolutionized the field of computer vision. These foundation vision models effectively capture knowledge from a large-scale broad data with their vast model parameters, enabling them to perform zero-shot segmentation on previously unseen data without additional training. While they showcase competence in 2D tasks, their potential for enhancing 3D scene understanding remains relatively unexplored. To this end, we present a novel framework that adapts various foundational models for the 3D point cloud segmentation task. Our approach involves making initial predictions of 2D semantic masks using different large vision models. We then project these mask predictions from various frames of RGB-D video sequences into 3D space. To generate robust 3D semantic pseudo labels, we introduce a semantic label fusion strategy that effectively combines all the results via voting. We examine diverse scenarios, like zero-shot learning and limited guidance from sparse 2D point labels, to assess the pros and cons of different vision foundation models. Our approach is experimented on ScanNet dataset for 3D indoor scenes, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of adopting general 2D foundation models on solving 3D point cloud segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: One of the most serious corneal disorders, keratoconus is difficult to diagnose in its early stages and can result in blindness. This illness, which often appears in the second decade of life, affects people of all sexes and races. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), one of the deep learning approaches, have recently come to light as particularly promising tools for the accurate and timely diagnosis of keratoconus. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how well different D-CNN models identified keratoconus-related diseases. To be more precise, we compared five different CNN-based deep learning architectures (DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, VGG19, Xception). In our comprehensive experimental analysis, the DenseNet201-based model performed very well in keratoconus disease identification in our extensive experimental research. This model outperformed its D-CNN equivalents, with an astounding accuracy rate of 89.14% in three crucial classes: Keratoconus, Normal, and Suspect. The results demonstrate not only the stability and robustness of the model but also its practical usefulness in real-world applications for accurate and dependable keratoconus identification. In addition, D-CNN DenseNet201 performs extraordinarily well in terms of precision, recall rates, and F1 scores in addition to accuracy. These measures validate the model's usefulness as an effective diagnostic tool by highlighting its capacity to reliably detect instances of keratoconus and to reduce false positives and negatives.

- **Summary**: There is a growing interest in model-based deep learning (MBDL) for solving imaging inverse problems. MBDL networks can be seen as iterative algorithms that estimate the desired image using a physical measurement model and a learned image prior specified using a convolutional neural net (CNNs). The iterative nature of MBDL networks increases the test-time computational complexity, which limits their applicability in certain large-scale applications. We address this issue by presenting structured pruning algorithm for model-based deep learning (SPADE) as the first structured pruning algorithm for MBDL networks. SPADE reduces the computational complexity of CNNs used within MBDL networks by pruning its non-essential weights. We propose three distinct strategies to fine-tune the pruned MBDL networks to minimize the performance loss. Each fine-tuning strategy has a unique benefit that depends on the presence of a pre-trained model and a high-quality ground truth. We validate SPADE on two distinct inverse problems, namely compressed sensing MRI and image super-resolution. Our results highlight that MBDL models pruned by SPADE can achieve substantial speed up in testing time while maintaining competitive performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised object detection from 3D point clouds in self-driving scenes. We present a simple yet effective method that exploits (i) point clustering in near-range areas where the point clouds are dense, (ii) temporal consistency to filter out noisy unsupervised detections, (iii) translation equivariance of CNNs to extend the auto-labels to long range, and (iv) self-supervision for improving on its own. Our approach, OYSTER (Object Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Refinement), does not impose constraints on data collection (such as repeated traversals of the same location), is able to detect objects in a zero-shot manner without supervised finetuning (even in sparse, distant regions), and continues to self-improve given more rounds of iterative self-training. To better measure model performance in self-driving scenarios, we propose a new planning-centric perception metric based on distance-to-collision. We demonstrate that our unsupervised object detector significantly outperforms unsupervised baselines on PandaSet and Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset, showing promise that self-supervision combined with object priors can enable object discovery in the wild.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language learning have achieved notable success on complete-information question-answering datasets through the integration of extensive world knowledge. Yet, most models operate passively, responding to questions based on pre-stored knowledge. In stark contrast, humans possess the ability to actively explore, accumulate, and reason using both newfound and existing information to tackle incomplete-information questions. In response to this gap, we introduce $Conan$, an interactive open-world environment devised for the assessment of active reasoning. $Conan$ facilitates active exploration and promotes multi-round abductive inference, reminiscent of rich, open-world settings like Minecraft. Diverging from previous works that lean primarily on single-round deduction via instruction following, $Conan$ compels agents to actively interact with their surroundings, amalgamating new evidence with prior knowledge to elucidate events from incomplete observations. Our analysis on $Conan$ underscores the shortcomings of contemporary state-of-the-art models in active exploration and understanding complex scenarios. Additionally, we explore Abduction from Deduction, where agents harness Bayesian rules to recast the challenge of abduction as a deductive process. Through $Conan$, we aim to galvanize advancements in active reasoning and set the stage for the next generation of artificial intelligence agents adept at dynamically engaging in environments.

- **Summary**: Video analytics is widely used in contemporary systems and services. At the forefront of video analytics are video queries that users develop to find objects of particular interest. Building upon the insight that video objects (e.g., human, animals, cars, etc.), the center of video analytics, are similar in spirit to objects modeled by traditional object-oriented languages, we propose to develop an object-oriented approach to video analytics. This approach, named VQPy, consists of a frontend$\unicode{x2015}$a Python variant with constructs that make it easy for users to express video objects and their interactions$\unicode{x2015}$as well as an extensible backend that can automatically construct and optimize pipelines based on video objects. We have implemented and open-sourced VQPy, which has been productized in Cisco as part of its DeepVision framework.

This strategy is designed to model a wide range of occlusion scenarios, from mild disruptions to severe blockages. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive ablation study wherein multiple centerline detection methods are developed and evaluated. This analysis not only benchmarks the performance of various approaches but also provides valuable insights into the interpretability of these methods. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our methods and assess their adaptability across different sensor configurations, highlighting their versatility and relevance in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: We introduce LOTUS, a continual imitation learning algorithm that empowers a physical robot to continuously and efficiently learn to solve new manipulation tasks throughout its lifespan. The core idea behind LOTUS is constructing an ever-growing skill library from a sequence of new tasks with a small number of human demonstrations. LOTUS starts with a continual skill discovery process using an open-vocabulary vision model, which extracts skills as recurring patterns presented in unsegmented demonstrations. Continual skill discovery updates existing skills to avoid catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks and adds new skills to solve novel tasks. LOTUS trains a meta-controller that flexibly composes various skills to tackle vision-based manipulation tasks in the lifelong learning process. Our comprehensive experiments show that LOTUS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 11% in success rate, showing its superior knowledge transfer ability compared to prior methods.

- **Summary**: Most trackers perform template and search region similarity matching to find the most similar object to the template during tracking. However, they struggle to make prediction when the target appearance changes due to the limited historical information introduced by roughly cropping the current search region based on the predicted result of previous frame. In this paper, we identify that the central impediment to improving the performance of existing trackers is the incapacity to integrate abundant and effective historical information. To address this issue, we propose a Historical Information Prompter (HIP) to enhance the provision of historical information. We also build HIPTrack upon HIP module. HIP is a plug-and-play module that make full use of search region features to introduce historical appearance information. It also incorporates historical position information by constructing refined mask of the target. HIP is a lightweight module to generate historical information prompts. By integrating historical information prompts, HIPTrack significantly enhances the tracking performance without the need to retrain the backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches on LaSOT, LaSOT ext, GOT10k and NfS. Futhermore, HIP module exhibits strong generality and can be seamlessly integrated into trackers to improve tracking performance. The source code and models will be released for further research.

- **Summary**: We present EmerNeRF, a simple yet powerful approach for learning spatial-temporal representations of dynamic driving scenes. Grounded in neural fields, EmerNeRF simultaneously captures scene geometry, appearance, motion, and semantics via self-bootstrapping. EmerNeRF hinges upon two core components: First, it stratifies scenes into static and dynamic fields. This decomposition emerges purely from self-supervision, enabling our model to learn from general, in-the-wild data sources. Second, EmerNeRF parameterizes an induced flow field from the dynamic field and uses this flow field to further aggregate multi-frame features, amplifying the rendering precision of dynamic objects. Coupling these three fields (static, dynamic, and flow) enables EmerNeRF to represent highly-dynamic scenes self-sufficiently, without relying on ground truth object annotations or pre-trained models for dynamic object segmentation or optical flow estimation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in sensor simulation, significantly outperforming previous methods when reconstructing static (+2.93 PSNR) and dynamic (+3.70 PSNR) scenes. In addition, to bolster EmerNeRF's semantic generalization, we lift 2D visual foundation model features into 4D space-time and address a general positional bias in modern Transformers, significantly boosting 3D perception performance (e.g., 37.50% relative improvement in occupancy prediction accuracy on average). Finally, we construct a diverse and challenging 120-sequence dataset to benchmark neural fields under extreme and highly-dynamic settings.

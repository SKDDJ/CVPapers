- **Summary**: Object detection with event cameras enjoys the property of low latency and high dynamic range, making it suitable for safety-critical scenarios such as self-driving. However, labeling event streams with high temporal resolutions for supervised training is costly. We address this issue with LEOD, the first framework for label-efficient event-based detection. Our method unifies weakly- and semi-supervised object detection with a self-training mechanism. We first utilize a detector pre-trained on limited labels to produce pseudo ground truth on unlabeled events, and then re-train the detector with both real and generated labels. Leveraging the temporal consistency of events, we run bi-directional inference and apply tracking-based post-processing to enhance the quality of pseudo labels. To stabilize training, we further design a soft anchor assignment strategy to mitigate the noise in labels. We introduce new experimental protocols to evaluate the task of label-efficient event-based detection on Gen1 and 1Mpx datasets. LEOD consistently outperforms supervised baselines across various labeling ratios. For example, on Gen1, it improves mAP by 8.6% and 7.8% for RVT-S trained with 1% and 2% labels. On 1Mpx, RVT-S with 10% labels even surpasses its fully-supervised counterpart using 100% labels. LEOD maintains its effectiveness even when all labeled data are available, reaching new state-of-the-art results. Finally, we show that our method readily scales to improve larger detectors as well.

- **Summary**: Foundation Models (FMs) have revolutionized machine learning with their adaptability and high performance across tasks; yet, their integration into Federated Learning (FL) is challenging due to substantial communication overhead from their extensive parameterization. Current communication-efficient FL strategies, such as gradient compression, reduce bitrates to around $1$ bit-per-parameter (bpp). However, these approaches fail to harness the characteristics of FMs, with their large number of parameters still posing a challenge to communication efficiency, even at these bitrate regimes. In this work, we present DeltaMask, a novel method that efficiently fine-tunes FMs in FL at an ultra-low bitrate, well below 1 bpp. DeltaMask employs stochastic masking to detect highly effective subnetworks within FMs and leverage stochasticity and sparsity in client masks to compress updates into a compact grayscale image using probabilistic filters, deviating from traditional weight training approaches. Our comprehensive evaluations across various datasets and architectures demonstrate DeltaMask efficiently achieves bitrates as low as 0.09 bpp, enhancing communication efficiency while maintaining FMs performance, as measured on 8 datasets and 5 pre-trained models of various network architectures.



### Explaining CLIP's performance disparities on data from blind/low vision users

- **Summary**: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) hold the potential to usher in a new era of automated visual assistance for people who are blind or low vision (BLV). Yet, these models have not been systematically evaluated on data captured by BLV users. We address this by empirically assessing CLIP, a widely-used LMM likely to underpin many assistive technologies. Testing 25 CLIP variants in a zero-shot classification task, we find that their accuracy is 15 percentage points lower on average for images captured by BLV users than web-crawled images. This disparity stems from CLIP's sensitivities to 1) image content (e.g. not recognizing disability objects as well as other objects); 2) image quality (e.g. not being robust to lighting variation); and 3) text content (e.g. not recognizing objects described by tactile adjectives as well as visual ones). We delve deeper with a textual analysis of three common pre-training datasets: LAION-400M, LAION-2B and DataComp-1B, showing that disability content is rarely mentioned. We then provide three examples that illustrate how the performance disparities extend to three downstream models underpinned by CLIP: OWL-ViT, CLIPSeg and DALL-E2. We find that few-shot learning with as few as 5 images can mitigate CLIP's quality-of-service disparities for BLV users in some scenarios, which we discuss alongside a set of other possible mitigations.

- **Summary**: This research focuses on the issue of single-image reflection removal (SIRR) in real-world conditions, examining it from two angles: the collection pipeline of real reflection pairs and the perception of real reflection locations. We devise an advanced reflection collection pipeline that is highly adaptable to a wide range of real-world reflection scenarios and incurs reduced costs in collecting large-scale aligned reflection pairs. In the process, we develop a large-scale, high-quality reflection dataset named Reflection Removal in the Wild (RRW). RRW contains over 14,950 high-resolution real-world reflection pairs, a dataset forty-five times larger than its predecessors. Regarding perception of reflection locations, we identify that numerous virtual reflection objects visible in reflection images are not present in the corresponding ground-truth images. This observation, drawn from the aligned pairs, leads us to conceive the Maximum Reflection Filter (MaxRF). The MaxRF could accurately and explicitly characterize reflection locations from pairs of images. Building upon this, we design a reflection location-aware cascaded framework, specifically tailored for SIRR. Powered by these innovative techniques, our solution achieves superior performance than current leading methods across multiple real-world benchmarks. Codes and datasets will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation studies have shown promise in training models with limited labeled data. However, current dominant teacher-student based approaches can suffer from the confirmation bias. To address this challenge, we propose AD-MT, an alternate diverse teaching approach in a teacher-student framework. It involves a single student model and two non-trainable teacher models that are momentum-updated periodically and randomly in an alternate fashion. To mitigate the confirmation bias from the diverse supervision, the core of AD-MT lies in two proposed modules: the Random Periodic Alternate (RPA) Updating Module and the Conflict-Combating Module (CCM). The RPA schedules the alternating diverse updating process with complementary data batches, distinct data augmentation, and random switching periods to encourage diverse reasoning from different teaching perspectives. The CCM employs an entropy-based ensembling strategy to encourage the model to learn from both the consistent and conflicting predictions between the teachers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our AD-MT on the 2D and 3D medical segmentation benchmarks across various semi-supervised settings.

- **Summary**: Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention, exhibiting notable advancements across various tasks by leveraging extensive image-text paired data. However, prevailing VLMs often treat Visual Question Answering (VQA) as perception tasks, employing black-box models that overlook explicit modeling of relationships between different questions within the same visual scene. Moreover, the existing VQA methods that rely on Knowledge Bases (KBs) might frequently encounter biases from limited data and face challenges in relevant information indexing. Attempt to overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an explainable multi-agent collaboration framework by tapping into knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive corpora. Inspired by human cognition, our framework uncovers latent information within the given question by employing three agents, i.e., Seeker, Responder, and Integrator, to perform a top-down reasoning process. The Seeker agent generates relevant issues related to the original question. The Responder agent, based on VLM, handles simple VQA tasks and provides candidate answers. The Integrator agent combines information from the Seeker agent and the Responder agent to produce the final VQA answer. Through the above collaboration mechanism, our framework explicitly constructs a multi-view knowledge base for a specific image scene, reasoning answers in a top-down processing manner. We extensively evaluate our method on diverse VQA datasets and VLMs, demonstrating its broad applicability and interpretability with comprehensive experimental results.

- **Summary**: Face recognition (FR) technology plays a crucial role in various applications, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant security concerns. Existing research primarily focuses on transferability to different FR models, overlooking the direct transferability to victim's face images, which is a practical threat in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel adversarial attack method that considers both the transferability to the FR model and the victim's face image, called NeRFTAP. Leveraging NeRF-based 3D-GAN, we generate new view face images for the source and target subjects to enhance transferability of adversarial patches. We introduce a style consistency loss to ensure the visual similarity between the adversarial UV map and the target UV map under a 0-1 mask, enhancing the effectiveness and naturalness of the generated adversarial face images. Extensive experiments and evaluations on various FR models demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing attack techniques. Our work provides valuable insights for enhancing the robustness of FR systems in practical adversarial settings.

- **Summary**: Chest X-rays (CXR) often reveal rare diseases, demanding precise diagnosis. However, current computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods focus on common diseases, leading to inadequate detection of rare conditions due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. To overcome this, we present a novel benchmark for long-tailed multi-label classification in CXRs, encapsulating both common and rare thoracic diseases. Our approach includes developing the "LTML-MIMIC-CXR" dataset, an augmentation of MIMIC-CXR with 26 additional rare diseases. We propose a baseline method for this classification challenge, integrating adaptive negative regularization to address negative logits' over-suppression in tail classes, and a large loss reconsideration strategy for correcting noisy labels from automated annotations. Our evaluation on LTML-MIMIC-CXR demonstrates significant advancements in rare disease detection. This work establishes a foundation for robust CAD methods, achieving a balance in identifying a spectrum of thoracic diseases in CXRs.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, short videos (SVs) are essential to information acquisition and sharing in our life. The prevailing use of SVs to spread emotions leads to the necessity of emotion recognition in SVs. Considering the lack of SVs emotion data, we introduce a large-scale dataset named eMotions, comprising 27,996 videos. Meanwhile, we alleviate the impact of subjectivities on labeling quality by emphasizing better personnel allocations and multi-stage annotations. In addition, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented variants through targeted data sampling. Some commonly used videos (e.g., facial expressions and postures) have been well studied. However, it is still challenging to understand the emotions in SVs. Since the enhanced content diversity brings more distinct semantic gaps and difficulties in learning emotion-related features, and there exists information gaps caused by the emotion incompleteness under the prevalently audio-visual co-expressions. To tackle these problems, we present an end-to-end baseline method AV-CPNet that employs the video transformer to better learn semantically relevant representations. We further design the two-stage cross-modal fusion module to complementarily model the correlations of audio-visual features. The EP-CE Loss, incorporating three emotion polarities, is then applied to guide model optimization. Extensive experimental results on nine datasets verify the effectiveness of AV-CPNet. Datasets and code will be open on https://github.com/XuecWu/eMotions.

- **Summary**: Identity-consistent video generation seeks to synthesize videos that are guided by both textual prompts and reference images of entities. Current approaches typically utilize cross-attention layers to integrate the appearance of the entity, which predominantly captures semantic attributes, resulting in compromised fidelity of entities. Moreover, these methods necessitate iterative fine-tuning for each new entity encountered, thereby limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAssembler, a novel end-to-end framework for identity-consistent video generation that can conduct inference directly when encountering new entities. VideoAssembler is adept at producing videos that are not only flexible with respect to the input reference entities but also responsive to textual conditions. Additionally, by modulating the quantity of input images for the entity, VideoAssembler enables the execution of tasks ranging from image-to-video generation to sophisticated video editing. VideoAssembler comprises two principal components: the Reference Entity Pyramid (REP) encoder and the Entity-Prompt Attention Fusion (EPAF) module. The REP encoder is designed to infuse comprehensive appearance details into the denoising stages of the stable diffusion model. Concurrently, the EPAF module is utilized to integrate text-aligned features effectively. Furthermore, to mitigate the challenge of scarce data, we present a methodology for the preprocessing of training data. Our evaluation of the VideoAssembler framework on the UCF-101, MSR-VTT, and DAVIS datasets indicates that it achieves good performances in both quantitative and qualitative analyses (346.84 in FVD and 48.01 in IS on UCF-101).

- **Summary**: Face recognition (FR) systems powered by deep learning have become widely used in various applications. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially those based on local adversarial patches that can be physically applied to real-world objects. In this paper, we propose RADAP, a robust and adaptive defense mechanism against diverse adversarial patches in both closed-set and open-set FR systems. RADAP employs innovative techniques, such as FCutout and F-patch, which use Fourier space sampling masks to improve the occlusion robustness of the FR model and the performance of the patch segmenter. Moreover, we introduce an edge-aware binary cross-entropy (EBCE) loss function to enhance the accuracy of patch detection. We also present the split and fill (SAF) strategy, which is designed to counter the vulnerability of the patch segmenter to complete white-box adaptive attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of RADAP, which shows significant improvements in defense performance against various adversarial patches, while maintaining clean accuracy higher than that of the undefended Vanilla model.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image super-resolution has attained widespread prominence to enhance the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. However, convolution-based methods have encountered challenges in harnessing the global spatial-spectral information. The prevailing transformer-based methods have not adequately captured the long-range dependencies in both spectral and spatial dimensions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel cross-scope spatial-spectral Transformer (CST) to efficiently investigate long-range spatial and spectral similarities for single hyperspectral image super-resolution. Specifically, we devise cross-attention mechanisms in spatial and spectral dimensions to comprehensively model the long-range spatial-spectral characteristics. By integrating global information into the rectangle-window self-attention, we first design a cross-scope spatial self-attention to facilitate long-range spatial interactions. Then, by leveraging appropriately characteristic spatial-spectral features, we construct a cross-scope spectral self-attention to effectively capture the intrinsic correlations among global spectral bands. Finally, we elaborate a concise feed-forward neural network to enhance the feature representation capacity in the Transformer structure. Extensive experiments over three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed CST is superior to other state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Tomchenshi/CST.git}.

- **Summary**: With the increasing consumption of 3D displays and virtual reality, multi-view video has become a promising format. However, its high resolution and multi-camera shooting result in a substantial increase in data volume, making storage and transmission a challenging task. To tackle these difficulties, we propose an implicit-explicit integrated representation for multi-view video compression. Specifically, we first use the explicit representation-based 2D video codec to encode one of the source views. Subsequently, we propose employing the implicit neural representation (INR)-based codec to encode the remaining views. The implicit codec takes the time and view index of multi-view video as coordinate inputs and generates the corresponding implicit reconstruction frames.To enhance the compressibility, we introduce a multi-level feature grid embedding and a fully convolutional architecture into the implicit codec. These components facilitate coordinate-feature and feature-RGB mapping, respectively. To further enhance the reconstruction quality from the INR codec, we leverage the high-quality reconstructed frames from the explicit codec to achieve inter-view compensation. Finally, the compensated results are fused with the implicit reconstructions from the INR to obtain the final reconstructed frames. Our proposed framework combines the strengths of both implicit neural representation and explicit 2D codec. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve comparable or even superior performance to the latest multi-view video compression standard MIV and other INR-based schemes in terms of view compression and scene modeling.

- **Summary**: The paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has laid the foundation for deploying deep learning models. However, most fine-tuning methods are designed to meet a specific resource budget. Recently, considering diverse deployment scenarios with various resource budgets, stitchable neural network (SN-Net) is introduced to quickly obtain numerous new networks (stitches) from the pre-trained models (anchors) in a model family via model stitching. Although promising, SN-Net confronts new challenges when adapting it to new target domains, including huge memory and storage requirements and a long and sub-optimal multistage adaptation process. In this work, we present a novel framework, Efficient Stitchable Task Adaptation (ESTA), to efficiently produce a palette of fine-tuned models that adhere to diverse resource constraints. Specifically, we first tailor parameter-efficient fine-tuning to share low-rank updates among the stitches while maintaining independent bias terms. In this way, we largely reduce fine-tuning memory burdens and mitigate the interference among stitches that arises in task adaptation. Furthermore, we streamline a simple yet effective one-stage deployment pipeline, which estimates the important stitches to deploy with training-time gradient statistics. By assigning higher sampling probabilities to important stitches, we also get a boosted Pareto frontier. Extensive experiments on 25 downstream visual recognition tasks demonstrate that our ESTA is capable of generating stitches with smooth accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and surpasses the direct SN-Net adaptation by remarkable margins with significantly lower training time and fewer trainable parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our ESTA framework by stitching LLMs from LLaMA family, obtaining chatbot stitches of assorted sizes.

- **Summary**: In the past decade, using Street View images and machine learning to measure human perception has become a mainstream research approach in urban science. However, this approach using only image-shallow information makes it difficult to comprehensively understand the deep semantic features of human perception of a scene. In this study, we proposed a new framework based on a pre-train natural language model to understand the relationship between human perception and the sense of a scene. Firstly, Place Pulse 2.0 was used as our base dataset, which contains a variety of human-perceived labels, namely, beautiful, safe, wealthy, depressing, boring, and lively. An image captioning network was used to extract the description information of each street view image. Secondly, a pre-trained BERT model was finetuning and added a regression function for six human perceptual dimensions. Furthermore, we compared the performance of five traditional regression methods with our approach and conducted a migration experiment in Hong Kong. Our results show that human perception scoring by deep semantic features performed better than previous studies by machine learning methods with shallow features. The use of deep scene semantic features provides new ideas for subsequent human perception research, as well as better explanatory power in the face of spatial heterogeneity.

- **Summary**: The Attention Restoration Theory (ART) presents a theoretical framework with four essential indicators (being away, extent, fascinating, and compatibility) for comprehending urban and natural restoration quality. However, previous studies relied on non-sequential data and non-spatial dependent methods, which overlooks the impact of spatial structure defined here as the positional relationships between scene entities on restoration quality. The past methods also make it challenging to measure restoration quality on an urban scale. In this work, a spatial-dependent graph neural networks (GNNs) approach is proposed to reveal the relation between spatial structure and restoration quality on an urban scale. Specifically, we constructed two different types of graphs at the street and city levels. The street-level graphs, using sequential street view images (SVIs) of road segments to capture position relationships between entities, were used to represent spatial structure. The city-level graph, modeling the topological relationships of roads as non-Euclidean data structures and embedding urban features (including Perception-features, Spatial-features, and Socioeconomic-features), was used to measure restoration quality. The results demonstrate that: 1) spatial-dependent GNNs model outperforms traditional methods (Acc = 0.735, F1 = 0.732); 2) spatial structure portrayed through sequential SVIs data significantly influences restoration quality; 3) spaces with the same restoration quality exhibited distinct spatial structures patterns. This study clarifies the association between spatial structure and restoration quality, providing a new perspective to improve urban well-being in the future.

- **Summary**: Human reasoning can be understood as a cooperation between the intuitive, associative "System-1" and the deliberative, logical "System-2". For existing System-1-like methods in visual activity understanding, it is crucial to integrate System-2 processing to improve explainability, generalization, and data efficiency. One possible path of activity reasoning is building a symbolic system composed of symbols and rules, where one rule connects multiple symbols, implying human knowledge and reasoning abilities. Previous methods have made progress, but are defective with limited symbols from handcraft and limited rules from visual-based annotations, failing to cover the complex patterns of activities and lacking compositional generalization. To overcome the defects, we propose a new symbolic system with two ideal important properties: broad-coverage symbols and rational rules. Collecting massive human knowledge via manual annotations is expensive to instantiate this symbolic system. Instead, we leverage the recent advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) as an approximation of the two ideal properties, i.e., Symbols from Large Language Models (Symbol-LLM). Then, given an image, visual contents from the images are extracted and checked as symbols and activity semantics are reasoned out based on rules via fuzzy logic calculation. Our method shows superiority in extensive activity understanding tasks. Code and data are available at https://mvig-rhos.com/symbol_llm.

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework that concurrently tackles hand action recognition and 3D future hand motion prediction. While previous works focus on either recognition or prediction, we propose a generative Transformer VAE architecture to jointly capture both aspects, facilitating realistic motion prediction by leveraging the short-term hand motion and long-term action consistency observed across timestamps.To ensure faithful representation of the semantic dependency and different temporal granularity of hand pose and action, our framework is decomposed into two cascaded VAE blocks. The lower pose block models short-span poses, while the upper action block models long-span action. These are connected by a mid-level feature that represents sub-second series of hand poses.Our framework is trained across multiple datasets, where pose and action blocks are trained separately to fully utilize pose-action annotations of different qualities. Evaluations show that on multiple datasets, the joint modeling of recognition and prediction improves over separate solutions, and the semantic and temporal hierarchy enables long-term pose and action modeling.

- **Summary**: Monitoring wildfires is an essential step in minimizing their impact on the planet, understanding the many negative environmental, economic, and social consequences. Recent advances in remote sensing technology combined with the increasing application of artificial intelligence methods have improved real-time, high-resolution fire monitoring. This study explores two proposed approaches based on the U-Net model for automating and optimizing the burned-area mapping process. Denoted 128 and AllSizes (AS), they are trained on datasets with a different class balance by cropping input images to different sizes. They are then applied to Landsat imagery and time-series data from two fire-prone regions in Chile. The results obtained after enhancement of model performance by hyperparameter optimization demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches. Tests based on 195 representative images of the study area show that increasing dataset balance using the AS model yields better performance. More specifically, AS exhibited a Dice Coefficient (DC) of 0.93, an Omission Error (OE) of 0.086, and a Commission Error (CE) of 0.045, while the 128 model achieved a DC of 0.86, an OE of 0.12, and a CE of 0.12. These findings should provide a basis for further development of scalable automatic burned-area mapping tools.

- **Summary**: Portable 360$^\circ$ cameras are becoming a cheap and efficient tool to establish large visual databases. By capturing omnidirectional views of a scene, these cameras could expedite building environment models that are essential for visual localization. However, such an advantage is often overlooked due to the lack of valuable datasets. This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset, 360Loc, composed of 360$^\circ$ images with ground truth poses for visual localization. We present a practical implementation of 360$^\circ$ mapping combining 360$^\circ$ images with lidar data to generate the ground truth 6DoF poses. 360Loc is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of cross-device visual positioning, involving 360$^\circ$ reference frames, and query frames from pinhole, ultra-wide FoV fisheye, and 360$^\circ$ cameras. We propose a virtual camera approach to generate lower-FoV query frames from 360$^\circ$ images, which ensures a fair comparison of performance among different query types in visual localization tasks. We also extend this virtual camera approach to feature matching-based and pose regression-based methods to alleviate the performance loss caused by the cross-device domain gap, and evaluate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art baselines. We demonstrate that omnidirectional visual localization is more robust in challenging large-scale scenes with symmetries and repetitive structures. These results provide new insights into 360-camera mapping and omnidirectional visual localization with cross-device queries.

- **Summary**: Image datasets are essential not only in validating existing methods in computer vision but also in developing new methods. Most existing image datasets focus on trichromatic intensity images to mimic human vision. However, polarization and spectrum, the wave properties of light that animals in harsh environments and with limited brain capacity often rely on, remain underrepresented in existing datasets. Although spectro-polarimetric datasets exist, these datasets have insufficient object diversity, limited illumination conditions, linear-only polarization data, and inadequate image count. Here, we introduce two spectro-polarimetric datasets: trichromatic Stokes images and hyperspectral Stokes images. These novel datasets encompass both linear and circular polarization; they introduce multiple spectral channels; and they feature a broad selection of real-world scenes. With our dataset in hand, we analyze the spectro-polarimetric image statistics, develop efficient representations of such high-dimensional data, and evaluate spectral dependency of shape-from-polarization methods. As such, the proposed dataset promises a foundation for data-driven spectro-polarimetric imaging and vision research. Dataset and code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: The ability to perceive how objects change over time is a crucial ingredient in human intelligence. However, current benchmarks cannot faithfully reflect the temporal understanding abilities of video-language models (VidLMs) due to the existence of static visual shortcuts. To remedy this issue, we present VITATECS, a diagnostic VIdeo-Text dAtaset for the evaluation of TEmporal Concept underStanding. Specifically, we first introduce a fine-grained taxonomy of temporal concepts in natural language in order to diagnose the capability of VidLMs to comprehend different temporal aspects. Furthermore, to disentangle the correlation between static and temporal information, we generate counterfactual video descriptions that differ from the original one only in the specified temporal aspect. We employ a semi-automatic data collection framework using large language models and human-in-the-loop annotation to obtain high-quality counterfactual descriptions efficiently. Evaluation of representative video-language understanding models confirms their deficiency in temporal understanding, revealing the need for greater emphasis on the temporal elements in video-language research.

- **Summary**: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) which typically follows a neural message passing framework to model dependencies among skeletal joints has achieved high success in skeleton-based human motion prediction task. Nevertheless, how to construct a graph from a skeleton sequence and how to perform message passing on the graph are still open problems, which severely affect the performance of GCN. To solve both problems, this paper presents a Dynamic Dense Graph Convolutional Network (DD-GCN), which constructs a dense graph and implements an integrated dynamic message passing. More specifically, we construct a dense graph with 4D adjacency modeling as a comprehensive representation of motion sequence at different levels of abstraction. Based on the dense graph, we propose a dynamic message passing framework that learns dynamically from data to generate distinctive messages reflecting sample-specific relevance among nodes in the graph. Extensive experiments on benchmark Human 3.6M and CMU Mocap datasets verify the effectiveness of our DD-GCN which obviously outperforms state-of-the-art GCN-based methods, especially when using long-term and our proposed extremely long-term protocol.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of creating a character model that can be controlled in real time from a single image of an anime character. A solution to this problem would greatly reduce the cost of creating avatars, computer games, and other interactive applications.   Talking Head Anime 3 (THA3) is an open source project that attempts to directly address the problem. It takes as input (1) an image of an anime character's upper body and (2) a 45-dimensional pose vector and outputs a new image of the same character taking the specified pose. The range of possible movements is expressive enough for personal avatars and certain types of game characters. However, the system is too slow to generate animations in real time on common PCs, and its image quality can be improved.   In this paper, we improve THA3 in two ways. First, we propose new architectures for constituent networks that rotate the character's head and body based on U-Nets with attention that are widely used in modern generative models. The new architectures consistently yield better image quality than the THA3 baseline. Nevertheless, they also make the whole system much slower: it takes up to 150 milliseconds to generate a frame. Second, we propose a technique to distill the system into a small network (less than 2 MB) that can generate 512x512 animation frames in real time (under 30 FPS) using consumer gaming GPUs while keeping the image quality close to that of the full system. This improvement makes the whole system practical for real-time applications.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of generating whole-body motion from speech. Despite great successes, prior methods still struggle to produce reasonable and diverse whole-body motions from speech. This is due to their reliance on suboptimal representations and a lack of strategies for generating diverse results. To address these challenges, we present a novel hybrid point representation to achieve accurate and continuous motion generation, e.g., avoiding foot skating, and this representation can be transformed into an easy-to-use representation, i.e., SMPL-X body mesh, for many applications. To generate whole-body motion from speech, for facial motion, closely tied to the audio signal, we introduce an encoder-decoder architecture to achieve deterministic outcomes. However, for the body and hands, which have weaker connections to the audio signal, we aim to generate diverse yet reasonable motions. To boost diversity in motion generation, we propose a contrastive motion learning method to encourage the model to produce more distinctive representations. Specifically, we design a robust VQ-VAE to learn a quantized motion codebook using our hybrid representation. Then, we regress the motion representation from the audio signal by a translation model employing our contrastive motion learning method. Experimental results validate the superior performance and the correctness of our model.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal human action segmentation is a critical and challenging task with a wide range of applications. Nowadays, the majority of approaches concentrate on the fusion of dense signals (i.e., RGB, optical flow, and depth maps). However, the potential contributions of sparse IoT sensor signals, which can be crucial for achieving accurate recognition, have not been fully explored. To make up for this, we introduce a Sparse signalguided Transformer (SigFormer) to combine both dense and sparse signals. We employ mask attention to fuse localized features by constraining cross-attention within the regions where sparse signals are valid. However, since sparse signals are discrete, they lack sufficient information about the temporal action boundaries. Therefore, in SigFormer, we propose to emphasize the boundary information at two stages to alleviate this problem. In the first feature extraction stage, we introduce an intermediate bottleneck module to jointly learn both category and boundary features of each dense modality through the inner loss functions. After the fusion of dense modalities and sparse signals, we then devise a two-branch architecture that explicitly models the interrelationship between action category and temporal boundary. Experimental results demonstrate that SigFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on a multi-modal action segmentation dataset from real industrial environments, reaching an outstanding F1 score of 0.958. The codes and pre-trained models have been available at https://github.com/LIUQI-creat/SigFormer.



### Group-wise Sparse and Explainable Adversarial Attacks

- **Summary**: Sparse adversarial attacks fool deep neural networks (DNNs) through minimal pixel perturbations, typically regularized by the $\ell_0$ norm. Recent efforts have replaced this norm with a structural sparsity regularizer, such as the nuclear group norm, to craft group-wise sparse adversarial attacks. The resulting perturbations are thus explainable and hold significant practical relevance, shedding light on an even greater vulnerability of DNNs than previously anticipated. However, crafting such attacks poses an optimization challenge, as it involves computing norms for groups of pixels within a non-convex objective. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by presenting an algorithm that simultaneously generates group-wise sparse attacks within semantically meaningful areas of an image. In each iteration, the core operation of our algorithm involves the optimization of a quasinorm adversarial loss. This optimization is achieved by employing the $1/2$-quasinorm proximal operator for some iterations, a method tailored for nonconvex programming. Subsequently, the algorithm transitions to a projected Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with $2$-norm regularization applied to perturbation magnitudes. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of our novel attack in both targeted and non-targeted attack scenarios, on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our attack consistently results in a remarkable increase in group-wise sparsity, e.g., an increase of $48.12\%$ on CIFAR-10 and $40.78\%$ on ImageNet (average case, targeted attack), all while maintaining lower perturbation magnitudes. Notably, this performance is complemented by a significantly faster computation time and a $100\%$ attack success rate.

- **Summary**: We present MM-Narrator, a novel system leveraging GPT-4 with multimodal in-context learning for the generation of audio descriptions (AD). Unlike previous methods that primarily focused on downstream fine-tuning with short video clips, MM-Narrator excels in generating precise audio descriptions for videos of extensive lengths, even beyond hours, in an autoregressive manner. This capability is made possible by the proposed memory-augmented generation process, which effectively utilizes both the short-term textual context and long-term visual memory through an efficient register-and-recall mechanism. These contextual memories compile pertinent past information, including storylines and character identities, ensuring an accurate tracking and depicting of story-coherent and character-centric audio descriptions. Maintaining the training-free design of MM-Narrator, we further propose a complexity-based demonstration selection strategy to largely enhance its multi-step reasoning capability via few-shot multimodal in-context learning (MM-ICL). Experimental results on MAD-eval dataset demonstrate that MM-Narrator consistently outperforms both the existing fine-tuning-based approaches and LLM-based approaches in most scenarios, as measured by standard evaluation metrics. Additionally, we introduce the first segment-based evaluator for recurrent text generation. Empowered by GPT-4, this evaluator comprehensively reasons and marks AD generation performance in various extendable dimensions.

- **Summary**: Deep learning for detecting objects in remotely sensed imagery can enable new technologies for important applications including mitigating climate change. However, these models often require large datasets labeled with bounding box annotations which are expensive to curate, prohibiting the development of models for new tasks and geographies. To address this challenge, we develop weakly-semi-supervised object detection (WSSOD) models on remotely sensed imagery which can leverage a small amount of bounding boxes together with a large amount of point labels that are easy to acquire at scale in geospatial data. We train WSSOD models which use large amounts of point-labeled images with varying fractions of bounding box labeled images in FAIR1M and a wind turbine detection dataset, and demonstrate that they substantially outperform fully supervised models trained with the same amount of bounding box labeled images on both datasets. Furthermore, we find that the WSSOD models trained with 2-10x fewer bounding box labeled images can perform similarly to or outperform fully supervised models trained on the full set of bounding-box labeled images. We believe that the approach can be extended to other remote sensing tasks to reduce reliance on bounding box labels and increase development of models for impactful applications.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation based on continual learning exhibits a critical drop of performance, mainly due to catastrophic forgetting and background shift, as they are required to incorporate new classes continually. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective Continual Image Segmentation method with incremental Dynamic Query (CISDQ), which decouples the representation learning of both old and new knowledge with lightweight query embedding. CISDQ mainly includes three contributions: 1) We define dynamic queries with adaptive background class to exploit past knowledge and learn future classes naturally. 2) CISDQ proposes a class/instance-aware Query Guided Knowledge Distillation strategy to overcome catastrophic forgetting by capturing the inter-class diversity and intra-class identity. 3) Apart from semantic segmentation, CISDQ introduce the continual learning for instance segmentation in which instance-wise labeling and supervision are considered. Extensive experiments on three datasets for two tasks (i.e., continual semantic and instance segmentation are conducted to demonstrate that CISDQ achieves the state-of-the-art performance, specifically, obtaining 4.4% and 2.9% mIoU improvements for the ADE 100-10 (6 steps) setting and ADE 100-5 (11 steps) setting.

- **Summary**: Scene flow estimation, which aims to predict per-point 3D displacements of dynamic scenes, is a fundamental task in the computer vision field. However, previous works commonly suffer from unreliable correlation caused by locally constrained searching ranges, and struggle with accumulated inaccuracy arising from the coarse-to-fine structure. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware scene flow estimation network (DifFlow3D) with the diffusion probabilistic model. Iterative diffusion-based refinement is designed to enhance the correlation robustness and resilience to challenging cases, e.g., dynamics, noisy inputs, repetitive patterns, etc. To restrain the generation diversity, three key flow-related features are leveraged as conditions in our diffusion model. Furthermore, we also develop an uncertainty estimation module within diffusion to evaluate the reliability of estimated scene flow. Our DifFlow3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 6.7\% and 19.1\% EPE3D reduction respectively on FlyingThings3D and KITTI 2015 datasets. Notably, our method achieves an unprecedented millimeter-level accuracy (0.0089m in EPE3D) on the KITTI dataset. Additionally, our diffusion-based refinement paradigm can be readily integrated as a plug-and-play module into existing scene flow networks, significantly increasing their estimation accuracy. Codes will be released later.

- **Summary**: For a long time, in the field of reconstructing 3D human bodies from monocular images, most methods opted to simplify the task by minimizing the influence of the camera. Using a coarse focal length setting results in the reconstructed bodies not aligning well with distorted images. Ignoring camera rotation leads to an unrealistic reconstructed body pose in world space. Consequently, existing methods' application scenarios are confined to controlled environments. And they struggle to achieve accurate and reasonable reconstruction in world space when confronted with complex and diverse in-the-wild images. To address the above issues, we propose W-HMR, which decouples global body recovery into camera calibration, local body recovery and global body orientation correction. We design the first weak-supervised camera calibration method for body distortion, eliminating dependence on focal length labels and achieving finer mesh-image alignment. We propose a novel orientation correction module to allow the reconstructed human body to remain normal in world space. Decoupling body orientation and body pose enables our model to consider the accuracy in camera coordinate and the reasonableness in world coordinate simultaneously, expanding the range of applications. As a result, W-HMR achieves high-quality reconstruction in dual coordinate systems, particularly in challenging scenes. Codes will be released on https://yw0208.github.io/w-hmr/ after publication.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have remarkably excelled in producing diverse, high-quality, and photo-realistic images. This advancement has spurred a growing interest in incorporating specific identities into generated content. Most current methods employ an inversion approach to embed a target visual concept into the text embedding space using a single reference image. However, the newly synthesized faces either closely resemble the reference image in terms of facial attributes, such as expression, or exhibit a reduced capacity for identity preservation. Text descriptions intended to guide the facial attributes of the synthesized face may fall short, owing to the intricate entanglement of identity information with identity-irrelevant facial attributes derived from the reference image. To address these issues, we present the novel use of the extended StyleGAN embedding space $\mathcal{W}_+$, to achieve enhanced identity preservation and disentanglement for diffusion models. By aligning this semantically meaningful human face latent space with text-to-image diffusion models, we succeed in maintaining high fidelity in identity preservation, coupled with the capacity for semantic editing. Additionally, we propose new training objectives to balance the influences of both prompt and identity conditions, ensuring that the identity-irrelevant background remains unaffected during facial attribute modifications. Extensive experiments reveal that our method adeptly generates personalized text-to-image outputs that are not only compatible with prompt descriptions but also amenable to common StyleGAN editing directions in diverse settings.

- **Summary**: In this study, our goal is to create interactive avatar agents that can autonomously plan and animate nuanced facial movements realistically, from both visual and behavioral perspectives. Given high-level inputs about the environment and agent profile, our framework harnesses LLMs to produce a series of detailed text descriptions of the avatar agents' facial motions. These descriptions are then processed by our task-agnostic driving engine into motion token sequences, which are subsequently converted into continuous motion embeddings that are further consumed by our standalone neural-based renderer to generate the final photorealistic avatar animations. These streamlined processes allow our framework to adapt to a variety of non-verbal avatar interactions, both monadic and dyadic. Our extensive study, which includes experiments on both newly compiled and existing datasets featuring two types of agents -- one capable of monadic interaction with the environment, and the other designed for dyadic conversation -- validates the effectiveness and versatility of our approach. To our knowledge, we advanced a leap step by combining LLMs and neural rendering for generalized non-verbal prediction and photo-realistic rendering of avatar agents.

- **Summary**: Whole slide image (WSI) classification requires repetitive zoom-in and out for pathologists, as only small portions of the slide may be relevant to detecting cancer. Due to the lack of patch-level labels, multiple instance learning (MIL) is a common practice for training a WSI classifier. One of the challenges in MIL for WSIs is the weak supervision coming only from the slide-level labels, often resulting in severe overfitting. In response, researchers have considered adopting patch-level augmentation or applying mixup augmentation, but their applicability remains unverified. Our approach augments the training dataset by sampling a subset of patches in the WSI without significantly altering the underlying semantics of the original slides. Additionally, we introduce an efficient model (Slot-MIL) that organizes patches into a fixed number of slots, the abstract representation of patches, using an attention mechanism. We empirically demonstrate that the subsampling augmentation helps to make more informative slots by restricting the over-concentration of attention and to improve interpretability. Finally, we illustrate that combining our attention-based aggregation model with subsampling and mixup, which has shown limited compatibility in existing MIL methods, can enhance both generalization and calibration. Our proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance across various benchmark datasets including class imbalance and distribution shifts.

- **Summary**: Clouds in optical satellite images are a major concern since their presence hinders the ability to carry accurate analysis as well as processing. Presence of clouds also affects the image tasking schedule and results in wastage of valuable storage space on ground as well as space-based systems. Due to these reasons, deriving accurate cloud masks from optical remote-sensing images is an important task. Traditional methods such as threshold-based, spatial filtering for cloud detection in satellite images suffer from lack of accuracy. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have emerged as a promising approach to solve image segmentation problems as it allows pixel-level classification and semantic-level segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a deep-learning model based on hybrid transformer architecture for effective cloud mask generation named CLiSA - Cloud segmentation via Lipschitz Stable Attention network. In this context, we propose an concept of orthogonal self-attention combined with hierarchical cross attention model, and we validate its Lipschitz stability theoretically and empirically. We design the whole setup under adversarial setting in presence of Lov\'asz-Softmax loss. We demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative outcomes for multiple satellite image datasets including Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Cartosat-2s. Performing comparative study we show that our model performs preferably against other state-of-the-art methods and also provides better generalization in precise cloud extraction from satellite multi-spectral (MX) images. We also showcase different ablation studies to endorse our choices corresponding to different architectural elements and objective functions.

- **Summary**: We explore the "hidden" ability of large-scale pre-trained image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion and Imagen, in non-visible light domains, taking Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for a case study. Due to the inherent challenges in capturing satellite data, acquiring ample SAR training samples is infeasible. For instance, for a particular category of ship in the open sea, we can collect only few-shot SAR images which are too limited to derive effective ship recognition models. If large-scale models pre-trained with regular images can be adapted to generating novel SAR images, the problem is solved. In preliminary study, we found that fine-tuning these models with few-shot SAR images is not working, as the models can not capture the two primary differences between SAR and regular images: structure and modality. To address this, we propose a 2-stage low-rank adaptation method, and we call it 2LoRA. In the first stage, the model is adapted using aerial-view regular image data (whose structure matches SAR), followed by the second stage where the base model from the first stage is further adapted using SAR modality data. Particularly in the second stage, we introduce a novel prototype LoRA (pLoRA), as an improved version of 2LoRA, to resolve the class imbalance problem in SAR datasets. For evaluation, we employ the resulting generation model to synthesize additional SAR data. This augmentation, when integrated into the training process of SAR classification as well as segmentation models, yields notably improved performance for minor classes

- **Summary**: LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation enables the robots to obtain fine-grained semantic information of the surrounding environment. Recently, many works project the point cloud onto the 2D image and adopt the 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or vision transformer for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation. However, since more than one point can be projected onto the same 2D position but only one point can be preserved, the previous 2D image-based segmentation methods suffer from inevitable quantized information loss. To avoid quantized information loss, in this paper, we propose a novel spherical frustum structure. The points projected onto the same 2D position are preserved in the spherical frustums. Moreover, we propose a memory-efficient hash-based representation of spherical frustums. Through the hash-based representation, we propose the Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution (SFC) and Frustum Fast Point Sampling (F2PS) to convolve and sample the points stored in spherical frustums respectively. Finally, we present the Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution Network (SFCNet) to adopt 2D CNNs for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation without quantized information loss. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our SFCNet outperforms the 2D image-based semantic segmentation methods based on conventional spherical projection. The source code will be released later.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are hard to deploy on edge devices due to its high computation and storage complexities. As a common practice for model compression, network pruning consists of two major categories: unstructured and structured pruning, where unstructured pruning constantly performs better. However, unstructured pruning presents a structured pattern at high pruning rates, which limits its performance. To this end, we propose a Rank-based PruninG (RPG) method to maintain the ranks of sparse weights in an adversarial manner. In each step, we minimize the low-rank approximation error for the weight matrices using singular value decomposition, and maximize their distance by pushing the weight matrices away from its low rank approximation. This rank-based optimization objective guides sparse weights towards a high-rank topology. The proposed method is conducted in a gradual pruning fashion to stabilize the change of rank during training. Experimental results on various datasets and different tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in high sparsity. The proposed RPG outperforms the state-of-the-art performance by 1.13% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in ResNet-50 with 98% sparsity.

- **Summary**: In the current state of 6D pose estimation, top-performing techniques depend on complex intermediate correspondences, specialized architectures, and non-end-to-end algorithms. In contrast, our research reframes the problem as a straightforward regression task by exploring the capabilities of Vision Transformers for direct 6D pose estimation through a tailored use of classification tokens. We also introduce a simple method for determining pose confidence, which can be readily integrated into most 6D pose estimation frameworks. This involves modifying the transformer architecture by decreasing the number of query elements based on the network's assessment of the scene complexity. Our method that we call Pose Vision Transformer or PViT-6D provides the benefits of simple implementation and being end-to-end learnable while outperforming current state-of-the-art methods by +0.3% ADD(-S) on Linemod-Occlusion and +2.7% ADD(-S) on the YCB-V dataset. Moreover, our method enhances both the model's interpretability and the reliability of its performance during inference.

- **Summary**: Man-made 3D shapes are naturally organized in parts and hierarchies; such structures provide important constraints for shape reconstruction and generation. Modeling shape structures is difficult, because there can be multiple hierarchies for a given shape, causing ambiguity, and across different categories the shape structures are correlated with semantics, limiting generalization. We present StructRe, a structure rewriting system, as a novel approach to structured shape modeling. Given a 3D object represented by points and components, StructRe can rewrite it upward into more concise structures, or downward into more detailed structures; by iterating the rewriting process, hierarchies are obtained. Such a localized rewriting process enables probabilistic modeling of ambiguous structures and robust generalization across object categories. We train StructRe on PartNet data and show its generalization to cross-category and multiple object hierarchies, and test its extension to ShapeNet. We also demonstrate the benefits of probabilistic and generalizable structure modeling for shape reconstruction, generation and editing tasks.

Our method out-beats the state-of-the-art, does not require manually tuned parameters, can be extended to an arbitrary number and combinations of spectral channels, and is reconfigurable to address different use-cases.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Text-to-Image (T2I) models have seen remarkable advancements, gaining widespread adoption. However, this progress has inadvertently opened avenues for potential misuse, particularly in generating inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. Our work introduces MMA-Diffusion, a framework that presents a significant and realistic threat to the security of T2I models by effectively circumventing current defensive measures in both open-source models and commercial online services. Unlike previous approaches, MMA-Diffusion leverages both textual and visual modalities to bypass safeguards like prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers, thus exposing and highlighting the vulnerabilities in existing defense mechanisms.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in large vision-language models enabled visual object detection in open-vocabulary scenarios, where object classes are defined in free-text formats during inference. In this paper, we aim to probe the state-of-the-art methods for open-vocabulary object detection to determine to what extent they understand fine-grained properties of objects and their parts. To this end, we introduce an evaluation protocol based on dynamic vocabulary generation to test whether models detect, discern, and assign the correct fine-grained description to objects in the presence of hard-negative classes. We contribute with a benchmark suite of increasing difficulty and probing different properties like color, pattern, and material. We further enhance our investigation by evaluating several state-of-the-art open-vocabulary object detectors using the proposed protocol and find that most existing solutions, which shine in standard open-vocabulary benchmarks, struggle to accurately capture and distinguish finer object details. We conclude the paper by highlighting the limitations of current methodologies and exploring promising research directions to overcome the discovered drawbacks.

- **Comment**: Stable upsampling, reduction in spectral artifacts
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: State-of-the-art models for pixel-wise prediction tasks such as image restoration, image segmentation, or disparity estimation, involve several stages of data resampling, in which the resolution of feature maps is first reduced to aggregate information and then sequentially increased to generate a high-resolution output. Several previous works have investigated the effect of artifacts that are invoked during downsampling and diverse cures have been proposed that facilitate to improve prediction stability and even robustness for image classification. However, equally relevant, artifacts that arise during upsampling have been less discussed. This is significantly relevant as upsampling and downsampling approaches face fundamentally different challenges. While during downsampling, aliases and artifacts can be reduced by blurring feature maps, the emergence of fine details is crucial during upsampling. Blurring is therefore not an option and dedicated operations need to be considered. In this work, we are the first to explore the relevance of context during upsampling by employing convolutional upsampling operations with increasing kernel size while keeping the encoder unchanged. We find that increased kernel sizes can in general improve the prediction stability in tasks such as image restoration or image segmentation, while a block that allows for a combination of small-size kernels for fine details and large-size kernels for artifact removal and increased context yields the best results.

- **Summary**: Background and Objective: Infra-red scanning laser ophthalmoscope (IRSLO) images are akin to colour fundus photographs in displaying the posterior pole and retinal vasculature fine detail. While there are many trained networks readily available for retinal vessel segmentation in colour fundus photographs, none cater to IRSLO images. Accordingly, we aimed to develop (and release as open source) a vessel segmentation algorithm tailored specifically to IRSLO images. Materials and Methods: We used 23 expertly annotated IRSLO images from the RAVIR dataset, combined with 7 additional images annotated in-house. We trained a U-Net (convolutional neural network) to label pixels as 'vessel' or 'background'. Results: On an unseen test set (4 images), our model achieved an AUC of 0.981, and an AUPRC of 0.815. Upon thresholding, it achieved a sensitivity of 0.844, a specificity of 0.983, and an F1 score of 0.857. Conclusion: We have made our automatic segmentation algorithm publicly available and easy to use. Researchers can use the generated vessel maps to compute metrics such as fractal dimension and vessel density.

- **Summary**: We introduce HiDiffusion, a tuning-free framework comprised of Resolution-Aware U-Net (RAU-Net) and Modified Shifted Window Multi-head Self-Attention (MSW-MSA) to enable pretrained large text-to-image diffusion models to efficiently generate high-resolution images (e.g. 1024$\times$1024) that surpass the training image resolution. Pretrained diffusion models encounter unreasonable object duplication in generating images beyond the training image resolution. We attribute it to the mismatch between the feature map size of high-resolution images and the receptive field of U-Net's convolution. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet scalable method named RAU-Net. RAU-Net dynamically adjusts the feature map size to match the convolution's receptive field in the deep block of U-Net. Another obstacle in high-resolution synthesis is the slow inference speed of U-Net. Our observations reveal that the global self-attention in the top block, which exhibits locality, however, consumes the majority of computational resources. To tackle this issue, we propose MSW-MSA. Unlike previous window attention mechanisms, our method uses a much larger window size and dynamically shifts windows to better accommodate diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HiDiffusion can scale diffusion models to generate 1024$\times$1024, 2048$\times$2048, or even 4096$\times$4096 resolution images, while simultaneously reducing inference time by 40\%-60\%, achieving state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution image synthesis. The most significant revelation of our work is that a pretrained diffusion model on low-resolution images is scalable for high-resolution generation without further tuning. We hope this revelation can provide insights for future research on the scalability of diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Generating vivid and emotional 3D co-speech gestures is crucial for virtual avatar animation in human-machine interaction applications. While the existing methods enable generating the gestures to follow a single emotion label, they overlook that long gesture sequence modeling with emotion transition is more practical in real scenes. In addition, the lack of large-scale available datasets with emotional transition speech and corresponding 3D human gestures also limits the addressing of this task. To fulfill this goal, we first incorporate the ChatGPT-4 and an audio inpainting approach to construct the high-fidelity emotion transition human speeches. Considering obtaining the realistic 3D pose annotations corresponding to the dynamically inpainted emotion transition audio is extremely difficult, we propose a novel weakly supervised training strategy to encourage authority gesture transitions. Specifically, to enhance the coordination of transition gestures w.r.t different emotional ones, we model the temporal association representation between two different emotional gesture sequences as style guidance and infuse it into the transition generation. We further devise an emotion mixture mechanism that provides weak supervision based on a learnable mixed emotion label for transition gestures. Last, we present a keyframe sampler to supply effective initial posture cues in long sequences, enabling us to generate diverse gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models constructed by adapting single emotion-conditioned counterparts on our newly defined emotion transition task and datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent one-shot video tuning methods, which fine-tune the network on a specific video based on pre-trained text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), are popular in the community because of the flexibility. However, these methods often produce videos marred by incoherence and inconsistency. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a simple yet effective noise constraint across video frames. This constraint aims to regulate noise predictions across their temporal neighbors, resulting in smooth latents. It can be simply included as a loss term during the training phase. By applying the loss to existing one-shot video tuning methods, we significantly improve the overall consistency and smoothness of the generated videos. Furthermore, we argue that current video evaluation metrics inadequately capture smoothness. To address this, we introduce a novel metric that considers detailed features and their temporal dynamics. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in producing smoother videos on various one-shot video tuning baselines.

- **Summary**: Fast and accurate segmentation of neonatal brain images is highly desired to better understand and detect changes during development and disease. Yet, the limited availability of ground truth datasets, lack of standardized acquisition protocols, and wide variations of head positioning pose challenges for method development. A few automated image analysis pipelines exist for newborn brain MRI segmentation, but they often rely on time-consuming procedures and require resampling to a common resolution, subject to loss of information due to interpolation and down-sampling. Without registration and image resampling, variations with respect to head positions and voxel resolutions have to be addressed differently. In deep-learning, external augmentations are traditionally used to artificially expand the representation of spatial variability, increasing the training dataset size and robustness. However, these transformations in the image space still require resampling, reducing accuracy specifically in the context of label interpolation. We recently introduced the concept of resolution-independence with the Voxel-size Independent Neural Network framework, VINN. Here, we extend this concept by additionally shifting all rigid-transforms into the network architecture with a four degree of freedom (4-DOF) transform module, enabling resolution-aware internal augmentations (VINNA). In this work we show that VINNA (i) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art external augmentation approaches, (ii) effectively addresses the head variations present specifically in newborn datasets, and (iii) retains high segmentation accuracy across a range of resolutions (0.5-1.0 mm). The 4-DOF transform module is a powerful, general approach to implement spatial augmentation without requiring image or label interpolation. The specific network application to newborns will be made publicly available as VINNA4neonates.

- **Summary**: Tiger conservation necessitates the strategic deployment of multifaceted initiatives encompassing the preservation of ecological habitats, anti-poaching measures, and community involvement for sustainable growth in the tiger population. With the advent of artificial intelligence, tiger surveillance can be automated using object detection. In this paper, an accurate illumination invariant framework is proposed based on EnlightenGAN and YOLOv8 for tiger detection. The fine-tuned YOLOv8 model achieves a mAP score of 61% without illumination enhancement. The illumination enhancement improves the mAP by 0.7%. The approaches elevate the state-of-the-art performance on the ATRW dataset by approximately 6% to 7%.

- **Summary**: Image matching that finding robust and accurate correspondences across images is a challenging task under extreme conditions. Capturing local and global features simultaneously is an important way to mitigate such an issue but recent transformer-based decoders were still stuck in the issues that CNN-based encoders only extract local features and the transformers lack locality. Inspired by the locality and implicit positional encoding of convolutions, a novel convolutional transformer is proposed to capture both local contexts and global structures more sufficiently for detector-free matching. Firstly, a universal FPN-like framework captures global structures in self-encoder as well as cross-decoder by transformers and compensates local contexts as well as implicit positional encoding by convolutions. Secondly, a novel convolutional transformer module explores multi-scale long range dependencies by a novel multi-scale attention and further aggregates local information inside dependencies for enhancing locality. Finally, a novel regression-based sub-pixel refinement module exploits the whole fine-grained window features for fine-level positional deviation regression. The proposed method achieves superior performances on a wide range of benchmarks. The code will be available on https://github.com/zwh0527/LGFCTR.

- **Summary**: Face recognition technology is widely used in the financial field, and various types of liveness attack behaviors need to be addressed. Existing liveness detection algorithms are trained on specific training datasets and tested on testing datasets, but their performance and robustness in transferring to unseen datasets are relatively poor. To tackle this issue, we propose a face liveness detection method based on image-text pairs and contrastive learning, dividing liveness attack problems in the financial field into eight categories and using text information to describe the images of these eight types of attacks. The text encoder and image encoder are used to extract feature vector representations for the classification description text and face images, respectively. By maximizing the similarity of positive samples and minimizing the similarity of negative samples, the model learns shared representations between images and texts. The proposed method is capable of effectively detecting specific liveness attack behaviors in certain scenarios, such as those occurring in dark environments or involving the tampering of ID card photos. Additionally, it is also effective in detecting traditional liveness attack methods, such as printing photo attacks and screen remake attacks. The zero-shot capabilities of face liveness detection on five public datasets, including NUAA, CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, OULU-NPU and MSU-MFSD also reaches the level of commercial algorithms. The detection capability of proposed algorithm was verified on 5 types of testing datasets, and the results show that the method outperformed commercial algorithms, and the detection rates reached 100% on multiple datasets. Demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of introducing image-text pairs and contrastive learning into liveness detection tasks as proposed in this paper.

- **Summary**: Achieving high synchronization in the synthesis of realistic, speech-driven talking head videos presents a significant challenge. Traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) struggle to maintain consistent facial identity, while Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods, although they can address this issue, often produce mismatched lip movements, inadequate facial expressions, and unstable head poses. A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial expressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic and artificial outcomes. To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the "devil" in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk. This NeRF-based method effectively maintains subject identity, enhancing synchronization and realism in talking head synthesis. SyncTalk employs a Face-Sync Controller to align lip movements with speech and innovatively uses a 3D facial blendshape model to capture accurate facial expressions. Our Head-Sync Stabilizer optimizes head poses, achieving more natural head movements. The Portrait-Sync Generator restores hair details and blends the generated head with the torso for a seamless visual experience. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that SyncTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synchronization and realism.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have showcased its potential in tackling complex tasks. However, experiments on visual control tasks have revealed that state-of-the-art reinforcement learning models struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. Conversely, expressing higher-level concepts and global contexts is relatively easy using language.   Building upon recent success of the large language models, our main objective is to improve the state abstraction technique in reinforcement learning by leveraging language for robust action selection. Specifically, we focus on learning language-grounded visual features to enhance the world model learning, a model-based reinforcement learning technique.   To enforce our hypothesis explicitly, we mask out the bounding boxes of a few objects in the image observation and provide the text prompt as descriptions for these masked objects. Subsequently, we predict the masked objects along with the surrounding regions as pixel reconstruction, similar to the transformer-based masked autoencoder approach.   Our proposed LanGWM: Language Grounded World Model achieves state-of-the-art performance in out-of-distribution test at the 100K interaction steps benchmarks of iGibson point navigation tasks. Furthermore, our proposed technique of explicit language-grounded visual representation learning has the potential to improve models for human-robot interaction because our extracted visual features are language grounded.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning is an efficient pre-training method for medical image analysis. However, current research is mostly confined to specific-modality data pre-training, consuming considerable time and resources without achieving universality across different modalities. A straightforward solution is combining all modality data for joint self-supervised pre-training, which poses practical challenges. Firstly, our experiments reveal conflicts in representation learning as the number of modalities increases. Secondly, multi-modal data collected in advance cannot cover all real-world scenarios. In this paper, we reconsider versatile self-supervised learning from the perspective of continual learning and propose MedCoSS, a continuous self-supervised learning approach for multi-modal medical data. Unlike joint self-supervised learning, MedCoSS assigns different modality data to different training stages, forming a multi-stage pre-training process. To balance modal conflicts and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we propose a rehearsal-based continual learning method. We introduce the k-means sampling strategy to retain data from previous modalities and rehearse it when learning new modalities. Instead of executing the pretext task on buffer data, a feature distillation strategy and an intra-modal mixup strategy are applied to these data for knowledge retention. We conduct continuous self-supervised pre-training on a large-scale multi-modal unlabeled dataset, including clinical reports, X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and pathological images. Experimental results demonstrate MedCoSS's exceptional generalization ability across nine downstream datasets and its significant scalability in integrating new modality data.

- **Summary**: Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended. The security concerns surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively explored, yet the safety of Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) remains understudied. In our study, we present a novel visual prompt attack that exploits query-relevant images to jailbreak the open-source LMMs. Our method creates a composite image from one image generated by diffusion models and another that displays the text as typography, based on keywords extracted from a malicious query. We show LLMs can be easily attacked by our approach, even if the employed Large Language Models are safely aligned. To evaluate the extent of this vulnerability in open-source LMMs, we have compiled a substantial dataset encompassing 13 scenarios with a total of 5,040 text-image pairs, using our presented attack technique. Our evaluation of 12 cutting-edge LMMs using this dataset shows the vulnerability of existing multi-modal models on adversarial attacks. This finding underscores the need for a concerted effort to strengthen and enhance the safety measures of open-source LMMs against potential malicious exploits.

- **Summary**: Despite the effectiveness in improving the robustness of neural networks, adversarial training has suffered from the natural accuracy degradation problem, i.e., accuracy on natural samples has reduced significantly. In this study, we reveal that natural accuracy degradation is highly related to the disruption of the natural sample topology in the representation space by quantitative and qualitative experiments. Based on this observation, we propose Topology-pReserving Adversarial traINing (TRAIN) to alleviate the problem by preserving the topology structure of natural samples from a standard model trained only on natural samples during adversarial training. As an additional regularization, our method can easily be combined with various popular adversarial training algorithms in a plug-and-play manner, taking advantage of both sides. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet show that our proposed method achieves consistent and significant improvements over various strong baselines in most cases. Specifically, without additional data, our proposed method achieves up to 8.78% improvement in natural accuracy and 4.50% improvement in robust accuracy.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable advances that have been made in continual learning, the adversarial vulnerability of such methods has not been fully discussed. We delve into the adversarial robustness of memory-based continual learning algorithms and observe limited robustness improvement by directly applying adversarial training techniques. Preliminary studies reveal the twin challenges for building adversarial robust continual learners: accelerated forgetting in continual learning and gradient obfuscation in adversarial robustness. In this study, we put forward a novel adversarial robust memory-based continual learner that adjusts data logits to mitigate the forgetting of pasts caused by adversarial samples. Furthermore, we devise a gradient-based data selection mechanism to overcome the gradient obfuscation caused by limited stored data. The proposed approach can widely integrate with existing memory-based continual learning as well as adversarial training algorithms in a plug-and-play way. Extensive experiments on Split-CIFAR10/100 and Split-Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8.13% higher accuracy for adversarial data.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art diffusion models can generate highly realistic images based on various conditioning like text, segmentation, and depth. However, an essential aspect often overlooked is the specific camera geometry used during image capture. The influence of different optical systems on the final scene appearance is frequently overlooked. This study introduces a framework that intimately integrates a text-to-image diffusion model with the particular lens geometry used in image rendering. Our method is based on a per-pixel coordinate conditioning method, enabling the control over the rendering geometry. Notably, we demonstrate the manipulation of curvature properties, achieving diverse visual effects, such as fish-eye, panoramic views, and spherical texturing using a single diffusion model.

- **Summary**: The advent of large language models, enabling flexibility through instruction-driven approaches, has revolutionized many traditional generative tasks, but large models for 3D data, particularly in comprehensively handling 3D shapes with other modalities, are still under-explored. By achieving instruction-based shape generations, versatile multimodal generative shape models can significantly benefit various fields like 3D virtual construction and network-aided design. In this work, we present ShapeGPT, a shape-included multi-modal framework to leverage strong pre-trained language models to address multiple shape-relevant tasks. Specifically, ShapeGPT employs a word-sentence-paragraph framework to discretize continuous shapes into shape words, further assembles these words for shape sentences, as well as integrates shape with instructional text for multi-modal paragraphs. To learn this shape-language model, we use a three-stage training scheme, including shape representation, multimodal alignment, and instruction-based generation, to align shape-language codebooks and learn the intricate correlations among these modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShapeGPT achieves comparable performance across shape-relevant tasks, including text-to-shape, shape-to-text, shape completion, and shape editing.

- **Summary**: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of new categories given only a handful of annotated samples. Previous works focus their efforts on exploring the support information while paying less attention to the mining of the critical query branch. In this paper, we rethink the importance of support information and propose a new query-centric FSS model Adversarial Mining Transformer (AMFormer), which achieves accurate query image segmentation with only rough support guidance or even weak support labels. The proposed AMFormer enjoys several merits. First, we design an object mining transformer (G) that can achieve the expansion of incomplete region activated by support clue, and a detail mining transformer (D) to discriminate the detailed local difference between the expanded mask and the ground truth. Second, we propose to train G and D via an adversarial process, where G is optimized to generate more accurate masks approaching ground truth to fool D. We conduct extensive experiments on commonly used Pascal-5i and COCO-20i benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results across all settings. In addition, the decent performance with weak support labels in our query-centric paradigm may inspire the development of more general FSS models. Code will be available at https://github.com/Wyxdm/AMNet.

- **Summary**: Object instances in remote sensing images often distribute with multi-orientations, varying scales, and dense distribution. These issues bring challenges to end-to-end oriented object detectors including multi-scale features alignment and a large number of queries. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end oriented detector equipped with an efficient decoder, which incorporates two technologies, Rotated RoI attention (RRoI attention) and Selective Distinct Queries (SDQ). Specifically, RRoI attention effectively focuses on oriented regions of interest through a cross-attention mechanism and aligns multi-scale features. SDQ collects queries from intermediate decoder layers and then filters similar queries to obtain distinct queries. The proposed SDQ can facilitate the optimization of one-to-one label assignment, without introducing redundant initial queries or extra auxiliary branches. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DIOR-R (67.31% mAP), DOTA-v1.5 (67.43% mAP), and DOTA-v2.0 (53.28% mAP) with the ResNet50 backbone.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing novel views for urban environments is crucial for tasks like autonomous driving and virtual tours. Compared to object-level or indoor situations, outdoor settings present unique challenges, such as inconsistency across frames due to moving vehicles and camera pose drift over lengthy sequences. In this paper, we introduce a method that tackles these challenges on view synthesis for outdoor scenarios. We employ a neural point light field scene representation and strategically detect and mask out dynamic objects to reconstruct novel scenes without artifacts. Moreover, we simultaneously optimize camera pose along with the view synthesis process, and thus, we simultaneously refine both elements. Through validation on real-world urban datasets, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results in synthesizing novel views of urban scenes.

- **Summary**: Recent approaches for arbitrary-scale single image super-resolution (ASSR) have used local neural fields to represent continuous signals that can be sampled at different rates. However, in such formulation, the point-wise query of field values does not naturally match the point spread function (PSF) of a given pixel. In this work we present a novel way to design neural fields such that points can be queried with a Gaussian PSF, which serves as anti-aliasing when moving across resolutions for ASSR. We achieve this using a novel activation function derived from Fourier theory and the heat equation. This comes at no additional cost: querying a point with a Gaussian PSF in our framework does not affect computational cost, unlike filtering in the image domain. Coupled with a hypernetwork, our method not only provides theoretically guaranteed anti-aliasing, but also sets a new bar for ASSR while also being more parameter-efficient than previous methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce VISUAL EMBEDDED INSTRUCTION (VIM), a new framework designed to evaluate the visual instruction following capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). As illustrated in Figure 2, VIM challenges the MLLMs by embedding the instructions into the visual scenes, demanding strong visual interpretative skills for instruction following. We adapt VIM to various benchmarks, including VQAv2, MME, MM-Vet, and RefCOCO series, compose a VIM bench, and probe diverse MLLMs across three distinct in-context learning settings: Zero Shot, One Shot, and Pair Shot. We observe that there is a significant performance disparity between the open-source MLLMs and GPT-4V, implying that their proficiency in visual instruction comprehension is not up to par. Our results highlight a promising direction for the enhancement of MLLMs capabilities on instruction following. We aim VIM to serve as a useful norm for advancing the state of the art and driving further progress in the field.

- **Summary**: The task of deepfakes detection is far from being solved by speech or vision researchers. Several publicly available databases of fake synthetic video and speech were built to aid the development of detection methods. However, existing databases typically focus on visual or voice modalities and provide no proof that their deepfakes can in fact impersonate any real person. In this paper, we present the first realistic audio-visual database of deepfakes SWAN-DF, where lips and speech are well synchronized and video have high visual and audio qualities. We took the publicly available SWAN dataset of real videos with different identities to create audio-visual deepfakes using several models from DeepFaceLab and blending techniques for face swapping and HiFiVC, DiffVC, YourTTS, and FreeVC models for voice conversion. From the publicly available speech dataset LibriTTS, we also created a separate database of only audio deepfakes LibriTTS-DF using several latest text to speech methods: YourTTS, Adaspeech, and TorToiSe. We demonstrate the vulnerability of a state of the art speaker recognition system, such as ECAPA-TDNN-based model from SpeechBrain, to the synthetic voices. Similarly, we tested face recognition system based on the MobileFaceNet architecture to several variants of our visual deepfakes. The vulnerability assessment show that by tuning the existing pretrained deepfake models to specific identities, one can successfully spoof the face and speaker recognition systems in more than 90% of the time and achieve a very realistic looking and sounding fake video of a given person.

While conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are adept at tracking diverse objects, toddlers pose unique challenges due to their unpredictable movements, various poses, and similar appearance. Tracking toddlers in indoor environments introduces additional complexities such as occlusions and limited fields of view. In this paper, we address the challenges of MTT and propose MTTSort, a customized method built upon the DeepSort algorithm. MTTSort is designed to track multiple toddlers in indoor videos accurately. Our contributions include discussing the primary challenges in MTT, introducing a genetic algorithm to optimize hyperparameters, proposing an accurate tracking algorithm, and curating the MTTrack dataset using unbiased AI co-labeling techniques. We quantitatively compare MTTSort to state-of-the-art MOT methods on MTTrack, DanceTrack, and MOT15 datasets. In our evaluation, the proposed method outperformed other MOT methods, achieving 0.98, 0.68, and 0.98 in multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA), and iterative and discriminative framework 1 (IDF1) metrics, respectively.

- **Summary**: Volumetric phenomena, such as clouds and fog, present a significant challenge for 3D reconstruction systems due to their translucent nature and their complex interactions with light. Conventional techniques for reconstructing scattering volumes rely on controlled setups, limiting practical applications. This paper introduces an approach to reconstructing volumes from a few input stereo pairs. We propose a novel deep learning framework that integrates a deep stereo model with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) and an advection module, capable of capturing the shape and dynamics of volumes. The stereo depths are used to carve empty space around volumes, providing the 3D CNN with a prior for coping with the lack of input views. Refining our output, the advection module leverages the temporal evolution of the medium, providing a mechanism to infer motion and improve temporal consistency. The efficacy of our system is demonstrated through its ability to estimate density and velocity fields of large-scale volumes, in this case, clouds, from a sparse set of stereo image pairs.

- **Summary**: Understanding how the surrounding environment changes is crucial for performing downstream tasks safely and reliably in autonomous driving applications. Recent occupancy estimation techniques using only camera images as input can provide dense occupancy representations of large-scale scenes based on the current observation. However, they are mostly limited to representing the current 3D space and do not consider the future state of surrounding objects along the time axis. To extend camera-only occupancy estimation into spatiotemporal prediction, we propose Cam4DOcc, a new benchmark for camera-only 4D occupancy forecasting, evaluating the surrounding scene changes in a near future. We build our benchmark based on multiple publicly available datasets, including nuScenes, nuScenes-Occupancy, and Lyft-Level5, which provides sequential occupancy states of general movable and static objects, as well as their 3D backward centripetal flow. To establish this benchmark for future research with comprehensive comparisons, we introduce four baseline types from diverse camera-based perception and prediction implementations, including a static-world occupancy model, voxelization of point cloud prediction, 2D-3D instance-based prediction, and our proposed novel end-to-end 4D occupancy forecasting network. Furthermore, the standardized evaluation protocol for preset multiple tasks is also provided to compare the performance of all the proposed baselines on present and future occupancy estimation with respect to objects of interest in autonomous driving scenarios. The dataset and our implementation of all four baselines in the proposed Cam4DOcc benchmark will be released here: https://github.com/haomo-ai/Cam4DOcc.

- **Summary**: The global ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic remain significant, exerting persistent pressure on nations even three years after its initial outbreak. Deep learning models have shown promise in improving COVID-19 diagnostics but require diverse and larger-scale datasets to improve performance. In this paper, we introduce COVIDx CXR-4, an expanded multi-institutional open-source benchmark dataset for chest X-ray image-based computer-aided COVID-19 diagnostics. COVIDx CXR-4 expands significantly on the previous COVIDx CXR-3 dataset by increasing the total patient cohort size by greater than 2.66 times, resulting in 84,818 images from 45,342 patients across multiple institutions. We provide extensive analysis on the diversity of the patient demographic, imaging metadata, and disease distributions to highlight potential dataset biases. To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVIDx CXR-4 is the largest and most diverse open-source COVID-19 CXR dataset and is made publicly available as part of an open initiative to advance research to aid clinicians against the COVID-19 disease.

- **Summary**: Robotic-assisted surgical systems have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing surgical precision and minimizing human errors. However, existing systems lack the ability to accommodate the unique preferences and requirements of individual surgeons. Additionally, they primarily focus on general surgeries (e.g., laparoscopy) and are not suitable for highly precise microsurgeries, such as ophthalmic procedures. Thus, we propose a simulation-based image-guided approach for surgeon-centered autonomous agents that can adapt to the individual surgeon's skill level and preferred surgical techniques during ophthalmic cataract surgery. Our approach utilizes a simulated environment to train reinforcement and imitation learning agents guided by image data to perform all tasks of the incision phase of cataract surgery. By integrating the surgeon's actions and preferences into the training process with the surgeon-in-the-loop, our approach enables the robot to implicitly learn and adapt to the individual surgeon's unique approach through demonstrations. This results in a more intuitive and personalized surgical experience for the surgeon. Simultaneously, it ensures consistent performance for the autonomous robotic apprentice. We define and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using our proposed metrics; and highlight the trade-off between a generic agent and a surgeon-centered adapted agent. Moreover, our approach has the potential to extend to other ophthalmic surgical procedures, opening the door to a new generation of surgeon-in-the-loop autonomous surgical robots. We provide an open-source simulation framework for future development and reproducibility.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the limitations of existing text-to-image diffusion models in generating demographically fair results when given human-related descriptions. These models often struggle to disentangle the target language context from sociocultural biases, resulting in biased image generation. To overcome this challenge, we propose Fair Mapping, a general, model-agnostic, and lightweight approach that modifies a pre-trained text-to-image model by controlling the prompt to achieve fair image generation. One key advantage of our approach is its high efficiency. The training process only requires updating a small number of parameters in an additional linear mapping network. This not only reduces the computational cost but also accelerates the optimization process. We first demonstrate the issue of bias in generated results caused by language biases in text-guided diffusion models. By developing a mapping network that projects language embeddings into an unbiased space, we enable the generation of relatively balanced demographic results based on a keyword specified in the prompt. With comprehensive experiments on face image generation, we show that our method significantly improves image generation performance when prompted with descriptions related to human faces. By effectively addressing the issue of bias, we produce more fair and diverse image outputs. This work contributes to the field of text-to-image generation by enhancing the ability to generate images that accurately reflect the intended demographic characteristics specified in the text.

- **Summary**: We introduce SAMPro3D for zero-shot 3D indoor scene segmentation. Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed 2D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D scenes by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating 3D points in scenes as natural 3D prompts to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring frame-consistency in both pixel prompts and their SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest filtering out low-quality 3D prompts based on feedback from all 2D frames, for enhancing segmentation quality. We also propose to consolidate different 3D prompts if they are segmenting the same object, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training on domain-specific data, enabling us to preserve the zero-shot power of SAM. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that our method consistently achieves higher quality and more diverse segmentation than previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases even surpasses human-level annotations.

- **Summary**: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models aims to disable pre-trained diffusion models from generating images related to a target concept. To perform reliable concept erasure, the properties of robustness and locality are desirable. The former refrains the model from producing images associated with the target concept for any paraphrased or learned prompts, while the latter preserves the model ability in generating images for non-target concepts. In this paper, we propose Reliable Concept Erasing via Lightweight Erasers (Receler), which learns a lightweight Eraser to perform concept erasing and enhances locality and robustness with the proposed concept-localized regularization and adversarial prompt learning, respectively. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with various concept prompts verify the superiority of Receler over the previous erasing methods on the above two desirable properties.

- **Summary**: Can we synthesize 3D humans interacting with scenes without learning from any 3D human-scene interaction data? We propose GenZI, the first zero-shot approach to generating 3D human-scene interactions. Key to GenZI is our distillation of interaction priors from large vision-language models (VLMs), which have learned a rich semantic space of 2D human-scene compositions. Given a natural language description and a coarse point location of the desired interaction in a 3D scene, we first leverage VLMs to imagine plausible 2D human interactions inpainted into multiple rendered views of the scene. We then formulate a robust iterative optimization to synthesize the pose and shape of a 3D human model in the scene, guided by consistency with the 2D interaction hypotheses. In contrast to existing learning-based approaches, GenZI circumvents the conventional need for captured 3D interaction data, and allows for flexible control of the 3D interaction synthesis with easy-to-use text prompts. Extensive experiments show that our zero-shot approach has high flexibility and generality, making it applicable to diverse scene types, including both indoor and outdoor environments.

- **Summary**: Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization of the latent MAP. In this work, we propose to use compressive autoencoders for latent estimation. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. We then introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs this estimation within the framework of variational inference. This allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.

- **Summary**: Banding, also known as staircase-like contours, frequently occurs in flat areas of images/videos processed by the compression or quantization algorithms. As undesirable artifacts, banding destroys the original image structure, thus degrading users' quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we systematically investigate the banding image quality assessment (IQA) problem, aiming to detect the image banding artifacts and evaluate their perceptual visual quality. Considering that the existing image banding databases only contain limited content sources and banding generation methods, and lack perceptual quality labels (i.e. mean opinion scores), we first build the largest banding IQA database so far, named Banding Artifact Noticeable Database (BAND-2k), which consists of 2,000 banding images generated by 15 compression and quantization schemes. A total of 23 workers participated in the subjective IQA experiment, yielding over 214,000 patch-level banding class labels and 44,371 reliable image-level quality ratings. Subsequently, we develop an effective no-reference (NR) banding evaluator for banding detection and quality assessment by leveraging frequency characteristics of banding artifacts. A dual convolutional neural network is employed to concurrently learn the feature representation from the high-frequency and low-frequency maps, thereby enhancing the ability to discern banding artifacts. The quality score of a banding image is generated by pooling the banding detection maps masked by the spatial frequency filters. Experiments demonstrate that our banding evaluator achieves a remarkably high accuracy in banding detection and also exhibits high SRCC and PLCC results with the perceptual quality labels. These findings unveil the strong correlations between the intensity of banding artifacts and the perceptual visual quality, thus validating the necessity of banding quality assessment.

- **Summary**: In the evolving landscape of digital media and video production, the precise manipulation and reproduction of visual elements like camera movements and character actions are highly desired. Existing SLAM methods face limitations in dynamic scenes and human pose estimation often focuses on 2D projections, neglecting 3D statuses. To address these issues, we first introduce a reverse filming behavior estimation technique. It optimizes camera trajectories by leveraging NeRF as a differentiable renderer and refining SMPL tracks. We then introduce a cinematic transfer pipeline that is able to transfer various shot types to a new 2D video or a 3D virtual environment. The incorporation of 3D engine workflow enables superior rendering and control abilities, which also achieves a higher rating in the user study.

- **Summary**: This paper shows the effectiveness of 2D backbone scaling and pretraining for pillar-based 3D object detectors. Pillar-based methods mainly employ randomly initialized 2D convolution neural network (ConvNet) for feature extraction and fail to enjoy the benefits from the backbone scaling and pretraining in the image domain. To show the scaling-up capacity in point clouds, we introduce the dense ConvNet pretrained on large-scale image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) as the 2D backbone of pillar-based detectors. The ConvNets are adaptively designed based on the model size according to the specific features of point clouds, such as sparsity and irregularity. Equipped with the pretrained ConvNets, our proposed pillar-based detector, termed PillarNeSt, outperforms the existing 3D object detectors by a large margin on the nuScenes and Argoversev2 datasets. Our code shall be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: We introduce One-shot Open Affordance Learning (OOAL), where a model is trained with just one example per base object category, but is expected to identify novel objects and affordances. While vision-language models excel at recognizing novel objects and scenes, they often struggle to understand finer levels of granularity such as affordances. To handle this issue, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing foundation models, to explore their inherent understanding of affordances and assess the potential for data-limited affordance learning. We then propose a vision-language framework with simple and effective designs that boost the alignment between visual features and affordance text embeddings. Experiments on two affordance segmentation benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models with less than 1% of the full training data, and exhibits reasonable generalization capability on unseen objects and affordances.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce U-Net v2, a new robust and efficient U-Net variant for medical image segmentation. It aims to augment the infusion of semantic information into low-level features while simultaneously refining high-level features with finer details. For an input image, we begin by extracting multi-level features with a deep neural network encoder. Next, we enhance the feature map of each level by infusing semantic information from higher-level features and integrating finer details from lower-level features through Hadamard product. Our novel skip connections empower features of all the levels with enriched semantic characteristics and intricate details. The improved features are subsequently transmitted to the decoder for further processing and segmentation. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any Encoder-Decoder network. We evaluate our method on several public medical image segmentation datasets for skin lesion segmentation and polyp segmentation, and the experimental results demonstrate the segmentation accuracy of our new method over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving memory and computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and pathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a feature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are subsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI label. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new feature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged. Traditional evaluation methods, however, rely on fixed aggregation model hyperparameters, a framework we identify as potentially biasing the results. Our study uncovers a co-dependence between feature extractor models and aggregation model hyperparameters, indicating that performance comparability can be skewed based on the chosen hyperparameters. By accounting for this co-dependency, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor models is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature extractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation model configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between feature extractors and aggregation models, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of feature extractor models in digital pathology.

- **Summary**: Historical buildings are a treasure and milestone of human cultural heritage. Reconstructing the 3D models of these building hold significant value. The rapid development of neural rendering methods makes it possible to recover the 3D shape only based on archival photographs. However, this task presents considerable challenges due to the limitations of such datasets. Historical photographs are often limited in number and the scenes in these photos might have altered over time. The radiometric quality of these images is also often sub-optimal. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach to reconstruct the geometry of historical buildings, employing volumetric rendering techniques. We leverage dense point clouds as a geometric prior and introduce a color appearance embedding loss to recover the color of the building given limited available color images. We aim for our work to spark increased interest and focus on preserving historical buildings. Thus, we also introduce a new historical dataset of the Hungarian National Theater, providing a new benchmark for the reconstruction method.

- **Summary**: Following language instructions to navigate in unseen environments is a challenging task for autonomous embodied agents. With strong representation capabilities, pretrained vision-and-language models are widely used in VLN. However, most of them are trained on web-crawled general-purpose datasets, which incurs a considerable domain gap when used for VLN tasks. To address the problem, we propose a novel and model-agnostic domain-aware prompt learning (DAP) framework. For equipping the pretrained models with specific object-level and scene-level cross-modal alignment in VLN tasks, DAP applies a low-cost prompt tuning paradigm to learn soft visual prompts for extracting in-domain image semantics. Specifically, we first generate a set of in-domain image-text pairs with the help of the CLIP model. Then we introduce soft visual prompts in the input space of the visual encoder in a pretrained model. DAP injects in-domain visual knowledge into the visual encoder of the pretrained model in an efficient way. Experimental results on both R2R and REVERIE show the superiority of DAP compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: While deep learning has led to huge progress in complex image classification tasks like ImageNet, unexpected failure modes, e.g. via spurious features, call into question how reliably these classifiers work in the wild. Furthermore, for safety-critical tasks the black-box nature of their decisions is problematic, and explanations or at least methods which make decisions plausible are needed urgently. In this paper, we address these problems by generating images that optimize a classifier-derived objective using a framework for guided image generation. We analyze the behavior and decisions of image classifiers by visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs), detection of systematic mistakes by analyzing images where classifiers maximally disagree, and visualization of neurons to verify potential spurious features. In this way, we validate existing observations, e.g. the shape bias of adversarially robust models, as well as novel failure modes, e.g. systematic errors of zero-shot CLIP classifiers, or identify harmful spurious features. Moreover, our VCEs outperform previous work while being more versatile.

- **Summary**: We are witnessing rapid progress in automatically generating and manipulating 3D assets due to the availability of pretrained text-image diffusion models. However, time-consuming optimization procedures are required for synthesizing each sample, hindering their potential for democratizing 3D content creation. Conversely, 3D diffusion models now train on million-scale 3D datasets, yielding high-quality text-conditional 3D samples within seconds. In this work, we present SPiC-E - a neural network that adds structural guidance to 3D diffusion models, extending their usage beyond text-conditional generation. At its core, our framework introduces a cross-entity attention mechanism that allows for multiple entities (in particular, paired input and guidance 3D shapes) to interact via their internal representations within the denoising network. We utilize this mechanism for learning task-specific structural priors in 3D diffusion models from auxiliary guidance shapes. We show that our approach supports a variety of applications, including 3D stylization, semantic shape editing and text-conditional abstraction-to-3D, which transforms primitive-based abstractions into highly-expressive shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPiC-E achieves SOTA performance over these tasks while often being considerably faster than alternative methods. Importantly, this is accomplished without tailoring our approach for any specific task.

- **Summary**: In this study, we are interested in imbuing robots with the capability of physically-grounded task planning. Recent advancements have shown that large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge useful in robotic tasks, especially in reasoning and planning. However, LLMs are constrained by their lack of world grounding and dependence on external affordance models to perceive environmental information, which cannot jointly reason with LLMs. We argue that a task planner should be an inherently grounded, unified multimodal system. To this end, we introduce Robotic Vision-Language Planning (ViLa), a novel approach for long-horizon robotic planning that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate a sequence of actionable steps. ViLa directly integrates perceptual data into its reasoning and planning process, enabling a profound understanding of commonsense knowledge in the visual world, including spatial layouts and object attributes. It also supports flexible multimodal goal specification and naturally incorporates visual feedback. Our extensive evaluation, conducted in both real-robot and simulated environments, demonstrates ViLa's superiority over existing LLM-based planners, highlighting its effectiveness in a wide array of open-world manipulation tasks.

- **Summary**: Focus stacking is widely used in micro, macro, and landscape photography to reconstruct all-in-focus images from multiple frames obtained with focus bracketing, that is, with shallow depth of field and different focus planes. Existing deep learning approaches to the underlying multi-focus image fusion problem have limited applicability to real-world imagery since they are designed for very short image sequences (two to four images), and are typically trained on small, low-resolution datasets either acquired by light-field cameras or generated synthetically. We introduce a new dataset consisting of 94 high-resolution bursts of raw images with focus bracketing, with pseudo ground truth computed from the data using state-of-the-art commercial software. This dataset is used to train the first deep learning algorithm for focus stacking capable of handling bursts of sufficient length for real-world applications. Qualitative experiments demonstrate that it is on par with existing commercial solutions in the long-burst, realistic regime while being significantly more tolerant to noise. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/araujoalexandre/FocusStackingDataset.

- **Summary**: Unlabeled 3D objects present an opportunity to leverage pretrained vision language models (VLMs) on a range of annotation tasks -- from describing object semantics to physical properties. An accurate response must take into account the full appearance of the object in 3D, various ways of phrasing the question/prompt, and changes in other factors that affect the response. We present a method to marginalize over any factors varied across VLM queries, utilizing the VLM's scores for sampled responses. We first show that this probabilistic aggregation can outperform a language model (e.g., GPT4) for summarization, for instance avoiding hallucinations when there are contrasting details between responses. Secondly, we show that aggregated annotations are useful for prompt-chaining; they help improve downstream VLM predictions (e.g., of object material when the object's type is specified as an auxiliary input in the prompt). Such auxiliary inputs allow ablating and measuring the contribution of visual reasoning over language-only reasoning. Using these evaluations, we show how VLMs can approach, without additional training or in-context learning, the quality of human-verified type and material annotations on the large-scale Objaverse dataset.

- **Summary**: Efficient generation of 3D digital humans is important in several industries, including virtual reality, social media, and cinematic production. 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality and diversity for generated assets. Current 3D GAN architectures, however, typically rely on volume representations, which are slow to render, thereby hampering the GAN training and requiring multi-view-inconsistent 2D upsamplers. Here, we introduce Gaussian Shell Maps (GSMs) as a framework that connects SOTA generator network architectures with emerging 3D Gaussian rendering primitives using an articulable multi shell--based scaffold. In this setting, a CNN generates a 3D texture stack with features that are mapped to the shells. The latter represent inflated and deflated versions of a template surface of a digital human in a canonical body pose. Instead of rasterizing the shells directly, we sample 3D Gaussians on the shells whose attributes are encoded in the texture features. These Gaussians are efficiently and differentiably rendered. The ability to articulate the shells is important during GAN training and, at inference time, to deform a body into arbitrary user-defined poses. Our efficient rendering scheme bypasses the need for view-inconsistent upsamplers and achieves high-quality multi-view consistent renderings at a native resolution of $512 \times 512$ pixels. We demonstrate that GSMs successfully generate 3D humans when trained on single-view datasets, including SHHQ and DeepFashion.

- **Summary**: This study addresses the challenging problem of active view selection and uncertainty quantification within the domain of Radiance Fields. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have greatly advanced image rendering and reconstruction, but the limited availability of 2D images poses uncertainties stemming from occlusions, depth ambiguities, and imaging errors. Efficiently selecting informative views becomes crucial, and quantifying NeRF model uncertainty presents intricate challenges. Existing approaches either depend on model architecture or are based on assumptions regarding density distributions that are not generally applicable. By leveraging Fisher Information, we efficiently quantify observed information within Radiance Fields without ground truth data. This can be used for the next best view selection and pixel-wise uncertainty quantification. Our method overcomes existing limitations on model architecture and effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both view selection and uncertainty quantification, demonstrating its potential to advance the field of Radiance Fields. Our method with the 3D Gaussian Splatting backend could perform view selections at 70 fps.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks, while powerful for image classification, often operate as "black boxes," complicating the understanding of their decision-making processes. Various explanation methods, particularly those generating saliency maps, aim to address this challenge. However, the inconsistency issues of faithfulness metrics hinder reliable benchmarking of explanation methods. This paper employs an approach inspired by psychometrics, utilizing Krippendorf's alpha to quantify the benchmark reliability of post-hoc methods in image classification. The study proposes model training modifications, including feeding perturbed samples and employing focal loss, to enhance robustness and calibration. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in benchmark reliability across metrics, datasets, and post-hoc methods. This pioneering work establishes a foundation for more reliable evaluation practices in the realm of post-hoc explanation methods, emphasizing the importance of model robustness in the assessment process.

- **Summary**: Multi-view neural surface reconstruction has exhibited impressive results. However, a notable limitation is the prohibitively slow inference time when compared to traditional techniques, primarily attributed to the dense sampling, required to maintain the rendering quality. This paper introduces a novel approach that substantially reduces the number of samplings by incorporating the Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) of the scene. While prior works have proposed importance sampling, their dependence on initial uniform samples over the entire space makes them unable to avoid performance degradation when trying to use less number of samples. In contrast, our method leverages the TSDF volume generated only by the trained views, and it proves to provide a reasonable bound on the sampling from upcoming novel views. As a result, we achieve high rendering quality by fully exploiting the continuous neural SDF estimation within the bounds given by the TSDF volume. Notably, our method is the first approach that can be robustly plug-and-play into a diverse array of neural surface field models, as long as they use the volume rendering technique. Our empirical results show an 11-fold increase in inference speed without compromising performance. The result videos are available at our project page: https://tsdf-sampling.github.io/

- **Summary**: Traditional 2D pose estimation models are limited by their category-specific design, making them suitable only for predefined object categories. This restriction becomes particularly challenging when dealing with novel objects due to the lack of relevant training data.   To address this limitation, category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) was introduced. CAPE aims to enable keypoint localization for arbitrary object categories using a single model, requiring minimal support images with annotated keypoints. This approach not only enables object pose generation based on arbitrary keypoint definitions but also significantly reduces the associated costs, paving the way for versatile and adaptable pose estimation applications.   We present a novel approach to CAPE that leverages the inherent geometrical relations between keypoints through a newly designed Graph Transformer Decoder. By capturing and incorporating this crucial structural information, our method enhances the accuracy of keypoint localization, marking a significant departure from conventional CAPE techniques that treat keypoints as isolated entities.   We validate our approach on the MP-100 benchmark, a comprehensive dataset comprising over 20,000 images spanning more than 100 categories. Our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by substantial margins, achieving remarkable improvements of 2.16% and 1.82% under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively. Furthermore, our method's end-to-end training demonstrates both scalability and efficiency compared to previous CAPE approaches.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised video object segmentation (VOS). Our key insight is that the inherent structural dependencies present in DINO-pretrained Transformers can be leveraged to establish robust spatio-temporal correspondences in videos. Furthermore, simple clustering on this correspondence cue is sufficient to yield competitive segmentation results. Previous self-supervised VOS techniques majorly resort to auxiliary modalities or utilize iterative slot attention to assist in object discovery, which restricts their general applicability and imposes higher computational requirements. To deal with these challenges, we develop a simplified architecture that capitalizes on the emerging objectness from DINO-pretrained Transformers, bypassing the need for additional modalities or slot attention. Specifically, we first introduce a single spatio-temporal Transformer block to process the frame-wise DINO features and establish spatio-temporal dependencies in the form of self-attention. Subsequently, utilizing these attention maps, we implement hierarchical clustering to generate object segmentation masks. To train the spatio-temporal block in a fully self-supervised manner, we employ semantic and dynamic motion consistency coupled with entropy normalization. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple unsupervised VOS benchmarks and particularly excels in complex real-world multi-object video segmentation tasks such as DAVIS-17-Unsupervised and YouTube-VIS-19. The code and model checkpoints will be released at https://github.com/shvdiwnkozbw/SSL-UVOS.

- **Summary**: Hallucinations and unfaithful synthesis due to inaccurate prompts with insufficient semantic details are widely observed in multimodal generative models. A prevalent strategy to align multiple modalities is to fine-tune the generator with a large number of annotated text-image pairs. However, such a procedure is labor-consuming and resource-draining. The key question we ask is: can we enhance the quality and faithfulness of text-driven generative models beyond extensive text-image pair annotations? To address this question, we propose Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP), a zero-shot framework that iteratively incorporates external knowledge to help generators produce reliable visual content. Instead of training generators to handle generic prompts, KPP employs a recursive knowledge query process to gather informative external facts from the knowledge base, instructs a language model to compress the acquired knowledge for prompt refinement, and utilizes text-driven generators for visual synthesis. The entire process is zero-shot, without accessing the architectures and parameters of generative models. We evaluate the framework across multiple text-driven generative tasks (image, 3D rendering, and video) on datasets of different domains. We further demonstrate the extensibility and adaptability of KPP through varying foundation model bases and instructions. Our results show that KPP is capable of generating faithful and semantically rich content across diverse visual domains, offering a promising solution to improve multimodal generative models.

- **Summary**: We introduce SODA, a self-supervised diffusion model, designed for representation learning. The model incorporates an image encoder, which distills a source view into a compact representation, that, in turn, guides the generation of related novel views. We show that by imposing a tight bottleneck between the encoder and a denoising decoder, and leveraging novel view synthesis as a self-supervised objective, we can turn diffusion models into strong representation learners, capable of capturing visual semantics in an unsupervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, SODA is the first diffusion model to succeed at ImageNet linear-probe classification, and, at the same time, it accomplishes reconstruction, editing and synthesis tasks across a wide range of datasets. Further investigation reveals the disentangled nature of its emergent latent space, that serves as an effective interface to control and manipulate the model's produced images. All in all, we aim to shed light on the exciting and promising potential of diffusion models, not only for image generation, but also for learning rich and robust representations.

- **Summary**: We present a new open-vocabulary detection framework. Our framework uses both image-level labels and detailed detection annotations when available. Our framework proceeds in three steps. We first train a language-conditioned object detector on fully-supervised detection data. This detector gets to see the presence or absence of ground truth classes during training, and conditions prediction on the set of present classes. We use this detector to pseudo-label images with image-level labels. Our detector provides much more accurate pseudo-labels than prior approaches with its conditioning mechanism. Finally, we train an unconditioned open-vocabulary detector on the pseudo-annotated images. The resulting detector, named DECOLA, shows strong zero-shot performance in open-vocabulary LVIS benchmark as well as direct zero-shot transfer benchmarks on LVIS, COCO, Object365, and OpenImages. DECOLA outperforms the prior arts by 17.1 AP-rare and 9.4 mAP on zero-shot LVIS benchmark. DECOLA achieves state-of-the-art results in various model sizes, architectures, and datasets by only training on open-sourced data and academic-scale computing.

- **Summary**: With the onset of diffusion-based generative models and their ability to generate text-conditioned images, content generation has received a massive invigoration. Recently, these models have been shown to provide useful guidance for the generation of 3D graphics assets. However, existing work in text-conditioned 3D generation faces fundamental constraints: (i) inability to generate detailed, multi-object scenes, (ii) inability to textually control multi-object configurations, and (iii) physically realistic scene composition. In this work, we propose CG3D, a method for compositionally generating scalable 3D assets that resolves these constraints. We find that explicit Gaussian radiance fields, parameterized to allow for compositions of objects, possess the capability to enable semantically and physically consistent scenes. By utilizing a guidance framework built around this explicit representation, we show state of the art results, capable of even exceeding the guiding diffusion model in terms of object combinations and physics accuracy.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in neural rendering have improved both training and rendering times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work, we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g. cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model. Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose synthesis of human and novel view synthesis of both the human and the scene. We achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality with a rendering speed of 60 FPS while being ~100x faster to train over previous work.

- **Summary**: Hallucination, posed as a pervasive challenge of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), has significantly impeded their real-world usage that demands precise judgment. Existing methods mitigate this issue with either training with specific designed data or inferencing with external knowledge from other sources, incurring inevitable additional costs. In this paper, we present OPERA, a novel MLLM decoding method grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and a Retrospection-Allocation strategy, serving as a nearly free lunch to alleviate the hallucination issue without additional data, knowledge, or training. Our approach begins with an interesting observation that, most hallucinations are closely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the self-attention matrix, i.e., MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on a few summary tokens, but not all the previous tokens. Such partial over-trust inclination results in the neglecting of image tokens and describes the image content with hallucination. Statistically, we observe an 80%$\sim$95% co-currency rate between hallucination contents and such knowledge aggregation patterns. Based on the observation, OPERA introduces a penalty term on the model logits during the beam-search decoding to mitigate the over-trust issue, along with a rollback strategy that retrospects the presence of summary tokens in the previously generated tokens, and re-allocate the token selection if necessary. With extensive experiments, OPERA shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics, proving its effectiveness and generality.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of creating high-fidelity and animatable 3D avatars from only textual descriptions. Existing text-to-avatar methods are either limited to static avatars which cannot be animated or struggle to generate animatable avatars with promising quality and precise pose control. To address these limitations, we propose AvatarStudio, a coarse-to-fine generative model that generates explicit textured 3D meshes for animatable human avatars. Specifically, AvatarStudio begins with a low-resolution NeRF-based representation for coarse generation, followed by incorporating SMPL-guided articulation into the explicit mesh representation to support avatar animation and high resolution rendering. To ensure view consistency and pose controllability of the resulting avatars, we introduce a 2D diffusion model conditioned on DensePose for Score Distillation Sampling supervision. By effectively leveraging the synergy between the articulated mesh representation and the DensePose-conditional diffusion model, AvatarStudio can create high-quality avatars from text that are ready for animation, significantly outperforming previous methods. Moreover, it is competent for many applications, e.g., multimodal avatar animations and style-guided avatar creation.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, predicting future events in advance and evaluating the foreseeable risks empowers autonomous vehicles to better plan their actions, enhancing safety and efficiency on the road. To this end, we propose Drive-WM, the first driving world model compatible with existing end-to-end planning models. Through a joint spatial-temporal modeling facilitated by view factorization, our model generates high-fidelity multiview videos in driving scenes. Building on its powerful generation ability, we showcase the potential of applying the world model for safe driving planning for the first time. Particularly, our Drive-WM enables driving into multiple futures based on distinct driving maneuvers, and determines the optimal trajectory according to the image-based rewards. Evaluation on real-world driving datasets verifies that our method could generate high-quality, consistent, and controllable multiview videos, opening up possibilities for real-world simulations and safe planning.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of synthesizing multi-view optical illusions: images that change appearance upon a transformation, such as a flip or rotation. We propose a simple, zero-shot method for obtaining these illusions from off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models. During the reverse diffusion process, we estimate the noise from different views of a noisy image. We then combine these noise estimates together and denoise the image. A theoretical analysis suggests that this method works precisely for views that can be written as orthogonal transformations, of which permutations are a subset. This leads to the idea of a visual anagram--an image that changes appearance under some rearrangement of pixels. This includes rotations and flips, but also more exotic pixel permutations such as a jigsaw rearrangement. Our approach also naturally extends to illusions with more than two views. We provide both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.

- **Summary**: While many unsupervised learning models focus on one family of tasks, either generative or discriminative, we explore the possibility of a unified representation learner: a model which addresses both families of tasks simultaneously. We identify diffusion models, a state-of-the-art method for generative tasks, as a prime candidate. Such models involve training a U-Net to iteratively predict and remove noise, and the resulting model can synthesize high-fidelity, diverse, novel images. We find that the intermediate feature maps of the U-Net are diverse, discriminative feature representations. We propose a novel attention mechanism for pooling feature maps and further leverage this mechanism as DifFormer, a transformer feature fusion of features from different diffusion U-Net blocks and noise steps. We also develop DifFeed, a novel feedback mechanism tailored to diffusion. We find that diffusion models are better than GANs, and, with our fusion and feedback mechanisms, can compete with state-of-the-art unsupervised image representation learning methods for discriminative tasks - image classification with full and semi-supervision, transfer for fine-grained classification, object detection and segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Generalization to new domains not seen during training is one of the long-standing goals and challenges in deploying neural networks in real-world applications. Existing generalization techniques necessitate substantial data augmentation, potentially sourced from external datasets, and aim at learning invariant representations by imposing various alignment constraints. Large-scale pretraining has recently shown promising generalization capabilities, along with the potential of bridging different modalities. For instance, the recent advent of vision-language models like CLIP has opened the doorway for vision models to exploit the textual modality. In this paper, we introduce a simple framework for generalizing semantic segmentation networks by employing language as the source of randomization. Our recipe comprises three key ingredients: i) the preservation of the intrinsic CLIP robustness through minimal fine-tuning, ii) language-driven local style augmentation, and iii) randomization by locally mixing the source and augmented styles during training. Extensive experiments report state-of-the-art results on various generalization benchmarks. The code will be made available.

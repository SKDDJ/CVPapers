- **Summary**: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation, but their real-world applications are hampered by the extensive time needed for hundreds of diffusion steps. Although progressive distillation has been proposed to speed up diffusion sampling to 2-8 steps, it still falls short in one-step generation, and necessitates training multiple student models, which is highly parameter-extensive and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce High-frequency-Promoting Adaptation (HiPA), a parameter-efficient approach to enable one-step text-to-image diffusion. Grounded in the insight that high-frequency information is essential but highly lacking in one-step diffusion, HiPA focuses on training one-step, low-rank adaptors to specifically enhance the under-represented high-frequency abilities of advanced diffusion models. The learned adaptors empower these diffusion models to generate high-quality images in just a single step. Compared with progressive distillation, HiPA achieves much better performance in one-step text-to-image generation (37.3 $\rightarrow$ 23.8 in FID-5k on MS-COCO 2017) and 28.6x training speed-up (108.8 $\rightarrow$ 3.8 A100 GPU days), requiring only 0.04% training parameters (7,740 million $\rightarrow$ 3.3 million). We also demonstrate HiPA's effectiveness in text-guided image editing, inpainting and super-resolution tasks, where our adapted models consistently deliver high-quality outputs in just one diffusion step. The source code will be released.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting is a new method for modeling and rendering 3D radiance fields that achieves much faster learning and rendering time compared to SOTA NeRF methods. However, it comes with a drawback in the much larger storage demand compared to NeRF methods since it needs to store the parameters for several 3D Gaussians. We notice that many Gaussians may share similar parameters, so we introduce a simple vector quantization method based on \kmeans algorithm to quantize the Gaussian parameters. Then, we store the small codebook along with the index of the code for each Gaussian. Moreover, we compress the indices further by sorting them and using a method similar to run-length encoding. We do extensive experiments on standard benchmarks as well as a new benchmark which is an order of magnitude larger than the standard benchmarks. We show that our simple yet effective method can reduce the storage cost for the original 3D Gaussian Splatting method by a factor of almost $20\times$ with a very small drop in the quality of rendered images.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an assistive system for architects that converts a large-scale point cloud into a standardized digital representation of a building for Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications. The process is known as Scan-to-BIM, which requires many hours of manual work even for a single building floor by a professional architect. Given its challenging nature, the paper focuses on helping architects on the Scan-to-BIM process, instead of replacing them. Concretely, we propose an assistive Scan-to-BIM system that takes the raw sensor data and edit history (including the current BIM model), then auto-regressively predicts a sequence of model editing operations as APIs of a professional BIM software (i.e., Autodesk Revit). The paper also presents the first building-scale Scan2BIM dataset that contains a sequence of model editing operations as the APIs of Autodesk Revit. The dataset contains 89 hours of Scan2BIM modeling processes by professional architects over 16 scenes, spanning over 35,000 m^2. We report our system's reconstruction quality with standard metrics, and we introduce a novel metric that measures how natural the order of reconstructed operations is. A simple modification to the reconstruction module helps improve performance, and our method is far superior to two other baselines in the order metric. We will release data, code, and models at a-scan2bim.github.io.

- **Summary**: We consider the task of animating 3D facial geometry from speech signal. Existing works are primarily deterministic, focusing on learning a one-to-one mapping from speech signal to 3D face meshes on small datasets with limited speakers. While these models can achieve high-quality lip articulation for speakers in the training set, they are unable to capture the full and diverse distribution of 3D facial motions that accompany speech in the real world. Importantly, the relationship between speech and facial motion is one-to-many, containing both inter-speaker and intra-speaker variations and necessitating a probabilistic approach. In this paper, we identify and address key challenges that have so far limited the development of probabilistic models: lack of datasets and metrics that are suitable for training and evaluating them, as well as the difficulty of designing a model that generates diverse results while remaining faithful to a strong conditioning signal as speech. We first propose large-scale benchmark datasets and metrics suitable for probabilistic modeling. Then, we demonstrate a probabilistic model that achieves both diversity and fidelity to speech, outperforming other methods across the proposed benchmarks. Finally, we showcase useful applications of probabilistic models trained on these large-scale datasets: we can generate diverse speech-driven 3D facial motion that matches unseen speaker styles extracted from reference clips; and our synthetic meshes can be used to improve the performance of downstream audio-visual models.

- **Summary**: Training a generative model with limited data (e.g., 10) is a very challenging task. Many works propose to fine-tune a pre-trained GAN model. However, this can easily result in overfitting. In other words, they manage to adapt the style but fail to preserve the content, where \textit{style} denotes the specific properties that defines a domain while \textit{content} denotes the domain-irrelevant information that represents diversity. Recent works try to maintain a pre-defined correspondence to preserve the content, however, the diversity is still not enough and it may affect style adaptation. In this work, we propose a paired image reconstruction approach for content preservation. We propose to introduce an image translation module to GAN transferring, where the module teaches the generator to separate style and content, and the generator provides training data to the translation module in return. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in few shot setting.

- **Summary**: Decreased myocardial capillary density has been reported as an important histopathological feature associated with various heart disorders. Quantitative assessment of cardiac capillarization typically involves double immunostaining of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and capillaries in myocardial slices. In contrast, single immunostaining of basement membrane components is a straightforward approach to simultaneously label CMs and capillaries, presenting fewer challenges in background staining. However, subsequent image analysis always requires manual work in identifying and segmenting CMs and capillaries. Here, we developed an image analysis tool, AutoQC, to automatically identify and segment CMs and capillaries in immunofluorescence images of collagen type IV, a predominant basement membrane protein within the myocardium. In addition, commonly used capillarization-related measurements can be derived from segmentation masks. AutoQC features a weakly supervised instance segmentation algorithm by leveraging the power of a pre-trained segmentation model via prompt engineering. AutoQC outperformed YOLOv8-Seg, a state-of-the-art instance segmentation model, in both instance segmentation and capillarization assessment. Furthermore, the training of AutoQC required only a small dataset with bounding box annotations instead of pixel-wise annotations, leading to a reduced workload during network training. AutoQC provides an automated solution for quantifying cardiac capillarization in basement-membrane-immunostained myocardial slices, eliminating the need for manual image analysis once it is trained.



### Persistent Test-time Adaptation in Episodic Testing Scenarios

- **Summary**: Current test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches aim to adapt to environments that change continuously. Yet, when the environments not only change but also recur in a correlated manner over time, such as in the case of day-night surveillance cameras, it is unclear whether the adaptability of these methods is sustained after a long run. This study aims to examine the error accumulation of TTA models when they are repeatedly exposed to previous testing environments, proposing a novel testing setting called episodic TTA. To study this phenomenon, we design a simulation of TTA process on a simple yet representative $\epsilon$-perturbed Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier and derive the theoretical findings revealing the dataset- and algorithm-dependent factors that contribute to the gradual degeneration of TTA methods through time. Our investigation has led us to propose a method, named persistent TTA (PeTTA). PeTTA senses the model divergence towards a collapsing and adjusts the adaptation strategy of TTA, striking a balance between two primary objectives: adaptation and preventing model collapse. The stability of PeTTA in the face of episodic TTA scenarios has been demonstrated through a set of comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction is of significant importance in computer vision. Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction benefits autonomous vehicles and robots in planning their motion. Pedestrians' trajectories are greatly influenced by their intentions. Prior studies having introduced various deep learning methods only pay attention to the spatial and temporal information of trajectory, overlooking the explicit intention information. In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the \textbf{S-T CRF}: \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{R}andom \textbf{F}ield, which judiciously incorporates intention information besides spatial and temporal information of trajectory. This model uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate a representation of future intentions, greatly improving the prediction of subsequent trajectories when combined with spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, the study innovatively devises a space CRF loss and a time CRF loss, meticulously designed to enhance interaction constraints and temporal dynamics, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on dataset ETH/UCY and SDD demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baseline approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper explores advancements in high-fidelity personalized image generation through the utilization of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. While previous approaches have made significant strides in generating versatile scenes based on text descriptions and a few input images, challenges persist in maintaining the subject fidelity within the generated images. In this work, we introduce an innovative algorithm named HiFi Tuner to enhance the appearance preservation of objects during personalized image generation. Our proposed method employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, comprising a denoising process and a pivotal inversion process. Key enhancements include the utilization of mask guidance, a novel parameter regularization technique, and the incorporation of step-wise subject representations to elevate the sample fidelity. Additionally, we propose a reference-guided generation approach that leverages the pivotal inversion of a reference image to mitigate unwanted subject variations and artifacts. We further extend our method to a novel image editing task: substituting the subject in an image through textual manipulations. Experimental evaluations conducted on the DreamBooth dataset using the Stable Diffusion model showcase promising results. Fine-tuning solely on textual embeddings improves CLIP-T score by 3.6 points and improves DINO score by 9.6 points over Textual Inversion. When fine-tuning all parameters, HiFi Tuner improves CLIP-T score by 1.2 points and improves DINO score by 1.2 points over DreamBooth, establishing a new state of the art.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral object tracking has recently emerged as a topic of great interest in the remote sensing community. The hyperspectral image, with its many bands, provides a rich source of material information of an object that can be effectively used for object tracking. While most hyperspectral trackers are based on detection-based techniques, no one has yet attempted to employ YOLO for detecting and tracking the object. This is due to the presence of multiple spectral bands, the scarcity of annotated hyperspectral videos, and YOLO's performance limitation in managing occlusions, and distinguishing object in cluttered backgrounds. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hy-Tracker, which aims to bridge the gap between hyperspectral data and state-of-the-art object detection methods to leverage the strengths of YOLOv7 for object tracking in hyperspectral videos. Hy-Tracker not only introduces YOLOv7 but also innovatively incorporates a refined tracking module on top of YOLOv7. The tracker refines the initial detections produced by YOLOv7, leading to improved object-tracking performance. Furthermore, we incorporate Kalman-Filter into the tracker, which addresses the challenges posed by scale variation and occlusion. The experimental results on hyperspectral benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Hy-Tracker in accurately tracking objects across frames.

- **Summary**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) usually struggle in learning from highly diverse data, whose underlying manifold is complex. In this work, we revisit the mathematical foundations of GANs, and theoretically reveal that the native adversarial loss for GAN training is insufficient to fix the problem of subsets with positive Lebesgue measure of the generated data manifold lying out of the real data manifold. Instead, we find that score matching serves as a valid solution to this issue thanks to its capability of persistently pushing the generated data points towards the real data manifold. We thereby propose to improve the optimization of GANs with score matching regularity (SMaRt). Regarding the empirical evidences, we first design a toy example to show that training GANs by the aid of a ground-truth score function can help reproduce the real data distribution more accurately, and then confirm that our approach can consistently boost the synthesis performance of various state-of-the-art GANs on real-world datasets with pre-trained diffusion models acting as the approximate score function. For instance, when training Aurora on the ImageNet 64x64 dataset, we manage to improve FID from 8.87 to 7.11, on par with the performance of one-step consistency model. The source code will be made public.

- **Summary**: Sky survey telescopes play a critical role in modern astronomy, but misalignment of their optical elements can introduce significant variations in point spread functions, leading to reduced data quality. To address this, we need a method to obtain misalignment states, aiding in the reconstruction of accurate point spread functions for data processing methods or facilitating adjustments of optical components for improved image quality. Since sky survey telescopes consist of many optical elements, they result in a vast array of potential misalignment states, some of which are intricately coupled, posing detection challenges. However, by continuously adjusting the misalignment states of optical elements, we can disentangle coupled states. Based on this principle, we propose a deep neural network to extract misalignment states from continuously varying point spread functions in different field of views. To ensure sufficient and diverse training data, we recommend employing a digital twin to obtain data for neural network training. Additionally, we introduce the state graph to store misalignment data and explore complex relationships between misalignment states and corresponding point spread functions, guiding the generation of training data from experiments. Once trained, the neural network estimates misalignment states from observation data, regardless of the impacts caused by atmospheric turbulence, noise, and limited spatial sampling rates in the detector. The method proposed in this paper could be used to provide prior information for the active optics system and the optical system alignment.

- **Summary**: Vision language models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various downstream tasks. However, understanding fine-grained visual-linguistic concepts, such as attributes and inter-object relationships, remains a significant challenge. While several benchmarks aim to evaluate VLMs in finer granularity, their primary focus remains on the linguistic aspect, neglecting the visual dimension. Here, we highlight the importance of evaluating VLMs from both a textual and visual perspective. We introduce a progressive pipeline to synthesize images that vary in a specific attribute while ensuring consistency in all other aspects. Utilizing this data engine, we carefully design a benchmark, SPEC, to diagnose the comprehension of object size, position, existence, and count. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough evaluation of four leading VLMs on SPEC. Surprisingly, their performance is close to random guess, revealing significant limitations. With this in mind, we propose a simply yet effective approach to optimize VLMs in fine-grained understanding, achieving significant improvements on SPEC without compromising the zero-shot performance. Results on two additional fine-grained benchmarks also show consistent improvements, further validating the transferability of our approach.

- **Summary**: Banding artifact, as known as staircase-like contour, is a common quality annoyance that happens in compression, transmission, etc. scenarios, which largely affects the user's quality of experience (QoE). The banding distortion typically appears as relatively small pixel-wise variations in smooth backgrounds, which is difficult to analyze in the spatial domain but easily reflected in the frequency domain. In this paper, we thereby study the banding artifact from the frequency aspect and propose a no-reference banding detection model to capture and evaluate banding artifacts, called the Frequency-Sensitive BANding Detector (FS-BAND). The proposed detector is able to generate a pixel-wise banding map with a perception correlated quality score. Experimental results show that the proposed FS-BAND method outperforms state-of-the-art image quality assessment (IQA) approaches with higher accuracy in banding classification task.

- **Summary**: Prompt tuning represents a valuable technique for adapting pre-trained visual-language models (VLM) to various downstream tasks. Recent advancements in CoOp-based methods propose a set of learnable domain-shared or image-conditional textual tokens to facilitate the generation of task-specific textual classifiers. However, those textual tokens have a limited generalization ability regarding unseen domains, as they cannot dynamically adjust to the distribution of testing classes. To tackle this issue, we present a novel Textual-based Class-aware Prompt tuning(TCP) that explicitly incorporates prior knowledge about classes to enhance their discriminability. The critical concept of TCP involves leveraging Textual Knowledge Embedding (TKE) to map the high generalizability of class-level textual knowledge into class-aware textual tokens. By seamlessly integrating these class-aware prompts into the Text Encoder, a dynamic class-aware classifier is generated to enhance discriminability for unseen domains. During inference, TKE dynamically generates class-aware prompts related to the unseen classes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that TKE serves as a plug-and-play module effortlessly combinable with existing methods. Furthermore, TCP consistently achieves superior performance while demanding less training time.

- **Summary**: Large Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on massive datasets exhibit impressive performance on various downstream tasks, especially with limited labeled target data. However, due to their high memory and compute requirements, these models cannot be deployed in resource constrained settings. This raises an important question: How can we utilize the knowledge from a large VFM to train a small task-specific model for a new target task with limited labeled training data? In this work, we answer this question by proposing a simple and highly effective task-oriented knowledge transfer approach to leverage pretrained VFMs for effective training of small task-specific models. Our experimental results on four target tasks under limited labeled data settings show that the proposed knowledge transfer approach outperforms task-agnostic VFM distillation, web-scale CLIP pretraining and supervised ImageNet pretraining by 1-10.5%, 2-22% and 2-14%, respectively. We also show that the dataset used for transferring knowledge has a significant effect on the final target task performance, and propose an image retrieval-based approach for curating effective transfer sets.

- **Summary**: Large language and vision models have transformed how social movements scholars identify protest and extract key protest attributes from multi-modal data such as texts, images, and videos. This article documents how we fine-tuned two large pretrained transformer models, including longformer and swin-transformer v2, to infer potential protests in news articles using textual and imagery data. First, the longformer model was fine-tuned using the Dynamic of Collective Action (DoCA) Corpus. We matched the New York Times articles with the DoCA database to obtain a training dataset for downstream tasks. Second, the swin-transformer v2 models was trained on UCLA-protest imagery data. UCLA-protest project contains labeled imagery data with information such as protest, violence, and sign. Both fine-tuned models will be available via \url{https://github.com/Joshzyj/llvms4protest}.

- **Summary**: Image steganography, the practice of concealing information within another image, traditionally faces security challenges when its methods become publicly known. To counteract this, we introduce a novel private key-based image steganography technique. This approach ensures the security of hidden information, requiring a corresponding private key for access, irrespective of the public knowledge of the steganography method. We present experimental evidence demonstrating our method's effectiveness, showcasing its real-world applicability. Additionally, we identified a critical challenge in the invertible image steganography process: the transfer of non-essential, or `garbage', information from the secret to the host pipeline. To address this, we introduced the decay weight to control the information transfer, filtering out irrelevant data and enhancing the performance of image steganography. Our code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/yanghangAI/DKiS, and a practical demonstration is available at http://yanghang.site/hidekey.

- **Summary**: The aging population of the U.S. drives the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. Brookmeyer et al. forecasts approximately 15 million Americans will have either clinical AD or mild cognitive impairment by 2060. In response to this urgent call, methods for early detection of Alzheimer's disease have been developed for prevention and pre-treatment. Notably, literature on the application of deep learning in the automatic detection of the disease has been proliferating. This study builds upon previous literature and maintains a focus on leveraging multi-modal information to enhance automatic detection. We aim to predict the stage of the disease - Cognitively Normal (CN), Mildly Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), based on two different types of brain MRI scans. We design an AlexNet-based deep learning model that learns the synergy of complementary information from both T1 and FLAIR MRI scans.

- **Summary**: With the recent surge in the use of touchscreen devices, free-hand sketching has emerged as a promising modality for human-computer interaction. While previous research has focused on tasks such as recognition, retrieval, and generation of familiar everyday objects, this study aims to create a Sketch Input Method Editor (SketchIME) specifically designed for a professional C4I system. Within this system, sketches are utilized as low-fidelity prototypes for recommending standardized symbols in the creation of comprehensive situation maps. This paper also presents a systematic dataset comprising 374 specialized sketch types, and proposes a simultaneous recognition and segmentation architecture with multilevel supervision between recognition and segmentation to improve performance and enhance interpretability. By incorporating few-shot domain adaptation and class-incremental learning, the network's ability to adapt to new users and extend to new task-specific classes is significantly enhanced. Results from experiments conducted on both the proposed dataset and the SPG dataset illustrate the superior performance of the proposed architecture. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Anony517/SketchIME.

- **Summary**: In recent advancements in high-fidelity image generation, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as a key player. However, their application at high resolutions presents significant computational challenges. Current methods, such as patchifying, expedite processes in UNet and Transformer architectures but at the expense of representational capacity. Addressing this, we introduce the Diffusion State Space Model (DiffuSSM), an architecture that supplants attention mechanisms with a more scalable state space model backbone. This approach effectively handles higher resolutions without resorting to global compression, thus preserving detailed image representation throughout the diffusion process. Our focus on FLOP-efficient architectures in diffusion training marks a significant step forward. Comprehensive evaluations on both ImageNet and LSUN datasets at two resolutions demonstrate that DiffuSSMs are on par or even outperform existing diffusion models with attention modules in FID and Inception Score metrics while significantly reducing total FLOP usage.

- **Summary**: We present Ego-Exo4D, a diverse, large-scale multimodal multiview video dataset and benchmark challenge. Ego-Exo4D centers around simultaneously-captured egocentric and exocentric video of skilled human activities (e.g., sports, music, dance, bike repair). More than 800 participants from 13 cities worldwide performed these activities in 131 different natural scene contexts, yielding long-form captures from 1 to 42 minutes each and 1,422 hours of video combined. The multimodal nature of the dataset is unprecedented: the video is accompanied by multichannel audio, eye gaze, 3D point clouds, camera poses, IMU, and multiple paired language descriptions -- including a novel "expert commentary" done by coaches and teachers and tailored to the skilled-activity domain. To push the frontier of first-person video understanding of skilled human activity, we also present a suite of benchmark tasks and their annotations, including fine-grained activity understanding, proficiency estimation, cross-view translation, and 3D hand/body pose. All resources will be open sourced to fuel new research in the community.

- **Summary**: Radiology reports are an instrumental part of modern medicine, informing key clinical decisions such as diagnosis and treatment. The worldwide shortage of radiologists, however, restricts access to expert care and imposes heavy workloads, contributing to avoidable errors and delays in report delivery. While recent progress in automated report generation with vision-language models offer clear potential in ameliorating the situation, the path to real-world adoption has been stymied by the challenge of evaluating the clinical quality of AI-generated reports. In this study, we build a state-of-the-art report generation system for chest radiographs, Flamingo-CXR, by fine-tuning a well-known vision-language foundation model on radiology data. To evaluate the quality of the AI-generated reports, a group of 16 certified radiologists provide detailed evaluations of AI-generated and human written reports for chest X-rays from an intensive care setting in the United States and an inpatient setting in India. At least one radiologist (out of two per case) preferred the AI report to the ground truth report in over 60$\%$ of cases for both datasets. Amongst the subset of AI-generated reports that contain errors, the most frequently cited reasons were related to the location and finding, whereas for human written reports, most mistakes were related to severity and finding. This disparity suggested potential complementarity between our AI system and human experts, prompting us to develop an assistive scenario in which Flamingo-CXR generates a first-draft report, which is subsequently revised by a clinician. This is the first demonstration of clinician-AI collaboration for report writing, and the resultant reports are assessed to be equivalent or preferred by at least one radiologist to reports written by experts alone in 80$\%$ of in-patient cases and 66$\%$ of intensive care cases.

- **Summary**: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data is a kind of widely used four-dimensional biomedical data, demanding effective compression but presenting unique challenges for compression due to its intricate temporal dynamics, low signal-to-noise ratio, and complicated underlying redundancies. This paper reports a novel compression paradigm specifically tailored for fMRI data based on Implicit Neural Representation (INR). The proposed approach focuses on removing the various redundancies among the time series, including (i) conducting spatial correlation modeling for intra-region dynamics, (ii) decomposing reusable neuronal activation patterns, and using proper initialization together with nonlinear fusion to describe the inter-region similarity. The above scheme properly incorporates the unique features of fMRI data, and experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing state-of-the-art algorithms in both conventional image quality evaluation metrics and fMRI downstream tasks. This work in this paper paves the way for sharing massive fMRI data at low bandwidth and high fidelity.

- **Summary**: The human brain can be conceptualized as a dynamical system. Utilizing resting state fMRI time series imaging, we can study the underlying dynamics at ear-marked Regions of Interest (ROIs) to understand structure or lack thereof. This differential behavior could be key to understanding the neurodegeneration and also to classify between healthy and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects. In this study, we consider 6 brain networks spanning over 160 ROIs derived from Dosenbach template, where each network consists of 25-30 ROIs. Recurrence plot, extensively used to understand evolution of time series, is employed. Representative time series at each ROI is converted to its corresponding recurrence plot visualization, which is subsequently condensed to low-dimensional feature embeddings through Autoencoders. The performance of the proposed method is shown on fMRI volumes of 100 subjects (balanced data), taken from publicly available ADNI dataset. Results obtained show peak classification accuracy of 93% among the 6 brain networks, mean accuracy of 89.3% thereby illustrating promise in the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Replay-based methods in class-incremental learning (CIL) have attained remarkable success, as replaying the exemplars of old classes can significantly mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Despite their effectiveness, the inherent memory restrictions of CIL result in saving a limited number of exemplars with poor diversity, leading to data imbalance and overfitting issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel exemplar super-compression and regeneration method, ESCORT, which substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars. Rather than storing past images, we compress images into visual and textual prompts, e.g., edge maps and class tags, and save the prompts instead, reducing the memory usage of each exemplar to 1/24 of the original size. In subsequent learning phases, diverse high-resolution exemplars are generated from the prompts by a pre-trained diffusion model, e.g., ControlNet. To minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images, we propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation, allowing us to utilize an off-the-shelf diffusion model without fine-tuning it on the target dataset. Therefore, the same diffusion model can be downloaded whenever it is needed, incurring no memory consumption. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves model performance across multiple CIL benchmarks, e.g., 5.0 percentage points higher than the previous state-of-the-art on 10-phase Caltech-256 dataset.

- **Summary**: Continual test-time adaptation (cTTA) methods are designed to facilitate the continual adaptation of models to dynamically changing real-world environments where computational resources are limited. Due to this inherent limitation, existing approaches fail to simultaneously achieve accuracy and efficiency. In detail, when using a single image, the instability caused by batch normalization layers and entropy loss significantly destabilizes many existing methods in real-world cTTA scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we present BESTTA, a novel single image continual test-time adaptation method guided by style transfer, which enables stable and efficient adaptation to the target environment by transferring the style of the input image to the source style. To implement the proposed method, we devise BeIN, a simple yet powerful normalization method, along with the style-guided losses. We demonstrate that BESTTA effectively adapts to the continually changing target environment, leveraging only a single image on both semantic segmentation and image classification tasks. Remarkably, despite training only two parameters in a BeIN layer consuming the least memory, BESTTA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.

- **Summary**: Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) is a multi-modal task that aims to select, among a batch of candidate images, the one that best entails the target word's meaning within a limited context. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal retrieval framework that maximally leverages pretrained Vision-Language models, as well as open knowledge bases and datasets. Our system consists of the following key components: (1) Gloss matching: a pretrained bi-encoder model is used to match contexts with proper senses of the target words; (2) Prompting: matched glosses and other textual information, such as synonyms, are incorporated using a prompting template; (3) Image retrieval: semantically matching images are retrieved from large open datasets using prompts as queries; (4) Modality fusion: contextual information from different modalities are fused and used for prediction. Although our system does not produce the most competitive results at SemEval-2023 Task 1, we are still able to beat nearly half of the teams. More importantly, our experiments reveal acute insights for the field of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and multi-modal learning. Our code is available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative to CNNs and transformers in certain image processing applications due to their parameter-efficiency in modeling spatial relationships. Currently, a major area of research involves the converting non-graph input data for GNN-based models, notably in scenarios where the data originates from images. One approach involves converting images into nodes by identifying significant keypoints within them. Super-Retina, a semi-supervised technique, has been utilized for detecting keypoints in retinal images. However, its limitations lie in the dependency on a small initial set of ground truth keypoints, which is progressively expanded to detect more keypoints. Having encountered difficulties in detecting consistent initial keypoints in brain images using SIFT and LoFTR, we proposed a new approach: radiomic feature-based keypoint detection. Demonstrating the anatomical significance of the detected keypoints was achieved by showcasing their efficacy in improving registration processes guided by these keypoints. Subsequently, these keypoints were employed as the ground truth for the keypoint detection method (LK-SuperRetina). Furthermore, the study showcases the application of GNNs in image matching, highlighting their superior performance in terms of both the number of good matches and confidence scores. This research sets the stage for expanding GNN applications into various other applications, including but not limited to image classification, segmentation, and registration.



### SimulFlow: Simultaneously Extracting Feature and Identifying Target for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation

- **Summary**: Unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) aims at detecting the primary objects in a given video sequence without any human interposing. Most existing methods rely on two-stream architectures that separately encode the appearance and motion information before fusing them to identify the target and generate object masks. However, this pipeline is computationally expensive and can lead to suboptimal performance due to the difficulty of fusing the two modalities properly. In this paper, we propose a novel UVOS model called SimulFlow that simultaneously performs feature extraction and target identification, enabling efficient and effective unsupervised video object segmentation. Concretely, we design a novel SimulFlow Attention mechanism to bridege the image and motion by utilizing the flexibility of attention operation, where coarse masks predicted from fused feature at each stage are used to constrain the attention operation within the mask area and exclude the impact of noise. Because of the bidirectional information flow between visual and optical flow features in SimulFlow Attention, no extra hand-designed fusing module is required and we only adopt a light decoder to obtain the final prediction. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results. Our proposed approach not only outperforms existing methods but also addresses the computational complexity and fusion difficulties caused by two-stream architectures. Our models achieve 87.4% J & F on DAVIS-16 with the highest speed (63.7 FPS on a 3090) and the lowest parameters (13.7 M). Our SimulFlow also obtains competitive results on video salient object detection datasets.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral 3D imaging aims to acquire both depth and spectral information of a scene. However, existing methods are either prohibitively expensive and bulky or compromise on spectral and depth accuracy. In this work, we present Dispersed Structured Light (DSL), a cost-effective and compact method for accurate hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL modifies a traditional projector-camera system by placing a sub-millimeter thick diffraction grating film front of the projector. The grating disperses structured light based on light wavelength. To utilize the dispersed structured light, we devise a model for dispersive projection image formation and a per-pixel hyperspectral 3D reconstruction method. We validate DSL by instantiating a compact experimental prototype. DSL achieves spectral accuracy of 18.8nm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) and depth error of 1mm. We demonstrate that DSL outperforms prior work on practical hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL promises accurate and practical hyperspectral 3D imaging for diverse application domains, including computer vision and graphics, cultural heritage, geology, and biology.

- **Summary**: Recently, text-guided digital portrait editing has attracted more and more attentions. However, existing methods still struggle to maintain consistency across time, expression, and view or require specific data prerequisites. To solve these challenging problems, we propose CosAvatar, a high-quality and user-friendly framework for portrait tuning. With only monocular video and text instructions as input, we can produce animatable portraits with both temporal and 3D consistency. Different from methods that directly edit in the 2D domain, we employ a dynamic NeRF-based 3D portrait representation to model both the head and torso. We alternate between editing the video frames' dataset and updating the underlying 3D portrait until the edited frames reach 3D consistency. Additionally, we integrate the semantic portrait priors to enhance the edited results, allowing precise modifications in specified semantic areas. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed method can not only accurately edit portrait styles or local attributes based on text instructions but also support expressive animation driven by a source video.

- **Summary**: A classifier may depend on incidental features stemming from a strong correlation between the feature and the classification target in the training dataset. Recently, Last Layer Retraining (LLR) with group-balanced datasets is known to be efficient in mitigating the spurious correlation of classifiers. However, the acquisition of group-balanced datasets is costly, which hinders the applicability of the LLR method. In this work, we propose to perform LLR based on text datasets built with large language models for a general image classifier. We demonstrate that text can be a proxy for its corresponding image beyond the image-text joint embedding space, such as CLIP. Based on this, we use generated texts to train the final layer in the embedding space of the arbitrary image classifier. In addition, we propose a method of filtering the generated words to get rid of noisy, imprecise words, which reduces the effort of inspecting each word. We dub these procedures as TLDR (\textbf{T}ext-based \textbf{L}ast layer retraining for \textbf{D}ebiasing image classifie\textbf{R}s) and show our method achieves the performance that is comparable to those of the LLR methods that also utilize group-balanced image dataset for retraining. Furthermore, TLDR outperforms other baselines that involve training the last linear layer without a group annotated dataset.

Despite being widely used in computer vision in the early 2010s, it remains a mystery whether perceptual grouping can be leveraged to derive a neural visual recognition backbone that generates as powerful representations. In this paper, we propose the Perceptual Group Tokenizer, a model that entirely relies on grouping operations to extract visual features and perform self-supervised representation learning, where a series of grouping operations are used to iteratively hypothesize the context for pixels or superpixels to refine feature representations. We show that the proposed model can achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art vision architectures, and inherits desirable properties including adaptive computation without re-training, and interpretability. Specifically, Perceptual Group Tokenizer achieves 80.3% on ImageNet-1K self-supervised learning benchmark with linear probe evaluation, marking a new progress under this paradigm.

- **Summary**: Imperceptible digital watermarking is important in copyright protection, misinformation prevention, and responsible generative AI. We propose TrustMark - a GAN-based watermarking method with novel design in architecture and spatio-spectra losses to balance the trade-off between watermarked image quality with the watermark recovery accuracy. Our model is trained with robustness in mind, withstanding various in- and out-place perturbations on the encoded image. Additionally, we introduce TrustMark-RM - a watermark remover method useful for re-watermarking. Our methods achieve state-of-art performance on 3 benchmarks comprising arbitrary resolution images.

- **Summary**: Specularities are numerous in endoscopic images. They occur as many white small elliptic spots, which are generally ruled out as nuisance in image analysis and computer vision methods. Instead, we propose to use specularities as cues for 3D perception. Specifically, we propose a new method to reconstruct, at each specularity, the observed tissue's normal direction (i.e., its orientation) and shape (i.e., its curvature) from a single image. We show results on simulated and real interventional images.

- **Summary**: Our paper aims to generate diverse and realistic animal motion sequences from textual descriptions, without a large-scale animal text-motion dataset. While the task of text-driven human motion synthesis is already extensively studied and benchmarked, it remains challenging to transfer this success to other skeleton structures with limited data. In this work, we design a model architecture that imitates Generative Pretraining Transformer (GPT), utilizing prior knowledge learned from human data to the animal domain. We jointly train motion autoencoders for both animal and human motions and at the same time optimize through the similarity scores among human motion encoding, animal motion encoding, and text CLIP embedding. Presenting the first solution to this problem, we are able to generate animal motions with high diversity and fidelity, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming the results of training human motion generation baselines on animal data. Additionally, we introduce AnimalML3D, the first text-animal motion dataset with 1240 animation sequences spanning 36 different animal identities. We hope this dataset would mediate the data scarcity problem in text-driven animal motion generation, providing a new playground for the research community.

- **Summary**: Temporal sentence grounding aims to localize moments relevant to a language description. Recently, DETR-like approaches have shown notable progress by decoding the center and length of a target moment from learnable queries. However, they suffer from the issue of center misalignment raised by the inherent ambiguity of moment centers, leading to inaccurate predictions. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel boundary-oriented moment formulation. In our paradigm, the model no longer needs to find the precise center but instead suffices to predict any anchor point within the interval, from which the onset and offset are directly estimated. Based on this idea, we design a Boundary-Aligned Moment Detection Transformer (BAM-DETR), equipped with a dual-pathway decoding process. Specifically, it refines the anchor and boundaries within parallel pathways using global and boundary-focused attention, respectively. This separate design allows the model to focus on desirable regions, enabling precise refinement of moment predictions. Further, we propose a quality-based ranking method, ensuring that proposals with high localization qualities are prioritized over incomplete ones. Extensive experiments verify the advantages of our methods, where our model records new state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks. Code is at https://github.com/Pilhyeon/BAM-DETR.

- **Summary**: Stable Diffusion has established itself as a foundation model in generative AI artistic applications, receiving widespread research and application. Some recent fine-tuning methods have made it feasible for individuals to implant personalized concepts onto the basic Stable Diffusion model with minimal computational costs on small datasets. However, these innovations have also given rise to issues like facial privacy forgery and artistic copyright infringement. In recent studies, researchers have explored the addition of imperceptible adversarial perturbations to images to prevent potential unauthorized exploitation and infringements when personal data is used for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion. Although these studies have demonstrated the ability to protect images, it is essential to consider that these methods may not be entirely applicable in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the use of perturbations to protect images within a practical threat model. The results suggest that these approaches may not be sufficient to safeguard image privacy and copyright effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a purification method capable of removing protected perturbations while preserving the original image structure to the greatest extent possible. Experiments reveal that Stable Diffusion can effectively learn from purified images over all protective methods.



### X-Dreamer: Creating High-quality 3D Content by Bridging the Domain Gap Between Text-to-2D and Text-to-3D Generation

- **Summary**: In recent times, automatic text-to-3D content creation has made significant progress, driven by the development of pretrained 2D diffusion models. Existing text-to-3D methods typically optimize the 3D representation to ensure that the rendered image aligns well with the given text, as evaluated by the pretrained 2D diffusion model. Nevertheless, a substantial domain gap exists between 2D images and 3D assets, primarily attributed to variations in camera-related attributes and the exclusive presence of foreground objects. Consequently, employing 2D diffusion models directly for optimizing 3D representations may lead to suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we present X-Dreamer, a novel approach for high-quality text-to-3D content creation that effectively bridges the gap between text-to-2D and text-to-3D synthesis. The key components of X-Dreamer are two innovative designs: Camera-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (CG-LoRA) and Attention-Mask Alignment (AMA) Loss. CG-LoRA dynamically incorporates camera information into the pretrained diffusion models by employing camera-dependent generation for trainable parameters. This integration enhances the alignment between the generated 3D assets and the camera's perspective. AMA loss guides the attention map of the pretrained diffusion model using the binary mask of the 3D object, prioritizing the creation of the foreground object. This module ensures that the model focuses on generating accurate and detailed foreground objects. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to existing text-to-3D approaches. Our project webpage: https://xmuxiaoma666.github.io/Projects/X-Dreamer .

- **Summary**: Adept traffic models are critical to both planning and closed-loop simulation for autonomous vehicles (AV), and key design objectives include accuracy, diverse multimodal behaviors, interpretability, and downstream compatibility. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), an additional desirable feature for traffic models is LLM compatibility. We present Categorical Traffic Transformer (CTT), a traffic model that outputs both continuous trajectory predictions and tokenized categorical predictions (lane modes, homotopies, etc.). The most outstanding feature of CTT is its fully interpretable latent space, which enables direct supervision of the latent variable from the ground truth during training and avoids mode collapse completely. As a result, CTT can generate diverse behaviors conditioned on different latent modes with semantic meanings while beating SOTA on prediction accuracy. In addition, CTT's ability to input and output tokens enables integration with LLMs for common-sense reasoning and zero-shot generalization.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved impressive view synthesis results by learning an implicit volumetric representation from multi-view images. To project the implicit representation into an image, NeRF employs volume rendering that approximates the continuous integrals of rays as an accumulation of the colors and densities of the sampled points. Although this approximation enables efficient rendering, it ignores the direction information in point intervals, resulting in ambiguous features and limited reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose an anisotropic neural representation learning method that utilizes learnable view-dependent features to improve scene representation and reconstruction. We model the volumetric function as spherical harmonic (SH)-guided anisotropic features, parameterized by multilayer perceptrons, facilitating ambiguity elimination while preserving the rendering efficiency. To achieve robust scene reconstruction without anisotropy overfitting, we regularize the energy of the anisotropic features during training. Our method is flexiable and can be plugged into NeRF-based frameworks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed representation can boost the rendering quality of various NeRFs and achieve state-of-the-art rendering performance on both synthetic and real-world scenes.

- **Summary**: Modern artificial intelligence provides a novel way of producing digital art in styles. The expressive power of neural networks enables the realm of visual style transfer methods, which can be used to edit images, videos, and 3D data to make them more artistic and diverse. This paper reports on recent advances in neural stylization for 3D data. We provide a taxonomy for neural stylization by considering several important design choices, including scene representation, guidance data, optimization strategies, and output styles. Building on such taxonomy, our survey first revisits the background of neural stylization on 2D images, and then provides in-depth discussions on recent neural stylization methods for 3D data, where we also provide a mini-benchmark on artistic stylization methods. Based on the insights gained from the survey, we then discuss open challenges, future research, and potential applications and impacts of neural stylization.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have shown exemplary performance on semantic scene understanding tasks on source domains, but due to the absence of style diversity during training, enhancing performance on unseen target domains using only single source domain data remains a challenging task. Generation of simulated data is a feasible alternative to retrieving large style-diverse real-world datasets as it is a cumbersome and budget-intensive process. However, the large domain-specific inconsistencies between simulated and real-world data pose a significant generalization challenge in semantic segmentation. In this work, to alleviate this problem, we propose a novel MultiResolution Feature Perturbation (MRFP) technique to randomize domain-specific fine-grained features and perturb style of coarse features. Our experimental results on various urban-scene segmentation datasets clearly indicate that, along with the perturbation of style-information, perturbation of fine-feature components is paramount to learn domain invariant robust feature maps for semantic segmentation models. MRFP is a simple and computationally efficient, transferable module with no additional learnable parameters or objective functions, that helps state-of-the-art deep neural networks to learn robust domain invariant features for simulation-to-real semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task in computer vision. It aims to identify incorrect image data patterns which deviate from the normal ones. Conventional methods generally address AD by preparing augmented negative samples to enforce self-supervised learning. However, these techniques typically do not consider semantics during augmentation, leading to the generation of unrealistic or invalid negative samples. Consequently, the feature extraction network can be hindered from embedding critical features. In this study, inspired by visual attention learning approaches, we propose CutSwap, which leverages saliency guidance to incorporate semantic cues for augmentation. Specifically, we first employ LayerCAM to extract multilevel image features as saliency maps and then perform clustering to obtain multiple centroids. To fully exploit saliency guidance, on each map, we select a pixel pair from the cluster with the highest centroid saliency to form a patch pair. Such a patch pair includes highly similar context information with dense semantic correlations. The resulting negative sample is created by swapping the locations of the patch pair. Compared to prior augmentation methods, CutSwap generates more subtle yet realistic negative samples to facilitate quality feature learning. Extensive experimental and ablative evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art AD performance on two mainstream AD benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a model-driven approach to detect image line segments. The approach incrementally detects segments on the gradient image using a linear Kalman filter that estimates the supporting line parameters and their associated variances. The algorithm is fast and robust with respect to image noise and illumination variations, it allows the detection of longer line segments than data-driven approaches, and does not require any tedious parameters tuning. An extension of the algorithm that exploits a pyramidal approach to enhance the quality of results is proposed. Results with varying scene illumination and comparisons to classic existing approaches are presented.

- **Summary**: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to extract semantic knowledge from limited object instances of novel categories within a target domain. Recent advances in FSOD focus on fine-tuning the base model based on a few objects via meta-learning or data augmentation. Despite their success, the majority of them are grounded with parametric readjustment to generalize on novel objects, which face considerable challenges in Industry 5.0, such as (i) a certain amount of fine-tuning time is required, and (ii) the parameters of the constructed model being unavailable due to the privilege protection, making the fine-tuning fail. Such constraints naturally limit its application in scenarios with real-time configuration requirements or within black-box settings. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we formalize a novel FSOD task, referred to as Test TIme Few Shot DEtection (TIDE), where the model is un-tuned in the configuration procedure. To that end, we introduce an asymmetric architecture for learning a support-instance-guided dynamic category classifier. Further, a cross-attention module and a multi-scale resizer are provided to enhance the model performance. Experimental results on multiple few-shot object detection platforms reveal that the proposed TIDE significantly outperforms existing contemporary methods.

- **Summary**: This study proposes a method to automate the development of lookahead planning. The proposed method uses construction material conditions (i.e., appearances) and site space utilization to predict task completion rates. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model was trained using a segment of a construction project timeline to estimate completion rates of tasks and propose data-aware lookahead plans. The proposed method was evaluated in a sample construction project involving finishing works such as plastering, painting, and installing electrical fixtures. The results show that the proposed method can assist with developing automated lookahead plans. In doing so, this study links construction planning with actual events at the construction site. It extends the traditional scheduling techniques and integrates a broader spectrum of site spatial constraints into lookahead planning.

- **Summary**: Distribution shift widely exists in medical images acquired from different medical centres and poses a significant obstacle to deploying the pre-trained semantic segmentation model in real-world applications. Test-time adaptation has proven its effectiveness in tackling the cross-domain distribution shift during inference. However, most existing methods achieve adaptation by updating the pre-trained models, rendering them susceptible to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting when encountering a series of distribution shifts (i.e., under the continual test-time adaptation setup). To overcome these challenges caused by updating the models, in this paper, we freeze the pre-trained model and propose the Visual Prompt-based Test-Time Adaptation (VPTTA) method to train a specific prompt for each test image to align the statistics in the batch normalization layers. Specifically, we present the low-frequency prompt, which is lightweight with only a few parameters and can be effectively trained in a single iteration. To enhance prompt initialization, we equip VPTTA with a memory bank to benefit the current prompt from previous ones. Additionally, we design a warm-up mechanism, which mixes source and target statistics to construct warm-up statistics, thereby facilitating the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VPTTA over other state-of-the-art methods on two medical image segmentation benchmark tasks. The code and weights of pre-trained source models are available at https://github.com/Chen-Ziyang/VPTTA.

- **Summary**: Early detection and assessment of polyps play a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Polyp segmentation provides an effective solution to assist clinicians in accurately locating and segmenting polyp regions. In the past, people often relied on manually extracted lower-level features such as color, texture, and shape, which often had issues capturing global context and lacked robustness to complex scenarios. With the advent of deep learning, more and more outstanding medical image segmentation algorithms based on deep learning networks have emerged, making significant progress in this field. This paper provides a comprehensive review of polyp segmentation algorithms. We first review some traditional algorithms based on manually extracted features and deep segmentation algorithms, then detail benchmark datasets related to the topic. Specifically, we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of recent deep learning models and results based on polyp sizes, considering the pain points of research topics and differences in network structures. Finally, we discuss the challenges of polyp segmentation and future trends in this field.

- **Summary**: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are a key component in modern generative models. DPM-solvers have achieved reduced latency and enhanced quality significantly, but have posed challenges to find the exact inverse (i.e., finding the initial noise from the given image). Here we investigate the exact inversions for DPM-solvers and propose algorithms to perform them when samples are generated by the first-order as well as higher-order DPM-solvers. For each explicit denoising step in DPM-solvers, we formulated the inversions using implicit methods such as gradient descent or forward step method to ensure the robustness to large classifier-free guidance unlike the prior approach using fixed-point iteration. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed exact inversion methods significantly reduced the error of both image and noise reconstructions, greatly enhanced the ability to distinguish invisible watermarks and well prevented unintended background changes consistently during image editing.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a solution to the Weather4Cast 2023 competition, where the goal is to forecast high-resolution precipitation with an 8-hour lead time using lower-resolution satellite radiance images. We propose a simple, yet effective method for spatiotemporal feature learning using a 2D U-Net model, that outperforms the official 3D U-Net baseline in both performance and efficiency. We place emphasis on refining the dataset, through importance sampling and dataset preparation, and show that such techniques have a significant impact on performance. We further study an alternative cross-entropy loss function that improves performance over the standard mean squared error loss, while also enabling models to produce probabilistic outputs. Additional techniques are explored regarding the generation of predictions at different lead times, specifically through Conditioning Lead Time. Lastly, to generate high-resolution forecasts, we evaluate standard and learned upsampling methods. The code and trained parameters are available at https://github.com/rafapablos/w4c23-rainai.

Due to the lack of comparable pre-trained models for 3D shapes, recent methods utilize language-image pre-training to realize zero-shot 3D shape recognition. However, due to the modality gap, pretrained language-image models are not confident enough in the generalization to 3D shape recognition. Consequently, this paper aims to improve the confidence with view selection and hierarchical prompts. Leveraging the CLIP model as an example, we employ view selection on the vision side by identifying views with high prediction confidence from multiple rendered views of a 3D shape. On the textual side, the strategy of hierarchical prompts is proposed for the first time. The first layer prompts several classification candidates with traditional class-level descriptions, while the second layer refines the prediction based on function-level descriptions or further distinctions between the candidates. Remarkably, without the need for additional training, our proposed method achieves impressive zero-shot 3D classification accuracies of 84.44\%, 91.51\%, and 66.17\% on ModelNet40, ModelNet10, and ShapeNet Core55, respectively. Furthermore, we will make the code publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and further research in this area.

- **Summary**: Unlearnable datasets lead to a drastic drop in the generalization performance of models trained on them by introducing elaborate and imperceptible perturbations into clean training sets. Many existing defenses, e.g., JPEG compression and adversarial training, effectively counter UDs based on norm-constrained additive noise. However, a fire-new type of convolution-based UDs have been proposed and render existing defenses all ineffective, presenting a greater challenge to defenders. To address this, we express the convolution-based unlearnable sample as the result of multiplying a matrix by a clean sample in a simplified scenario, and formalize the intra-class matrix inconsistency as $\Theta_{imi}$, inter-class matrix consistency as $\Theta_{imc}$ to investigate the working mechanism of the convolution-based UDs. We conjecture that increasing both of these metrics will mitigate the unlearnability effect. Through validation experiments that commendably support our hypothesis, we further design a random matrix to boost both $\Theta_{imi}$ and $\Theta_{imc}$, achieving a notable degree of defense effect. Hence, by building upon and extending these facts, we first propose a brand-new image COrruption that employs randomly multiplicative transformation via INterpolation operation to successfully defend against convolution-based UDs. Our approach leverages global pixel random interpolations, effectively suppressing the impact of multiplicative noise in convolution-based UDs. Additionally, we have also designed two new forms of convolution-based UDs, and find that our defense is the most effective against them.

- **Summary**: Image-based virtual try-on enables users to virtually try on different garments by altering original clothes in their photographs. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) dominate the research field in image-based virtual try-on, but have not resolved problems such as unnatural deformation of garments and the blurry generation quality. Recently, diffusion models have emerged with surprising performance across various image generation tasks. While the generative quality of diffusion models is impressive, achieving controllability poses a significant challenge when applying it to virtual try-on tasks and multiple denoising iterations limit its potential for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose Controllable Accelerated virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model called CAT-DM. To enhance the controllability, a basic diffusion-based virtual try-on network is designed, which utilizes ControlNet to introduce additional control conditions and improves the feature extraction of garment images. In terms of acceleration, CAT-DM initiates a reverse denoising process with an implicit distribution generated by a pre-trained GAN-based model. Compared with previous try-on methods based on diffusion models, CAT-DM not only retains the pattern and texture details of the in-shop garment but also reduces the sampling steps without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CAT-DM against both GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in producing more realistic images and accurately reproducing garment patterns. Our code and models will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Enhancing the domain generalization performance of Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) techniques has emerged as a research focus. Existing methods are dedicated to extracting domain-invariant features from various training domains. Despite the promising performance, the extracted features inevitably contain residual style feature bias (e.g., illumination, capture device), resulting in inferior generalization performance. In this paper, we propose an alternative and effective solution, the Textually Guided Domain Generalization (TeG-DG) framework, which can effectively leverage text information for cross-domain alignment. Our core insight is that text, as a more abstract and universal form of expression, can capture the commonalities and essential characteristics across various attacks, bridging the gap between different image domains. Contrary to existing vision-language models, the proposed framework is elaborately designed to enhance the domain generalization ability of the FAS task. Concretely, we first design a Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HAF) module to enable adaptive aggregation of visual features at different levels; Then, a Textual-Enhanced Visual Discriminator (TEVD) is proposed for not only better alignment between the two modalities but also to regularize the classifier with unbiased text features. TeG-DG significantly outperforms previous approaches, especially in situations with extremely limited source domain data (~14% and ~12% improvements on HTER and AUC respectively), showcasing impressive few-shot performance.

- **Summary**: Event cameras have emerged as a promising vision sensor in recent years due to their unparalleled temporal resolution and dynamic range. While registration of 2D RGB images to 3D point clouds is a long-standing problem in computer vision, no prior work studies 2D-3D registration for event cameras. To this end, we propose E2PNet, the first learning-based method for event-to-point cloud registration. The core of E2PNet is a novel feature representation network called Event-Points-to-Tensor (EP2T), which encodes event data into a 2D grid-shaped feature tensor. This grid-shaped feature enables matured RGB-based frameworks to be easily used for event-to-point cloud registration, without changing hyper-parameters and the training procedure. EP2T treats the event input as spatio-temporal point clouds. Unlike standard 3D learning architectures that treat all dimensions of point clouds equally, the novel sampling and information aggregation modules in EP2T are designed to handle the inhomogeneity of the spatial and temporal dimensions. Experiments on the MVSEC and VECtor datasets demonstrate the superiority of E2PNet over hand-crafted and other learning-based methods. Compared to RGB-based registration, E2PNet is more robust to extreme illumination or fast motion due to the use of event data. Beyond 2D-3D registration, we also show the potential of EP2T for other vision tasks such as flow estimation, event-to-image reconstruction and object recognition.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces innovative solutions to enhance spatial controllability in diffusion models reliant on text queries. We present two key innovations: Vision Guidance and the Layered Rendering Diffusion (LRDiff) framework. Vision Guidance, a spatial layout condition, acts as a clue in the perturbed distribution, greatly narrowing down the search space, to focus on the image sampling process adhering to the spatial layout condition. The LRDiff framework constructs an image-rendering process with multiple layers, each of which applies the vision guidance to instructively estimate the denoising direction for a single object. Such a layered rendering strategy effectively prevents issues like unintended conceptual blending or mismatches, while allowing for more coherent and contextually accurate image synthesis. The proposed method provides a more efficient and accurate means of synthesising images that align with specific spatial and contextual requirements. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method provides better results than existing techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively. We apply our method to three practical applications: bounding box-to-image, semantic mask-to-image and image editing.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable text understanding capabilities, which have been extended as Video LLMs to handle video data for comprehending visual details. However, existing Video LLMs can only provide a coarse description of the entire video, failing to capture the precise start and end time boundary of specific events. In this paper, we solve this issue via proposing VTimeLLM, a novel Video LLM designed for fine-grained video moment understanding and reasoning with respect to time boundary. Specifically, our VTimeLLM adopts a boundary-aware three-stage training strategy, which respectively utilizes image-text pairs for feature alignment, multiple-event videos to increase temporal-boundary awareness, and high-quality video-instruction tuning to further improve temporal understanding ability as well as align with human intents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in fine-grained time-related comprehension tasks for videos such as Temporal Video Grounding and Dense Video Captioning, VTimeLLM significantly outperforms existing Video LLMs. Besides, benefits from the fine-grained temporal understanding of the videos further enable VTimeLLM to beat existing Video LLMs in video dialogue benchmark, showing its superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning abilities.

- **Summary**: Since humans interact with diverse objects every day, the holistic 3D capture of these interactions is important to understand and model human behaviour. However, most existing methods for hand-object reconstruction from RGB either assume pre-scanned object templates or heavily rely on limited 3D hand-object data, restricting their ability to scale and generalize to more unconstrained interaction settings. To this end, we introduce HOLD -- the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs an articulated hand and object jointly from a monocular interaction video. We develop a compositional articulated implicit model that can reconstruct disentangled 3D hand and object from 2D images. We also further incorporate hand-object constraints to improve hand-object poses and consequently the reconstruction quality. Our method does not rely on 3D hand-object annotations while outperforming fully-supervised baselines in both in-the-lab and challenging in-the-wild settings. Moreover, we qualitatively show its robustness in reconstructing from in-the-wild videos. Code: https://github.com/zc-alexfan/hold

- **Summary**: Prototypical-part interpretable methods, e.g., ProtoPNet, enhance interpretability by connecting classification predictions to class-specific training prototypes, thereby offering an intuitive insight into their decision-making. Current methods rely on a discriminative classifier trained with point-based learning techniques that provide specific values for prototypes. Such prototypes have relatively low representation power due to their sparsity and potential redundancy, with each prototype containing no variability measure. In this paper, we present a new generative learning of prototype distributions, named Mixture of Gaussian-distributed Prototypes (MGProto), which are represented by Gaussian mixture models (GMM). Such an approach enables the learning of more powerful prototype representations since each learned prototype will own a measure of variability, which naturally reduces the sparsity given the spread of the distribution around each prototype, and we also integrate a prototype diversity objective function into the GMM optimisation to reduce redundancy. Incidentally, the generative nature of MGProto offers a new and effective way for detecting out-of-distribution samples. To improve the compactness of MGProto, we further propose to prune Gaussian-distributed prototypes with a low prior. Experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, and Oxford-IIIT Pets datasets show that MGProto achieves state-of-the-art classification and OoD detection performances with encouraging interpretability results.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary querying in 3D space is challenging but essential for scene understanding tasks such as object localization and segmentation. Language-embedded scene representations have made progress by incorporating language features into 3D spaces. However, their efficacy heavily depends on neural networks that are resource-intensive in training and rendering. Although recent 3D Gaussians offer efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis, directly embedding language features in them leads to prohibitive memory usage and decreased performance. In this work, we introduce Language Embedded 3D Gaussians, a novel scene representation for open-vocabulary query tasks. Instead of embedding high-dimensional raw semantic features on 3D Gaussians, we propose a dedicated quantization scheme that drastically alleviates the memory requirement, and a novel embedding procedure that achieves smoother yet high accuracy query, countering the multi-view feature inconsistencies and the high-frequency inductive bias in point-based representations. Our comprehensive experiments show that our representation achieves the best visual quality and language querying accuracy across current language-embedded representations, while maintaining real-time rendering frame rates on a single desktop GPU.

- **Summary**: In the field of media production, video editing techniques play a pivotal role. Recent approaches have had great success at performing novel view image synthesis of static scenes. But adding temporal information adds an extra layer of complexity. Previous models have focused on implicitly representing static and dynamic scenes using NeRF. These models achieve impressive results but are costly at training and inference time. They overfit an MLP to describe the scene implicitly as a function of position. This paper proposes ZeST-NeRF, a new approach that can produce temporal NeRFs for new scenes without retraining. We can accurately reconstruct novel views using multi-view synthesis techniques and scene flow-field estimation, trained only with unrelated scenes. We demonstrate how existing state-of-the-art approaches from a range of fields cannot adequately solve this new task and demonstrate the efficacy of our solution. The resulting network improves quantitatively by 15% and produces significantly better visual results.

- **Summary**: Surface reconstruction with preservation of geometric features is a challenging computer vision task. Despite significant progress in implicit shape reconstruction, state-of-the-art mesh extraction methods often produce aliased, perceptually distorted surfaces and lack scalability to high-resolution 3D shapes. We present a data-driven approach for automatic feature detection and remeshing that requires only a coarse, aliased mesh as input and scales to arbitrary resolution reconstructions. We define and learn a collection of surface-based fields to (1) capture sharp geometric features in the shape with an implicit vertexwise model and (2) approximate improvements in normals alignment obtained by applying edge-flips with an edgewise model. To support scaling to arbitrary complexity shapes, we learn our fields using local triangulated patches, fusing estimates on complete surface meshes. Our feature remeshing algorithm integrates the learned fields as sharp feature priors and optimizes vertex placement and mesh connectivity for maximum expected surface improvement. On a challenging collection of high-resolution shape reconstructions in the ABC dataset, our algorithm improves over state-of-the-art by 26% normals F-score and 42% perceptual $\text{RMSE}_{\text{v}}$.

- **Summary**: Neural networks are susceptible to adversarial perturbations that are transferable across different models. In this paper, we introduce a novel model alignment technique aimed at improving a given source model's ability in generating transferable adversarial perturbations. During the alignment process, the parameters of the source model are fine-tuned to minimize an alignment loss. This loss measures the divergence in the predictions between the source model and another, independently trained model, referred to as the witness model. To understand the effect of model alignment, we conduct a geometric anlaysis of the resulting changes in the loss landscape. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset, using a variety of model architectures, demonstrate that perturbations generated from aligned source models exhibit significantly higher transferability than those from the original source model.

- **Summary**: Optic disc and cup segmentation play a crucial role in automating the screening and diagnosis of optic glaucoma. While data-driven convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show promise in this area, the inherent ambiguity of segmenting object and background boundaries in the task of optic disc and cup segmentation leads to noisy annotations that impact model performance. To address this, we propose an innovative label-denoising method of Multiple Pseudo-labels Noise-aware Network (MPNN) for accurate optic disc and cup segmentation. Specifically, the Multiple Pseudo-labels Generation and Guided Denoising (MPGGD) module generates pseudo-labels by multiple different initialization networks trained on true labels, and the pixel-level consensus information extracted from these pseudo-labels guides to differentiate clean pixels from noisy pixels. The training framework of the MPNN is constructed by a teacher-student architecture to learn segmentation from clean pixels and noisy pixels. Particularly, such a framework adeptly leverages (i) reliable and fundamental insights from clean pixels and (ii) the supplementary knowledge within noisy pixels via multiple perturbation-based unsupervised consistency. Compared to other label-denoising methods, comprehensive experimental results on the RIGA dataset demonstrate our method's excellent performance and significant denoising ability.

- **Summary**: It is well known the adversarial optimization of GAN-based image super-resolution (SR) methods makes the preceding SR model generate unpleasant and undesirable artifacts, leading to large distortion. We attribute the cause of such distortions to the poor calibration of the discriminator, which hampers its ability to provide meaningful feedback to the generator for learning high-quality images. To address this problem, we propose a simple but non-travel diffusion-style data augmentation scheme for current GAN-based SR methods, known as DifAugGAN. It involves adapting the diffusion process in generative diffusion models for improving the calibration of the discriminator during training motivated by the successes of data augmentation schemes in the field to achieve good calibration. Our DifAugGAN can be a Plug-and-Play strategy for current GAN-based SISR methods to improve the calibration of the discriminator and thus improve SR performance. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of DifAugGAN over state-of-the-art GAN-based SISR methods across both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing notable advancements in both qualitative and quantitative results.

- **Summary**: This paper revisits the pipeline for detecting objects in images with proposals. For any object detector, the obtained box proposals or queries need to be classified and regressed towards ground truth boxes. The common solution for the final predictions is to directly maximize the overlap between each proposal and the ground truth box, followed by a winner-takes-all ranking or non-maximum suppression. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective alternative. For proposal regression, we solve a simpler problem where we regress to the area of intersection between proposal and ground truth. In this way, each proposal only specifies which part contains the object, avoiding a blind inpainting problem where proposals need to be regressed beyond their visual scope. In turn, we replace the winner-takes-all strategy and obtain the final prediction by taking the union over the regressed intersections of a proposal group surrounding an object. Our revisited approach comes with minimal changes to the detection pipeline and can be plugged into any existing method. We show that our approach directly improves canonical object detection and instance segmentation architectures, highlighting the utility of intersection-based regression and grouping.

- **Summary**: Art objects can evoke certain emotions. Color is a fundamental element of visual art and plays a significant role in how art is perceived. This paper introduces a novel approach to classifying emotions in art using Fuzzy Sets. We employ a fuzzy approach because it aligns well with human judgments' imprecise and subjective nature. Extensive fuzzy colors (n=120) and a broad emotional spectrum (n=10) allow for a more human-consistent and context-aware exploration of emotions inherent in paintings. First, we introduce the fuzzy color representation model. Then, at the fuzzification stage, we process the Wiki Art Dataset of paintings tagged with emotions, extracting fuzzy dominant colors linked to specific emotions. This results in fuzzy color distributions for ten emotions. Finally, we convert them back to a crisp domain, obtaining a knowledge base of color-emotion associations in primary colors. Our findings reveal strong associations between specific emotions and colors; for instance, gratitude strongly correlates with green, brown, and orange. Other noteworthy associations include brown and anger, orange with shame, yellow with happiness, and gray with fear. Using these associations and Jaccard similarity, we can find the emotions in the arbitrary untagged image. We conducted a 2AFC experiment involving human subjects to evaluate the proposed method. The average hit rate of 0.77 indicates a significant correlation between the method's predictions and human perception. The proposed method is simple to adapt to art painting retrieval systems. The study contributes to the theoretical understanding of color-emotion associations in art, offering valuable insights for various practical applications besides art, like marketing, design, and psychology.

- **Summary**: Sampling from diffusion models can be treated as solving the corresponding ordinary differential equations (ODEs), with the aim of obtaining an accurate solution with as few number of function evaluations (NFE) as possible. Recently, various fast samplers utilizing higher-order ODE solvers have emerged and achieved better performance than the initial first-order one. However, these numerical methods inherently result in certain approximation errors, which significantly degrades sample quality with extremely small NFE (e.g., around 5). In contrast, based on the geometric observation that each sampling trajectory almost lies in a two-dimensional subspace embedded in the ambient space, we propose Approximate MEan-Direction Solver (AMED-Solver) that eliminates truncation errors by directly learning the mean direction for fast diffusion sampling. Besides, our method can be easily used as a plugin to further improve existing ODE-based samplers. Extensive experiments on image synthesis with the resolution ranging from 32 to 256 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. With only 5 NFE, we achieve 7.14 FID on CIFAR-10, 13.75 FID on ImageNet 64$\times$64, and 12.79 FID on LSUN Bedroom. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhyzhouu/amed-solver.

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation (DD) offers a compelling approach in computer vision, with the goal of condensing extensive datasets into smaller synthetic versions without sacrificing much of the model performance. In this paper, we continue to study the methods for DD, by addressing its conceptually core objective: how to capture the essential representation of extensive datasets in smaller, synthetic forms.   We propose a novel approach utilizing the Wasserstein distance, a metric rooted in optimal transport theory, to enhance distribution matching in DD. Our method leverages the Wasserstein barycenter, offering a geometrically meaningful way to quantify distribution differences and effectively capture the centroid of a set of distributions. Our approach retains the computational benefits of distribution matching-based methods while achieving new state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.   To provide useful prior for learning the images, we embed the synthetic data into the feature space of pretrained classification models to conduct distribution matching. Extensive testing on various high-resolution datasets confirms the effectiveness and adaptability of our method, indicating the promising yet unexplored capabilities of Wasserstein metrics in dataset distillation.

- **Summary**: Video panoptic segmentation requires consistently segmenting (for both `thing' and `stuff' classes) and tracking objects in a video over time. In this work, we present MaXTron, a general framework that exploits Mask XFormer with Trajectory Attention to tackle the task. MaXTron enriches an off-the-shelf mask transformer by leveraging trajectory attention. The deployed mask transformer takes as input a short clip consisting of only a few frames and predicts the clip-level segmentation. To enhance the temporal consistency, MaXTron employs within-clip and cross-clip tracking modules, efficiently utilizing trajectory attention. Originally designed for video classification, trajectory attention learns to model the temporal correspondences between neighboring frames and aggregates information along the estimated motion paths. However, it is nontrivial to directly extend trajectory attention to the per-pixel dense prediction tasks due to its quadratic dependency on input size. To alleviate the issue, we propose to adapt the trajectory attention for both the dense pixel features and object queries, aiming to improve the short-term and long-term tracking results, respectively. Particularly, in our within-clip tracking module, we propose axial-trajectory attention that effectively computes the trajectory attention for tracking dense pixels sequentially along the height- and width-axes. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the computational complexity for dense pixel features. In our cross-clip tracking module, since the object queries in mask transformer are learned to encode the object information, we are able to capture the long-term temporal connections by applying trajectory attention to object queries, which learns to track each object across different clips. Without bells and whistles, MaXTron demonstrates state-of-the-art performances on video segmentation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Recent approaches for semantic correspondence have focused on obtaining high-quality correspondences using a complicated network, refining the ambiguous or noisy matching points. Despite their performance improvements, they remain constrained by the limited training pairs due to costly point-level annotations. This paper proposes a simple yet effective method that performs training with unlabeled pairs to complement both limited image pairs and sparse point pairs, requiring neither extra labeled keypoints nor trainable modules. We fundamentally extend the data quantity and variety by augmenting new unannotated pairs not primitively provided as training pairs in benchmarks. Using a simple teacher-student framework, we offer reliable pseudo correspondences to the student network via machine supervision. Finally, the performance of our network is steadily improved by the proposed iterative training, putting back the student as a teacher to generate refined labels and train a new student repeatedly. Our models outperform the milestone baselines, including state-of-the-art methods on semantic correspondence benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Due to the resource-intensive nature of training vision-language models on expansive video data, a majority of studies have centered on adapting pre-trained image-language models to the video domain. Dominant pipelines propose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learners while overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptive narratives and concise action category names, leading to less distinct semantic space and potential performance limitations. In this work, we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach. Our best model achieves a state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy of 75.1% on Kinetics-600.

- **Summary**: We propose SparseDC, a model for Depth Completion of Sparse and non-uniform depth inputs. Unlike previous methods focusing on completing fixed distributions on benchmark datasets (e.g., NYU with 500 points, KITTI with 64 lines), SparseDC is specifically designed to handle depth maps with poor quality in real usage. The key contributions of SparseDC are two-fold. First, we design a simple strategy, called SFFM, to improve the robustness under sparse input by explicitly filling the unstable depth features with stable image features. Second, we propose a two-branch feature embedder to predict both the precise local geometry of regions with available depth values and accurate structures in regions with no depth. The key of the embedder is an uncertainty-based fusion module called UFFM to balance the local and long-term information extracted by CNNs and ViTs. Extensive indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate the robustness of our framework when facing sparse and non-uniform input depths. The pre-trained model and code are available at https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/SparseDC.

- **Summary**: Precisely predicting the future trajectories of surrounding traffic participants is a crucial but challenging problem in autonomous driving, due to complex interactions between traffic agents, map context and traffic rules. Vector-based approaches have recently shown to achieve among the best performances on trajectory prediction benchmarks. These methods model simple interactions between traffic agents but don't distinguish between relation-type and attributes like their distance along the road. Furthermore, they represent lanes only by sequences of vectors representing center lines and ignore context information like lane dividers and other road elements. We present a novel approach for vector-based trajectory prediction that addresses these shortcomings by leveraging three crucial sources of information: First, we model interactions between traffic agents by a semantic scene graph, that accounts for the nature and important features of their relation. Second, we extract agent-centric image-based map features to model the local map context. Finally, we generate anchor paths to enforce the policy in multi-modal prediction to permitted trajectories only. Each of these three enhancements shows advantages over the baseline model HoliGraph.

- **Summary**: Personalized federated learning (pFL) enables collaborative training among multiple clients to enhance the capability of customized local models. In pFL, clients may have heterogeneous (also known as non-IID) data, which poses a key challenge in how to decouple the data knowledge into generic knowledge for global sharing and personalized knowledge for preserving local personalization. A typical way of pFL focuses on label distribution skew, and they adopt a decoupling scheme where the model is split into a common feature extractor and two prediction heads (generic and personalized). However, such a decoupling scheme cannot solve the essential problem of feature skew heterogeneity, because a common feature extractor cannot decouple the generic and personalized features. Therefore, in this paper, we rethink the architecture decoupling design for feature-skew pFL and propose an effective pFL method called FediOS. In FediOS, we reformulate the decoupling into two feature extractors (generic and personalized) and one shared prediction head. Orthogonal projections are used for clients to map the generic features into one common subspace and scatter the personalized features into different subspaces to achieve decoupling for them. In addition, a shared prediction head is trained to balance the importance of generic and personalized features during inference. Extensive experiments on four vision datasets demonstrate our method reaches state-of-the-art pFL performances under feature skew heterogeneity.

- **Summary**: Modeling dynamic, large-scale urban scenes is challenging due to their highly intricate geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics in both space and time. Prior methods often employ high-level architectural priors, separating static and dynamic elements, resulting in suboptimal capture of their synergistic interactions. To address this challenge, we present a unified representation model, called Periodic Vibration Gaussian (PVG). PVG builds upon the efficient 3D Gaussian splatting technique, originally designed for static scene representation, by introducing periodic vibration-based temporal dynamics. This innovation enables PVG to elegantly and uniformly represent the characteristics of various objects and elements in dynamic urban scenes. To enhance temporally coherent representation learning with sparse training data, we introduce a novel flow-based temporal smoothing mechanism and a position-aware adaptive control strategy. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that PVG surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis for both dynamic and static scenes. Notably, PVG achieves this without relying on manually labeled object bounding boxes or expensive optical flow estimation. Moreover, PVG exhibits 50/6000-fold acceleration in training/rendering over the best alternative.

- **Summary**: Seam-cutting methods have been proven effective in the composition step of image stitching, especially for images with parallax. However, the effectiveness of seam-cutting usually depends on that images can be roughly aligned such that there exists a local region where a plausible seam can be found. For images with large parallax, current alignment methods often fall short of expectations. In this paper, we propose a local alignment and stitching method guided by seam quality evaluation. First, we use existing image alignment and seam-cutting methods to calculate an initial seam and evaluate the quality of pixels along the seam. Then, for pixels with low qualities, we separate their enclosing patches in the aligned images and locally align them by extracting modified dense correspondences via SIFT flow. Finally, we composite the aligned patches via seam-cutting and merge them into the original aligned result to generate the final mosaic. Experiments show that compared with the state-of-the-art seam-cutting methods, our result is more plausible and with fewer artifacts. The code will be available at https://github.com/tlliao/Seam-guided-local-alignment.

- **Summary**: Despite the progress seen in classification methods, current approaches for handling videos with distribution shifts in source and target domains remain source-dependent as they require access to the source data during the adaptation stage. In this paper, we present a self-training based source-free video domain adaptation approach to address this challenge by bridging the gap between the source and the target domains. We use the source pre-trained model to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain samples, which are inevitably noisy. Thus, we treat the problem of source-free video domain adaptation as learning from noisy labels and argue that the samples with correct pseudo-labels can help us in adaptation. To this end, we leverage the cross-entropy loss as an indicator of the correctness of the pseudo-labels and use the resulting small-loss samples from the target domain for fine-tuning the model. We further enhance the adaptation performance by implementing a teacher-student framework, in which the teacher, which is updated gradually, produces reliable pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, the student undergoes fine-tuning on the target domain videos using these generated pseudo-labels to improve its performance. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our methods, termed as CleanAdapt, CleanAdapt + TS, achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming the existing approaches on various open datasets.

We propose the development of a deep learning model capable of recognizing these locations during movie viewing. The model is trained on a dataset comprising major tourism destinations worldwide. Through this research, the goal is to enable viewers to identify the real-world locations depicted in movie scenes, offering a novel way to connect cinema with global travel experiences.

- **Summary**: Compared to minutia-based fingerprint representations, fixed-length representations are attractive due to simple and efficient matching. However, fixed-length fingerprint representations are limited in accuracy when matching fingerprints with different visible areas, which can occur due to different finger poses or acquisition methods. To address this issue, we propose a localized deep representation of fingerprint, named LDRF. By focusing on the discriminative characteristics within local regions, LDRF provides a more robust and accurate fixed-length representation for fingerprints with variable visible areas. LDRF can be adapted to retain information within any valid area, making it highly flexible. The matching scores produced by LDRF also exhibit intuitive statistical characteristics, which led us to propose a matching score normalization technique to mitigate the uncertainty in the cases of very small overlapping area. With this new technique, we can maintain a high level of accuracy and reliability in our fingerprint matching, even as the size of the database grows rapidly. Our experimental results on 21 datasets containing over 140K fingerprints of various finger poses and impression types show that LDRF outperforms other fixed-length representations and is robust to sensing technologies and impression types. Besides, the proposed matching score normalization effectively reduces the false match rate (FMR) in large-scale identification experiments comprising over 5.11 million fingerprints. Specifically, this technique results in a reduction of two orders of magnitude compared to matching without matching score normalization and five orders of magnitude compared to prior works.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is the state-of-the-art approach for learning from decentralized data in privacy-constrained scenarios. As the current literature reports, the main problems associated with FL refer to system and statistical challenges: the former ones demand for efficient learning from edge devices, including lowering communication bandwidth and frequency, while the latter require algorithms robust to non-iidness. State-of-art approaches either guarantee convergence at increased communication cost or are not sufficiently robust to handle extreme heterogeneous local distributions. In this work we propose a novel generalization of the heavy-ball momentum, and present FedHBM to effectively address statistical heterogeneity in FL without introducing any communication overhead. We conduct extensive experimentation on common FL vision and NLP datasets, showing that our FedHBM algorithm empirically yields better model quality and higher convergence speed w.r.t. the state-of-art, especially in pathological non-iid scenarios. While being designed for cross-silo settings, we show how FedHBM is applicable in moderate-to-high cross-device scenarios, and how good model initializations (e.g. pre-training) can be exploited for prompt acceleration. Extended experimentation on large-scale real-world federated datasets further corroborates the effectiveness of our approach for real-world FL applications.

- **Summary**: Pattern recognition through the fusion of RGB frames and Event streams has emerged as a novel research area in recent years. Current methods typically employ backbone networks to individually extract the features of RGB frames and event streams, and subsequently fuse these features for pattern recognition. However, we posit that these methods may suffer from key issues like sematic gaps and small-scale backbone networks. In this study, we introduce a novel pattern recognition framework that consolidates the semantic labels, RGB frames, and event streams, leveraging pre-trained large-scale vision-language models. Specifically, given the input RGB frames, event streams, and all the predefined semantic labels, we employ a pre-trained large-scale vision model (CLIP vision encoder) to extract the RGB and event features. To handle the semantic labels, we initially convert them into language descriptions through prompt engineering, and then obtain the semantic features using the pre-trained large-scale language model (CLIP text encoder). Subsequently, we integrate the RGB/Event features and semantic features using multimodal Transformer networks. The resulting frame and event tokens are further amplified using self-attention layers. Concurrently, we propose to enhance the interactions between text tokens and RGB/Event tokens via cross-attention. Finally, we consolidate all three modalities using self-attention and feed-forward layers for recognition. Comprehensive experiments on the HARDVS and PokerEvent datasets fully substantiate the efficacy of our proposed SAFE model.

- **Summary**: Convolution neural network is successful in pervasive vision tasks, including label distribution learning, which usually takes the form of learning an injection from the non-linear visual features to the well-defined labels. However, how the discrepancy between features is mapped to the label discrepancy is ambient, and its correctness is not guaranteed. To address these problems, we study the mathematical connection between feature and its label, presenting a general and simple framework for label distribution learning. We propose a so-called Triangular Distribution Transform (TDT) to build an injective function between feature and label, guaranteeing that any symmetric feature discrepancy linearly reflects the difference between labels. The proposed TDT can be used as a plug-in in mainstream backbone networks to address different label distribution learning tasks. Experiments on Facial Age Recognition, Illumination Chromaticity Estimation, and Aesthetics assessment show that TDT achieves on-par or better results than the prior arts.

- **Summary**: With the remarkable advent of text-to-image diffusion models, image editing methods have become more diverse and continue to evolve. A promising recent approach in this realm is Delta Denoising Score (DDS) - an image editing technique based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. However, relying solely on the difference between scoring functions is insufficient for preserving specific structural elements from the original image, a crucial aspect of image editing. Inspired by the similarity and importance differences between DDS and the contrastive learning for unpaired image-to-image translation (CUT), here we present an embarrassingly simple yet very powerful modification of DDS, called Contrastive Denoising Score (CDS), for latent diffusion models (LDM). Specifically, to enforce structural correspondence between the input and output while maintaining the controllability of contents, we introduce a straightforward approach to regulate structural consistency using CUT loss within the DDS framework. To calculate this loss, instead of employing auxiliary networks, we utilize the intermediate features of LDM, in particular, those from the self-attention layers, which possesses rich spatial information. Our approach enables zero-shot image-to-image translation and neural radiance field (NeRF) editing, achieving a well-balanced interplay between maintaining the structural details and transforming content.

- **Summary**: Perceiving 3D structures from RGB images based on CAD model primitives can enable an effective, efficient 3D object-based representation of scenes. However, current approaches rely on supervision from expensive annotations of CAD models associated with real images, and encounter challenges due to the inherent ambiguities in the task -- both in depth-scale ambiguity in monocular perception, as well as inexact matches of CAD database models to real observations. We thus propose DiffCAD, the first weakly-supervised probabilistic approach to CAD retrieval and alignment from an RGB image. We formulate this as a conditional generative task, leveraging diffusion to learn implicit probabilistic models capturing the shape, pose, and scale of CAD objects in an image. This enables multi-hypothesis generation of different plausible CAD reconstructions, requiring only a few hypotheses to characterize ambiguities in depth/scale and inexact shape matches. Our approach is trained only on synthetic data, leveraging monocular depth and mask estimates to enable robust zero-shot adaptation to various real target domains. Despite being trained solely on synthetic data, our multi-hypothesis approach can even surpass the supervised state-of-the-art on the Scan2CAD dataset by 5.9% with 8 hypotheses.

- **Summary**: In Canada, prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men and accounted for 20% of new cancer cases for this demographic in 2022. Due to recent successes in leveraging machine learning for clinical decision support, there has been significant interest in the development of deep neural networks for prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data. A major challenge hindering widespread adoption in clinical use is poor generalization of such networks due to scarcity of large-scale, diverse, balanced prostate imaging datasets for training such networks. In this study, we explore the efficacy of latent diffusion for generating realistic prostate DWI data through the introduction of an anatomic-conditional controlled latent diffusion strategy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to leverage conditioning for synthesis of prostate cancer imaging. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy, which we call Cancer-Net PCa-Gen, enhances synthesis of diverse prostate images through controllable tumour locations and better anatomical and textural fidelity. These crucial features make it well-suited for augmenting real patient data, enabling neural networks to be trained on a more diverse and comprehensive data distribution. The Cancer-Net PCa-Gen framework and sample images have been made publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deetsadi/cancer-net-pca-gen-dataset as a part of a global open-source initiative dedicated to accelerating advancement in machine learning to aid clinicians in the fight against cancer.

- **Summary**: Part-aware panoptic segmentation is a problem of computer vision that aims to provide a semantic understanding of the scene at multiple levels of granularity. More precisely, semantic areas, object instances, and semantic parts are predicted simultaneously. In this paper, we present our Joint Panoptic Part Fusion (JPPF) that combines the three individual segmentations effectively to obtain a panoptic-part segmentation. Two aspects are of utmost importance for this: First, a unified model for the three problems is desired that allows for mutually improved and consistent representation learning. Second, balancing the combination so that it gives equal importance to all individual results during fusion. Our proposed JPPF is parameter-free and dynamically balances its input. The method is evaluated and compared on the Cityscapes Panoptic Parts (CPP) and Pascal Panoptic Parts (PPP) datasets in terms of PartPQ and Part-Whole Quality (PWQ). In extensive experiments, we verify the importance of our fair fusion, highlight its most significant impact for areas that can be further segmented into parts, and demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our design without fine-tuning on 5 additional datasets.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to label each pixel of an image to a corresponding class without the use of annotated data. It is a widely researched area as obtaining labeled datasets are expensive. While previous works in the field demonstrated a gradual improvement in segmentation performance, most of them required neural network training. This made segmentation equally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. We thereby propose a lightweight clustering framework for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Attention features of the self-supervised vision transformer exhibit strong foreground-background differentiability. By clustering these features into a small number of clusters, we could separate foreground and background image patches into distinct groupings. In our clustering framework, we first obtain attention features from the self-supervised vision transformer. Then we extract Dataset-level, Category-level and Image-level masks by clustering features within the same dataset, category and image. We further ensure multilevel clustering consistency across the three levels and this allows us to extract patch-level binary pseudo-masks. Finally, the pseudo-mask is upsampled, refined and class assignment is performed according to the CLS token of object regions. Our framework demonstrates great promise in unsupervised semantic segmentation and achieves state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.

- **Summary**: DiffusionAvatars synthesizes a high-fidelity 3D head avatar of a person, offering intuitive control over both pose and expression. We propose a diffusion-based neural renderer that leverages generic 2D priors to produce compelling images of faces. For coarse guidance of the expression and head pose, we render a neural parametric head model (NPHM) from the target viewpoint, which acts as a proxy geometry of the person. Additionally, to enhance the modeling of intricate facial expressions, we condition DiffusionAvatars directly on the expression codes obtained from NPHM via cross-attention. Finally, to synthesize consistent surface details across different viewpoints and expressions, we rig learnable spatial features to the head's surface via TriPlane lookup in NPHM's canonical space. We train DiffusionAvatars on RGB videos and corresponding tracked NPHM meshes of a person and test the obtained avatars in both self-reenactment and animation scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that DiffusionAvatars generates temporally consistent and visually appealing videos for novel poses and expressions of a person, outperforming existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning is one of the most promising approaches to acquiring knowledge from limited labeled data. Despite the substantial advancements made in recent years, self-supervised models have posed a challenge to practitioners, as they do not readily provide insight into the model's confidence and uncertainty. Tackling this issue is no simple feat, primarily due to the complexity involved in implementing techniques that can make use of the latent representations learned during pre-training without relying on explicit labels. Motivated by this, we introduce a new stochastic vision transformer that integrates uncertainty and distance awareness into self-supervised learning (SSL) pipelines. Instead of the conventional deterministic vector embedding, our novel stochastic vision transformer encodes image patches into elliptical Gaussian distributional embeddings. Notably, the attention matrices of these stochastic representational embeddings are computed using Wasserstein distance-based attention, effectively capitalizing on the distributional nature of these embeddings. Additionally, we propose a regularization term based on Wasserstein distance for both pre-training and fine-tuning processes, thereby incorporating distance awareness into latent representations. We perform extensive experiments across different tasks such as in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution detection, dataset corruption, semi-supervised settings, and transfer learning to other datasets and tasks. Our proposed method achieves superior accuracy and calibration, surpassing the self-supervised baseline in a wide range of experiments on a variety of datasets.

- **Summary**: Learning from a limited amount of data, namely Few-Shot Learning, stands out as a challenging computer vision task. Several works exploit semantics and design complicated semantic fusion mechanisms to compensate for rare representative features within restricted data. However, relying on naive semantics such as class names introduces biases due to their brevity, while acquiring extensive semantics from external knowledge takes a huge time and effort. This limitation severely constrains the potential of semantics in few-shot learning. In this paper, we design an automatic way called Semantic Evolution to generate high-quality semantics. The incorporation of high-quality semantics alleviates the need for complex network structures and learning algorithms used in previous works. Hence, we employ a simple two-layer network termed Semantic Alignment Network to transform semantics and visual features into robust class prototypes with rich discriminative features for few-shot classification. The experimental results show our framework outperforms all previous methods on five benchmarks, demonstrating a simple network with high-quality semantics can beat intricate multi-modal modules on few-shot classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised representation learning aims at finding methods that learn representations from data without annotation-based signals. Abstaining from annotations not only leads to economic benefits but may - and to some extent already does - result in advantages regarding the representation's structure, robustness, and generalizability to different tasks. In the long run, unsupervised methods are expected to surpass their supervised counterparts due to the reduction of human intervention and the inherently more general setup that does not bias the optimization towards an objective originating from specific annotation-based signals. While major advantages of unsupervised representation learning have been recently observed in natural language processing, supervised methods still dominate in vision domains for most tasks. In this dissertation, we contribute to the field of unsupervised (visual) representation learning from three perspectives: (i) Learning representations: We design unsupervised, backpropagation-free Convolutional Self-Organizing Neural Networks (CSNNs) that utilize self-organization- and Hebbian-based learning rules to learn convolutional kernels and masks to achieve deeper backpropagation-free models. (ii) Evaluating representations: We build upon the widely used (non-)linear evaluation protocol to define pretext- and target-objective-independent metrics for measuring and investigating the objective function mismatch between various unsupervised pretext tasks and target tasks. (iii) Transferring representations: We contribute CARLANE, the first 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection, and a method based on prototypical self-supervised learning. Finally, we contribute a content-consistent unpaired image-to-image translation method that utilizes masks, global and local discriminators, and similarity sampling to mitigate content inconsistencies.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMM) have made it possible for various applications in human-machine interactions. However, developing LMMs that can comprehend, reason, and plan in complex and diverse 3D environments remains a challenging topic, especially considering the demand for understanding permutation-invariant point cloud 3D representations of the 3D scene. Existing works seek help from multi-view images, and project 2D features to 3D space as 3D scene representations. This, however, leads to huge computational overhead and performance degradation. In this paper, we present LL3DA, a Large Language 3D Assistant that takes point cloud as direct input and respond to both textual-instructions and visual-prompts. This help LMMs better comprehend human interactions and further help to remove the ambiguities in cluttered 3D scenes. Experiments show that LL3DA achieves remarkable results, and surpasses various 3D vision-language models on both 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Question Answering.

- **Summary**: Text-driven large scene image synthesis has made significant progress with diffusion models, but controlling it is challenging. While using additional spatial controls with corresponding texts has improved the controllability of large scene synthesis, it is still challenging to faithfully reflect detailed text descriptions without user-provided controls. Here, we propose DetText2Scene, a novel text-driven large-scale image synthesis with high faithfulness, controllability, and naturalness in a global context for the detailed human-centric text description. Our DetText2Scene consists of 1) hierarchical keypoint-box layout generation from the detailed description by leveraging large language model (LLM), 2) view-wise conditioned joint diffusion process to synthesize a large scene from the given detailed text with LLM-generated grounded keypoint-box layout and 3) pixel perturbation-based pyramidal interpolation to progressively refine the large scene for global coherence. Our DetText2Scene significantly outperforms prior arts in text-to-large scene synthesis qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating strong faithfulness with detailed descriptions, superior controllability, and excellent naturalness in a global context.

- **Summary**: Semantic part segmentation provides an intricate and interpretable understanding of an object, thereby benefiting numerous downstream tasks. However, the need for exhaustive annotations impedes its usage across diverse object types. This paper focuses on learning part segmentation from synthetic animals, leveraging the Skinned Multi-Animal Linear (SMAL) models to scale up existing synthetic data generated by computer-aided design (CAD) animal models. Compared to CAD models, SMAL models generate data with a wider range of poses observed in real-world scenarios. As a result, our first contribution is to construct a synthetic animal dataset of tigers and horses with more pose diversity, termed Synthetic Animal Parts (SAP). We then benchmark Syn-to-Real animal part segmentation from SAP to PartImageNet, namely SynRealPart, with existing semantic segmentation domain adaptation methods and further improve them as our second contribution. Concretely, we examine three Syn-to-Real adaptation methods but observe relative performance drop due to the innate difference between the two tasks. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method called Class-Balanced Fourier Data Mixing (CB-FDM). Fourier Data Mixing aligns the spectral amplitudes of synthetic images with real images, thereby making the mixed images have more similar frequency content to real images. We further use Class-Balanced Pseudo-Label Re-Weighting to alleviate the imbalanced class distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of CB-FDM on SynRealPart over previous methods with significant performance improvements. Remarkably, our third contribution is to reveal that the learned parts from synthetic tiger and horse are transferable across all quadrupeds in PartImageNet, further underscoring the utility and potential applications of animal part segmentation.

- **Summary**: Colonoscopy screening is the gold standard procedure for assessing abnormalities in the colon and rectum, such as ulcers and cancerous polyps. Measuring the abnormal mucosal area and its 3D reconstruction can help quantify the surveyed area and objectively evaluate disease burden. However, due to the complex topology of these organs and variable physical conditions, for example, lighting, large homogeneous texture, and image modality estimating distance from the camera aka depth) is highly challenging. Moreover, most colonoscopic video acquisition is monocular, making the depth estimation a non-trivial problem. While methods in computer vision for depth estimation have been proposed and advanced on natural scene datasets, the efficacy of these techniques has not been widely quantified on colonoscopy datasets. As the colonic mucosa has several low-texture regions that are not well pronounced, learning representations from an auxiliary task can improve salient feature extraction, allowing estimation of accurate camera depths. In this work, we propose to develop a novel multi-task learning (MTL) approach with a shared encoder and two decoders, namely a surface normal decoder and a depth estimator decoder. Our depth estimator incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance global context awareness. We leverage the surface normal prediction to improve geometric feature extraction. Also, we apply a cross-task consistency loss among the two geometrically related tasks, surface normal and camera depth. We demonstrate an improvement of 14.17% on relative error and 10.4% improvement on $\delta_{1}$ accuracy over the most accurate baseline state-of-the-art BTS approach. All experiments are conducted on a recently released C3VD dataset; thus, we provide a first benchmark of state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Aircraft Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) is a system designed to arrest helicopters safely and efficiently on ships. Originally, a precision Helicopter Position Sensing Equipment (HPSE) tracked and monitored the position of the helicopter relative to the Rapid Securing Device (RSD). However, using the HPSE component was determined to be infeasible in the transition of the ASIST system due to the hardware installation requirements. As a result, sailors track the position of the helicopters with their eyes with no sensor or artificially intelligent decision aid. Manually tracking the helicopter takes additional time and makes recoveries more difficult, especially at high sea states. Performing recoveries without the decision aid leads to higher uncertainty and cognitive load. PETA (Pose Estimation and Tracking for ASIST) is a research effort to create a helicopter tracking system prototype without hardware installation requirements for ASIST system operators. Its overall goal is to improve situational awareness and reduce operator uncertainty with respect to the aircrafts position relative to the RSD, and consequently increase the allowable landing area. The authors produced a prototype system capable of tracking helicopters with respect to the RSD. The software included a helicopter pose estimation component, camera pose estimation component, and a user interface component. PETA demonstrated the potential for state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms Faster R-CNN and HRNet (High-Resolution Network) to be used to estimate the pose of helicopters in real-time, returning ASIST to its originally intended capability. PETA also demonstrated that traditional methods of encoder-decoders could be used to estimate the orientation of the helicopter and could be used to confirm the output from HRNet.

- **Summary**: Action recognition is a prerequisite for many applications in laparoscopic video analysis including but not limited to surgical training, operation room planning, follow-up surgery preparation, post-operative surgical assessment, and surgical outcome estimation. However, automatic action recognition in laparoscopic surgeries involves numerous challenges such as (I) cross-action and intra-action duration variation, (II) relevant content distortion due to smoke, blood accumulation, fast camera motions, organ movements, object occlusion, and (III) surgical scene variations due to different illuminations and viewpoints. Besides, action annotations in laparoscopy surgeries are limited and expensive due to requiring expert knowledge. In this study, we design and evaluate a CNN-RNN architecture as well as a customized training-inference framework to deal with the mentioned challenges in laparoscopic surgery action recognition. Using stacked recurrent layers, our proposed network takes advantage of inter-frame dependencies to negate the negative effect of content distortion and variation in action recognition. Furthermore, our proposed frame sampling strategy effectively manages the duration variations in surgical actions to enable action recognition with high temporal resolution. Our extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our proposed method in action recognition compared to static CNNs.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks have been widely applied in salient object detection and have achieved remarkable results in this field. However, existing models suffer from information distortion caused by interpolation during up-sampling and down-sampling. In response to this drawback, this article starts from two directions in the network: feature and label. On the one hand, a novel cascaded interaction network with a guidance module named global-local aligned attention (GAA) is designed to reduce the negative impact of interpolation on the feature side. On the other hand, a deep supervision strategy based on edge erosion is proposed to reduce the negative guidance of label interpolation on lateral output. Extensive experiments on five popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Conversational AI tools that can generate and discuss clinically correct radiology reports for a given medical image have the potential to transform radiology. Such a human-in-the-loop radiology assistant could facilitate a collaborative diagnostic process, thus saving time and improving the quality of reports. Towards this goal, we introduce RaDialog, the first thoroughly evaluated and publicly available large vision-language model for radiology report generation and interactive dialog. RaDialog effectively integrates visual image features and structured pathology findings with a large language model (LLM) while simultaneously adapting it to a specialized domain using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To keep the conversational abilities of the underlying LLM, we propose a comprehensive, semi-automatically labeled, image-grounded instruct dataset for chest X-ray radiology tasks. By training with this dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art clinical correctness in report generation and shows impressive abilities in interactive tasks such as correcting reports and answering questions, serving as a foundational step toward clinical dialog systems. Our code is available on github: https://github.com/ChantalMP/RaDialog.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art single-view 360-degree room layout reconstruction methods formulate the problem as a high-level 1D (per-column) regression task. On the other hand, traditional low-level 2D layout segmentation is simpler to learn and can represent occluded regions, but it requires complex post-processing for the targeting layout polygon and sacrifices accuracy. We present Seg2Reg to render 1D layout depth regression from the 2D segmentation map in a differentiable and occlusion-aware way, marrying the merits of both sides. Specifically, our model predicts floor-plan density for the input equirectangular 360-degree image. Formulating the 2D layout representation as a density field enables us to employ `flattened' volume rendering to form 1D layout depth regression. In addition, we propose a novel 3D warping augmentation on layout to improve generalization. Finally, we re-implement recent room layout reconstruction methods into our codebase for benchmarking and explore modern backbones and training techniques to serve as the strong baseline. Our model significantly outperforms previous arts. The code will be made available upon publication.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have become a foundational tool for addressing imaging inverse problems. They are typically trained for a specific task, with a supervised loss to learn a mapping from the observations to the image to recover. However, real-world imaging challenges often lack ground truth data, rendering traditional supervised approaches ineffective. Moreover, for each new imaging task, a new model needs to be trained from scratch, wasting time and resources. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach based on meta-learning. Our method trains a meta-model on a diverse set of imaging tasks that allows the model to be efficiently fine-tuned for specific tasks with few fine-tuning steps. We show that the proposed method extends to the unsupervised setting, where no ground truth data is available. In its bilevel formulation, the outer level uses a supervised loss, that evaluates how well the fine-tuned model performs, while the inner loss can be either supervised or unsupervised, relying only on the measurement operator. This allows the meta-model to leverage a few ground truth samples for each task while being able to generalize to new imaging tasks. We show that in simple settings, this approach recovers the Bayes optimal estimator, illustrating the soundness of our approach. We also demonstrate our method's effectiveness on various tasks, including image processing and magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Summary**: Most real-world applications that employ deep neural networks (DNNs) quantize them to low precision to reduce the compute needs. We present a method to improve the robustness of quantized DNNs to white-box adversarial attacks. We first tackle the limitation of deterministic quantization to fixed ``bins'' by introducing a differentiable Stochastic Quantizer (SQ). We explore the hypothesis that different quantizations may collectively be more robust than each quantized DNN. We formulate a training objective to encourage different quantized DNNs to learn different representations of the input image. The training objective captures diversity and accuracy via mutual information between ensemble members. Through experimentation, we demonstrate substantial improvement in robustness against $L_\infty$ attacks even if the attacker is allowed to backpropagate through SQ (e.g., > 50\% accuracy to PGD(5/255) on CIFAR10 without adversarial training), compared to vanilla DNNs as well as existing ensembles of quantized DNNs. We extend the method to detect attacks and generate robustness profiles in the adversarial information plane (AIP), towards a unified analysis of different threat models by correlating the MI and accuracy.

- **Summary**: Existing one-shot 4D head synthesis methods usually learn from monocular videos with the aid of 3DMM reconstruction, yet the latter is evenly challenging which restricts them from reasonable 4D head synthesis. We present a method to learn one-shot 4D head synthesis via large-scale synthetic data. The key is to first learn a part-wise 4D generative model from monocular images via adversarial learning, to synthesize multi-view images of diverse identities and full motions as training data; then leverage a transformer-based animatable triplane reconstructor to learn 4D head reconstruction using the synthetic data. A novel learning strategy is enforced to enhance the generalizability to real images by disentangling the learning process of 3D reconstruction and reenactment. Experiments demonstrate our superiority over the prior art.

- **Summary**: Humans possess the remarkable ability to foresee the future to a certain extent based on present observations, a skill we term as foresight minds. However, this capability remains largely under explored within existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), hindering their capacity to learn the fundamental principles of how things operate and the intentions behind the observed subjects. To address this issue, we introduce the integration of future modeling into the existing learning frameworks of MLLMs. By utilizing the subject trajectory, a highly structured representation of a consecutive frame sequence, as a learning objective, we aim to bridge the gap between the past and the future. We propose two innovative methods to empower MLLMs with foresight minds, Foresight Pre-Training (FPT) and Foresight Instruction-Tuning (FIT), which are inspired by the modern learning paradigm of LLMs. Specifically, FPT jointly training various tasks centered on trajectories, enabling MLLMs to learn how to attend and predict entire trajectories from a given initial observation. Then, FIT requires MLLMs to first predict trajectories of related objects and then reason about potential future events based on them. Aided by FPT and FIT, we build a novel and unified MLLM named Merlin that supports multi-images input and analysis about potential actions of multiple objects for the future reasoning. Experimental results show Merlin powerful foresight minds with impressive performance on both future reasoning and visual comprehension tasks.

- **Summary**: Neural rendering methods have significantly advanced photo-realistic 3D scene rendering in various academic and industrial applications. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting method has achieved the state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed combining the benefits of both primitive-based representations and volumetric representations. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians that try to fit every training view, neglecting the underlying scene geometry. Consequently, the resulting model becomes less robust to significant view changes, texture-less area and lighting effects. We introduce Scaffold-GS, which uses anchor points to distribute local 3D Gaussians, and predicts their attributes on-the-fly based on viewing direction and distance within the view frustum. Anchor growing and pruning strategies are developed based on the importance of neural Gaussians to reliably improve the scene coverage. We show that our method effectively reduces redundant Gaussians while delivering high-quality rendering. We also demonstrates an enhanced capability to accommodate scenes with varying levels-of-detail and view-dependent observations, without sacrificing the rendering speed.

- **Summary**: We bring a new perspective to semi-supervised semantic segmentation by providing an analysis on the labeled and unlabeled distributions in training datasets. We first figure out that the distribution gap between labeled and unlabeled datasets cannot be ignored, even though the two datasets are sampled from the same distribution. To address this issue, we theoretically analyze and experimentally prove that appropriately boosting uncertainty on unlabeled data can help minimize the distribution gap, which benefits the generalization of the model. We propose two strategies and design an uncertainty booster algorithm, specially for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments are carried out based on these theories, and the results confirm the efficacy of the algorithm and strategies. Our plug-and-play uncertainty booster is tiny, efficient, and robust to hyperparameters but can significantly promote performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in our experiments compared to the current semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods on the popular benchmarks: Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 with different train settings.

- **Summary**: Recent work has demonstrated a remarkable ability to customize text-to-image diffusion models to multiple, fine-grained concepts in a sequential (i.e., continual) manner while only providing a few example images for each concept. This setting is known as continual diffusion. Here, we ask the question: Can we scale these methods to longer concept sequences without forgetting? Although prior work mitigates the forgetting of previously learned concepts, we show that its capacity to learn new tasks reaches saturation over longer sequences. We address this challenge by introducing a novel method, STack-And-Mask INcremental Adapters (STAMINA), which is composed of low-ranked attention-masked adapters and customized MLP tokens. STAMINA is designed to enhance the robust fine-tuning properties of LoRA for sequential concept learning via learnable hard-attention masks parameterized with low rank MLPs, enabling precise, scalable learning via sparse adaptation. Notably, all introduced trainable parameters can be folded back into the model after training, inducing no additional inference parameter costs. We show that STAMINA outperforms the prior SOTA for the setting of text-to-image continual customization on a 50-concept benchmark composed of landmarks and human faces, with no stored replay data. Additionally, we extended our method to the setting of continual learning for image classification, demonstrating that our gains also translate to state-of-the-art performance in this standard benchmark.

- **Summary**: Visual-language pre-training (VLP) has achieved remarkable success in multi-modal tasks, largely attributed to the availability of large-scale image-text datasets. In this work, we demonstrate that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can enhance visual-language representation learning by improving data quality. Our approach is simple, utilizing MLLMs to extend multiple captions for each image. To prevent the bias introduced by MLLMs' hallucinations and intrinsic caption styles, we propose "text shearing" to maintain the same length for extended captions as that of the original captions. In image-text retrieval, our method consistently obtains 5.6 ~ 35.0% and 16.8 ~ 46.1% improvement on R@1 under the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, respectively. Notably, we obtain zero-shot results that are comparable to fine-tuning on target datasets, which encourages more exploration of the versatile use of MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Learning from videos is an emerging research area that enables robots to acquire skills from human demonstrations, such as procedural videos. To do this, video-language models must be able to obtain structured understandings, such as the temporal segmentation of a demonstration into sequences of actions and skills, and to generalize the understandings to novel domains. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1) step recognition and (2) intra-video retrieval over a dataset of temporally segmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalk recordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to make use of: (1) out-of-domain visual information; (2) a high temporal context window; and (3) multimodal (text + video) domains. This departs from existing benchmarks for procedural video understanding, which typically deal with short context lengths and can be solved with a single modality. Spacewalk-18, with its inherent multimodal and long-form complexity, exposes the high difficulty of task recognition and segmentation. We find that state-of-the-art methods perform poorly on our benchmark, demonstrating that the goal of generalizable procedural video understanding models is far out and underscoring the need to develop new approaches to these tasks. Data, model, and code will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce an explainable algorithm designed from a multi-modal foundation model, that performs fast and explainable image classification. Drawing inspiration from CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), our method creates a latent space where each neuron is linked to a specific word. Observing that this latent space can be modeled with simple distributions, we use a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) formalism to enhance the interpretability of this latent space. Then, we introduce CLIP-QDA, a classifier that only uses statistical values to infer labels from the concepts. In addition, this formalism allows for both local and global explanations. These explanations come from the inner design of our architecture, our work is part of a new family of greybox models, combining performances of opaque foundation models and the interpretability of transparent models. Our empirical findings show that in instances where the MoG assumption holds, CLIP-QDA achieves similar accuracy with state-of-the-art methods CBMs. Our explanations compete with existing XAI methods while being faster to compute.

- **Summary**: We present CoDi-2, a versatile and interactive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that can follow complex multimodal interleaved instructions, conduct in-context learning (ICL), reason, chat, edit, etc., in an any-to-any input-output modality paradigm. By aligning modalities with language for both encoding and generation, CoDi-2 empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to not only understand complex modality-interleaved instructions and in-context examples, but also autoregressively generate grounded and coherent multimodal outputs in the continuous feature space. To train CoDi-2, we build a large-scale generation dataset encompassing in-context multimodal instructions across text, vision, and audio. CoDi-2 demonstrates a wide range of zero-shot capabilities for multimodal generation, such as in-context learning, reasoning, and compositionality of any-to-any modality generation through multi-round interactive conversation. CoDi-2 surpasses previous domain-specific models on tasks such as subject-driven image generation, vision transformation, and audio editing. CoDi-2 signifies a substantial breakthrough in developing a comprehensive multimodal foundation model adept at interpreting in-context language-vision-audio interleaved instructions and producing multimodal outputs.

- **Summary**: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and the leading cause of neonate death in China. Clinical diagnosis can be based on the selected 2D key-frames from five views. Limited by the availability of multi-view data, most methods have to rely on the insufficient single view analysis. This study proposes to automatically analyze the multi-view echocardiograms with a practical end-to-end framework. We collect the five-view echocardiograms video records of 1308 subjects (including normal controls, ventricular septal defect (VSD) patients and atrial septal defect (ASD) patients) with both disease labels and standard-view key-frame labels. Depthwise separable convolution-based multi-channel networks are adopted to largely reduce the network parameters. We also approach the imbalanced class problem by augmenting the positive training samples. Our 2D key-frame model can diagnose CHD or negative samples with an accuracy of 95.4\%, and in negative, VSD or ASD classification with an accuracy of 92.3\%. To further alleviate the work of key-frame selection in real-world implementation, we propose an adaptive soft attention scheme to directly explore the raw video data. Four kinds of neural aggregation methods are systematically investigated to fuse the information of an arbitrary number of frames in a video. Moreover, with a view detection module, the system can work without the view records. Our video-based model can diagnose with an accuracy of 93.9\% (binary classification), and 92.1\% (3-class classification) in a collected 2D video testing set, which does not need key-frame selection and view annotation in testing. The detailed ablation study and the interpretability analysis are provided.

- **Summary**: Vision-language pre-training and instruction tuning have demonstrated general-purpose capabilities in 2D visual reasoning tasks by aligning visual encoders with state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a simple, yet effective, cross-modality framework built atop frozen LLMs that allows the integration of various modalities without extensive modality-specific customization. To facilitate instruction-modality fine-tuning, we collect high-quality instruction tuning data in an automatic and scalable manner, composed of 24K QA samples for audio and 250K QA samples for 3D. Leveraging instruction-aware representations, our model performs comparably with leading-edge counterparts without the need of extensive modality-specific pre-training or customization. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates cross-modal reasoning abilities across two or more input modalities, despite each modality projection being trained individually. To study the model's cross-modal abilities, we contribute a novel Discriminative Cross-modal Reasoning (DisCRn) evaluation task, comprising 9K audio-video QA samples and 28K image-3D QA samples that require the model to reason discriminatively across disparate input modalities.

- **Summary**: While initial approaches to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) revolved around both global and incremental methods, most recent applications rely on incremental systems to estimate camera poses due to their superior robustness. Though there has been tremendous progress in SfM `front-ends' powered by deep models learned from data, the state-of-the-art (incremental) SfM pipelines still rely on classical SIFT features, developed in 2004. In this work, we investigate whether leveraging the developments in feature extraction and matching helps global SfM perform on par with the SOTA incremental SfM approach (COLMAP). To do so, we design a modular SfM framework that allows us to easily combine developments in different stages of the SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that while developments in deep-learning based two-view correspondence estimation do translate to improvements in point density for scenes reconstructed with global SfM, none of them outperform SIFT when comparing with incremental SfM results on a range of datasets. Our SfM system is designed from the ground up to leverage distributed computation, enabling us to parallelize computation on multiple machines and scale to large scenes.

- **Summary**: Images of the natural world, collected by a variety of cameras, from drones to individual phones, are increasingly abundant sources of biological information. There is an explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant information from images for science and conservation. Yet most of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions, contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life, leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of rich structured biological knowledge. We rigorously benchmark our approach on diverse fine-grained biology classification tasks, and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines (by 17% to 20% absolute). Intrinsic evaluation reveals that BioCLIP has learned a hierarchical representation conforming to the tree of life, shedding light on its strong generalizability. Our code, models and data will be made available at https://github.com/Imageomics/bioclip.

The method assumes that 3D models of the objects are available but does not require any object-specific training. This is achieved by building upon DINOv2, a recent vision foundation model with impressive generalization capabilities. An online pose estimation stage is supported by a minimal object representation that is built during a short onboarding stage from DINOv2 patch features extracted from rendered object templates. Given a query image with an object segmentation mask, FoundPose first rapidly retrieves a handful of similarly looking templates by a DINOv2-based bag-of-words approach. Pose hypotheses are then generated from 2D-3D correspondences established by matching DINOv2 patch features between the query image and a retrieved template, and finally optimized by featuremetric refinement. The method can handle diverse objects, including challenging ones with symmetries and without any texture, and noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for coarse pose estimation in both accuracy and speed on the standard BOP benchmark. With the featuremetric and additional MegaPose refinement, which are demonstrated complementary, the method outperforms all RGB competitors. Source code is at: evinpinar.github.io/foundpose.

- **Summary**: Plug-and-Play Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PnP-ADMM) is a widely-used algorithm for solving inverse problems by integrating physical measurement models and convolutional neural network (CNN) priors. PnP-ADMM has been theoretically proven to converge for convex data-fidelity terms and nonexpansive CNNs. It has however been observed that PnP-ADMM often empirically converges even for expansive CNNs. This paper presents a theoretical explanation for the observed stability of PnP-ADMM based on the interpretation of the CNN prior as a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser. Our explanation parallels a similar argument recently made for the iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm variant of PnP (PnP-ISTA) and relies on the connection between MMSE denoisers and proximal operators. We also numerically evaluate the performance gap between PnP-ADMM using a nonexpansive DnCNN denoiser and expansive DRUNet denoiser, thus motivating the use of expansive CNNs.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D tracking in highly deformable scenes with occlusions and shadows can facilitate new applications in robotics, augmented reality, and generative AI. However, tracking under these conditions is extremely challenging due to the ambiguity that arises with large deformations, shadows, and occlusions. We introduce MD-Splatting, an approach for simultaneous 3D tracking and novel view synthesis, using video captures of a dynamic scene from various camera poses. MD-Splatting builds on recent advances in Gaussian splatting, a method that learns the properties of a large number of Gaussians for state-of-the-art and fast novel view synthesis. MD-Splatting learns a deformation function to project a set of Gaussians with non-metric, thus canonical, properties into metric space. The deformation function uses a neural-voxel encoding and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to infer Gaussian position, rotation, and a shadow scalar. We enforce physics-inspired regularization terms based on local rigidity, conservation of momentum, and isometry, which leads to trajectories with smaller trajectory errors. MD-Splatting achieves high-quality 3D tracking on highly deformable scenes with shadows and occlusions. Compared to state-of-the-art, we improve 3D tracking by an average of 23.9 %, while simultaneously achieving high-quality novel view synthesis. With sufficient texture such as in scene 6, MD-Splatting achieves a median tracking error of 3.39 mm on a cloth of 1 x 1 meters in size. Project website: https://md-splatting.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Underwater object detection is a crucial and challenging problem in marine engineering and aquatic robot. The difficulty is partly because of the degradation of underwater images caused by light selective absorption and scattering. Intuitively, enhancing underwater images can benefit high-level applications like underwater object detection. However, it is still unclear whether all object detectors need underwater image enhancement as pre-processing. We therefore pose the questions "Does underwater image enhancement really improve underwater object detection?" and "How does underwater image enhancement contribute to underwater object detection?". With these two questions, we conduct extensive studies. Specifically, we use 18 state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement algorithms, covering traditional, CNN-based, and GAN-based algorithms, to pre-process underwater object detection data. Then, we retrain 7 popular deep learning-based object detectors using the corresponding results enhanced by different algorithms, obtaining 126 underwater object detection models. Coupled with 7 object detection models retrained using raw underwater images, we employ these 133 models to comprehensively analyze the effect of underwater image enhancement on underwater object detection. We expect this study can provide sufficient exploration to answer the aforementioned questions and draw more attention of the community to the joint problem of underwater image enhancement and underwater object detection. The pre-trained models and results are publicly available and will be regularly updated.

- **Summary**: Advancements in text-to-image models and fine-tuning methods have led to the increasing risk of malicious adaptation, i.e., fine-tuning to generate harmful unauthorized content. Recent works, e.g., Glaze or MIST, have developed data-poisoning techniques which protect the data against adaptation methods. In this work, we consider an alternative paradigm for protection. We propose to ``immunize'' the model by learning model parameters that are difficult for the adaptation methods when fine-tuning malicious content; in short IMMA. Empirical results show IMMA's effectiveness against malicious adaptations, including mimicking the artistic style and learning of inappropriate/unauthorized content, over three adaptation methods: LoRA, Textual-Inversion, and DreamBooth.

- **Summary**: With the recent development of generative models, Text-to-3D generations have also seen significant growth. Nonetheless, achieving precise control over 3D generation continues to be an arduous task, as using text to control often leads to missing objects and imprecise locations. Contemporary strategies for enhancing controllability in 3D generation often entail the introduction of additional parameters, such as customized diffusion models. This often induces hardness in adapting to different diffusion models or creating distinct objects.   In this paper, we present LucidDreaming as an effective pipeline capable of fine-grained control over 3D generation. It requires only minimal input of 3D bounding boxes, which can be deduced from a simple text prompt using a Large Language Model. Specifically, we propose clipped ray sampling to separately render and optimize objects with user specifications. We also introduce object-centric density blob bias, fostering the separation of generated objects. With individual rendering and optimizing of objects, our method excels not only in controlled content generation from scratch but also within the pre-trained NeRF scenes. In such scenarios, existing generative approaches often disrupt the integrity of the original scene, and current editing methods struggle to synthesize new content in empty spaces. We show that our method exhibits remarkable adaptability across a spectrum of mainstream Score Distillation Sampling-based 3D generation frameworks, and achieves superior alignment of 3D content when compared to baseline approaches. We also provide a dataset of prompts with 3D bounding boxes, benchmarking 3D spatial controllability.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation in recent years, yet they are still limited to a few sizes and aspect ratios. We propose ElasticDiffusion, a novel training-free decoding method that enables pretrained text-to-image diffusion models to generate images with various sizes. ElasticDiffusion attempts to decouple the generation trajectory of a pretrained model into local and global signals. The local signal controls low-level pixel information and can be estimated on local patches, while the global signal is used to maintain overall structural consistency and is estimated with a reference image. We test our method on CelebA-HQ (faces) and LAION-COCO (objects/indoor/outdoor scenes). Our experiments and qualitative results show superior image coherence quality across aspect ratios compared to MultiDiffusion and the standard decoding strategy of Stable Diffusion.

- **Summary**: Weight initialization plays an important role in neural network training. Widely used initialization methods are proposed and evaluated for networks that are trained from scratch. However, the growing number of pretrained models now offers new opportunities for tackling this classical problem of weight initialization. In this work, we introduce weight selection, a method for initializing smaller models by selecting a subset of weights from a pretrained larger model. This enables the transfer of knowledge from pretrained weights to smaller models. Our experiments demonstrate that weight selection can significantly enhance the performance of small models and reduce their training time. Notably, it can also be used together with knowledge distillation. Weight selection offers a new approach to leverage the power of pretrained models in resource-constrained settings, and we hope it can be a useful tool for training small models in the large-model era.

- **Summary**: Recognizing human actions in videos requires spatial and temporal understanding. Most existing action recognition models lack a balanced spatio-temporal understanding of videos. In this work, we propose a novel two-stream architecture, called Cross-Attention in Space and Time (CAST), that achieves a balanced spatio-temporal understanding of videos using only RGB input. Our proposed bottleneck cross-attention mechanism enables the spatial and temporal expert models to exchange information and make synergistic predictions, leading to improved performance. We validate the proposed method with extensive experiments on public benchmarks with different characteristics: EPIC-KITCHENS-100, Something-Something-V2, and Kinetics-400. Our method consistently shows favorable performance across these datasets, while the performance of existing methods fluctuates depending on the dataset characteristics.

It leverages a simple decomposition of the video editing problem into image editing followed by motion-conditioned image animation. Furthermore, given the lack of robust evaluation datasets for video editing, we introduce a new benchmark that measures edit capability across a wide variety of tasks, such as object replacement, background changes, style changes, and motion edits. We present a comprehensive human evaluation of the latest video editing methods along with MoCA, on our proposed benchmark. MoCA establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating greater human preference win-rate, and outperforming notable recent approaches including Dreamix (63%), MasaCtrl (75%), and Tune-A-Video (72%), with especially significant improvements for motion edits.

- **Summary**: Accurately and efficiently modeling dynamic scenes and motions is considered so challenging a task due to temporal dynamics and motion complexity. To address these challenges, we propose DynMF, a compact and efficient representation that decomposes a dynamic scene into a few neural trajectories. We argue that the per-point motions of a dynamic scene can be decomposed into a small set of explicit or learned trajectories. Our carefully designed neural framework consisting of a tiny set of learned basis queried only in time allows for rendering speed similar to 3D Gaussian Splatting, surpassing 120 FPS, while at the same time, requiring only double the storage compared to static scenes. Our neural representation adequately constrains the inherently underconstrained motion field of a dynamic scene leading to effective and fast optimization. This is done by biding each point to motion coefficients that enforce the per-point sharing of basis trajectories. By carefully applying a sparsity loss to the motion coefficients, we are able to disentangle the motions that comprise the scene, independently control them, and generate novel motion combinations that have never been seen before. We can reach state-of-the-art render quality within just 5 minutes of training and in less than half an hour, we can synthesize novel views of dynamic scenes with superior photorealistic quality. Our representation is interpretable, efficient, and expressive enough to offer real-time view synthesis of complex dynamic scene motions, in monocular and multi-view scenarios.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models generate high-quality images but require dozens of forward passes. We introduce Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), a procedure to transform a diffusion model into a one-step image generator with minimal impact on image quality. We enforce the one-step image generator match the diffusion model at distribution level, by minimizing an approximate KL divergence whose gradient can be expressed as the difference between 2 score functions, one of the target distribution and the other of the synthetic distribution being produced by our one-step generator. The score functions are parameterized as two diffusion models trained separately on each distribution. Combined with a simple regression loss matching the large-scale structure of the multi-step diffusion outputs, our method outperforms all published few-step diffusion approaches, reaching 2.62 FID on ImageNet 64x64 and 11.49 FID on zero-shot COCO-30k, comparable to Stable Diffusion but orders of magnitude faster. Utilizing FP16 inference, our model generates images at 20 FPS on modern hardware.

- **Summary**: We present ContinuityCam, a novel approach to generate a continuous video from a single static RGB image, using an event camera. Conventional cameras struggle with high-speed motion capture due to bandwidth and dynamic range limitations. Event cameras are ideal sensors to solve this problem because they encode compressed change information at high temporal resolution. In this work, we propose a novel task called event-based continuous color video decompression, pairing single static color frames and events to reconstruct temporally continuous videos. Our approach combines continuous long-range motion modeling with a feature-plane-based synthesis neural integration model, enabling frame prediction at arbitrary times within the events. Our method does not rely on additional frames except for the initial image, increasing, thus, the robustness to sudden light changes, minimizing the prediction latency, and decreasing the bandwidth requirement. We introduce a novel single objective beamsplitter setup that acquires aligned images and events and a novel and challenging Event Extreme Decompression Dataset (E2D2) that tests the method in various lighting and motion profiles. We thoroughly evaluate our method through benchmarking reconstruction as well as various downstream tasks. Our approach significantly outperforms the event- and image- based baselines in the proposed task.

- **Summary**: We present MicroCinema, a straightforward yet effective framework for high-quality and coherent text-to-video generation. Unlike existing approaches that align text prompts with video directly, MicroCinema introduces a Divide-and-Conquer strategy which divides the text-to-video into a two-stage process: text-to-image generation and image\&text-to-video generation. This strategy offers two significant advantages. a) It allows us to take full advantage of the recent advances in text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALLE, to generate photorealistic and highly detailed images. b) Leveraging the generated image, the model can allocate less focus to fine-grained appearance details, prioritizing the efficient learning of motion dynamics. To implement this strategy effectively, we introduce two core designs. First, we propose the Appearance Injection Network, enhancing the preservation of the appearance of the given image. Second, we introduce the Appearance Noise Prior, a novel mechanism aimed at maintaining the capabilities of pre-trained 2D diffusion models. These design elements empower MicroCinema to generate high-quality videos with precise motion, guided by the provided text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Concretely, MicroCinema achieves SOTA zero-shot FVD of 342.86 on UCF-101 and 377.40 on MSR-VTT.

- **Summary**: Event cameras are a novel type of biologically inspired vision sensor known for their high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. Because of these properties, they are well-suited for processing fast motions that require rapid reactions. Although event cameras have recently shown competitive performance in unsupervised optical flow estimation, performance in detecting independently moving objects (IMOs) is lacking behind, although event-based methods would be suited for this task based on their low latency and HDR properties. Previous approaches to event-based IMO segmentation have been heavily dependent on labeled data. However, biological vision systems have developed the ability to avoid moving objects through daily tasks without being given explicit labels. In this work, we propose the first event framework that generates IMO pseudo-labels using geometric constraints. Due to its unsupervised nature, our method can handle an arbitrary number of not predetermined objects and is easily scalable to datasets where expensive IMO labels are not readily available. We evaluate our approach on the EVIMO dataset and show that it performs competitively with supervised methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Existing diffusion-based video editing models have made gorgeous advances for editing attributes of a source video over time but struggle to manipulate the motion information while preserving the original protagonist's appearance and background. To address this, we propose MotionEditor, a diffusion model for video motion editing. MotionEditor incorporates a novel content-aware motion adapter into ControlNet to capture temporal motion correspondence. While ControlNet enables direct generation based on skeleton poses, it encounters challenges when modifying the source motion in the inverted noise due to contradictory signals between the noise (source) and the condition (reference). Our adapter complements ControlNet by involving source content to transfer adapted control signals seamlessly. Further, we build up a two-branch architecture (a reconstruction branch and an editing branch) with a high-fidelity attention injection mechanism facilitating branch interaction. This mechanism enables the editing branch to query the key and value from the reconstruction branch in a decoupled manner, making the editing branch retain the original background and protagonist appearance. We also propose a skeleton alignment algorithm to address the discrepancies in pose size and position. Experiments demonstrate the promising motion editing ability of MotionEditor, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Contents generated by recent advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are sometimes too imaginative for existing off-the-shelf property semantic predictors to estimate due to the immitigable domain gap. We introduce DMP, a pipeline utilizing pre-trained T2I models as a prior for pixel-level semantic prediction tasks. To address the misalignment between deterministic prediction tasks and stochastic T2I models, we reformulate the diffusion process through a sequence of interpolations, establishing a deterministic mapping between input RGB images and output prediction distributions. To preserve generalizability, we use low-rank adaptation to fine-tune pre-trained models. Extensive experiments across five tasks, including 3D property estimation, semantic segmentation, and intrinsic image decomposition, showcase the efficacy of the proposed method. Despite limited-domain training data, the approach yields faithful estimations for arbitrary images, surpassing existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: Existing long video retrieval systems are trained and tested in the paragraph-to-video retrieval regime, where every long video is described by a single long paragraph. This neglects the richness and variety of possible valid descriptions of a video, which could be described in moment-by-moment detail, or in a single phrase summary, or anything in between. To provide a more thorough evaluation of the capabilities of long video retrieval systems, we propose a pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art large language models to carefully generate a diverse set of synthetic captions for long videos. We validate this pipeline's fidelity via rigorous human inspection. We then benchmark a representative set of video language models on these synthetic captions using a few long video datasets, showing that they struggle with the transformed data, especially the shortest captions. We also propose a lightweight fine-tuning method, where we use a contrastive loss to learn a hierarchical embedding loss based on the differing levels of information among the various captions. Our method improves performance both on the downstream paragraph-to-video retrieval task (+1.1% R@1 on ActivityNet), as well as for the various long video retrieval metrics we compute using our synthetic data (+3.6% R@1 for short descriptions on ActivityNet).

- **Summary**: We present ART$\boldsymbol{\cdot}$V, an efficient framework for auto-regressive video generation with diffusion models. Unlike existing methods that generate entire videos in one-shot, ART$\boldsymbol{\cdot}$V generates a single frame at a time, conditioned on the previous ones. The framework offers three distinct advantages. First, it only learns simple continual motions between adjacent frames, therefore avoiding modeling complex long-range motions that require huge training data. Second, it preserves the high-fidelity generation ability of the pre-trained image diffusion models by making only minimal network modifications. Third, it can generate arbitrarily long videos conditioned on a variety of prompts such as text, image or their combinations, making it highly versatile and flexible. To combat the common drifting issue in AR models, we propose masked diffusion model which implicitly learns which information can be drawn from reference images rather than network predictions, in order to reduce the risk of generating inconsistent appearances that cause drifting. Moreover, we further enhance generation coherence by conditioning it on the initial frame, which typically contains minimal noise. This is particularly useful for long video generation. When trained for only two weeks on four GPUs, ART$\boldsymbol{\cdot}$V already can generate videos with natural motions, rich details and a high level of aesthetic quality. Besides, it enables various appealing applications, e.g., composing a long video from multiple text prompts.

- **Summary**: Image-to-image translation (I2IT) refers to the process of transforming images from a source domain to a target domain while maintaining a fundamental connection in terms of image content. In the past few years, remarkable advancements in I2IT were achieved by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which nevertheless struggle with translations requiring high precision. Recently, Diffusion Models have established themselves as the engine of choice for image generation. In this paper we introduce S2ST, a novel framework designed to accomplish global I2IT in complex photorealistic images, such as day-to-night or clear-to-rain translations of automotive scenes. S2ST operates within the seed space of a Latent Diffusion Model, thereby leveraging the powerful image priors learned by the latter. We show that S2ST surpasses state-of-the-art GAN-based I2IT methods, as well as diffusion-based approaches, for complex automotive scenes, improving fidelity while respecting the target domain's appearance across a variety of domains. Notably, S2ST obviates the necessity for training domain-specific translation networks.

- **Summary**: Empowering models to dynamically accomplish tasks specified through natural language instructions represents a promising path toward more capable and general artificial intelligence. In this work, we introduce InstructSeq, an instruction-conditioned multi-modal modeling framework that unifies diverse vision tasks through flexible natural language control and handling of both visual and textual data. InstructSeq employs a multimodal transformer architecture encompassing visual, language, and sequential modeling. We utilize a visual encoder to extract image features and a text encoder to encode instructions. An autoregressive transformer fuses the representations and generates sequential task outputs. By training with LLM-generated natural language instructions, InstructSeq acquires a strong comprehension of free-form instructions for specifying visual tasks. This provides an intuitive interface for directing capabilities using flexible natural instructions. Without any task-specific tuning, InstructSeq achieves compelling performance on semantic segmentation, referring expression segmentation/comprehension, and image captioning. The flexible control and multi-task unification empower the model with more human-like versatility and generalizability for computer vision. The code will be released soon at https://github.com/rongyaofang/InstructSeq.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce PoseGPT, a framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and reason about 3D human poses from images or textual descriptions. Our work is motivated by the human ability to intuitively understand postures from a single image or a brief description, a process that intertwines image interpretation, world knowledge, and an understanding of body language. Traditional human pose estimation methods, whether image-based or text-based, often lack holistic scene comprehension and nuanced reasoning, leading to a disconnect between visual data and its real-world implications. PoseGPT addresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as a distinct signal token within a multi-modal LLM, enabling direct generation of 3D body poses from both textual and visual inputs. This approach not only simplifies pose prediction but also empowers LLMs to apply their world knowledge in reasoning about human poses, fostering two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning about pose estimation. These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate 3D poses from subtle text queries, possibly accompanied by images. We establish benchmarks for these tasks, moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and estimation methods. Our results show that PoseGPT outperforms existing multimodal LLMs and task-sepcific methods on these newly proposed tasks. Furthermore, PoseGPT's ability to understand and generate 3D human poses based on complex reasoning opens new directions in human pose analysis.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved significant success in image and video generation. This motivates a growing interest in video editing tasks, where videos are edited according to provided text descriptions. However, most existing approaches only focus on video editing for short clips and rely on time-consuming tuning or inference. We are the first to propose Video Instruction Diffusion (VIDiff), a unified foundation model designed for a wide range of video tasks. These tasks encompass both understanding tasks (such as language-guided video object segmentation) and generative tasks (video editing and enhancement). Our model can edit and translate the desired results within seconds based on user instructions. Moreover, we design an iterative auto-regressive method to ensure consistency in editing and enhancing long videos. We provide convincing generative results for diverse input videos and written instructions, both qualitatively and quantitatively. More examples can be found at our website https://ChenHsing.github.io/VIDiff.

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation aims to generate a smaller but representative subset from a large dataset, which allows a model to be trained efficiently, meanwhile evaluating on the original testing data distribution to achieve decent performance. Many prior works have aimed to align with diverse aspects of the original datasets, such as matching the training weight trajectories, gradient, feature/BatchNorm distributions, etc. In this work, we show how to distill various large-scale datasets such as full ImageNet-1K/21K under a conventional input resolution of 224$\times$224 to achieve the best accuracy over all previous approaches, including SRe$^2$L, TESLA and MTT. To achieve this, we introduce a simple yet effective ${\bf C}$urriculum ${\bf D}$ata ${\bf A}$ugmentation ($\texttt{CDA}$) during data synthesis that obtains the accuracy on large-scale ImageNet-1K and 21K with 63.2% under IPC (Images Per Class) 50 and 36.1% under IPC 20, respectively. Finally, we show that, by integrating all our enhancements together, the proposed model beats the current state-of-the-art by more than 4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K/21K and for the first time, reduces the gap to its full-data training counterpart to less than absolute 15%. Moreover, this work represents the inaugural success in dataset distillation on larger-scale ImageNet-21K under the standard 224$\times$224 resolution. Our code and distilled ImageNet-21K dataset of 20 IPC, 2K recovery budget are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/SRe2L/tree/main/CDA.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking in traffic videos is a crucial research area, offering immense potential for enhancing traffic monitoring accuracy and promoting road safety measures through the utilisation of advanced machine learning algorithms. However, existing datasets for multi-object tracking in traffic videos often feature limited instances or focus on single classes, which cannot well simulate the challenges encountered in complex traffic scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce TrafficMOT, an extensive dataset designed to encompass diverse traffic situations with complex scenarios. To validate the complexity and challenges presented by TrafficMOT, we conducted comprehensive empirical studies using three different settings: fully-supervised, semi-supervised, and a recent powerful zero-shot foundation model Tracking Anything Model (TAM). The experimental results highlight the inherent complexity of this dataset, emphasising its value in driving advancements in the field of traffic monitoring and multi-object tracking.

- **Summary**: Video transformers have become the de facto standard for human action recognition, yet their exclusive reliance on the RGB modality still limits their adoption in certain domains. One such domain is Activities of Daily Living (ADL), where RGB alone is not sufficient to distinguish between visually similar actions, or actions observed from multiple viewpoints. To facilitate the adoption of video transformers for ADL, we hypothesize that the augmentation of RGB with human pose information, known for its sensitivity to fine-grained motion and multiple viewpoints, is essential. Consequently, we introduce the first Pose Induced Video Transformer: PI-ViT (or $\pi$-ViT), a novel approach that augments the RGB representations learned by video transformers with 2D and 3D pose information. The key elements of $\pi$-ViT are two plug-in modules, 2D Skeleton Induction Module and 3D Skeleton Induction Module, that are responsible for inducing 2D and 3D pose information into the RGB representations. These modules operate by performing pose-aware auxiliary tasks, a design choice that allows $\pi$-ViT to discard the modules during inference. Notably, $\pi$-ViT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three prominent ADL datasets, encompassing both real-world and large-scale RGB-D datasets, without requiring poses or additional computational overhead at inference.

- **Summary**: As pretrained text-to-image diffusion models become increasingly powerful, recent efforts have been made to distill knowledge from these text-to-image pretrained models for optimizing a text-guided 3D model. Most of the existing methods generate a holistic 3D model from a plain text input. This can be problematic when the text describes a complex scene with multiple objects, because the vectorized text embeddings are inherently unable to capture a complex description with multiple entities and relationships. Holistic 3D modeling of the entire scene further prevents accurate grounding of text entities and concepts. To address this limitation, we propose GraphDreamer, a novel framework to generate compositional 3D scenes from scene graphs, where objects are represented as nodes and their interactions as edges. By exploiting node and edge information in scene graphs, our method makes better use of the pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is able to fully disentangle different objects without image-level supervision. To facilitate modeling of object-wise relationships, we use signed distance fields as representation and impose a constraint to avoid inter-penetration of objects. To avoid manual scene graph creation, we design a text prompt for ChatGPT to generate scene graphs based on text inputs. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of GraphDreamer in generating high-fidelity compositional 3D scenes with disentangled object entities.

- **Summary**: The challenging task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires embodied agents to follow natural language instructions to reach a goal location or object (e.g. `walk down the hallway and turn left at the piano'). For agents to complete this task successfully, they must be able to ground objects referenced into the instruction (e.g.`piano') into the visual scene as well as ground directional phrases (e.g.`turn left') into actions. In this work we ask the following question -- to what degree are spatial and directional language cues informing the navigation model's decisions? We propose a series of simple masking experiments to inspect the model's reliance on different parts of the instruction. Surprisingly we uncover that certain top performing models rely only on the noun tokens of the instructions. We propose two training methods to alleviate this concerning limitation.

- **Summary**: Web-scraped datasets are vulnerable to data poisoning, which can be used for backdooring deep image classifiers during training. Since training on large datasets is expensive, a model is trained once and re-used many times. Unlike adversarial examples, backdoor attacks often target specific classes rather than any class learned by the model. One might expect that targeting many classes through a naive composition of attacks vastly increases the number of poison samples. We show this is not necessarily true and more efficient, universal data poisoning attacks exist that allow controlling misclassifications from any source class into any target class with a small increase in poison samples. Our idea is to generate triggers with salient characteristics that the model can learn. The triggers we craft exploit a phenomenon we call inter-class poison transferability, where learning a trigger from one class makes the model more vulnerable to learning triggers for other classes. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our universal backdoor attacks by controlling models with up to 6,000 classes while poisoning only 0.15% of the training dataset.

- **Summary**: Adversarial patches exemplify the tangible manifestation of the threat posed by adversarial attacks on Machine Learning (ML) models in real-world scenarios. Robustness against these attacks is of the utmost importance when designing computer vision applications, especially for safety-critical domains such as CCTV systems. In most practical situations, monitoring open spaces requires multi-view systems to overcome acquisition challenges such as occlusion handling. Multiview object systems are able to combine data from multiple views, and reach reliable detection results even in difficult environments. Despite its importance in real-world vision applications, the vulnerability of multiview systems to adversarial patches is not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we raise the following question: Does the increased performance and information sharing across views offer as a by-product robustness to adversarial patches? We first conduct a preliminary analysis showing promising robustness against off-the-shelf adversarial patches, even in an extreme setting where we consider patches applied to all views by all persons in Wildtrack benchmark. However, we challenged this observation by proposing two new attacks: (i) In the first attack, targeting a multiview CNN, we maximize the global loss by proposing gradient projection to the different views and aggregating the obtained local gradients. (ii) In the second attack, we focus on a Transformer-based multiview framework. In addition to the focal loss, we also maximize the transformer-specific loss by dissipating its attention blocks. Our results show a large degradation in the detection performance of victim multiview systems with our first patch attack reaching an attack success rate of 73% , while our second proposed attack reduced the performance of its target detector by 62%

- **Summary**: People with visual impairments have difficulty accessing touchscreen-enabled personal computing devices like mobile phones and laptops. The image-to-speech (ITS) systems can assist them in mitigating this problem, but their huge model size makes it extremely hard to be deployed on low-resourced embedded devices. In this paper, we aim to overcome this challenge by developing an efficient endto-end neural architecture for generating audio from tiny segments of display content on low-resource devices. We introduced a vision transformers-based image encoder and utilized knowledge distillation to compress the model from 6.1 million to 2.46 million parameters. Human and automatic evaluation results show that our approach leads to a very minimal drop in performance and can speed up the inference time by 22%.

- **Summary**: The classification of galaxies as spirals or ellipticals is a crucial task in understanding their formation and evolution. With the arrival of large-scale astronomical surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), astronomers now have access to images of a vast number of galaxies. However, the visual inspection of these images is an impossible task for humans due to the sheer number of galaxies to be analyzed. To solve this problem, the Galaxy Zoo project was created to engage thousands of citizen scientists to classify the galaxies based on their visual features. In this paper, we present a machine learning model for galaxy classification using numerical data from the Galaxy Zoo[5] project. Our model utilizes a convolutional neural network architecture to extract features from galaxy images and classify them into spirals or ellipticals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by comparing its performance with that of human classifiers using a subset of the Galaxy Zoo dataset. Our results show that our model achieves high accuracy in classifying galaxies and has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies.

- **Summary**: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are interpretable models that first predict a set of semantically meaningful features, i.e., concepts, from observations that are subsequently used to condition a downstream task. However, the model's performance strongly depends on the engineered features and can severely suffer from incomplete sets of concepts. Prior works have proposed a side channel -- a residual -- that allows for unconstrained information flow to the downstream task, thus improving model performance but simultaneously introducing information leakage, which is undesirable for interpretability. This work proposes three novel approaches to mitigate information leakage by disentangling concepts and residuals, investigating the critical balance between model performance and interpretability. Through extensive empirical analysis on the CUB, OAI, and CIFAR 100 datasets, we assess the performance of each disentanglement method and provide insights into when they work best. Further, we show how each method impacts the ability to intervene over the concepts and their subsequent impact on task performance.

- **Summary**: Aim of this work is to explore the potential of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for universal detection of AI-generated images. We develop a lightweight detection strategy based on CLIP features and study its performance in a wide variety of challenging scenarios. We find that, unlike previous belief, it is neither necessary nor convenient to use a large domain-specific dataset for training. On the contrary, by using only a handful of example images from a single generative model, a CLIP-based detector exhibits a surprising generalization ability and high robustness across several different architectures, including recent commercial tools such as Dalle-3, Midjourney v5, and Firefly. We match the SoTA on in-distribution data, and improve largely above it in terms of generalization to out-of-distribution data (+6% in terms of AUC) and robustness to impaired/laundered data (+13%).

- **Summary**: In recent years, coordinate-based neural implicit representations have shown promising results for the task of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). While achieving impressive performance on small synthetic scenes, these methods often suffer from oversmoothed reconstructions, especially for complex real-world scenes. In this work, we introduce DNS SLAM, a novel neural RGB-D semantic SLAM approach featuring a hybrid representation. Relying only on 2D semantic priors, we propose the first semantic neural SLAM method that trains class-wise scene representations while providing stable camera tracking at the same time. Our method integrates multi-view geometry constraints with image-based feature extraction to improve appearance details and to output color, density, and semantic class information, enabling many downstream applications. To further enable real-time tracking, we introduce a lightweight coarse scene representation which is trained in a self-supervised manner in latent space. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real-world data tracking while maintaining a commendable operational speed on off-the-shelf hardware. Further, our method outputs class-wise decomposed reconstructions with better texture capturing appearance and geometric details.

- **Summary**: The problem of novel view synthesis has grown significantly in popularity recently with the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and other implicit scene representation methods. A recent advance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leverages an explicit representation to achieve real-time rendering with high-quality results. However, 3DGS still requires an abundance of training views to generate a coherent scene representation. In few shot settings, similar to NeRF, 3DGS tends to overfit to training views, causing background collapse and excessive floaters, especially as the number of training views are reduced. We propose a method to enable training coherent 3DGS-based radiance fields of 360 scenes from sparse training views. We find that using naive depth priors is not sufficient and integrate depth priors with generative and explicit constraints to reduce background collapse, remove floaters, and enhance consistency from unseen viewpoints. Experiments show that our method outperforms base 3DGS by up to 30.5% and NeRF-based methods by up to 15.6% in LPIPS on the MipNeRF-360 dataset with substantially less training and inference cost.

- **Summary**: We present DREAM, a novel training framework representing Diffusion Rectification and Estimation-Adaptive Models, requiring minimal code changes (just three lines) yet significantly enhancing the alignment of training with sampling in diffusion models. DREAM features two components: diffusion rectification, which adjusts training to reflect the sampling process, and estimation adaptation, which balances perception against distortion. When applied to image super-resolution (SR), DREAM adeptly navigates the tradeoff between minimizing distortion and preserving high image quality. Experiments demonstrate DREAM's superiority over standard diffusion-based SR methods, showing a $2$ to $3\times $ faster training convergence and a $10$ to $20\times$ reduction in necessary sampling steps to achieve comparable or superior results. We hope DREAM will inspire a rethinking of diffusion model training paradigms.

- **Summary**: Video topic segmentation unveils the coarse-grained semantic structure underlying videos and is essential for other video understanding tasks. Given the recent surge in multi-modal, relying solely on a single modality is arguably insufficient. On the other hand, prior solutions for similar tasks like video scene/shot segmentation cater to short videos with clear visual shifts but falter for long videos with subtle changes, such as livestreams. In this paper, we introduce a multi-modal video topic segmenter that utilizes both video transcripts and frames, bolstered by a cross-modal attention mechanism. Furthermore, we propose a dual-contrastive learning framework adhering to the unsupervised domain adaptation paradigm, enhancing our model's adaptability to longer, more semantically complex videos. Experiments on short and long video corpora demonstrate that our proposed solution, significantly surpasses baseline methods in terms of both accuracy and transferability, in both intra- and cross-domain settings.

- **Summary**: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common form of mesothelioma. To assess response to treatment, tumor measurements are acquired and evaluated based on a patient's longitudinal computed tomography (CT) scans. Tumor volume, however, is the more accurate metric for assessing tumor burden and response. Automated segmentation methods using deep learning can be employed to acquire volume, which otherwise is a tedious task performed manually. The deep learning-based tumor volume and contours can then be compared with a standard reference to assess the robustness of the automated segmentations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of probability map threshold on MPM tumor delineations generated using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Eighty-eight CT scans from 21 MPM patients were segmented by a VGG16/U-Net CNN. A radiologist modified the contours generated at a 0.5 probability threshold. Percent difference of tumor volume and overlap using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) were compared between the standard reference provided by the radiologist and CNN outputs for thresholds ranging from 0.001 to 0.9. CNN annotations consistently yielded smaller tumor volumes than radiologist contours. Reducing the probability threshold from 0.5 to 0.1 decreased the absolute percent volume difference, on average, from 43.96% to 24.18%. Median and mean DSC ranged from 0.58 to 0.60, with a peak at a threshold of 0.5; no distinct threshold was found for percent volume difference. No single output threshold in the CNN probability maps was optimal for both tumor volume and DSC. This work underscores the need to assess tumor volume and spatial overlap when evaluating CNN performance. While automated segmentations may yield comparable tumor volumes to that of the reference standard, the spatial region delineated by the CNN at a specific threshold is equally important.

- **Summary**: In this study, we propose a novel motif-based approach for unsupervised textile anomaly detection that combines the benefits of traditional convolutional neural networks with those of an unsupervised learning paradigm. It consists of five main steps: preprocessing, automatic pattern period extraction, patch extraction, features selection and anomaly detection. This proposed approach uses a new dynamic and heuristic method for feature selection which avoids the drawbacks of initialization of the number of filters (neurons) and their weights, and those of the backpropagation mechanism such as the vanishing gradients, which are common practice in the state-of-the-art methods. The design and training of the network are performed in a dynamic and input domain-based manner and, thus, no ad-hoc configurations are required. Before building the model, only the number of layers and the stride are defined. We do not initialize the weights randomly nor do we define the filter size or number of filters as conventionally done in CNN-based approaches. This reduces effort and time spent on hyperparameter initialization and fine-tuning. Only one defect-free sample is required for training and no further labeled data is needed. The trained network is then used to detect anomalies on defective fabric samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Patterned Fabrics benchmark dataset. Our algorithm yields reliable and competitive results (on recall, precision, accuracy and f1- measure) compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, in less time, with efficient training in a single epoch and a lower computational cost.

- **Summary**: "Perception is reality". Human perception plays a vital role in forming beliefs and understanding reality. Exploring how the human brain works in the visual system facilitates bridging the gap between human visual perception and computer vision models. However, neuroscientists study the brain via Neuroimaging, i.e., Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), to discover the brain's functions. These approaches face interpretation challenges where fMRI data can be complex and require expertise. Therefore, neuroscientists make inferences about cognitive processes based on patterns of brain activities, which can lead to potential misinterpretation or limited functional understanding. In this work, we first present a simple yet effective Brainformer approach, a novel Transformer-based framework, to analyze the patterns of fMRI in the human perception system from the machine learning perspective. Secondly, we introduce a novel mechanism incorporating fMRI, which represents the human brain activities, as the supervision for the machine vision model. This work also introduces a novel perspective on transferring knowledge from human perception to neural networks. Through our experiments, we demonstrated that by leveraging fMRI information, the machine vision model can achieve potential results compared to the current State-of-the-art methods in various image recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: Currently, to further improve visual enjoyment, Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images are catching wide attention. Here, UHD images are usually referred to as having a resolution greater than or equal to $3840 \times 2160$. However, since the imaging equipment is subject to environmental noise or equipment jitter, UHD images are prone to contrast degradation, blurring, low dynamic range, etc. To address these issues, a large number of algorithms for UHD image enhancement have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce the current state of UHD image enhancement from two perspectives, one is the application field and the other is the technology. In addition, we briefly explore its trends.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) can be dramatically accelerated by spatial grid representations. However, they do not explicitly reason about scale and so introduce aliasing artifacts when reconstructing scenes captured at different camera distances. Mip-NeRF and its extensions propose scale-aware renderers that project volumetric frustums rather than point samples but such approaches rely on positional encodings that are not readily compatible with grid methods. We propose a simple modification to grid-based models by training model heads at different spatial grid resolutions. At render time, we simply use coarser grids to render samples that cover larger volumes. Our method can be easily applied to existing accelerated NeRF methods and significantly improves rendering quality (reducing error rates by 20-90% across synthetic and unbounded real-world scenes) while incurring minimal performance overhead (as each model head is quick to evaluate). Compared to Mip-NeRF, we reduce error rates by 20% while training over 60x faster.

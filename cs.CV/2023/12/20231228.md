- **Summary**: Traditional crowd counting networks suffer from information loss when feature maps are downsized through pooling layers, leading to inaccuracies in counting crowds at a distance. Existing methods often assume correct annotations during training, disregarding the impact of noisy annotations, especially in crowded scenes. Furthermore, the use of a fixed Gaussian kernel fails to account for the varying pixel distribution with respect to the camera distance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Scale-Aware Crowd Counting Network (SACC-Net) that introduces a ``scale-aware'' architecture with error-correcting capabilities of noisy annotations. For the first time, we {\bf simultaneously} model labeling errors (mean) and scale variations (variance) by spatially-varying Gaussian distributions to produce fine-grained heat maps for crowd counting. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive Gaussian kernel variance enables the model to learn dynamically with a low-rank approximation, leading to improved convergence efficiency with comparable accuracy. The performance of SACC-Net is extensively evaluated on four public datasets: UCF-QNRF, UCF CC 50, NWPU, and ShanghaiTech A-B. Experimental results demonstrate that SACC-Net outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in achieving superior crowd counting accuracy.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer continues to be a significant cause of mortality among women globally. Timely identification and precise diagnosis of breast abnormalities are critical for enhancing patient prognosis. In this study, we focus on improving the early detection and accurate diagnosis of breast abnormalities, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing the mortality rate of breast cancer. To address the limitations of traditional screening methods, a novel unsupervised feature correlation network was developed to predict maps indicating breast abnormal variations using longitudinal 2D mammograms. The proposed model utilizes the reconstruction process of current year and prior year mammograms to extract tissue from different areas and analyze the differences between them to identify abnormal variations that may indicate the presence of cancer. The model is equipped with a feature correlation module, an attention suppression gate, and a breast abnormality detection module that work together to improve the accuracy of the prediction. The proposed model not only provides breast abnormal variation maps, but also distinguishes between normal and cancer mammograms, making it more advanced compared to the state-of the-art baseline models. The results of the study show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models in terms of Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Dice score, and cancer detection rate.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel logo image recognition approach incorporating a localization technique based on reinforcement learning. Logo recognition is an image classification task identifying a brand in an image. As the size and position of a logo vary widely from image to image, it is necessary to determine its position for accurate recognition. However, because there is no annotation for the position coordinates, it is impossible to train and infer the location of the logo in the image. Therefore, we propose a deep reinforcement learning localization method for logo recognition (RL-LOGO). It utilizes deep reinforcement learning to identify a logo region in images without annotations of the positions, thereby improving classification accuracy. We demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy compared with existing methods in several published benchmarks. Specifically, we achieved an 18-point accuracy improvement over competitive methods on the complex dataset Logo-2K+. This demonstrates that the proposed method is a promising approach to logo recognition in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language models like Stable Diffusion have shown remarkable power in creative image synthesis and editing.However, most existing text-to-image editing methods encounter two obstacles: First, the text prompt needs to be carefully crafted to achieve good results, which is not intuitive or user-friendly. Second, they are insensitive to local edits and can irreversibly affect non-edited regions, leaving obvious editing traces. To tackle these problems, we propose a Zero-shot instructiON-guided local image Editing approach, termed ZONE. We first convert the editing intent from the user-provided instruction (e.g., ``make his tie blue") into specific image editing regions through InstructPix2Pix. We then propose a Region-IoU scheme for precise image layer extraction from an off-the-shelf segment model. We further develop an edge smoother based on FFT for seamless blending between the layer and the image.Our method allows for arbitrary manipulation of a specific region with a single instruction while preserving the rest. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ZONE achieves remarkable local editing results and user-friendliness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The fine-grained attribute descriptions can significantly supplement the valuable semantic information for person image, which is vital to the success of person re-identification (ReID) task. However, current ReID algorithms typically failed to effectively leverage the rich contextual information available, primarily due to their reliance on simplistic and coarse utilization of image attributes. Recent advances in artificial intelligence generated content have made it possible to automatically generate plentiful fine-grained attribute descriptions and make full use of them. Thereby, this paper explores the potential of using the generated multiple person attributes as prompts in ReID tasks with off-the-shelf (large) models for more accurate retrieval results. To this end, we present a new framework called Multi-Prompts ReID (MP-ReID), based on prompt learning and language models, to fully dip fine attributes to assist ReID task. Specifically, MP-ReID first learns to hallucinate diverse, informative, and promptable sentences for describing the query images. This procedure includes (i) explicit prompts of which attributes a person has and furthermore (ii) implicit learnable prompts for adjusting/conditioning the criteria used towards this person identity matching. Explicit prompts are obtained by ensembling generation models, such as ChatGPT and VQA models. Moreover, an alignment module is designed to fuse multi-prompts (i.e., explicit and implicit ones) progressively and mitigate the cross-modal gap. Extensive experiments on the existing attribute-involved ReID datasets, namely, Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed MP-ReID solution.

- **Summary**: Existing LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry and mapping (LIV-SLAM) systems mainly utilize the LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) module for structure reconstruction and the visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for color rendering. However, the accuracy of VIO is often compromised by photometric changes, weak textures and motion blur, unlike the more robust LIO. This paper introduces SR-LIVO, an advanced and novel LIV-SLAM system employing sweep reconstruction to align reconstructed sweeps with image timestamps. This allows the LIO module to accurately determine states at all imaging moments, enhancing pose accuracy and processing efficiency. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that: 1) our SRLIVO outperforms existing state-of-the-art LIV-SLAM systems in both pose accuracy and time efficiency; 2) our LIO-based pose estimation prove more accurate than VIO-based ones in several mainstream LIV-SLAM systems (including ours). We have released our source code to contribute to the community development in this field.

- **Summary**: Nighttime photography encounters escalating challenges in extremely low-light conditions, primarily attributable to the ultra-low signal-to-noise ratio. For real-world deployment, a practical solution must not only produce visually appealing results but also require minimal computation. However, most existing methods are either focused on improving restoration performance or employ lightweight models at the cost of quality. This paper proposes a lightweight network that outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in low-light enhancement tasks while minimizing computation. The proposed network incorporates Siamese Self-Attention Block (SSAB) and Skip-Channel Attention (SCA) modules, which enhance the model's capacity to aggregate global information and are well-suited for high-resolution images. Additionally, based on our analysis of the low-light image restoration process, we propose a Two-Stage Framework that achieves superior results. Our model can restore a UHD 4K resolution image with minimal computation while keeping SOTA restoration quality.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes has been an intriguing yet challenging problem. Despite recent advancements, simultaneously achieving high-resolution photorealistic results, real-time rendering, and compact storage remains a formidable task. To address these challenges, we propose Spacetime Gaussian Feature Splatting as a novel dynamic scene representation, composed of three pivotal components. First, we formulate expressive Spacetime Gaussians by enhancing 3D Gaussians with temporal opacity and parametric motion/rotation. This enables Spacetime Gaussians to capture static, dynamic, as well as transient content within a scene. Second, we introduce splatted feature rendering, which replaces spherical harmonics with neural features. These features facilitate the modeling of view- and time-dependent appearance while maintaining small size. Third, we leverage the guidance of training error and coarse depth to sample new Gaussians in areas that are challenging to converge with existing pipelines. Experiments on several established real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed, while retaining compact storage. At 8K resolution, our lite-version model can render at 60 FPS on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU.

- **Summary**: Background: Rim+ lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS), detectable via Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), correlate with increased disability. Existing literature lacks quantitative analysis of these lesions. We introduce RimSet for quantitative identification and characterization of rim+ lesions on QSM. Methods: RimSet combines RimSeg, an unsupervised segmentation method using level-set methodology, and radiomic measurements with Local Binary Pattern texture descriptors. We validated RimSet using simulated QSM images and an in vivo dataset of 172 MS subjects with 177 rim+ and 3986 rim-lesions. Results: RimSeg achieved a 78.7% Dice score against the ground truth, with challenges in partial rim lesions. RimSet detected rim+ lesions with a partial ROC AUC of 0.808 and PR AUC of 0.737, surpassing existing methods. QSMRim-Net showed the lowest mean square error (0.85) and high correlation (0.91; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.93) with expert annotations at the subject level.



### DiffusionGAN3D: Boosting Text-guided 3D Generation and Domain Adaption by Combining 3D GANs and Diffusion Priors

- **Summary**: Text-guided domain adaption and generation of 3D-aware portraits find many applications in various fields. However, due to the lack of training data and the challenges in handling the high variety of geometry and appearance, the existing methods for these tasks suffer from issues like inflexibility, instability, and low fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel framework DiffusionGAN3D, which boosts text-guided 3D domain adaption and generation by combining 3D GANs and diffusion priors. Specifically, we integrate the pre-trained 3D generative models (e.g., EG3D) and text-to-image diffusion models. The former provides a strong foundation for stable and high-quality avatar generation from text. And the diffusion models in turn offer powerful priors and guide the 3D generator finetuning with informative direction to achieve flexible and efficient text-guided domain adaption. To enhance the diversity in domain adaption and the generation capability in text-to-avatar, we introduce the relative distance loss and case-specific learnable triplane respectively. Besides, we design a progressive texture refinement module to improve the texture quality for both tasks above. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves excellent results in both domain adaption and text-to-avatar tasks, outperforming existing methods in terms of generation quality and efficiency.

- **Summary**: The appearance of a human in clothing is driven not only by the pose but also by its temporal context, i.e., motion. However, such context has been largely neglected by existing monocular human modeling methods whose neural networks often struggle to learn a video of a person with large dynamics due to the motion ambiguity, i.e., there exist numerous geometric configurations of clothes that are dependent on the context of motion even for the same pose. In this paper, we introduce a method for high-quality modeling of clothed 3D human avatars using a video of a person with dynamic movements. The main challenge comes from the lack of 3D ground truth data of geometry and its temporal correspondences. We address this challenge by introducing a novel compositional human modeling framework that takes advantage of both explicit and implicit human modeling. For explicit modeling, a neural network learns to generate point-wise shape residuals and appearance features of a 3D body model by comparing its 2D rendering results and the original images. This explicit model allows for the reconstruction of discriminative 3D motion features from UV space by encoding their temporal correspondences. For implicit modeling, an implicit network combines the appearance and 3D motion features to decode high-fidelity clothed 3D human avatars with motion-dependent geometry and texture. The experiments show that our method can generate a large variation of secondary motion in a physically plausible way.

- **Summary**: In the era of advanced multimodel learning, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4V have made remarkable strides towards bridging language and visual elements. However, the closed-source nature and considerable computational demand present notable challenges for universal usage and modifications. This is where open-source MLLMs like LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 come in, presenting groundbreaking achievements across tasks. Despite these accomplishments, computational efficiency remains an unresolved issue, as these models, like LLaVA-v1.5-13B, require substantial resources. Addressing these issues, we introduce TinyGPT-V, a new-wave model marrying impressive performance with commonplace computational capacity. It stands out by requiring merely a 24G GPU for training and an 8G GPU or CPU for inference. Built upon Phi-2, TinyGPT-V couples an effective language backbone with pre-trained vision modules from BLIP-2 or CLIP. TinyGPT-V's 2.8B parameters can undergo a unique quantisation process, suitable for local deployment and inference tasks on 8G various devices. Our work fosters further developments for designing cost-effective, efficient, and high-performing MLLMs, expanding their applicability in a broad array of real-world scenarios. Furthermore this paper proposed a new paradigm of Multimodal Large Language Model via small backbones. Our code and training weights are placed at: https://github.com/DLYuanGod/TinyGPT-V and https://huggingface.co/Tyrannosaurus/TinyGPT-V respectively.

- **Summary**: Fluid motion can be considered as point cloud transformation when adopted by a Lagrangian description. Compared to traditional numerical analysis methods, using machine learning techniques to learn physics simulations can achieve near accuracy, while significantly increasing efficiency. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for 3D fluid simulations utilizing an Attention-based Dual-pipeline Network, which employs a dual-pipeline architecture, seamlessly integrated with an Attention-based Feature Fusion Module. Unlike previous single-pipeline approaches, we find that a well-designed dual-pipeline approach achieves a better balance between global fluid control and physical law constraints. Furthermore, we design a Type-aware Input Module to adaptively recognize particles of different types and perform feature fusion afterward, such that fluid-solid coupling issues can be better dealt with. The experiments show that our approach significantly increases the accuracy of fluid simulation predictions and enhances generalizability to previously unseen scenarios. We demonstrate its superior performance over the state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics.

- **Summary**: The notion of adversarial attacks on image classification models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is introduced in this work. To classify images, deep learning models called CNNs are frequently used. However, when the networks are subject to adversarial attacks, extremely potent and previously trained CNN models that perform quite effectively on image datasets for image classification tasks may perform poorly. In this work, one well-known adversarial attack known as the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) is explored and its adverse effects on the performances of image classification models are examined. The FGSM attack is simulated on three pre-trained image classifier CNN architectures, ResNet-101, AlexNet, and RegNetY 400MF using randomly chosen images from the ImageNet dataset. The classification accuracies of the models are computed in the absence and presence of the attack to demonstrate the detrimental effect of the attack on the performances of the classifiers. Finally, a mechanism is proposed to defend against the FGSM attack based on a modified defensive distillation-based approach. Extensive results are presented for the validation of the proposed scheme.

- **Summary**: Existing face aging methods often focus on modeling either texture aging or using an entangled shape-texture representation to achieve face aging. However, shape and texture are two distinct factors that mutually affect the human face aging process. In this paper, we propose 3D-STD, a novel 3D-aware Shape-Texture Disentangled face aging network that explicitly disentangles the facial image into shape and texture representations using 3D face reconstruction. Additionally, to facilitate high-fidelity texture synthesis, we propose a novel texture generation method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of shape and texture transformation. Moreover, our method supports producing plausible 3D face aging results, which is rarely accomplished by current methods.

It is an amalgamation of a myriad of architectural designs and techniques that are mobile-oriented, which comprises a set of language models at the scale of 1.4B and 2.7B parameters, trained from scratch, a multimodal vision model that is pre-trained in the CLIP fashion, cross-modality interaction via an efficient projector. We evaluate MobileVLM on several typical VLM benchmarks. Our models demonstrate on par performance compared with a few much larger models. More importantly, we measure the inference speed on both a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 CPU and an NVIDIA Jeston Orin GPU, and we obtain state-of-the-art performance of 21.5 tokens and 65.3 tokens per second, respectively. Our code will be made available at: https://github.com/Meituan-AutoML/MobileVLM.

- **Summary**: Figure drawing is often used as part of dementia screening protocols. The Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) has adopted three drawing tests from Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III as part of its questionnaire module on cognition. While the drawings are usually scored by trained clinicians, SHARE uses the face-to-face interviewers who conduct the interviews to score the drawings during fieldwork. This may pose a risk to data quality, as interviewers may be less consistent in their scoring and more likely to make errors due to their lack of clinical training. This paper therefore reports a first proof of concept and evaluates the feasibility of automating scoring using deep learning. We train several different convolutional neural network (CNN) models using about 2,000 drawings from the 8th wave of the SHARE panel in Germany and the corresponding interviewer scores, as well as self-developed 'gold standard' scores. The results suggest that this approach is indeed feasible. Compared to training on interviewer scores, models trained on the gold standard data improve prediction accuracy by about 10 percentage points. The best performing model, ConvNeXt Base, achieves an accuracy of about 85%, which is 5 percentage points higher than the accuracy of the interviewers. While this is a promising result, the models still struggle to score partially correct drawings, which are also problematic for interviewers. This suggests that more and better training data is needed to achieve production-level prediction accuracy. We therefore discuss possible next steps to improve the quality and quantity of training examples.

- **Summary**: The widespread usage of cars and other large, heavy vehicles necessitates the development of an effective parking infrastructure. Additionally, algorithms for detection and recognition of number plates are often used to identify automobiles all around the world where standardized plate sizes and fonts are enforced, making recognition an effortless task. As a result, both kinds of data can be combined to develop an intelligent parking system focuses on the technology of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR). Retrieving characters from an inputted number plate image is the sole purpose of ANPR which is a costly procedure. In this article, we propose Chaurah, a minimal cost ANPR system that relies on a Raspberry Pi 3 that was specifically created for parking facilities. The system employs a dual-stage methodology, with the first stage being an ANPR system which makes use of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The primary locates and recognises license plates from a vehicle image, while the secondary performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify individualized numbers from the number plate. An application built with Flutter and Firebase for database administration and license plate record comparison makes up the second component of the overall solution. The application also acts as an user-interface for the billing mechanism based on parking time duration resulting in an all-encompassing software deployment of the study.

- **Summary**: Numerous point-cloud understanding techniques focus on whole entities and have succeeded in obtaining satisfactory results and limited sparsity tolerance. However, these methods are generally sensitive to incomplete point clouds that are scanned with flaws or large gaps. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end architecture that compensates for and identifies partial point clouds on the fly. First, we propose a cascaded solution that integrates both the upstream and downstream networks simultaneously, allowing the task-oriented downstream to identify the points generated by the completion-oriented upstream. These two streams complement each other, resulting in improved performance for both completion and downstream-dependent tasks. Second, to explicitly understand the predicted points' pattern, we introduce hierarchical self-distillation (HSD), which can be applied to arbitrary hierarchy-based point cloud methods. HSD ensures that the deepest classifier with a larger perceptual field and longer code length provides additional regularization to intermediate ones rather than simply aggregating the multi-scale features, and therefore maximizing the mutual information between a teacher and students. We show the advantage of the self-distillation process in the hyperspaces based on the information bottleneck principle. On the classification task, our proposed method performs competitively on the synthetic dataset and achieves superior results on the challenging real-world benchmark when compared to the state-of-the-art models. Additional experiments also demonstrate the superior performance and generality of our framework on the part segmentation task.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to network pruning, targeting block pruning in deep neural networks for edge computing environments. Our method diverges from traditional techniques that utilize proxy metrics, instead employing a direct block removal strategy to assess the impact on classification accuracy. This hands-on approach allows for an accurate evaluation of each block's importance. We conducted extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets using ResNet architectures. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our method, particularly on large-scale datasets like ImageNet with ResNet50, where it excelled in reducing model size while retaining high accuracy, even when pruning a significant portion of the network. The findings underscore our method's capability in maintaining an optimal balance between model size and performance, especially in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.

- **Summary**: Object detection is a fundamental task in various applications ranging from autonomous driving to intelligent security systems. However, recognition of a person can be hindered when their clothing is decorated with carefully designed graffiti patterns, leading to the failure of object detection. To achieve greater attack potential against unknown black-box models, adversarial patches capable of affecting the outputs of multiple-object detection models are required. While ensemble models have proven effective, current research in the field of object detection typically focuses on the simple fusion of the outputs of all models, with limited attention being given to developing general adversarial patches that can function effectively in the physical world. In this paper, we introduce the concept of energy and treat the adversarial patches generation process as an optimization of the adversarial patches to minimize the total energy of the ``person'' category. Additionally, by adopting adversarial training, we construct a dynamically optimized ensemble model. During training, the weight parameters of the attacked target models are adjusted to find the balance point at which the generated adversarial patches can effectively attack all target models. We carried out six sets of comparative experiments and tested our algorithm on five mainstream object detection models. The adversarial patches generated by our algorithm can reduce the recognition accuracy of YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 to 13.19\% and 29.20\%, respectively. In addition, we conducted experiments to test the effectiveness of T-shirts covered with our adversarial patches in the physical world and could achieve that people are not recognized by the object detection model. Finally, leveraging the Grad-CAM tool, we explored the attack mechanism of adversarial patches from an energetic perspective.

- **Summary**: The pests captured with imaging devices may be relatively small in size compared to the entire images, and complex backgrounds have colors and textures similar to those of the pests, which hinders accurate feature extraction and makes pest identification challenging. The key to pest identification is to create a model capable of detecting regions of interest (ROIs) and transforming them into better ones for attention and discriminative learning. To address these problems, we will study how to generate and update the ROIs via multiscale cross-attention fusion as well as how to be highly robust to complex backgrounds and scale problems. Therefore, we propose a novel ROI-aware multiscale cross-attention vision transformer (ROI-ViT). The proposed ROI-ViT is designed using dual branches, called Pest and ROI branches, which take different types of maps as input: Pest images and ROI maps. To render such ROI maps, ROI generators are built using soft segmentation and a class activation map and then integrated into the ROI-ViT backbone. Additionally, in the dual branch, complementary feature fusion and multiscale hierarchies are implemented via a novel multiscale cross-attention fusion. The class token from the Pest branch is exchanged with the patch tokens from the ROI branch, and vice versa. The experimental results show that the proposed ROI-ViT achieves 81.81%, 99.64%, and 84.66% for IP102, D0, and SauTeg pest datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as MViT, PVT, DeiT, Swin-ViT, and EfficientNet. More importantly, for the new challenging dataset IP102(CBSS) that contains only pest images with complex backgrounds and small sizes, the proposed model can maintain high recognition accuracy, whereas that of other SOTA models decrease sharply, demonstrating that our model is more robust to complex background and scale problems.

- **Summary**: Res-Tuning introduces a flexible and efficient paradigm for model tuning, showing that tuners decoupled from the backbone network can achieve performance comparable to traditional methods. Existing methods commonly construct the tuner as a set of trainable low-rank decomposition matrices, positing that a low-rank subspace suffices for adapting pre-trained foundational models to new scenarios. In this work, we present an advanced, efficient tuner augmented with low-rank attention, termed Res-Attn , which also adheres to the Res-Tuning framework. Res-Attn utilizes a parallel multi-head attention module equipped with low-rank projections for query, key, and value to execute streamlined attention operations. Through training this lightweight attention module, Res-Attn facilitates adaptation to new scenarios. Our extensive experiments across a range of discriminative and generative tasks showcase the superior performance of our method when compared to existing alternatives

- **Summary**: Active learning has been demonstrated effective to reduce labeling cost, while most progress has been designed for image recognition, there still lacks instance-level active learning for object detection. In this paper, we rethink two key components, i.e., localization and recognition, for object detection, and find that the correctness of them are highly related, therefore, it is not necessary to annotate both boxes and classes if we are given pseudo annotations provided with the trained model. Motivated by this, we propose an efficient query strategy, termed as DeLR, that Decoupling the Localization and Recognition for active query. In this way, we are probably free of class annotations when the localization is correct, and able to assign the labeling budget for more informative samples. There are two main differences in DeLR: 1) Unlike previous methods mostly focus on image-level annotations, where the queried samples are selected and exhausted annotated. In DeLR, the query is based on region-level, and we only annotate the object region that is queried; 2) Instead of directly providing both localization and recognition annotations, we separately query the two components, and thus reduce the recognition budget with the pseudo class labels provided by the model. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate its superiority. We hope our proposed query strategy would shed light on researches in active learning in object detection.

- **Summary**: Event cameras and RGB cameras exhibit complementary characteristics in imaging: the former possesses high dynamic range (HDR) and high temporal resolution, while the latter provides rich texture and color information. This makes the integration of event cameras into middle- and high-level RGB-based vision tasks highly promising. However, challenges arise in multi-modal fusion, data annotation, and model architecture design. In this paper, we propose EvPlug, which learns a plug-and-play event and image fusion module from the supervision of the existing RGB-based model. The learned fusion module integrates event streams with image features in the form of a plug-in, endowing the RGB-based model to be robust to HDR and fast motion scenes while enabling high temporal resolution inference. Our method only requires unlabeled event-image pairs (no pixel-wise alignment required) and does not alter the structure or weights of the RGB-based model. We demonstrate the superiority of EvPlug in several vision tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D hand pose estimation

- **Summary**: Deep learning has driven significant progress in object detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Existing methods, while achieving promising results, often struggle to effectively integrate local and global information, particularly direction-aware features. This paper proposes SAR-Net, a novel framework specifically designed for global fusion of direction-aware information in SAR object detection. SAR-Net leverages two key innovations: the Unity Compensation Mechanism (UCM) and the Direction-aware Attention Module (DAM). UCM facilitates the establishment of complementary relationships among features across different scales, enabling efficient global information fusion. Among them, Multi-scale Alignment Module (MAM) and distinct Multi-level Fusion Module (MFM) enhance feature integration by capturing both texture detail and semantic information. Then, Multi-feature Embedding Module (MEM) feeds back global features into the primary branches, further improving information transmission. Additionally, DAM, through bidirectional attention polymerization, captures direction-aware information, effectively eliminating background interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SAR-Net, achieving state-of-the-art results on aircraft (SAR-AIRcraft-1.0) and ship datasets (SSDD, HRSID), confirming its generalization capability and robustness.

- **Summary**: Recently, the evolution of deep learning has promoted the application of machine learning (ML) to various systems. However, there are ML systems, such as autonomous vehicles, that cause critical damage when they misclassify. Conversely, there are ML-specific attacks called adversarial attacks based on the characteristics of ML systems. For example, one type of adversarial attack is an evasion attack, which uses minute perturbations called "adversarial examples" to intentionally misclassify classifiers. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the risk of ML-specific attacks in introducing ML base systems. In this study, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for analyzing the risk of evasion attacks using attack trees. The proposed method consists of the extension of the conventional attack tree to analyze evasion attacks and the systematic construction method of the extension. In the extension of the conventional attack tree, we introduce ML and conventional attack nodes to represent various characteristics of evasion attacks. In the systematic construction process, we propose a procedure to construct the attack tree. The procedure consists of three steps: (1) organizing information about attack methods in the literature to a matrix, (2) identifying evasion attack scenarios from methods in the matrix, and (3) constructing the attack tree from the identified scenarios using a pattern. Finally, we conducted experiments on three ML image recognition systems to demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Multi-view compression technology, especially Stereo Image Compression (SIC), plays a crucial role in car-mounted cameras and 3D-related applications. Interestingly, the Distributed Source Coding (DSC) theory suggests that efficient data compression of correlated sources can be achieved through independent encoding and joint decoding. This motivates the rapidly developed deep-distributed SIC methods in recent years. However, these approaches neglect the unique characteristics of stereo-imaging tasks and incur high decoding latency. To address this limitation, we propose a Feature-based Fast Cascade Alignment network (FFCA-Net) to fully leverage the side information on the decoder. FFCA adopts a coarse-to-fine cascaded alignment approach. In the initial stage, FFCA utilizes a feature domain patch-matching module based on stereo priors. This module reduces redundancy in the search space of trivial matching methods and further mitigates the introduction of noise. In the subsequent stage, we utilize an hourglass-based sparse stereo refinement network to further align inter-image features with a reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we have devised a lightweight yet high-performance feature fusion network, called a Fast Feature Fusion network (FFF), to decode the aligned features. Experimental results on InStereo2K, KITTI, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over traditional and learning-based SIC methods. In particular, our approach achieves significant gains in terms of 3 to 10-fold faster decoding speed than other methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel interactive satellite image change detection algorithm based on active learning. The proposed method is iterative and consists in frugally probing the user (oracle) about the labels of the most critical images, and according to the oracle's annotations, it updates change detection results. First, we consider a probabilistic framework which assigns to each unlabeled sample a relevance measure modeling how critical is that sample when training change detection functions. We obtain these relevance measures by minimizing an objective function mixing diversity, representativity and uncertainty. These criteria when combined allow exploring different data modes and also refining change detections. Then, we further explore the potential of this objective function, by considering a reinforcement learning approach that finds the best combination of diversity, representativity and uncertainty as well as display-sizes through active learning iterations, leading to better generalization as shown through experiments in interactive satellite image change detection.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of deep learning models. Contrastive methods are a prominent family of SSL that extract similar representations of two augmented views of an image while pushing away others in the representation space as negatives. However, the state-of-the-art contrastive methods require large batch sizes and augmentations designed for natural images that are impractical for 3D medical images. To address these limitations, we propose a new longitudinal SSL method, 3DTINC, based on non-contrastive learning. It is designed to learn perturbation-invariant features for 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes, using augmentations specifically designed for OCT. We introduce a new non-contrastive similarity loss term that learns temporal information implicitly from intra-patient scans acquired at different times. Our experiments show that this temporal information is crucial for predicting progression of retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). After pretraining with 3DTINC, we evaluated the learned representations and the prognostic models on two large-scale longitudinal datasets of retinal OCTs where we predict the conversion to wet-AMD within a six months interval. Our results demonstrate that each component of our contributions is crucial for learning meaningful representations useful in predicting disease progression from longitudinal volumetric scans.

- **Summary**: Collecting real-world optical flow datasets is a formidable challenge due to the high cost of labeling. A shortage of datasets significantly constrains the real-world performance of optical flow models. Building virtual datasets that resemble real scenarios offers a potential solution for performance enhancement, yet a domain gap separates virtual and real datasets. This paper introduces FlowDA, an unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) framework for optical flow estimation. FlowDA employs a UDA architecture based on mean-teacher and integrates concepts and techniques in unsupervised optical flow estimation. Furthermore, an Adaptive Curriculum Weighting (ACW) module based on curriculum learning is proposed to enhance the training effectiveness. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that our FlowDA outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised optical flow estimation method SMURF by 21.6%, real optical flow dataset generation method MPI-Flow by 27.8%, and optical flow estimation adaptive method FlowSupervisor by 30.9%, offering novel insights for enhancing the performance of optical flow estimation in real-world scenarios. The code will be open-sourced after the publication of this paper.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers complementary diagnostic information, but some modalities are limited by the long scanning time. To accelerate the whole acquisition process, MRI reconstruction of one modality from highly undersampled k-space data with another fully-sampled reference modality is an efficient solution. However, the misalignment between modalities, which is common in clinic practice, can negatively affect reconstruction quality. Existing deep learning-based methods that account for inter-modality misalignment perform better, but still share two main common limitations: (1) The spatial alignment task is not adaptively integrated with the reconstruction process, resulting in insufficient complementarity between the two tasks; (2) the entire framework has weak interpretability. In this paper, we construct a novel Deep Unfolding Network with Spatial Alignment, termed DUN-SA, to appropriately embed the spatial alignment task into the reconstruction process. Concretely, we derive a novel joint alignment-reconstruction model with a specially designed cross-modal spatial alignment term. By relaxing the model into cross-modal spatial alignment and multi-modal reconstruction tasks, we propose an effective algorithm to solve this model alternatively. Then, we unfold the iterative steps of the proposed algorithm and design corresponding network modules to build DUN-SA with interpretability. Through end-to-end training, we effectively compensate for spatial misalignment using only reconstruction loss, and utilize the progressively aligned reference modality to provide inter-modality prior to improve the reconstruction of the target modality. Comprehensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits superior reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging analysis has witnessed remarkable advancements even surpassing human-level performance in recent years, driven by the rapid development of advanced deep-learning algorithms. However, when the inference dataset slightly differs from what the model has seen during one-time training, the model performance is greatly compromised. The situation requires restarting the training process using both the old and the new data which is computationally costly, does not align with the human learning process, and imposes storage constraints and privacy concerns. Alternatively, continual learning has emerged as a crucial approach for developing unified and sustainable deep models to deal with new classes, tasks, and the drifting nature of data in non-stationary environments for various application areas. Continual learning techniques enable models to adapt and accumulate knowledge over time, which is essential for maintaining performance on evolving datasets and novel tasks. This systematic review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in continual learning techniques applied to medical imaging analysis. We present an extensive survey of existing research, covering topics including catastrophic forgetting, data drifts, stability, and plasticity requirements. Further, an in-depth discussion of key components of a continual learning framework such as continual learning scenarios, techniques, evaluation schemes, and metrics is provided. Continual learning techniques encompass various categories, including rehearsal, regularization, architectural, and hybrid strategies. We assess the popularity and applicability of continual learning categories in various medical sub-fields like radiology and histopathology...

- **Summary**: Multi-modal image stitching can be a difficult feat. That's why, in this paper, we've devised a unique and comprehensive image-stitching pipeline that taps into OpenCV's stitching module. Our approach integrates feature-based matching, transformation estimation, and blending techniques to bring about panoramic views that are of top-tier quality - irrespective of lighting, scale or orientation differences between images. We've put our pipeline to the test with a varied dataset and found that it's very effective in enhancing scene understanding and finding real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Existing approaches to Implicit Neural Representation (INR) can be interpreted as a global scene representation via a linear combination of Fourier bases of different frequencies. However, such universal basis functions can limit the representation capability in local regions where a specific component is unnecessary, resulting in unpleasant artifacts. To this end, we introduce a learnable spatial mask that effectively dispatches distinct Fourier bases into respective regions. This translates into collaging Fourier patches, thus enabling an accurate representation of complex signals. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality of the proposed approach over existing baselines across various INR tasks, including image fitting, video representation, and 3D shape representation. Our method outperforms all other baselines, improving the image fitting PSNR by over 3dB and 3D reconstruction to 98.81 IoU and 0.0011 Chamfer Distance.

- **Summary**: Recently, Visual Transformer (ViT) has been extensively used in medical image segmentation (MIS) due to applying self-attention mechanism in the spatial domain to modeling global knowledge. However, many studies have focused on improving models in the spatial domain while neglecting the importance of frequency domain information. Therefore, we propose Multi-axis External Weights UNet (MEW-UNet) based on the U-shape architecture by replacing self-attention in ViT with our Multi-axis External Weights block. Specifically, our block performs a Fourier transform on the three axes of the input features and assigns the external weight in the frequency domain, which is generated by our External Weights Generator. Then, an inverse Fourier transform is performed to change the features back to the spatial domain. We evaluate our model on four datasets, including Synapse, ACDC, ISIC17 and ISIC18 datasets, and our approach demonstrates competitive performance, owing to its effective utilization of frequency domain information.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Generalized Mask-aware Intersection-over-Union (GmaIoU) as a new measure for positive-negative assignment of anchor boxes during training of instance segmentation methods. Unlike conventional IoU measure or its variants, which only consider the proximity of anchor and ground-truth boxes; GmaIoU additionally takes into account the segmentation mask. This enables GmaIoU to provide more accurate supervision during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GmaIoU by replacing IoU with our GmaIoU in ATSS, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) assigner. Then, we train YOLACT, a real-time instance segmentation method, using our GmaIoU-based ATSS assigner. The resulting YOLACT based on the GmaIoU assigner outperforms (i) ATSS with IoU by $\sim 1.0-1.5$ mask AP, (ii) YOLACT with a fixed IoU threshold assigner by $\sim 1.5-2$ mask AP over different image sizes and (iii) decreases the inference time by $25 \%$ owing to using less anchors. Taking advantage of this efficiency, we further devise GmaYOLACT, a faster and $+7$ mask AP points more accurate detector than YOLACT. Our best model achieves $38.7$ mask AP at $26$ fps on COCO test-dev establishing a new state-of-the-art for real-time instance segmentation.

- **Summary**: This study presents an innovative approach for automatic road detection with deep learning, by employing fusion strategies for utilizing both lower-resolution satellite imagery and GPS trajectory data, a concept never explored before. We rigorously investigate both early and late fusion strategies, and assess deep learning based road detection performance using different fusion settings. Our extensive ablation studies assess the efficacy of our framework under diverse model architectures, loss functions, and geographic domains (Istanbul and Montreal). For an unbiased and complete evaluation of road detection results, we use both region-based and boundary-based evaluation metrics for road segmentation. The outcomes reveal that the ResUnet model outperforms U-Net and D-Linknet in road extraction tasks, achieving superior results over the benchmark study using low-resolution Sentinel-2 data. This research not only contributes to the field of automatic road detection but also offers novel insights into the utilization of data fusion methods in diverse applications.

- **Summary**: Dual-lens super-resolution (SR) is a practical scenario for reference (Ref) based SR by utilizing the telephoto image (Ref) to assist the super-resolution of the low-resolution wide-angle image (LR input). Different from general RefSR, the Ref in dual-lens SR only covers the overlapped field of view (FoV) area. However, current dual-lens SR methods rarely utilize these specific characteristics and directly perform dense matching between the LR input and Ref. Due to the resolution gap between LR and Ref, the matching may miss the best-matched candidate and destroy the consistent structures in the overlapped FoV area. Different from them, we propose to first align the Ref with the center region (namely the overlapped FoV area) of the LR input by combining global warping and local warping to make the aligned Ref be sharp and consistent. Then, we formulate the aligned Ref and LR center as value-key pairs, and the corner region of the LR is formulated as queries. In this way, we propose a kernel-free matching strategy by matching between the LR-corner (query) and LR-center (key) regions, and the corresponding aligned Ref (value) can be warped to the corner region of the target. Our kernel-free matching strategy avoids the resolution gap between LR and Ref, which makes our network have better generalization ability. In addition, we construct a DuSR-Real dataset with (LR, Ref, HR) triples, where the LR and HR are well aligned. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the second-best method by a large margin. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Craigie-Hill/KeDuSR.

- **Summary**: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting issue when a model is incrementally trained on limited data. While the Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-Training (CLIP) model has been effective in addressing 2D few/zero-shot learning tasks, its direct application to 3D FSCIL faces limitations. These limitations arise from feature space misalignment and significant noise in real-world scanned 3D data. To address these challenges, we introduce two novel components: the Redundant Feature Eliminator (RFE) and the Spatial Noise Compensator (SNC). RFE aligns the feature spaces of input point clouds and their embeddings by performing a unique dimensionality reduction on the feature space of pre-trained models (PTMs), effectively eliminating redundant information without compromising semantic integrity. On the other hand, SNC is a graph-based 3D model designed to capture robust geometric information within point clouds, thereby augmenting the knowledge lost due to projection, particularly when processing real-world scanned data. Considering the imbalance in existing 3D datasets, we also propose new evaluation metrics that offer a more nuanced assessment of a 3D FSCIL model. Traditional accuracy metrics are proved to be biased; thus, our metrics focus on the model's proficiency in learning new classes while maintaining the balance between old and new classes. Experimental results on both established 3D FSCIL benchmarks and our dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Drowsy driving represents a major contributor to traffic accidents, and the implementation of driver drowsy driving detection systems has been proven to significantly reduce the occurrence of such accidents. Despite the development of numerous drowsy driving detection algorithms, many of them impose specific prerequisites such as the availability of complete facial images, optimal lighting conditions, and the use of RGB images. In our study, we introduce a novel approach called the Multi-Attention Fusion Drowsy Driving Detection Model (MAF). MAF is aimed at significantly enhancing classification performance, especially in scenarios involving partial facial occlusion and low lighting conditions. It accomplishes this by capitalizing on the local feature extraction capabilities provided by multi-attention fusion, thereby enhancing the algorithm's overall robustness. To enhance our dataset, we collected real-world data that includes both occluded and unoccluded faces captured under nighttime and daytime lighting conditions. We conducted a comprehensive series of experiments using both publicly available datasets and our self-built data. The results of these experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves an impressive driver drowsiness detection accuracy of 96.8%.

- **Summary**: Recent real-time semantic segmentation methods usually adopt an additional semantic branch to pursue rich long-range context. However, the additional branch incurs undesirable computational overhead and slows inference speed. To eliminate this dilemma, we propose SCTNet, a single branch CNN with transformer semantic information for real-time segmentation. SCTNet enjoys the rich semantic representations of an inference-free semantic branch while retaining the high efficiency of lightweight single branch CNN. SCTNet utilizes a transformer as the training-only semantic branch considering its superb ability to extract long-range context. With the help of the proposed transformer-like CNN block CFBlock and the semantic information alignment module, SCTNet could capture the rich semantic information from the transformer branch in training. During the inference, only the single branch CNN needs to be deployed. We conduct extensive experiments on Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO-Stuff-10K, and the results show that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: The explosion of visual content available online underscores the requirement for an accurate machine assessor to robustly evaluate scores across diverse types of visual contents. While recent studies have demonstrated the exceptional potentials of large multi-modality models (LMMs) on a wide range of related fields, in this work, we explore how to teach them for visual rating aligned with human opinions. Observing that human raters only learn and judge discrete text-defined levels in subjective studies, we propose to emulate this subjective process and teach LMMs with text-defined rating levels instead of scores. The proposed Q-Align achieves state-of-the-art performance on image quality assessment (IQA), image aesthetic assessment (IAA), as well as video quality assessment (VQA) tasks under the original LMM structure. With the syllabus, we further unify the three tasks into one model, termed the OneAlign. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of the discrete-level-based syllabus over direct-score-based variants for LMMs. Our code and the pre-trained weights are released at https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Align.

- **Summary**: We address the challenges in estimating 3D human poses from multiple views under occlusion and with limited overlapping views. We approach multi-view, single-person 3D human pose reconstruction as a regression problem and propose a novel encoder-decoder Transformer architecture to estimate 3D poses from multi-view 2D pose sequences. The encoder refines 2D skeleton joints detected across different views and times, fusing multi-view and temporal information through global self-attention. We enhance the encoder by incorporating a geometry-biased attention mechanism, effectively leveraging geometric relationships between views. Additionally, we use detection scores provided by the 2D pose detector to further guide the encoder's attention based on the reliability of the 2D detections. The decoder subsequently regresses the 3D pose sequence from these refined tokens, using pre-defined queries for each joint. To enhance the generalization of our method to unseen scenes and improve resilience to missing joints, we implement strategies including scene centering, synthetic views, and token dropout. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark public datasets, Human3.6M, CMU Panoptic and Occlusion-Persons. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, particularly in occluded scenes and when few views are available, which are traditionally challenging scenarios for triangulation-based methods.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models have been widely explored across a wide range of tasks and achieve satisfactory performance. However, it's under-explored how to consolidate entity understanding through a varying number of images and to align it with the pre-trained language models for generative tasks. In this paper, we propose MIVC, a general multiple instance visual component to bridge the gap between various image inputs with off-the-shelf vision-language models by aggregating visual representations in a permutation-invariant fashion through a neural network. We show that MIVC could be plugged into the visual-language models to improve the model performance consistently on visual question answering, classification and captioning tasks on a public available e-commerce dataset with multiple images per product. Furthermore, we show that the component provides insight into the contribution of each image to the downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Learning policies that can generalize to unseen environments is a fundamental challenge in visual reinforcement learning (RL). While most current methods focus on acquiring robust visual representations through auxiliary supervision, pre-training, or data augmentation, the potential of modern vision foundation models remains underleveraged. In this work, we introduce Segment Anything Model for Generalizable visual RL (SAM-G), a novel framework that leverages the promptable segmentation ability of Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance the generalization capabilities of visual RL agents. We utilize image features from DINOv2 and SAM to find correspondence as point prompts to SAM, and then SAM produces high-quality masked images for agents directly. Evaluated across 8 DMControl tasks and 3 Adroit tasks, SAM-G significantly improves the visual generalization ability without altering the RL agents' architecture but merely their observations. Notably, SAM-G achieves 44% and 29% relative improvements on the challenging video hard setting on DMControl and Adroit respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG), which aims to localize moments from videos based on the given natural language queries, has attracted widespread attention. Existing works are mainly designed for short videos, failing to handle TSG in long videos, which poses two challenges: i) complicated contexts in long videos require temporal reasoning over longer moment sequences, and ii) multiple modalities including textual speech with rich information require special designs for content understanding in long videos. To tackle these challenges, in this work we propose a Grounding-Prompter method, which is capable of conducting TSG in long videos through prompting LLM with multimodal information. In detail, we first transform the TSG task and its multimodal inputs including speech and visual, into compressed task textualization. Furthermore, to enhance temporal reasoning under complicated contexts, a Boundary-Perceptive Prompting strategy is proposed, which contains three folds: i) we design a novel Multiscale Denoising Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to combine global and local semantics with noise filtering step by step, ii) we set up validity principles capable of constraining LLM to generate reasonable predictions following specific formats, and iii) we introduce one-shot In-Context-Learning (ICL) to boost reasoning through imitation, enhancing LLM in TSG task understanding. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our Grounding-Prompter method, revealing the benefits of prompting LLM with multimodal information for TSG in long videos.

- **Summary**: Occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving. Previous methods typically constructs a dense 3D volume, neglecting the inherent sparsity of the scene, which results in a high computational cost. Furthermore, these methods are limited to semantic occupancy and fail to differentiate between distinct instances. To exploit the sparsity property and ensure instance-awareness, we introduce a novel fully sparse panoptic occupancy network, termed SparseOcc. SparseOcc initially reconstructs a sparse 3D representation from visual inputs. Subsequently, it employs sparse instance queries to predict each object instance from the sparse 3D representation. These instance queries interact with 2D features via mask-guided sparse sampling, thereby circumventing the need for costly dense features or global attention. Additionally, we have established the first-ever vision-centric panoptic occupancy benchmark. SparseOcc demonstrates its efficacy on the Occ3D-nus dataset by achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 26.0, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 25.4 FPS. By incorporating temporal modeling from the preceding 8 frames, SparseOcc further improves its performance, achieving 30.9 mIoU without whistles and bells. Code will be made available.

- **Summary**: We present ARTrackV2, which integrates two pivotal aspects of tracking: determining where to look (localization) and how to describe (appearance analysis) the target object across video frames. Building on the foundation of its predecessor, ARTrackV2 extends the concept by introducing a unified generative framework to "read out" object's trajectory and "retell" its appearance in an autoregressive manner. This approach fosters a time-continuous methodology that models the joint evolution of motion and visual features, guided by previous estimates. Furthermore, ARTrackV2 stands out for its efficiency and simplicity, obviating the less efficient intra-frame autoregression and hand-tuned parameters for appearance updates. Despite its simplicity, ARTrackV2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on prevailing benchmark datasets while demonstrating remarkable efficiency improvement. In particular, ARTrackV2 achieves AO score of 79.5\% on GOT-10k, and AUC of 86.1\% on TrackingNet while being $3.6 \times$ faster than ARTrack. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: Generating animation of physics-based characters with intuitive control has long been a desirable task with numerous applications. However, generating physically simulated animations that reflect high-level human instructions remains a difficult problem due to the complexity of physical environments and the richness of human language. In this paper, we present InsActor, a principled generative framework that leverages recent advancements in diffusion-based human motion models to produce instruction-driven animations of physics-based characters. Our framework empowers InsActor to capture complex relationships between high-level human instructions and character motions by employing diffusion policies for flexibly conditioned motion planning. To overcome invalid states and infeasible state transitions in planned motions, InsActor discovers low-level skills and maps plans to latent skill sequences in a compact latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InsActor achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks, including instruction-driven motion generation and instruction-driven waypoint heading. Notably, the ability of InsActor to generate physically simulated animations using high-level human instructions makes it a valuable tool, particularly in executing long-horizon tasks with a rich set of instructions.

- **Summary**: Remarkable progress has been made in 4D content generation recently. However, existing methods suffer from long optimization time, lack of motion controllability, and a low level of detail. In this paper, we introduce DreamGaussian4D, an efficient 4D generation framework that builds on 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our key insight is that the explicit modeling of spatial transformations in Gaussian Splatting makes it more suitable for the 4D generation setting compared with implicit representations. DreamGaussian4D reduces the optimization time from several hours to just a few minutes, allows flexible control of the generated 3D motion, and produces animated meshes that can be efficiently rendered in 3D engines.

- **Summary**: The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details, which previous works are unable to do. Project webpage: https://gen2res.github.io.

- **Summary**: Inspired by human driving focus, this research pioneers networks augmented with Focusing Sampling, Partial Field of View Evaluation, Enhanced FPN architecture and Directional IoU Loss - targeted innovations addressing obstacles to precise lane detection for autonomous driving. Experiments demonstrate our Focusing Sampling strategy, emphasizing vital distant details unlike uniform approaches, significantly boosts both benchmark and practical curved/distant lane recognition accuracy essential for safety. While FENetV1 achieves state-of-the-art conventional metric performance via enhancements isolating perspective-aware contexts mimicking driver vision, FENetV2 proves most reliable on the proposed Partial Field analysis. Hence we specifically recommend V2 for practical lane navigation despite fractional degradation on standard entire-image measures. Future directions include collecting on-road data and integrating complementary dual frameworks to further breakthroughs guided by human perception principles. Code will be made available.

- **Summary**: We present Unified-IO 2, the first autoregressive multimodal model that is capable of understanding and generating image, text, audio, and action. To unify different modalities, we tokenize inputs and outputs -- images, text, audio, action, bounding boxes, etc., into a shared semantic space and then process them with a single encoder-decoder transformer model. Since training with such diverse modalities is challenging, we propose various architectural improvements to stabilize model training. We train our model from scratch on a large multimodal pre-training corpus from diverse sources with a multimodal mixture of denoisers objective. To learn an expansive set of skills, such as following multimodal instructions, we construct and finetune on an ensemble of 120 datasets with prompts and augmentations. With a single unified model, Unified-IO 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GRIT benchmark and strong results in more than 35 benchmarks, including image generation and understanding, natural language understanding, video and audio understanding, and robotic manipulation. We release all our models to the research community.

- **Summary**: Vision-language pretrained models have seen remarkable success, but their application to safety-critical settings is limited by their lack of interpretability. To improve the interpretability of vision-language models such as CLIP, we propose a multi-modal information bottleneck (M2IB) approach that learns latent representations that compress irrelevant information while preserving relevant visual and textual features. We demonstrate how M2IB can be applied to attribution analysis of vision-language pretrained models, increasing attribution accuracy and improving the interpretability of such models when applied to safety-critical domains such as healthcare. Crucially, unlike commonly used unimodal attribution methods, M2IB does not require ground truth labels, making it possible to audit representations of vision-language pretrained models when multiple modalities but no ground-truth data is available. Using CLIP as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of M2IB attribution and show that it outperforms gradient-based, perturbation-based, and attention-based attribution methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: In this study, we focus on building up a model that can Segment Anything in medical scenarios, driven by Text prompts, termed as SAT. Our main contributions are three folds: (i) on data construction, we combine multiple knowledge sources to construct a multi-modal medical knowledge tree; Then we build up a large-scale segmentation dataset for training, by collecting over 11K 3D medical image scans from 31 segmentation datasets with careful standardization on both visual scans and label space; (ii) on model training, we formulate a universal segmentation model, that can be prompted by inputting medical terminologies in text form. We present a knowledge-enhanced representation learning framework, and a series of strategies for effectively training on the combination of a large number of datasets; (iii) on model evaluation, we train a SAT-Nano with only 107M parameters, to segment 31 different segmentation datasets with text prompt, resulting in 362 categories. We thoroughly evaluate the model from three aspects: averaged by body regions, averaged by classes, and average by datasets, demonstrating comparable performance to 36 specialist nnUNets, i.e., we train nnUNet models on each dataset/subset, resulting in 36 nnUNets with around 1000M parameters for the 31 datasets. We will release all the codes, and models used in this report, i.e., SAT-Nano. Moreover, we will offer SAT-Ultra in the near future, which is trained with model of larger size, on more diverse datasets. Webpage URL: https://zhaoziheng.github.io/MedUniSeg.

- **Summary**: Neural reconstruction and rendering strategies have demonstrated state-of-the-art performances due, in part, to their ability to preserve high level shape details. Existing approaches, however, either represent objects as implicit surface functions or neural volumes and still struggle to recover shapes with heterogeneous materials, in particular human skin, hair or clothes. To this aim, we present a new hybrid implicit surface representation to model human shapes. This representation is composed of two surface layers that represent opaque and translucent regions on the clothed human body. We segment different regions automatically using visual cues and learn to reconstruct two signed distance functions (SDFs). We perform surface-based rendering on opaque regions (e.g., body, face, clothes) to preserve high-fidelity surface normals and volume rendering on translucent regions (e.g., hair). Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on 3D human reconstructions, and also shows competitive performances on other objects.

- **Summary**: The existing facial datasets, while having plentiful images at near frontal views, lack images with extreme head poses, leading to the downgraded performance of deep learning models when dealing with profile or pitched faces. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a novel dataset named Extreme Pose Face High-Quality Dataset (EFHQ), which includes a maximum of 450k high-quality images of faces at extreme poses. To produce such a massive dataset, we utilize a novel and meticulous dataset processing pipeline to curate two publicly available datasets, VFHQ and CelebV-HQ, which contain many high-resolution face videos captured in various settings. Our dataset can complement existing datasets on various facial-related tasks, such as facial synthesis with 2D/3D-aware GAN, diffusion-based text-to-image face generation, and face reenactment. Specifically, training with EFHQ helps models generalize well across diverse poses, significantly improving performance in scenarios involving extreme views, confirmed by extensive experiments. Additionally, we utilize EFHQ to define a challenging cross-view face verification benchmark, in which the performance of SOTA face recognition models drops 5-37\% compared to frontal-to-frontal scenarios, aiming to stimulate studies on face recognition under severe pose conditions in the wild.

- **Summary**: Aided by text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, existing 4D content creation pipelines utilize score distillation sampling to optimize the entire dynamic 3D scene. However, as these pipelines generate 4D content from text or image inputs, they incur significant time and effort in prompt engineering through trial and error. This work introduces 4DGen, a novel, holistic framework for grounded 4D content creation that decomposes the 4D generation task into multiple stages. We identify static 3D assets and monocular video sequences as key components in constructing the 4D content. Our pipeline facilitates conditional 4D generation, enabling users to specify geometry (3D assets) and motion (monocular videos), thus offering superior control over content creation. Furthermore, we construct our 4D representation using dynamic 3D Gaussians, which permits efficient, high-resolution supervision through rendering during training, thereby facilitating high-quality 4D generation. Additionally, we employ spatial-temporal pseudo labels on anchor frames, along with seamless consistency priors implemented through 3D-aware score distillation sampling and smoothness regularizations. Compared to existing baselines, our approach yields competitive results in faithfully reconstructing input signals and realistically inferring renderings from novel viewpoints and timesteps. Most importantly, our method supports grounded generation, offering users enhanced control, a feature difficult to achieve with previous methods. Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/4DGen/

- **Summary**: Current 3D scene segmentation methods are heavily dependent on manually annotated 3D training datasets. Such manual annotations are labor-intensive, and often lack fine-grained details. Importantly, models trained on this data typically struggle to recognize object classes beyond the annotated classes, i.e., they do not generalize well to unseen domains and require additional domain-specific annotations. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization and impressive zero-shot abilities, inspiring us to incorporate these characteristics from 2D models into 3D models. Therefore, we explore the use of image segmentation foundation models to automatically generate training labels for 3D segmentation. We propose Segment3D, a method for class-agnostic 3D scene segmentation that produces high-quality 3D segmentation masks. It improves over existing 3D segmentation models (especially on fine-grained masks), and enables easily adding new training data to further boost the segmentation performance -- all without the need for manual training labels.

- **Summary**: Generative diffusion models can serve as a prior which ensures that solutions of image restoration systems adhere to the manifold of natural images. However, for restoring facial images, a personalized prior is necessary to accurately represent and reconstruct unique facial features of a given individual. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective, method for personalized restoration, called Dual-Pivot Tuning - a two-stage approach that personalize a blind restoration system while maintaining the integrity of the general prior and the distinct role of each component. Our key observation is that for optimal personalization, the generative model should be tuned around a fixed text pivot, while the guiding network should be tuned in a generic (non-personalized) manner, using the personalized generative model as a fixed ``pivot". This approach ensures that personalization does not interfere with the restoration process, resulting in a natural appearance with high fidelity to the person's identity and the attributes of the degraded image. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively through extensive experiments with images of widely recognized individuals, comparing it against relevant baselines. Surprisingly, we found that our personalized prior not only achieves higher fidelity to identity with respect to the person's identity, but also outperforms state-of-the-art generic priors in terms of general image quality.

- **Summary**: We present LLoVi, a language-based framework for long-range video question-answering (LVQA). Unlike prior long-range video understanding methods, which are often costly and require specialized long-range video modeling design (e.g., memory queues, state-space layers, etc.), our approach uses a frame/clip-level visual captioner (e.g., BLIP2, LaViLa, LLaVA) coupled with a Large Language Model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) leading to a simple yet surprisingly effective LVQA framework. Specifically, we decompose short and long-range modeling aspects of LVQA into two stages. First, we use a short-term visual captioner to generate textual descriptions of short video clips (0.5-8s in length) densely sampled from a long input video. Afterward, an LLM aggregates the densely extracted short-term captions to perform long-range temporal reasoning needed to understand the whole video and answer a question. To analyze what makes our simple framework so effective, we thoroughly evaluate various components of our system. Our empirical analysis reveals that the choice of the visual captioner and LLM is critical for good LVQA performance. Furthermore, we show that a specialized prompt that asks the LLM first to summarize the noisy short-term visual captions and then answer a given input question leads to a significant LVQA performance boost. On EgoSchema, which is best known as a very long-form video question-answering benchmark, our method achieves 50.3% accuracy, outperforming the previous best-performing approach by 18.1% (absolute gain). In addition, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 4.1% and 3.1% on NeXT-QA and IntentQA. We also extend LLoVi to grounded LVQA and show that it outperforms all prior methods on the NeXT-GQA dataset. We will release our code at https://github.com/CeeZh/LLoVi.

- **Summary**: While LISA effectively bridges the gap between segmentation and large language models to enable reasoning segmentation, it poses certain limitations: unable to distinguish different instances of the target region, and constrained by the pre-defined textual response formats. In this work, we introduce LISA++, an update to the existing LISA model, focusing on improving core functionalities while keeping the base architecture intact. The main enhancements in LISA++ include: \textbf{1) Enhanced Segmentation}: The instance segmentation ability has been added, providing a more detailed scene analysis along with the existing multi-region semantic segmentation. \textbf{2) More Natural Conversation}: Improved capability for multi-turn dialogue, with the ability to incorporate segmentation results directly into text responses, i.e., Segmentation in Dialogue (SiD). These improvements are achieved by curating the existing samples of generic segmentation datasets, aimed specifically at enhancing the segmentation and conversational skills without structural change and additional data sources. Comparative analysis with the original LISA model shows significant advancements in these areas, positioning LISA++ as a notable upgrade in visual understanding and interaction. LISA++'s adaptability and improved features highlight the versatility of the mask-as-embedding paradigm proposed by LISA, and the potential as a foundational model for diverse applications.

- **Summary**: Neural graphics primitives are faster and achieve higher quality when their neural networks are augmented by spatial data structures that hold trainable features arranged in a grid. However, existing feature grids either come with a large memory footprint (dense or factorized grids, trees, and hash tables) or slow performance (index learning and vector quantization). In this paper, we show that a hash table with learned probes has neither disadvantage, resulting in a favorable combination of size and speed. Inference is faster than unprobed hash tables at equal quality while training is only 1.2-2.6x slower, significantly outperforming prior index learning approaches. We arrive at this formulation by casting all feature grids into a common framework: they each correspond to a lookup function that indexes into a table of feature vectors. In this framework, the lookup functions of existing data structures can be combined by simple arithmetic combinations of their indices, resulting in Pareto optimal compression and speed.

- **Summary**: Several unsupervised image segmentation approaches have been proposed which eliminate the need for dense manually-annotated segmentation masks; current models separately handle either semantic segmentation (e.g., STEGO) or class-agnostic instance segmentation (e.g., CutLER), but not both (i.e., panoptic segmentation). We propose an Unsupervised Universal Segmentation model (U2Seg) adept at performing various image segmentation tasks -- instance, semantic and panoptic -- using a novel unified framework. U2Seg generates pseudo semantic labels for these segmentation tasks via leveraging self-supervised models followed by clustering; each cluster represents different semantic and/or instance membership of pixels. We then self-train the model on these pseudo semantic labels, yielding substantial performance gains over specialized methods tailored to each task: a +2.6 AP$^{\text{box}}$ boost vs. CutLER in unsupervised instance segmentation on COCO and a +7.0 PixelAcc increase (vs. STEGO) in unsupervised semantic segmentation on COCOStuff. Moreover, our method sets up a new baseline for unsupervised panoptic segmentation, which has not been previously explored. U2Seg is also a strong pretrained model for few-shot segmentation, surpassing CutLER by +5.0 AP$^{\text{mask}}$ when trained on a low-data regime, e.g., only 1% COCO labels. We hope our simple yet effective method can inspire more research on unsupervised universal image segmentation.

- **Summary**: The problem we study in this paper is amodal image segmentation: predicting entire object segmentation masks including both visible and invisible (occluded) parts. In previous work, the amodal segmentation ground truth on real images is usually predicted by manual annotaton and thus is subjective. In contrast, we use 3D data to establish an automatic pipeline to determine authentic ground truth amodal masks for partially occluded objects in real images. This pipeline is used to construct an amodal completion evaluation benchmark, MP3D-Amodal, consisting of a variety of object categories and labels. To better handle the amodal completion task in the wild, we explore two architecture variants: a two-stage model that first infers the occluder, followed by amodal mask completion; and a one-stage model that exploits the representation power of Stable Diffusion for amodal segmentation across many categories. Without bells and whistles, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on Amodal segmentation datasets that cover a large variety of objects, including COCOA and our new MP3D-Amodal dataset. The dataset, model, and code are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/amodal/.

- **Summary**: We present iFusion, a novel 3D object reconstruction framework that requires only two views with unknown camera poses. While single-view reconstruction yields visually appealing results, it can deviate significantly from the actual object, especially on unseen sides. Additional views improve reconstruction fidelity but necessitate known camera poses. However, assuming the availability of pose may be unrealistic, and existing pose estimators fail in sparse view scenarios. To address this, we harness a pre-trained novel view synthesis diffusion model, which embeds implicit knowledge about the geometry and appearance of diverse objects. Our strategy unfolds in three steps: (1) We invert the diffusion model for camera pose estimation instead of synthesizing novel views. (2) The diffusion model is fine-tuned using provided views and estimated poses, turned into a novel view synthesizer tailored for the target object. (3) Leveraging registered views and the fine-tuned diffusion model, we reconstruct the 3D object. Experiments demonstrate strong performance in both pose estimation and novel view synthesis. Moreover, iFusion seamlessly integrates with various reconstruction methods and enhances them.

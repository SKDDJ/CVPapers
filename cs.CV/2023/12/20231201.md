- **Summary**: This paper proposes a heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation framework for unsupervised medical image registration. Existing methods rely on objectives (e.g. mean-squared error) that assume a uniform noise level across the image, disregarding the heteroscedastic and input-dependent characteristics of noise distribution in real-world medical images. This further introduces noisy gradients due to undesired penalization on outliers, causing unnatural deformation and performance degradation. To mitigate this, we propose an adaptive weighting scheme with a relative $\gamma$-exponentiated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the displacement estimator after modeling the heteroscedastic noise using a separate variance estimator to prevent the model from being driven away by spurious gradients from error residuals, leading to more accurate displacement estimation. To illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we tested our framework on two representative registration architectures across three medical image datasets. Our proposed framework consistently outperforms other baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively while also providing accurate and sensible uncertainty measures. Paired t-tests show that our improvements in registration accuracy are statistically significant. The code will be publicly available at \url{https://voldemort108x.github.io/hetero_uncertainty/}.

- **Summary**: Computer Vision (CV) systems are increasingly being adopted into Command and Control (C2) systems to improve intelligence analysis on the battlefield, the tactical edge. CV systems leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to help visualize and interpret the environment, enhancing situational awareness. However, the adaptability of CV systems at the tactical edge remains challenging due to rapidly changing environments and objects which can confuse the deployed models. A CV model leveraged in this environment can become uncertain in its predictions, as the environment and the objects existing in the environment begin to change. Additionally, mission objectives can rapidly change leading to adjustments in technology, camera angles, and image resolutions. All of which can negatively affect the performance of and potentially introduce uncertainty into the system. When the training environment and/or technology differs from the deployment environment, CV models can perform unexpectedly. Unfortunately, most scenarios at the tactical edge do not incorporate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into their deployed C2 and CV systems. This concept paper explores the idea of synchronizing robust data operations and model fine-tuning driven by UQ all at the tactical edge. Specifically, curating datasets and training child models based on the residuals of predictions, using these child models to calculate prediction intervals (PI), and then using these PI to calibrate the deployed models. By incorporating UQ into the core operations surrounding C2 and CV systems at the tactical edge, we can help drive purposeful adaptability on the battlefield.

- **Summary**: We propose an adaptive training scheme for unsupervised medical image registration. Existing methods rely on image reconstruction as the primary supervision signal. However, nuisance variables (e.g. noise and covisibility) often cause the loss of correspondence between medical images, violating the Lambertian assumption in physical waves (e.g. ultrasound) and consistent imaging acquisition. As the unsupervised learning scheme relies on intensity constancy to establish correspondence between images for reconstruction, this introduces spurious error residuals that are not modeled by the typical training objective. To mitigate this, we propose an adaptive framework that re-weights the error residuals with a correspondence scoring map during training, preventing the parametric displacement estimator from drifting away due to noisy gradients, which leads to performance degradations. To illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method, we tested our framework on three representative registration architectures across three medical image datasets along with other baselines. Our proposed adaptive framework consistently outperforms other methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Paired t-tests show that our improvements are statistically significant. The code will be publicly available at \url{https://voldemort108x.github.io/AdaCS/}.

- **Summary**: Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) is a prominent issue in continual learning. Parameter isolation addresses this challenge by masking a sub-network for each task to mitigate interference with old tasks. However, these sub-networks are constructed relying on weight magnitude, which does not necessarily correspond to the importance of weights, resulting in maintaining unimportant weights and constructing redundant sub-networks. To overcome this limitation, inspired by information bottleneck, which removes redundancy between adjacent network layers, we propose \textbf{\underline{I}nformation \underline{B}ottleneck \underline{M}asked sub-network (IBM)} to eliminate redundancy within sub-networks. Specifically, IBM accumulates valuable information into essential weights to construct redundancy-free sub-networks, not only effectively mitigating CF by freezing the sub-networks but also facilitating new tasks training through the transfer of valuable knowledge. Additionally, IBM decomposes hidden representations to automate the construction process and make it flexible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, IBM surpasses the state-of-the-art parameter isolation method with a 70\% reduction in the number of parameters within sub-networks and an 80\% decrease in training time.

- **Summary**: Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) plays a vital role in estimating solar energy resources, which are used to generate sustainable green energy. In order to estimate GHI with high spatial resolution, a quantitative irradiance estimation network, named QIENet, is proposed. Specifically, the temporal and spatial characteristics of remote sensing data of the satellite Himawari-8 are extracted and fused by recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolution operation, respectively. Not only remote sensing data, but also GHI-related time information (hour, day, and month) and geographical information (altitude, longitude, and latitude), are used as the inputs of QIENet. The satellite spectral channels B07 and B11 - B15 and time are recommended as model inputs for QIENet according to the spatial distributions of annual solar energy. Meanwhile, QIENet is able to capture the impact of various clouds on hourly GHI estimates. More importantly, QIENet does not overestimate ground observations and can also reduce RMSE by 27.51%/18.00%, increase R2 by 20.17%/9.42%, and increase r by 8.69%/3.54% compared with ERA5/NSRDB. Furthermore, QIENet is capable of providing a high-fidelity hourly GHI database with spatial resolution 0.02{\deg} * 0.02{\deg}(approximately 2km * 2km) for many applied energy fields.

- **Summary**: In the backdrop of increasing data requirements of Deep Neural Networks for object recognition that is growing more untenable by the day, we present Developmental PreTraining (DPT) as a possible solution. DPT is designed as a curriculum-based pre-training approach designed to rival traditional pre-training techniques that are data-hungry. These training approaches also introduce unnecessary features that could be misleading when the network is employed in a downstream classification task where the data is sufficiently different from the pre-training data and is scarce. We design the curriculum for DPT by drawing inspiration from human infant visual development. DPT employs a phased approach where carefully-selected primitive and universal features like edges and shapes are taught to the network participating in our pre-training regime. A model that underwent the DPT regime is tested against models with randomised weights to evaluate the viability of DPT.

- **Summary**: Creating radio galaxy catalogues from next-generation deep surveys requires automated identification of associated components of extended sources and their corresponding infrared hosts. In this paper, we introduce RadioGalaxyNET, a multimodal dataset, and a suite of novel computer vision algorithms designed to automate the detection and localization of multi-component extended radio galaxies and their corresponding infrared hosts. The dataset comprises 4,155 instances of galaxies in 2,800 images with both radio and infrared channels. Each instance provides information about the extended radio galaxy class, its corresponding bounding box encompassing all components, the pixel-level segmentation mask, and the keypoint position of its corresponding infrared host galaxy. RadioGalaxyNET is the first dataset to include images from the highly sensitive Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope, corresponding infrared images, and instance-level annotations for galaxy detection. We benchmark several object detection algorithms on the dataset and propose a novel multimodal approach to simultaneously detect radio galaxies and the positions of infrared hosts.

- **Summary**: Cloud types, as a type of meteorological data, are of particular significance for evaluating changes in rainfall, heatwaves, water resources, floods and droughts, food security and vegetation cover, as well as land use. In order to effectively utilize high-resolution geostationary observations, a knowledge-based data-driven (KBDD) framework for all-day identification of cloud types based on spectral information from Himawari-8/9 satellite sensors is designed. And a novel, simple and efficient network, named CldNet, is proposed. Compared with widely used semantic segmentation networks, including SegNet, PSPNet, DeepLabV3+, UNet, and ResUnet, our proposed model CldNet with an accuracy of 80.89+-2.18% is state-of-the-art in identifying cloud types and has increased by 32%, 46%, 22%, 2%, and 39%, respectively. With the assistance of auxiliary information (e.g., satellite zenith/azimuth angle, solar zenith/azimuth angle), the accuracy of CldNet-W using visible and near-infrared bands and CldNet-O not using visible and near-infrared bands on the test dataset is 82.23+-2.14% and 73.21+-2.02%, respectively. Meanwhile, the total parameters of CldNet are only 0.46M, making it easy for edge deployment. More importantly, the trained CldNet without any fine-tuning can predict cloud types with higher spatial resolution using satellite spectral data with spatial resolution 0.02{\deg}*0.02{\deg}, which indicates that CldNet possesses a strong generalization ability. In aggregate, the KBDD framework using CldNet is a highly effective cloud-type identification system capable of providing a high-fidelity, all-day, spatiotemporal cloud-type database for many climate assessment fields.

- **Summary**: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) provide promising 3D face reconstructions in various applications. However, existing methods struggle to reconstruct faces with extreme expressions due to deficiencies in supervisory signals, such as sparse or inaccurate landmarks. Segmentation information contains effective geometric contexts for face reconstruction. Certain attempts intuitively depend on differentiable renderers to compare the rendered silhouettes of reconstruction with segmentation, which is prone to issues like local optima and gradient instability. In this paper, we fully utilize the facial part segmentation geometry by introducing Part Re-projection Distance Loss (PRDL). Specifically, PRDL transforms facial part segmentation into 2D points and re-projects the reconstruction onto the image plane. Subsequently, by introducing grid anchors and computing different statistical distances from these anchors to the point sets, PRDL establishes geometry descriptors to optimize the distribution of the point sets for face reconstruction. PRDL exhibits a clear gradient compared to the renderer-based methods and presents state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. The project will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Polyp segmentation plays a vital role in accurately locating polyps at an early stage, which holds significant clinical importance for the prevention of colorectal cancer. Various polyp segmentation methods have been developed using fully-supervised deep learning techniques. However, pixel-wise annotation for polyp images by physicians during the diagnosis is both time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, visual foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable performance. Nevertheless, directly applying SAM to medical segmentation may not produce satisfactory results due to the inherent absence of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel SAM-guided Collaborative Learning Network (SAM-CLNet) for scribble-supervised polyp segmentation, enabling a collaborative learning process between our segmentation network and SAM to boost the model performance. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-level Enhancement and Aggregation Network (CEA-Net) for weakly-supervised polyp segmentation. Within CEA-Net, we propose a Cross-level Enhancement Module (CEM) that integrates the adjacent features to enhance the representation capabilities of different resolution features. Additionally, a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) is employed to capture richer features across multiple levels. Moreover, we present a box-augmentation strategy that combines the segmentation maps generated by CEA-Net with scribble annotations to create more precise prompts. These prompts are then fed into SAM, generating segmentation SAM-guided masks, which can provide additional supervision to train CEA-Net effectively. Furthermore, we present an Image-level Filtering Mechanism to filter out unreliable SAM-guided masks. Extensive experimental results show that our SAM-CLNet outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Stein's paradox holds considerable sway in high-dimensional statistics, highlighting that the sample mean, traditionally considered the de facto estimator, might not be the most efficacious in higher dimensions. To address this, the James-Stein estimator proposes an enhancement by steering the sample means toward a more centralized mean vector. In this paper, first, we establish that normalization layers in deep learning use inadmissible estimators for mean and variance. Next, we introduce a novel method to employ the James-Stein estimator to improve the estimation of mean and variance within normalization layers. We evaluate our method on different computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation, and 3D object classification. Through these evaluations, it is evident that our improved normalization layers consistently yield superior accuracy across all tasks without extra computational burden. Moreover, recognizing that a plethora of shrinkage estimators surpass the traditional estimator in performance, we study two other prominent shrinkage estimators: Ridge and LASSO. Additionally, we provide visual representations to intuitively demonstrate the impact of shrinkage on the estimated layer statistics. Finally, we study the effect of regularization and batch size on our modified batch normalization. The studies show that our method is less sensitive to batch size and regularization, improving accuracy under various setups.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel framework for camera relocation in autonomous vehicles, leveraging deep neural networks (DNN). While existing literature offers various DNN-based camera relocation methods, their deployment is hindered by their high computational demands during inference. In contrast, our approach addresses this challenge through edge cloud collaboration. Specifically, we strategically offload certain modules of the neural network to the server and evaluate the inference time of data frames under different network segmentation schemes to guide our offloading decisions. Our findings highlight the vital role of server-side offloading in DNN-based camera relocation for autonomous vehicles, and we also discuss the results of data fusion. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through experimental evaluation.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating diverse videos. However, they struggle to produce user-desired stylized videos due to (i) text's inherent clumsiness in expressing specific styles and (ii) the generally degraded style fidelity. To address these challenges, we introduce StyleCrafter, a generic method that enhances pre-trained T2V models with a style control adapter, enabling video generation in any style by providing a reference image. Considering the scarcity of stylized video datasets, we propose to first train a style control adapter using style-rich image datasets, then transfer the learned stylization ability to video generation through a tailor-made finetuning paradigm. To promote content-style disentanglement, we remove style descriptions from the text prompt and extract style information solely from the reference image using a decoupling learning strategy. Additionally, we design a scale-adaptive fusion module to balance the influences of text-based content features and image-based style features, which helps generalization across various text and style combinations. StyleCrafter efficiently generates high-quality stylized videos that align with the content of the texts and resemble the style of the reference images. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is more flexible and efficient than existing competitors.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have recently shown substantial success in learning visual representations from unannotated images. Compared with photographic images, medical images acquired with the same imaging protocol exhibit high consistency in anatomy. To exploit this anatomical consistency, this paper introduces a novel SSL approach, called PEAC (patch embedding of anatomical consistency), for medical image analysis. Specifically, in this paper, we propose to learn global and local consistencies via stable grid-based matching, transfer pre-trained PEAC models to diverse downstream tasks, and extensively demonstrate that (1) PEAC achieves significantly better performance than the existing state-of-the-art fully/self-supervised methods, and (2) PEAC captures the anatomical structure consistency across views of the same patient and across patients of different genders, weights, and healthy statuses, which enhances the interpretability of our method for medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching, a pivotal technique in computer vision, plays a crucial role in robotics, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality. Despite the development of numerous impressive methods in recent years, replicating their results and determining the most suitable architecture for practical application remains challenging. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark focusing on practical applicability rather than solely on performance enhancement. Specifically, we develop a flexible and efficient stereo matching codebase, called OpenStereo. OpenStereo includes training and inference codes of more than 12 network models, making it, to our knowledge, the most complete stereo matching toolbox available. Based on OpenStereo, we conducted experiments on the SceneFlow dataset and have achieved or surpassed the performance metrics reported in the original paper. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth revisitation of recent developments in stereo matching through ablative experiments. These investigations inspired the creation of StereoBase, a simple yet strong baseline model. Our extensive comparative analyses of StereoBase against numerous contemporary stereo matching methods on the SceneFlow dataset demonstrate its remarkably strong performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in video-language understanding have been established on the foundation of image-text models, resulting in promising outcomes due to the shared knowledge between images and videos. However, video-language understanding presents unique challenges due to the inclusion of highly complex semantic details, which result in information redundancy, temporal dependency, and scene complexity. Current techniques have only partially tackled these issues, and our quantitative analysis indicates that some of these methods are complementary. In light of this, we propose a novel framework called RTQ (Refine, Temporal model, and Query), which addresses these challenges simultaneously. The approach involves refining redundant information within frames, modeling temporal relations among frames, and querying task-specific information from the videos. Remarkably, our model demonstrates outstanding performance even in the absence of video-language pre-training, and the results are comparable with or superior to those achieved by state-of-the-art pre-training methods.

- **Summary**: After pre-training by generating the next word conditional on previous words, the Language Model (LM) acquires the ability of In-Context Learning (ICL) that can learn a new task conditional on the context of the given in-context examples (ICEs). Similarly, visually-conditioned Language Modelling is also used to train Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with ICL ability. However, such VLMs typically exhibit weaker classification abilities compared to contrastive learning-based models like CLIP, since the Language Modelling objective does not directly contrast whether an object is paired with a text. To improve the ICL of classification, using more ICEs to provide more knowledge is a straightforward way. However, this may largely increase the selection time, and more importantly, the inclusion of additional in-context images tends to extend the length of the in-context sequence beyond the processing capacity of a VLM. To alleviate these limitations, we propose to manipulate the label space of each ICE to increase its knowledge density, allowing for fewer ICEs to convey as much information as a larger set would. Specifically, we propose two strategies which are Label Distribution Enhancement and Visual Descriptions Enhancement to improve In-context classification performance on diverse datasets, including the classic ImageNet and more fine-grained datasets like CUB-200. Specifically, using our approach on ImageNet, we increase accuracy from 74.70\% in a 4-shot setting to 76.21\% with just 2 shots. surpassing CLIP by 0.67\%. On CUB-200, our method raises 1-shot accuracy from 48.86\% to 69.05\%, 12.15\% higher than CLIP. The code is given in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MLS_ICC.

- **Summary**: Cardiac MRI allows for a comprehensive assessment of myocardial structure, function, and tissue characteristics. Here we describe a foundational vision system for cardiac MRI, capable of representing the breadth of human cardiovascular disease and health. Our deep learning model is trained via self-supervised contrastive learning, by which visual concepts in cine-sequence cardiac MRI scans are learned from the raw text of the accompanying radiology reports. We train and evaluate our model on data from four large academic clinical institutions in the United States. We additionally showcase the performance of our models on the UK BioBank, and two additional publicly available external datasets. We explore emergent zero-shot capabilities of our system, and demonstrate remarkable performance across a range of tasks; including the problem of left ventricular ejection fraction regression, and the diagnosis of 35 different conditions such as cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We show that our deep learning system is capable of not only understanding the staggering complexity of human cardiovascular disease, but can be directed towards clinical problems of interest yielding impressive, clinical grade diagnostic accuracy with a fraction of the training data typically required for such tasks.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied for image recognition successfully. Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using quantum mechanisms. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from $N$ to $log_2N$. This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and cat/dog face images. Additionally, data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data augmentation didn't improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of Quantum machine learning theory.

- **Summary**: Multimodal (e.g., RGB-Depth/RGB-Thermal) fusion has shown great potential for improving semantic segmentation in complex scenes (e.g., indoor/low-light conditions). Existing approaches often fully fine-tune a dual-branch encoder-decoder framework with a complicated feature fusion strategy for achieving multimodal semantic segmentation, which is training-costly due to the massive parameter updates in feature extraction and fusion. To address this issue, we propose a surprisingly simple yet effective dual-prompt learning network (dubbed DPLNet) for training-efficient multimodal (e.g., RGB-D/T) semantic segmentation. The core of DPLNet is to directly adapt a frozen pre-trained RGB model to multimodal semantic segmentation, reducing parameter updates. For this purpose, we present two prompt learning modules, comprising multimodal prompt generator (MPG) and multimodal feature adapter (MFA). MPG works to fuse the features from different modalities in a compact manner and is inserted from shadow to deep stages to generate the multi-level multimodal prompts that are injected into the frozen backbone, while MPG adapts prompted multimodal features in the frozen backbone for better multimodal semantic segmentation. Since both the MPG and MFA are lightweight, only a few trainable parameters (3.88M, 4.4% of the pre-trained backbone parameters) are introduced for multimodal feature fusion and learning. Using a simple decoder (3.27M parameters), DPLNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance or is on a par with other complex approaches on four RGB-D/T semantic segmentation datasets while satisfying parameter efficiency. Moreover, we show that DPLNet is general and applicable to other multimodal tasks such as salient object detection and video semantic segmentation. Without special design, DPLNet outperforms many complicated models. Our code will be available at github.com/ShaohuaDong2021/DPLNet.

- **Summary**: Recently, dataset distillation has paved the way towards efficient machine learning, especially for image datasets. However, the distillation for videos, characterized by an exclusive temporal dimension, remains an underexplored domain. In this work, we provide the first systematic study of video distillation and introduce a taxonomy to categorize temporal compression. Our investigation reveals that the temporal information is usually not well learned during distillation , and the temporal dimension of synthetic data contributes little. The observations motivate our unified framework of disentangling the dynamic and static information in the videos. It first distills the videos into still images as static memory and then compensates the dynamic and motion information with a learnable dynamic memory block. Our method achieves state-of-the-art on video datasets at different scales, with notably smaller storage expenditure. Our code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: It is widely believed that the dense supervision is better than the sparse supervision in the field of depth completion, but the underlying reasons for this are rarely discussed. In this paper, we find that the challenge of using sparse supervision for training Radar-Camera depth prediction models is the Projection Transformation Collapse (PTC). The PTC implies that sparse supervision leads the model to learn unexpected collapsed projection transformations between Image/Radar/LiDAR spaces. Building on this insight, we propose a novel ``Disruption-Compensation" framework to handle the PTC, thereby relighting the use of sparse supervision in depth completion tasks. The disruption part deliberately discards position correspondences among Image/Radar/LiDAR, while the compensation part leverages 3D spatial and 2D semantic information to compensate for the discarded beneficial position correspondence. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework (sparse supervision) outperforms the state-of-the-art (dense supervision) with 11.6$\%$ improvement in mean absolute error and $1.6 \times$ speedup.

- **Summary**: Active learning aims to enhance model performance by strategically labeling informative data points. While extensively studied, its effectiveness on large-scale, real-world datasets remains underexplored. Existing research primarily focuses on single-source data, ignoring the multi-domain nature of real-world data. We introduce a multi-domain active learning benchmark to bridge this gap. Our benchmark demonstrates that traditional single-domain active learning strategies are often less effective than random selection in multi-domain scenarios. We also introduce CLIP-GeoYFCC, a novel large-scale image dataset built around geographical domains, in contrast to existing genre-based domain datasets. Analysis on our benchmark shows that all multi-domain strategies exhibit significant tradeoffs, with no strategy outperforming across all datasets or all metrics, emphasizing the need for future research.

- **Summary**: Text-guided 3D face synthesis has achieved remarkable results by leveraging text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. However, most existing works focus solely on the direct generation, ignoring the editing, restricting them from synthesizing customized 3D faces through iterative adjustments. In this paper, we propose a unified text-guided framework from face generation to editing. In the generation stage, we propose a geometry-texture decoupled generation to mitigate the loss of geometric details caused by coupling. Besides, decoupling enables us to utilize the generated geometry as a condition for texture generation, yielding highly geometry-texture aligned results. We further employ a fine-tuned texture diffusion model to enhance texture quality in both RGB and YUV space. In the editing stage, we first employ a pre-trained diffusion model to update facial geometry or texture based on the texts. To enable sequential editing, we introduce a UV domain consistency preservation regularization, preventing unintentional changes to irrelevant facial attributes. Besides, we propose a self-guided consistency weight strategy to improve editing efficacy while preserving consistency. Through comprehensive experiments, we showcase our method's superiority in face synthesis. Project page: https://faceg2e.github.io/.

- **Summary**: In the field of medical imaging, the scarcity of large-scale datasets due to privacy restrictions stands as a significant barrier to develop large models for medical. To address this issue, we introduce SynFundus-1M, a high-quality synthetic dataset with over 1 million retinal fundus images and extensive disease and pathologies annotations, which is generated by a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The SynFundus-Generator and SynFundus-1M achieve superior Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores compared to existing methods on main-stream public real datasets. Furthermore, the ophthalmologists evaluation validate the difficulty in discerning these synthetic images from real ones, confirming the SynFundus-1M's authenticity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that both CNN and ViT can benifit from SynFundus-1M by pretraining or training directly. Compared to datasets like ImageNet or EyePACS, models train on SynFundus-1M not only achieve better performance but also faster convergence on various downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Text-to-video diffusion models have advanced video generation significantly. However, customizing these models to generate videos with tailored motions presents a substantial challenge. In specific, they encounter hurdles in (a) accurately reproducing motion from a target video, and (b) creating diverse visual variations. For example, straightforward extensions of static image customization methods to video often lead to intricate entanglements of appearance and motion data. To tackle this, here we present the Video Motion Customization (VMC) framework, a novel one-shot tuning approach crafted to adapt temporal attention layers within video diffusion models. Our approach introduces a novel motion distillation objective using residual vectors between consecutive frames as a motion reference. The diffusion process then preserves low-frequency motion trajectories while mitigating high-frequency motion-unrelated noise in image space. We validate our method against state-of-the-art video generative models across diverse real-world motions and contexts.

- **Summary**: Existing neural implicit surface reconstruction methods have achieved impressive performance in multi-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit geometry priors such as depth maps or point clouds as regularization. However, the reconstruction results still lack fine details because of the over-smoothed depth map or sparse point cloud. In this work, we propose a neural implicit surface reconstruction pipeline with guidance from 3D Gaussian Splatting to recover highly detailed surfaces. The advantage of 3D Gaussian Splatting is that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are the centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus introduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by enforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine the point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the surface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of points as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction improves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly optimizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting and the neural implicit model, our approach benefits from both representations and generates complete surfaces with intricate details. Experiments on Tanks and Temples verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: The recovery of magnetic resonance (MR) images from undersampled measurements is a key problem that has seen extensive research in recent years. Unrolled approaches, which rely on end-to-end training of convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks within iterative reconstruction algorithms, offer state-of-the-art performance. These algorithms require a large amount of memory during training, making them difficult to employ in high-dimensional applications. Deep equilibrium (DEQ) models and the recent monotone operator learning (MOL) approach were introduced to eliminate the need for unrolling, thus reducing the memory demand during training. Both approaches require a Lipschitz constraint on the network to ensure that the forward and backpropagation iterations converge. Unfortunately, the constraint often results in reduced performance compared to unrolled methods. The main focus of this work is to relax the constraint on the CNN block in two different ways. Inspired by convex-non-convex regularization strategies, we now impose the monotone constraint on the sum of the gradient of the data term and the CNN block, rather than constrain the CNN itself to be a monotone operator. This approach enables the CNN to learn possibly non-monotone score functions, which can translate to improved performance. In addition, we only restrict the operator to be monotone in a local neighborhood around the image manifold. Our theoretical results show that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the fixed point and that the solution is robust to input perturbations, provided that it is initialized close to the true solution. Our empirical results show that the relaxed constraints translate to improved performance and that the approach enjoys robustness to input perturbations similar to MOL.

- **Summary**: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging is a significant and essential medical imaging technique.However, multi-contrast imaging has longer acquisition time and is easy to cause motion artifacts. In particular, the acquisition time for a T2-weighted image is prolonged due to its longer repetition time (TR). On the contrary, T1-weighted image has a shorter TR. Therefore,utilizing complementary information across T1 and T2-weighted image is a way to decrease the overall imaging time. Previous T1-assisted T2 reconstruction methods have mostly focused on image domain using whole-based image fusion approaches. The image domain reconstruction method has the defects of high computational complexity and limited flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-contrast imaging method called partition-based k-space synthesis (PKS) which can achieve super reconstruction quality of T2-weighted image by feature fusion. Concretely, we first decompose fully-sampled T1 k-space data and under-sampled T2 k-space data into two sub-data, separately. Then two new objects are constructed by combining the two sub-T1/T2 data. After that, the two new objects as the whole data to realize the reconstruction of T2-weighted image. Finally, the objective T2 is synthesized by extracting the sub-T2 data of each part. Experimental results showed that our combined technique can achieve comparable or better results than using traditional k-space parallel imaging(SAKE) that processes each contrast independently.

- **Summary**: Musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments in patients lead to difficulties in movement as well as negative effects on their psychological health. Clinical gait analysis, a vital tool for early diagnosis and treatment, traditionally relies on expensive optical motion capture systems. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have opened the door to more accessible and cost-effective alternatives. This paper introduces a novel spatio-temporal Transformer network to estimate critical gait parameters from RGB videos captured by a single-view camera. Empirical evaluations on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients indicate that the proposed framework surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches and show significant improvements in predicting general gait parameters (including Walking Speed, Gait Deviation Index - GDI, and Knee Flexion Angle at Maximum Extension), while utilizing fewer parameters and alleviating the need for manual feature extraction.

- **Summary**: Video Internet of Things (VIoT) has shown full potential in collecting an unprecedented volume of video data. Learning to schedule perceiving models and analyzing the collected videos intelligently will be potential sparks for VIoT. In this paper, to address the challenges posed by the fine-grained and interrelated vision tool usage of VIoT, we build VIoTGPT, the framework based on LLMs to correctly interact with humans, query knowledge videos, and invoke vision models to accomplish complicated tasks. To support VIoTGPT and related future works, we meticulously crafted the training dataset and established benchmarks involving 11 representative vision models across three categories based on semi-automatic annotations. To guide LLM to act as the intelligent agent towards intelligent VIoT, we resort to ReAct instruction tuning based on the collected VIoT dataset to learn the tool capability. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of VIoTGPT.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers have received significant attention due to their impressive performance in many vision tasks. While the token mixer or attention block has been studied in great detail, the channel mixer or feature mixing block (FFN or MLP) has not been explored in depth albeit it accounts for a bulk of the parameters and computation in a model. In this work, we study whether sparse feature mixing can replace the dense connections and confirm this with a block diagonal MLP structure that improves the accuracy by supporting larger expansion ratios. To improve the feature clusters formed by this structure and thereby further improve the accuracy, a lightweight, parameter-free, channel covariance attention (CCA) mechanism is introduced as a parallel branch during training. This design of CCA enables gradual feature mixing across channel groups during training whose contribution decays to zero as the training progresses to convergence. This allows the CCA block to be discarded during inference, thus enabling enhanced performance with no additional computational cost. The resulting $\textit{Scalable CHannEl MixEr}$ (SCHEME) can be plugged into any ViT architecture to obtain a gamut of models with different trade-offs between complexity and performance by controlling the block diagonal structure size in the MLP. This is shown by the introduction of a new family of SCHEMEformer models. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, with different ViT backbones, consistently demonstrate substantial accuracy gains over existing designs, especially under lower FLOPs regimes. For example, the SCHEMEformer establishes a new SOTA of 79.7% accuracy for ViTs using pure attention mixers on ImageNet-1K at 1.77G FLOPs.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an efficient and high-performance method for partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), which aims to retrieve untrimmed long videos that contain at least one relevant moment to the input text query. In terms of both efficiency and performance, the overlooked bottleneck of previous studies is the visual encoding of dense frames. This guides researchers to choose lightweight visual backbones, yielding sub-optimal retrieval performance due to their limited capabilities of learned visual representations. However, it is undesirable to simply replace them with high-performance large-scale vision-and-language models (VLMs) due to their low efficiency. To address these issues, instead of dense frames, we focus on super images, which are created by rearranging the video frames in a $N \times N$ grid layout. This reduces the number of visual encodings to $\frac{1}{N^2}$ and compensates for the low efficiency of large-scale VLMs, allowing us to adopt them as powerful encoders. Surprisingly, we discover that with a simple query-image attention trick, VLMs generalize well to super images effectively and demonstrate promising zero-shot performance against SOTA methods efficiently. In addition, we propose a fine-tuning approach by incorporating a few trainable modules into the VLM backbones. The experimental results demonstrate that our approaches efficiently achieve the best performance on ActivityNet Captions and TVR.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to predict poverty and development indicators from satellite images with surprising accuracy. This paper presents a first attempt at analyzing the CNNs responses in detail and explaining the basis for the predictions. The CNN model, while trained on relatively low resolution day- and night-time satellite images, is able to outperform human subjects who look at high-resolution images in ranking the Wealth Index categories. Multiple explainability experiments performed on the model indicate the importance of the sizes of the objects, pixel colors in the image, and provide a visualization of the importance of different structures in input images. A visualization is also provided of type images that maximize the network prediction of Wealth Index, which provides clues on what the CNN prediction is based on.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a neuromorphic methodology for eye tracking, harnessing pure event data captured by a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) camera. The framework integrates a directly trained Spiking Neuron Network (SNN) regression model and leverages a state-of-the-art low power edge neuromorphic processor - Speck, collectively aiming to advance the precision and efficiency of eye-tracking systems. First, we introduce a representative event-based eye-tracking dataset, "Ini-30", which was collected with two glass-mounted DVS cameras from thirty volunteers. Then,a SNN model, based on Integrate And Fire (IAF) neurons, named "Retina", is described , featuring only 64k parameters (6.63x fewer than the latest) and achieving pupil tracking error of only 3.24 pixels in a 64x64 DVS input. The continous regression output is obtained by means of convolution using a non-spiking temporal 1D filter slided across the output spiking layer. Finally, we evaluate Retina on the neuromorphic processor, showing an end-to-end power between 2.89-4.8 mW and a latency of 5.57-8.01 mS dependent on the time window. We also benchmark our model against the latest event-based eye-tracking method, "3ET", which was built upon event frames. Results show that Retina achieves superior precision with 1.24px less pupil centroid error and reduced computational complexity with 35 times fewer MAC operations. We hope this work will open avenues for further investigation of close-loop neuromorphic solutions and true event-based training pursuing edge performance.

- **Summary**: The quest for fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) capable of navigating complex real-world scenarios with human-like understanding and responsiveness. In this paper, we introduce Dolphins, a novel vision-language model architected to imbibe human-like abilities as a conversational driving assistant. Dolphins is adept at processing multimodal inputs comprising video (or image) data, text instructions, and historical control signals to generate informed outputs corresponding to the provided instructions. Building upon the open-sourced pretrained Vision-Language Model, OpenFlamingo, we first enhance Dolphins's reasoning capabilities through an innovative Grounded Chain of Thought (GCoT) process. Then we tailored Dolphins to the driving domain by constructing driving-specific instruction data and conducting instruction tuning. Through the utilization of the BDD-X dataset, we designed and consolidated four distinct AV tasks into Dolphins to foster a holistic understanding of intricate driving scenarios. As a result, the distinctive features of Dolphins are characterized into two dimensions: (1) the ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of complex and long-tailed open-world driving scenarios and solve a spectrum of AV tasks, and (2) the emergence of human-like capabilities including gradient-free instant adaptation via in-context learning and error recovery via reflection.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis from limited observations remains an important and persistent task. However, high efficiency in existing NeRF-based few-shot view synthesis is often compromised to obtain an accurate 3D representation. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables real-time and photo-realistic view synthesis with as few as three training views. The proposed method, dubbed FSGS, handles the extremely sparse initialized SfM points with a thoughtfully designed Gaussian Unpooling process. Our method iteratively distributes new Gaussians around the most representative locations, subsequently infilling local details in vacant areas. We also integrate a large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator within the Gaussians optimization process, leveraging online augmented views to guide the geometric optimization towards an optimal solution. Starting from sparse points observed from limited input viewpoints, our FSGS can accurately grow into unseen regions, comprehensively covering the scene and boosting the rendering quality of novel views. Overall, FSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and rendering efficiency across diverse datasets, including LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, and Blender.

- **Summary**: Referring image segmentation (RIS) aims to segment objects in an image conditioning on free-from text descriptions. Despite the overwhelming progress, it still remains challenging for current approaches to perform well on cases with various text expressions or with unseen visual entities, limiting its further application. In this paper, we present a novel RIS approach, which substantially improves the generalization ability by addressing the two dilemmas mentioned above. Specially, to deal with unconstrained texts, we propose to boost a given expression with an explicit and crucial prompt, which complements the expression in a unified context, facilitating target capturing in the presence of linguistic style changes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-modal fusion aggregation module with visual guidance from a powerful pretrained model to leverage spatial relations and pixel coherences to handle the incomplete target masks and false positive irregular clumps which often appear on unseen visual entities. Extensive experiments are conducted in the zero-shot cross-dataset settings and the proposed approach achieves consistent gains compared to the state-of-the-art, e.g., 4.15\%, 5.45\%, and 4.64\% mIoU increase on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and ReferIt respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, the results on GraspNet-RIS show that our approach also generalizes well to new scenarios with large domain shifts.

- **Summary**: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired and light-weight machine learning method. It has received significant attention in the literature as a candidate to be applied in the wearable internet of things, near-sensor artificial intelligence applications and on-device processing. HDC is computationally less complex than traditional deep learning algorithms and typically achieves moderate to good classification performance. A key aspect that determines the performance of HDC is the encoding of the input data to the hyperdimensional (HD) space. This article proposes a novel light-weight approach relying only on native HD arithmetic vector operations to encode binarized images that preserves similarity of patterns at nearby locations by using point of interest selection and local linear mapping. The method reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on the test set for the MNIST data set and 84.12% for the Fashion-MNIST data set. These results outperform other studies using baseline HDC with different encoding approaches and are on par with more complex hybrid HDC models. The proposed encoding approach also demonstrates a higher robustness to noise and blur compared to the baseline encoding.

- **Summary**: Estimating 3D rotations is a common procedure for 3D computer vision. The accuracy depends heavily on the rotation representation. One form of representation -- rotation matrices -- is popular due to its continuity, especially for pose estimation tasks. The learning process usually incorporates orthogonalization to ensure orthonormal matrices. Our work reveals, through gradient analysis, that common orthogonalization procedures based on the Gram-Schmidt process and singular value decomposition will slow down training efficiency. To this end, we advocate removing orthogonalization from the learning process and learning unorthogonalized `Pseudo' Rotation Matrices (PRoM). An optimization analysis shows that PRoM converges faster and to a better solution. By replacing the orthogonalization incorporated representation with our proposed PRoM in various rotation-related tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art results on large-scale benchmarks for human pose estimation.

- **Summary**: Presentation of folded documents is not an uncommon case in modern society. Digitizing such documents by capturing them with a smartphone camera can be tricky since a crease can divide the document contents into separate planes. To unfold the document, one could hold the edges potentially obscuring it in a captured image. While there are many geometrical rectification methods, they were usually developed for arbitrary bends and folds. We consider such algorithms and propose a novel approach Unfolder developed specifically for images of documents with a crease from folding in half. Unfolder is robust to projective distortions of the document image and does not fragment the image in the vicinity of a crease after rectification. A new Folded Document Images dataset was created to investigate the rectification accuracy of folded (2, 3, 4, and 8 folds) documents. The dataset includes 1600 images captured when document placed on a table and when held in hand. The Unfolder algorithm allowed for a recognition error rate of 0.33, which is better than the advanced neural network methods DocTr (0.44) and DewarpNet (0.57). The average runtime for Unfolder was only 0.25 s/image on an iPhone XR.

- **Summary**: This research paper focuses on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a form of blood cancer prevalent in children and teenagers, characterized by the rapid proliferation of immature white blood cells (WBCs). These atypical cells can overwhelm healthy cells, leading to severe health consequences. Early and accurate detection of ALL is vital for effective treatment and improving survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming, costly, and prone to errors. The paper proposes an automated detection approach using computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) models, leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of leukemia diagnosis. The study utilizes various transfer learning models like ResNet101V2, VGG19, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 for classifying ALL. The methodology includes using the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for ensuring the validity and reliability of the AI system's predictions. This approach is critical for overcoming the "black box" nature of AI, where decisions made by models are often opaque and unaccountable. The paper highlights that the proposed method using the InceptionV3 model achieved an impressive 98.38% accuracy, outperforming other tested models. The results, verified by the LIME algorithm, showcase the potential of this method in accurately identifying ALL, providing a valuable tool for medical practitioners. The research underscores the impact of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in medical diagnostics, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI applications in healthcare.

- **Summary**: Re-localizing a camera from a single image in a previously mapped area is vital for many computer vision applications in robotics and augmented/virtual reality. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the 6 DoF camera pose relative to a global frame from a single image. We propose to leverage a novel network of relative spatial and temporal geometric constraints to guide the training of a Deep Network for localization. We employ simultaneously spatial and temporal relative pose constraints that are obtained not only from adjacent camera frames but also from camera frames that are distant in the spatio-temporal space of the scene. We show that our method, through these constraints, is capable of learning to localize when little or very sparse ground-truth 3D coordinates are available. In our experiments, this is less than 1% of available ground-truth data. We evaluate our method on 3 common visual localization datasets and show that it outperforms other direct pose estimation methods.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, existing MLLMs prevalently suffer from serious hallucination problems, generating text that is not factually grounded in associated images. The problem makes existing MLLMs untrustworthy and thus impractical in real-world (especially high-stakes) applications. To address the challenge, we present RLHF-V, which enhances MLLM trustworthiness via behavior alignment from fine-grained correctional human feedback. Specifically, RLHF-V collects human preference in the form of segment-level corrections on hallucinations, and performs dense direct preference optimization over the human feedback. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks in both automatic and human evaluation show that, RLHF-V can enable substantially more trustworthy MLLM behaviors with promising data and computation efficiency. Remarkably, using 1.4k annotated data samples, RLHF-V significantly reduces the hallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8%, outperforming the concurrent LLaVA-RLHF trained on 10k annotated data. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness among open-source MLLMs, and shows better robustness than GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations aroused from over-generalization. We open-source our code, model, and data at https://github.com/RLHF-V/RLHF-V.

- **Summary**: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a growing health problem worldwide and is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness, especially among working people aged 20-65. Its incidence is increasing along with the number of diabetes cases, and it is more common in developed countries than in developing countries. Recent research in the field of diabetic retinopathy diagnosis is using advanced technologies, such as analysis of images obtained by ophthalmoscopy. Automatic methods for analyzing eye images based on neural networks, deep learning and image analysis algorithms can improve the efficiency of diagnosis. This paper describes an automatic DR diagnosis method that includes processing and analysis of ophthalmoscopic images of the eye. It uses morphological algorithms to identify the optic disc and lesions characteristic of DR, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates. Automated DR diagnosis has the potential to improve the efficiency of early detection of this disease and contribute to reducing the number of cases of diabetes-related visual impairment. The final step was to create an application with a graphical user interface that allowed retinal images taken at cooperating ophthalmology offices to be uploaded to the server. These images were then analyzed using a developed algorithm to make a diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Diminished reality (DR) refers to the removal of real objects from the environment by virtually replacing them with their background. Modern DR frameworks use inpainting to hallucinate unobserved regions. While recent deep learning-based inpainting is promising, the DR use case is complicated by the need to generate coherent structure and 3D geometry (i.e., depth), in particular for advanced applications, such as 3D scene editing. In this paper, we propose DeepDR, a first RGB-D inpainting framework fulfilling all requirements of DR: Plausible image and geometry inpainting with coherent structure, running at real-time frame rates, with minimal temporal artifacts. Our structure-aware generative network allows us to explicitly condition color and depth outputs on the scene semantics, overcoming the difficulty of reconstructing sharp and consistent boundaries in regions with complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can outperform related work qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Curb detection is essential for environmental awareness in Automated Driving (AD), as it typically limits drivable and non-drivable areas. Annotated data are necessary for developing and validating an AD function. However, the number of public datasets with annotated point cloud curbs is scarce. This paper presents a method for detecting 3D curbs in a sequence of point clouds captured from a LiDAR sensor, which consists of two main steps. First, our approach detects the curbs at each scan using a segmentation deep neural network. Then, a sequence-level processing step estimates the 3D curbs in the reconstructed point cloud using the odometry of the vehicle. From these 3D points of the curb, we obtain polylines structured following ASAM OpenLABEL standard. These detections can be used as pre-annotations in labelling pipelines to efficiently generate curb-related ground truth data. We validate our approach through an experiment in which different human annotators were required to annotate curbs in a group of LiDAR-based sequences with and without our automatically generated pre-annotations. The results show that the manual annotation time is reduced by 50.99% thanks to our detections, keeping the data quality level.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider domain-adaptive imitation learning with visual observation, where an agent in a target domain learns to perform a task by observing expert demonstrations in a source domain. Domain adaptive imitation learning arises in practical scenarios where a robot, receiving visual sensory data, needs to mimic movements by visually observing other robots from different angles or observing robots of different shapes. To overcome the domain shift in cross-domain imitation learning with visual observation, we propose a novel framework for extracting domain-independent behavioral features from input observations that can be used to train the learner, based on dual feature extraction and image reconstruction. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous algorithms for imitation learning from visual observation with domain shift.

- **Summary**: Pruning-quantization joint learning always facilitates the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices. However, most existing methods do not jointly learn a global criterion for pruning and quantization in an interpretable way. In this paper, we propose a novel physics inspired criterion for pruning-quantization joint learning (PIC-PQ), which is explored from an analogy we first draw between elasticity dynamics (ED) and model compression (MC). Specifically, derived from Hooke's law in ED, we establish a linear relationship between the filters' importance distribution and the filter property (FP) by a learnable deformation scale in the physics inspired criterion (PIC). Furthermore, we extend PIC with a relative shift variable for a global view. To ensure feasibility and flexibility, available maximum bitwidth and penalty factor are introduced in quantization bitwidth assignment. Experiments on benchmarks of image classification demonstrate that PIC-PQ yields a good trade-off between accuracy and bit-operations (BOPs) compression ratio e.g., 54.96X BOPs compression ratio in ResNet56 on CIFAR10 with 0.10% accuracy drop and 53.24X in ResNet18 on ImageNet with 0.61% accuracy drop).

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel application of Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs) to study visual aspects of social processes. I train a a StyleGAN2-model on a custom dataset of 14,564 images of London, sourced from Google Streetview taken in London. After training, I invert the images in the training set, finding points in the model's latent space that correspond to them, and compare results from three inversion techniques. I connect each data point with metadata from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, describing income, health and environmental quality in the area where the photographs were taken. It is then possible to map which parts of the model's latent space encode visual features that are distinctive for health, income and environmental quality, and condition the synthesis of new images based on these factors. The synthetic images created reflect visual features of social processes that were previously unknown and difficult to study, describing recurring visual differences between deprived and privileged areas in London. GANs are known for their capability to produce a continuous range of images that exhibit visual differences. The paper tests how to exploit this ability through visual comparisons in still images as well as through an interactive website where users can guide image synthesis with sliders. Though conditioned synthesis has its limitations and the results are difficult to validate, the paper points to the potential for generative models to be repurposed to be parts of social scientific methods.

- **Summary**: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) with reference images have achieved great success by imitating the human vision system, in which the image quality is effectively assessed by comparing the query image with its pristine reference image. However, for the images in the wild, it is quite difficult to access accurate reference images. We argue that it is possible to learn reference knowledge under the No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) setting, which is effective and efficient empirically. Concretely, by innovatively introducing a novel feature distillation method in IQA, we propose a new framework to learn comparative knowledge from non-aligned reference images. And then, to achieve fast convergence and avoid overfitting, we further propose an inductive bias regularization. Such a framework not only solves the congenital defects of NR-IQA but also improves the feature extraction framework, enabling it to express more abundant quality information. Surprisingly, our method utilizes less input while obtaining a more significant improvement compared to the teacher models. Extensive experiments on eight standard NR-IQA datasets demonstrate the superior performance to the state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods, i.e., achieving the PLCC values of 0.917 (vs. 0.884 in LIVEC) and 0.686 (vs. 0.661 in LIVEFB).

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) for robot control typically requires a detailed representation of the environment state, including information about task-relevant objects not directly measurable. Keypoint detectors, such as spatial autoencoders (SAEs), are a common approach to extracting a low-dimensional representation from high-dimensional image data. SAEs aim at spatial features such as object positions, which are often useful representations in robotic RL. However, whether an SAE is actually able to track objects in the scene and thus yields a spatial state representation well suited for RL tasks has rarely been examined due to a lack of established metrics. In this paper, we propose to assess the performance of an SAE instance by measuring how well keypoints track ground truth objects in images. We present a computationally lightweight metric and use it to evaluate common baseline SAE architectures on image data from a simulated robot task. We find that common SAEs differ substantially in their spatial extraction capability. Furthermore, we validate that SAEs that perform well in our metric achieve superior performance when used in downstream RL. Thus, our metric is an effective and lightweight indicator of RL performance before executing expensive RL training. Building on these insights, we identify three key modifications of SAE architectures to improve tracking performance. We make our code available at anonymous.4open.science/r/sae-rl.

- **Summary**: Analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos presents a complex and multifaceted challenge, with applications including surgical training, intra-operative surgical complication prediction, and post-operative surgical assessment. Identifying crucial events within these videos is a significant prerequisite in a majority of these applications. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for relevant event recognition in laparoscopic gynecology videos. Our dataset includes annotations for critical events associated with major intra-operative challenges and post-operative complications. To validate the precision of our annotations, we assess event recognition performance using several CNN-RNN architectures. Furthermore, we introduce and evaluate a hybrid transformer architecture coupled with a customized training-inference framework to recognize four specific events in laparoscopic surgery videos. Leveraging the Transformer networks, our proposed architecture harnesses inter-frame dependencies to counteract the adverse effects of relevant content occlusion, motion blur, and surgical scene variation, thus significantly enhancing event recognition accuracy. Moreover, we present a frame sampling strategy designed to manage variations in surgical scenes and the surgeons' skill level, resulting in event recognition with high temporal resolution. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology in event recognition compared to conventional CNN-RNN architectures through a series of extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: Normalization techniques have been widely used in the field of deep learning due to their capability of enabling higher learning rates and are less careful in initialization. However, the effectiveness of popular normalization technologies is typically limited to specific areas. Unlike the standard Batch Normalization (BN) and Layer Normalization (LN), where BN computes the mean and variance along the (N,H,W) dimensions and LN computes the mean and variance along the (C,H,W) dimensions (N, C, H and W are the batch, channel, spatial height and width dimension, respectively), this paper presents a novel normalization technique called Batch Channel Normalization (BCN). To exploit both the channel and batch dependence and adaptively and combine the advantages of BN and LN based on specific datasets or tasks, BCN separately normalizes inputs along the (N, H, W) and (C, H, W) axes, then combines the normalized outputs based on adaptive parameters. As a basic block, BCN can be easily integrated into existing models for various applications in the field of computer vision. Empirical results show that the proposed technique can be seamlessly applied to various versions of CNN or Vision Transformer architecture.

- **Summary**: This study delves into the flight behaviors of Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to gain insights into their flight trajectories and movements. Using 3D reconstruction from stereo video camera recordings, we closely examine the velocity and acceleration patterns during three flight motion takeoff, flying and landing. The findings not only contribute to our understanding of bird behaviors but also hold significant implications for the advancement of algorithms in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The research aims to bridge the gap between biological principles observed in birds and the application of these insights in developing more efficient and autonomous UAVs. In the context of the increasing use of drones, this study focuses on the biologically inspired principles drawn from bird behaviors, particularly during takeoff, flying and landing flight, to enhance UAV capabilities. The dataset created for this research sheds light on Budgerigars' takeoff, flying, and landing techniques, emphasizing their ability to control speed across different situations and surfaces. The study underscores the potential of incorporating these principles into UAV algorithms, addressing challenges related to short-range navigation, takeoff, flying, and landing.

- **Summary**: We introduce a framework for online learning from a single continuous video stream -- the way people and animals learn, without mini-batches, data augmentation or shuffling. This poses great challenges given the high correlation between consecutive video frames and there is very little prior work on it. Our framework allows us to do a first deep dive into the topic and includes a collection of streams and tasks composed from two existing video datasets, plus methodology for performance evaluation that considers both adaptation and generalization. We employ pixel-to-pixel modelling as a practical and flexible way to switch between pre-training and single-stream evaluation as well as between arbitrary tasks, without ever requiring changes to models and always using the same pixel loss. Equipped with this framework we obtained large single-stream learning gains from pre-training with a novel family of future prediction tasks, found that momentum hurts, and that the pace of weight updates matters. The combination of these insights leads to matching the performance of IID learning with batch size 1, when using the same architecture and without costly replay buffers.

- **Summary**: Sampling from the posterior distribution poses a major computational challenge in solving inverse problems using latent diffusion models. Common methods rely on Tweedie's first-order moments, which are known to induce a quality-limiting bias. Existing second-order approximations are impractical due to prohibitive computational costs, making standard reverse diffusion processes intractable for posterior sampling. This paper introduces Second-order Tweedie sampler from Surrogate Loss (STSL), a novel sampler that offers efficiency comparable to first-order Tweedie with a tractable reverse process using second-order approximation. Our theoretical results reveal that the second-order approximation is lower bounded by our surrogate loss that only requires $O(1)$ compute using the trace of the Hessian, and by the lower bound we derive a new drift term to make the reverse process tractable. Our method surpasses SoTA solvers PSLD and P2L, achieving 4X and 8X reduction in neural function evaluations, respectively, while notably enhancing sampling quality on FFHQ, ImageNet, and COCO benchmarks. In addition, we show STSL extends to text-guided image editing and addresses residual distortions present from corrupted images in leading text-guided image editing methods. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to offer an efficient second-order approximation in solving inverse problems using latent diffusion and editing real-world images with corruptions.

- **Summary**: Real-world low-resolution (LR) videos have diverse and complex degradations, imposing great challenges on video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms to reproduce their high-resolution (HR) counterparts with high quality. Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.

- **Summary**: Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) involves the intricate task of matching face images across the visual domains of visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR). While much of the existing literature on HFR identifies the domain gap as a primary challenge and directs efforts towards bridging it at either the input or feature level, our work deviates from this trend. We observe that large neural networks, unlike their smaller counterparts, when pre-trained on large scale homogeneous VIS data, demonstrate exceptional zero-shot performance in HFR, suggesting that the domain gap might be less pronounced than previously believed. By approaching the HFR problem as one of low-data fine-tuning, we introduce a straightforward framework: comprehensive pre-training, succeeded by a regularized fine-tuning strategy, that matches or surpasses the current state-of-the-art on four publicly available benchmarks.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space has recently emerged as a prevalent approach in the field of autonomous driving. Despite the demonstrated improvements in accuracy and velocity estimation compared to perspective view methods, the deployment of BEV-based techniques in real-world autonomous vehicles remains challenging. This is primarily due to their reliance on vision-transformer (ViT) based architectures, which introduce quadratic complexity with respect to the input resolution. To address this issue, we propose an efficient BEV-based 3D detection framework called BEVENet, which leverages a convolutional-only architectural design to circumvent the limitations of ViT models while maintaining the effectiveness of BEV-based methods. Our experiments show that BEVENet is 3$\times$ faster than contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the NuScenes challenge, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.456 and a nuScenes detection score (NDS) of 0.555 on the NuScenes validation dataset, with an inference speed of 47.6 frames per second. To the best of our knowledge, this study stands as the first to achieve such significant efficiency improvements for BEV-based methods, highlighting their enhanced feasibility for real-world autonomous driving applications.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in various healthcare applications, enabling accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising technique for addressing the challenges in medical image segmentation. In medical images, structures are usually highly interconnected and globally distributed. ViTs utilize their multi-scale attention mechanism to model the long-range relationships in the images. However, they do lack image-related inductive bias and translational invariance, potentially impacting their performance. Recently, researchers have come up with various ViT-based approaches that incorporate CNNs in their architectures, known as Hybrid Vision Transformers (HVTs) to capture local correlation in addition to the global information in the images. This survey paper provides a detailed review of the recent advancements in ViTs and HVTs for medical image segmentation. Along with the categorization of ViT and HVT-based medical image segmentation approaches we also present a detailed overview of their real-time applications in several medical image modalities. This survey may serve as a valuable resource for researchers, healthcare practitioners, and students in understanding the state-of-the-art approaches for ViT-based medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Modeling large-scale scenes from unconstrained image collections in-the-wild has proven to be a major challenge in computer vision. Existing methods tackling in-the-wild neural rendering operate in a closed-world setting, where knowledge is limited to a scene's captured images within a training set. We propose EvE, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first method leveraging generative priors to improve in-the-wild scene modeling. We employ pre-trained generative networks to enrich K-Planes representations with extrinsic knowledge. To this end, we define an alternating training procedure to conduct optimization guidance of K-Planes trained on the training set. We carry out extensive experiments and verify the merit of our method on synthetic data as well as real tourism photo collections. EvE enhances rendered scenes with richer details and outperforms the state of the art on the task of novel view synthesis in-the-wild. Our project page can be found at https://eve-nvs.github.io .

- **Summary**: Facial expression recognition (FER) methods have made great inroads in categorising moods and feelings in humans. Beyond FER, pain estimation methods assess levels of intensity in pain expressions, however assessing the quality of all facial expressions is of critical value in health-related applications. In this work, we address the quality of five different facial expressions in patients affected by Parkinson's disease. We propose a novel landmark-guided approach, QAFE-Net, that combines temporal landmark heatmaps with RGB data to capture small facial muscle movements that are encoded and mapped to severity scores. The proposed approach is evaluated on a new Parkinson's Disease Facial Expression dataset (PFED5), as well as on the pain estimation benchmark, the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database. Our comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms SOTA action quality assessment works on PFED5 and achieves lower mean absolute error than the SOTA pain estimation methods on UNBC-McMaster. Our code and the new PFED5 dataset are available at https://github.com/shuchaoduan/QAFE-Net.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised object-centric learning aims to decompose scenes into interpretable object entities, termed slots. Slot-based auto-encoders stand out as a prominent method for this task. Within them, crucial aspects include guiding the encoder to generate object-specific slots and ensuring the decoder utilizes them during reconstruction. This work introduces two novel techniques, (i) an attention-based self-training approach, which distills superior slot-based attention masks from the decoder to the encoder, enhancing object segmentation, and (ii) an innovative patch-order permutation strategy for autoregressive transformers that strengthens the role of slot vectors in reconstruction. The effectiveness of these strategies is showcased experimentally. The combined approach significantly surpasses prior slot-based autoencoder methods in unsupervised object segmentation, especially with complex real-world images. We provide the implementation code at https://github.com/gkakogeorgiou/spot .

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have gained prominence in generating data for perception tasks such as image classification and object detection. However, the potential in generating high-quality tracking sequences, a crucial aspect in the field of video perception, has not been fully investigated. To address this gap, we propose TrackDiffusion, a novel architecture designed to generate continuous video sequences from the tracklets. TrackDiffusion represents a significant departure from the traditional layout-to-image (L2I) generation and copy-paste synthesis focusing on static image elements like bounding boxes by empowering image diffusion models to encompass dynamic and continuous tracking trajectories, thereby capturing complex motion nuances and ensuring instance consistency among video frames. For the first time, we demonstrate that the generated video sequences can be utilized for training multi-object tracking (MOT) systems, leading to significant improvement in tracker performance. Experimental results show that our model significantly enhances instance consistency in generated video sequences, leading to improved perceptual metrics. Our approach achieves an improvement of 8.7 in TrackAP and 11.8 in TrackAP$_{50}$ on the YTVIS dataset, underscoring its potential to redefine the standards of video data generation for MOT tasks and beyond.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To develop an efficient dual-domain reconstruction framework for multi-contrast MRI, with the focus on minimising cross-contrast misalignment in both the image and the frequency domains to enhance optimisation. Theory and Methods: Our proposed framework, based on deep learning, facilitates the optimisation for under-sampled target contrast using fully-sampled reference contrast that is quicker to acquire. The method consists of three key steps: 1) Learning to synthesise data resembling the target contrast from the reference contrast; 2) Registering the multi-contrast data to reduce inter-scan motion; and 3) Utilising the registered data for reconstructing the target contrast. These steps involve learning in both domains with regularisation applied to ensure their consistency. We also compare the reconstruction performance with existing deep learning-based methods using a dataset of brain MRI scans. Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, for up to an 8-fold acceleration rate, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Comprehensive analysis and ablation studies further present the effectiveness of the proposed components. Conclusion:Our dual-domain framework offers a promising approach to multi-contrast MRI reconstruction. It can also be integrated with existing methods to further enhance the reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Deep neural network models have achieved remarkable progress in 3D scene understanding while trained in the closed-set setting and with full labels. However, the major bottleneck for current 3D recognition approaches is that they do not have the capacity to recognize any unseen novel classes beyond the training categories in diverse kinds of real-world applications. In the meantime, current state-of-the-art 3D scene understanding approaches primarily require high-quality labels to train neural networks, which merely perform well in a fully supervised manner. This work presents a generalized and simple framework for dealing with 3D scene understanding when the labeled scenes are quite limited. To extract knowledge for novel categories from the pre-trained vision-language models, we propose a hierarchical feature-aligned pre-training and knowledge distillation strategy to extract and distill meaningful information from large-scale vision-language models, which helps benefit the open-vocabulary scene understanding tasks. To leverage the boundary information, we propose a novel energy-based loss with boundary awareness benefiting from the region-level boundary predictions. To encourage latent instance discrimination and to guarantee efficiency, we propose the unsupervised region-level semantic contrastive learning scheme for point clouds, using confident predictions of the neural network to discriminate the intermediate feature embeddings at multiple stages. Extensive experiments with both indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in both data-efficient learning and open-world few-shot learning.

- **Summary**: In recent years, several unsupervised cell segmentation methods have been presented, trying to omit the requirement of laborious pixel-level annotations for the training of a cell segmentation model. Most if not all of these methods handle the instance segmentation task by focusing on the detection of different cell instances ignoring their type. While such models prove adequate for certain tasks, like cell counting, other applications require the identification of each cell's type. In this paper, we present CellMixer, an innovative annotation-free approach for the semantic segmentation of heterogeneous cell populations. Our augmentation-based method enables the training of a segmentation model from image-level labels of homogeneous cell populations. Our results show that CellMixer can achieve competitive segmentation performance across multiple cell types and imaging modalities, demonstrating the method's scalability and potential for broader applications in medical imaging, cellular biology, and diagnostics.

- **Summary**: Vision-language pre-training like CLIP has shown promising performance on various downstream tasks such as zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval. Most of the existing CLIP-alike works usually adopt relatively large image encoders like ResNet50 and ViT, while the lightweight counterparts are rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a multi-level interaction paradigm for training lightweight CLIP models. Firstly, to mitigate the problem that some image-text pairs are not strictly one-to-one correspondence, we improve the conventional global instance-level alignment objective by softening the label of negative samples progressively. Secondly, a relaxed bipartite matching based token-level alignment objective is introduced for finer-grained alignment between image patches and textual words. Moreover, based on the observation that the accuracy of CLIP model does not increase correspondingly as the parameters of text encoder increase, an extra objective of masked language modeling (MLM) is leveraged for maximizing the potential of the shortened text encoder. In practice, an auxiliary fusion module injecting unmasked image embedding into masked text embedding at different network stages is proposed for enhancing the MLM. Extensive experiments show that without introducing additional computational cost during inference, the proposed method achieves a higher performance on multiple downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: In recent studies on MRI reconstruction, advances have shown significant promise for further accelerating the MRI acquisition. Most state-of-the-art methods require a large amount of fully-sampled data to optimise reconstruction models, which is impractical and expensive under certain clinical settings. On the other hand, for unsupervised scan-specific reconstruction methods, overfitting is likely to happen due to insufficient supervision, while restrictions on acceleration rates and under-sampling patterns further limit their applicability. To this end, we propose an unsupervised, adaptive coarse-to-fine framework that enhances reconstruction quality without being constrained by the sparsity levels or patterns in under-sampling. The framework employs an implicit neural representation for scan-specific MRI reconstruction, learning a mapping from multi-dimensional coordinates to their corresponding signal intensities. Moreover, we integrate a novel learning strategy that progressively refines the use of acquired k-space signals for self-supervision. This approach effectively adjusts the proportion of supervising signals from unevenly distributed information across different frequency bands, thus mitigating the issue of overfitting while improving the overall reconstruction. Comprehensive evaluation on a public dataset, including both 2D and 3D data, has shown that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art scan-specific MRI reconstruction techniques, for up to 8-fold under-sampling.

- **Summary**: We introduce the new setting of open-vocabulary object 6D pose estimation, in which a textual prompt is used to specify the object of interest. In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g. CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, (iii) the object is imaged from two different viewpoints of two different scenes, and (iv) the object was not observed during the training phase. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from two distinct scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 39 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both a well-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baseline in estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

- **Summary**: Developing and evaluating vision science methods require robust and efficient tools for assessing their performance in various real-world scenarios. This study presents a novel virtual reality (VR) simulation tool that simulates real-world optical methods while giving high experimental control to the experiment. The tool incorporates an experiment controller, to smoothly and easily handle multiple conditions, a generic eye-tracking controller, that works with most common VR eye-trackers, a configurable defocus simulator, and a generic VR questionnaire loader to assess participants' behavior in virtual reality. This VR-based simulation tool bridges the gap between theoretical and applied research on new optical methods, corrections, and therapies. It enables vision scientists to increase their research tools with a robust, realistic, and fast research environment.

- **Summary**: To train well-performing generalizing neural networks, sufficiently large and diverse datasets are needed. Collecting data while adhering to privacy legislation becomes increasingly difficult and annotating these large datasets is both a resource-heavy and time-consuming task. An approach to overcome these difficulties is to use synthetic data since it is inherently scalable and can be automatically annotated. However, how training on synthetic data affects the layers of a neural network is still unclear. In this paper, we train the YOLOv3 object detector on real and synthetic images from city environments. We perform a similarity analysis using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to explore the effects of training on synthetic data on a layer-wise basis. The analysis captures the architecture of the detector while showing both different and similar patterns between different models. With this similarity analysis we want to give insights on how training synthetic data affects each layer and to give a better understanding of the inner workings of complex neural networks. The results show that the largest similarity between a detector trained on real data and a detector trained on synthetic data was in the early layers, and the largest difference was in the head part. The results also show that no major difference in performance or similarity could be seen between frozen and unfrozen backbone.

- **Summary**: Table Structure Recognition (TSR) aims at transforming unstructured table images into structured formats, such as HTML sequences. One type of popular solution is using detection models to detect components of a table, such as columns and rows, then applying a rule-based post-processing method to convert detection results into HTML sequences. However, existing detection-based studies often have the following limitations. First, these studies usually pay more attention to improving the detection performance, which does not necessarily lead to better performance regarding cell-level metrics, such as TEDS. Second, some solutions over-simplify the problem and can miss some critical information. Lastly, even though some studies defined the problem to detect more components to provide as much information as other types of solutions, these studies ignore the fact this problem definition is a multi-label detection because row, projected row header and column header can share identical bounding boxes. Besides, there is often a performance gap between two-stage and transformer-based detection models regarding the structure-only TEDS, even though they have similar performance regarding the COCO metrics. Therefore, we revisit the limitations of existing detection-based solutions, compare two-stage and transformer-based detection models, and identify the key design aspects for the success of a two-stage detection model for the TSR task, including the multi-class problem definition, the aspect ratio for anchor box generation, and the feature generation of the backbone network. We applied simple methods to improve these aspects of the Cascade R-CNN model, achieved state-of-the-art performance, and improved the baseline Cascade R-CNN model by 19.32%, 11.56% and 14.77% regarding the structure-only TEDS on SciTSR, FinTabNet, and PubTables1M datasets.

- **Summary**: We present GIFT (Generative Interpretable Fine-tuning Transformers) for fine-tuning pretrained (often large) Transformer models at downstream tasks in a parameter-efficient way with built-in interpretability. Our GIFT is a deep parameter-residual learning method, which addresses two problems in fine-tuning a pretrained Transformer model: Where to apply the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to be extremely lightweight yet sufficiently expressive, and How to learn the PEFT to better exploit the knowledge of the pretrained model in a direct way? For the former, we select the final projection (linear) layer in the multi-head self-attention of a Transformer model, and verify its effectiveness. For the latter, in contrast to the prior art that directly introduce new model parameters (often in low-rank approximation form) to be learned in fine-tuning with downstream data, we propose a method for learning to generate the fine-tuning parameters. Our GIFT is a hyper-Transformer which take as input the pretrained parameters of the projection layer to generate its fine-tuning parameters using a proposed Parameter-to-Cluster Attention (PaCa). The PaCa results in a simple clustering-based forward explainer that plays the role of semantic segmentation in testing. In experiments, our proposed GIFT is tested on the VTAB benchmark and the fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) benchmark. It obtains significantly better performance than the prior art.

- **Summary**: Bird's-eye View (BeV) representations have emerged as the de-facto shared space in driving applications, offering a unified space for sensor data fusion and supporting various downstream tasks. However, conventional models use grids with fixed resolution and range and face computational inefficiencies due to the uniform allocation of resources across all cells. To address this, we propose PointBeV, a novel sparse BeV segmentation model operating on sparse BeV cells instead of dense grids. This approach offers precise control over memory usage, enabling the use of long temporal contexts and accommodating memory-constrained platforms. PointBeV employs an efficient two-pass strategy for training, enabling focused computation on regions of interest. At inference time, it can be used with various memory/performance trade-offs and flexibly adjusts to new specific use cases. PointBeV achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset for vehicle, pedestrian, and lane segmentation, showcasing superior performance in static and temporal settings despite being trained solely with sparse signals. We will release our code along with two new efficient modules used in the architecture: Sparse Feature Pulling, designed for the effective extraction of features from images to BeV, and Submanifold Attention, which enables efficient temporal modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/PointBeV.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have recently gained unprecedented attention in the field of image synthesis due to their remarkable generative capabilities. Notwithstanding their prowess, these models often incur substantial computational costs, primarily attributed to the sequential denoising process and cumbersome model size. Traditional methods for compressing diffusion models typically involve extensive retraining, presenting cost and feasibility challenges. In this paper, we introduce DeepCache, a novel training-free paradigm that accelerates diffusion models from the perspective of model architecture. DeepCache capitalizes on the inherent temporal redundancy observed in the sequential denoising steps of diffusion models, which caches and retrieves features across adjacent denoising stages, thereby curtailing redundant computations. Utilizing the property of the U-Net, we reuse the high-level features while updating the low-level features in a very cheap way. This innovative strategy, in turn, enables a speedup factor of 2.3$\times$ for Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only a 0.05 decline in CLIP Score, and 4.1$\times$ for LDM-4-G with a slight decrease of 0.22 in FID on ImageNet. Our experiments also demonstrate DeepCache's superiority over existing pruning and distillation methods that necessitate retraining and its compatibility with current sampling techniques. Furthermore, we find that under the same throughput, DeepCache effectively achieves comparable or even marginally improved results with DDIM or PLMS.

- **Summary**: The recent Gaussian Splatting achieves high-quality and real-time novel-view synthesis of the 3D scenes. However, it is solely concentrated on the appearance and geometry modeling, while lacking in fine-grained object-level scene understanding. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Grouping, which extends Gaussian Splatting to jointly reconstruct and segment anything in open-world 3D scenes. We augment each Gaussian with a compact Identity Encoding, allowing the Gaussians to be grouped according to their object instance or stuff membership in the 3D scene. Instead of resorting to expensive 3D labels, we supervise the Identity Encodings during the differentiable rendering by leveraging the 2D mask predictions by SAM, along with introduced 3D spatial consistency regularization. Comparing to the implicit NeRF representation, we show that the discrete and grouped 3D Gaussians can reconstruct, segment and edit anything in 3D with high visual quality, fine granularity and efficiency. Based on Gaussian Grouping, we further propose a local Gaussian Editing scheme, which shows efficacy in versatile scene editing applications, including 3D object removal, inpainting, colorization and scene recomposition. Our code and models will be at https://github.com/lkeab/gaussian-grouping.

- **Summary**: Interactive 3D segmentation in radiance fields is an appealing task since its importance in 3D scene understanding and manipulation. However, existing methods face challenges in either achieving fine-grained, multi-granularity segmentation or contending with substantial computational overhead, inhibiting real-time interaction. In this paper, we introduce Segment Any 3D GAussians (SAGA), a novel 3D interactive segmentation approach that seamlessly blends a 2D segmentation foundation model with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a recent breakthrough of radiance fields. SAGA efficiently embeds multi-granularity 2D segmentation results generated by the segmentation foundation model into 3D Gaussian point features through well-designed contrastive training. Evaluation on existing benchmarks demonstrates that SAGA can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, SAGA achieves multi-granularity segmentation and accommodates various prompts, including points, scribbles, and 2D masks. Notably, SAGA can finish the 3D segmentation within milliseconds, achieving nearly 1000x acceleration compared to previous SOTA. The project page is at https://jumpat.github.io/SAGA.

- **Summary**: Existing score distillation methods are sensitive to classifier-free guidance (CFG) scale: manifested as over-smoothness or instability at small CFG scales, while over-saturation at large ones. To explain and analyze these issues, we revisit the derivation of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and decipher existing score distillation with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) paradigm. With the WGAN paradigm, we find that existing score distillation either employs a fixed sub-optimal discriminator or conducts incomplete discriminator optimization, resulting in the scale-sensitive issue. We propose the Adversarial Score Distillation (ASD), which maintains an optimizable discriminator and updates it using the complete optimization objective. Experiments show that the proposed ASD performs favorably in 2D distillation and text-to-3D tasks against existing methods. Furthermore, to explore the generalization ability of our WGAN paradigm, we extend ASD to the image editing task, which achieves competitive results.

- **Summary**: Machine unlearning has emerged as a prominent and challenging area of interest, driven in large part by the rising regulatory demands for industries to delete user data upon request and the heightened awareness of privacy. Existing approaches either retrain models from scratch or use several finetuning steps for every deletion request, often constrained by computational resource limitations and restricted access to the original training data. In this work, we introduce a novel class unlearning algorithm designed to strategically eliminate an entire class or a group of classes from the learned model. To that end, our algorithm first estimates the Retain Space and the Forget Space, representing the feature or activation spaces for samples from classes to be retained and unlearned, respectively. To obtain these spaces, we propose a novel singular value decomposition-based technique that requires layer wise collection of network activations from a few forward passes through the network. We then compute the shared information between these spaces and remove it from the forget space to isolate class-discriminatory feature space for unlearning. Finally, we project the model weights in the orthogonal direction of the class-discriminatory space to obtain the unlearned model. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy on ImageNet using a Vision Transformer with only $\sim$1.5% drop in retain accuracy compared to the original model while maintaining under 1% accuracy on the unlearned class samples. Further, our algorithm consistently performs well when subject to Membership Inference Attacks showing 7.8% improvement on average across a variety of image classification datasets and network architectures, as compared to other baselines while being $\sim$6x more computationally efficient.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful tool for numerous vision applications. A key component that drives the impressive performance for zero-shot transfer and high versatility is a super large Transformer model trained on the extensive high-quality SA-1B dataset. While beneficial, the huge computation cost of SAM model has limited its applications to wider real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose EfficientSAMs, light-weight SAM models that exhibits decent performance with largely reduced complexity. Our idea is based on leveraging masked image pretraining, SAMI, which learns to reconstruct features from SAM image encoder for effective visual representation learning. Further, we take SAMI-pretrained light-weight image encoders and mask decoder to build EfficientSAMs, and finetune the models on SA-1B for segment anything task. We perform evaluations on multiple vision tasks including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic object detection, and find that our proposed pretraining method, SAMI, consistently outperforms other masked image pretraining methods. On segment anything task such as zero-shot instance segmentation, our EfficientSAMs with SAMI-pretrained lightweight image encoders perform favorably with a significant gain (e.g., ~4 AP on COCO/LVIS) over other fast SAM models.

- **Summary**: The multitude of makeup products available can make it challenging to find the ideal match for desired attributes. An intelligent approach for product discovery is required to enhance the makeup shopping experience to make it more convenient and satisfying. However, enabling accurate and efficient product discovery requires extracting detailed attributes like color and finish type. Our work introduces an automated pipeline that utilizes multiple customized machine learning models to extract essential material attributes from makeup product images. Our pipeline is versatile and capable of handling various makeup products. To showcase the efficacy of our pipeline, we conduct extensive experiments on eyeshadow products (both single and multi-shade ones), a challenging makeup product known for its diverse range of shapes, colors, and finish types. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach by successfully extending it to other makeup categories like lipstick and foundation, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness across different beauty products. Additionally, we conduct ablation experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our machine learning pipeline over human labeling methods in terms of reliability. Our proposed method showcases its effectiveness in cross-category product discovery, specifically in recommending makeup products that perfectly match a specified outfit. Lastly, we also demonstrate the application of these material attributes in enabling virtual-try-on experiences which makes makeup shopping experience significantly more engaging.

- **Summary**: We pursue the goal of developing robots that can interact zero-shot with generic unseen objects via a diverse repertoire of manipulation skills and show how passive human videos can serve as a rich source of data for learning such generalist robots. Unlike typical robot learning approaches which directly learn how a robot should act from interaction data, we adopt a factorized approach that can leverage large-scale human videos to learn how a human would accomplish a desired task (a human plan), followed by translating this plan to the robots embodiment. Specifically, we learn a human plan predictor that, given a current image of a scene and a goal image, predicts the future hand and object configurations. We combine this with a translation module that learns a plan-conditioned robot manipulation policy, and allows following humans plans for generic manipulation tasks in a zero-shot manner with no deployment-time training. Importantly, while the plan predictor can leverage large-scale human videos for learning, the translation module only requires a small amount of in-domain data, and can generalize to tasks not seen during training. We show that our learned system can perform over 16 manipulation skills that generalize to 40 objects, encompassing 100 real-world tasks for table-top manipulation and diverse in-the-wild manipulation. https://homangab.github.io/hopman/

- **Summary**: Text-driven video generation witnesses rapid progress. However, merely using text prompts is not enough to depict the desired subject appearance that accurately aligns with users' intents, especially for customized content creation. In this paper, we study the task of video generation with image prompts, which provide more accurate and direct content control beyond the text prompts. Specifically, we propose a feed-forward framework VideoBooth, with two dedicated designs: 1) We propose to embed image prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner. Coarse visual embeddings from image encoder provide high-level encodings of image prompts, while fine visual embeddings from the proposed attention injection module provide multi-scale and detailed encoding of image prompts. These two complementary embeddings can faithfully capture the desired appearance. 2) In the attention injection module at fine level, multi-scale image prompts are fed into different cross-frame attention layers as additional keys and values. This extra spatial information refines the details in the first frame and then it is propagated to the remaining frames, which maintains temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoBooth achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating customized high-quality videos with subjects specified in image prompts. Notably, VideoBooth is a generalizable framework where a single model works for a wide range of image prompts with feed-forward pass.

- **Summary**: Neural rendering has demonstrated remarkable success in dynamic scene reconstruction. Thanks to the expressiveness of neural representations, prior works can accurately capture the motion and achieve high-fidelity reconstruction of the target object. Despite this, real-world video scenarios often feature large unobserved regions where neural representations struggle to achieve realistic completion. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MorpheuS, a framework for dynamic 360{\deg} surface reconstruction from a casually captured RGB-D video. Our approach models the target scene as a canonical field that encodes its geometry and appearance, in conjunction with a deformation field that warps points from the current frame to the canonical space. We leverage a view-dependent diffusion prior and distill knowledge from it to achieve realistic completion of unobserved regions. Experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method can achieve high-fidelity 360{\deg} surface reconstruction of a deformable object from a monocular RGB-D video.

- **Summary**: While existing large vision-language multimodal models focus on whole image understanding, there is a prominent gap in achieving region-specific comprehension. Current approaches that use textual coordinates or spatial encodings often fail to provide a user-friendly interface for visual prompting. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multimodal model capable of decoding arbitrary visual prompts. This allows users to intuitively mark images and interact with the model using natural cues like a "red bounding box" or "pointed arrow". Our simple design directly overlays visual markers onto the RGB image, eliminating the need for complex region encodings, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance on region-understanding tasks like Visual7W, PointQA, and Visual Commonsense Reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, we present ViP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to assess the capability of models in understanding visual prompts across multiple dimensions, enabling future research in this domain. Code, data, and model are publicly available.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel sequential modeling approach which enables learning a Large Vision Model (LVM) without making use of any linguistic data. To do this, we define a common format, "visual sentences", in which we can represent raw images and videos as well as annotated data sources such as semantic segmentations and depth reconstructions without needing any meta-knowledge beyond the pixels. Once this wide variety of visual data (comprising 420 billion tokens) is represented as sequences, the model can be trained to minimize a cross-entropy loss for next token prediction. By training across various scales of model architecture and data diversity, we provide empirical evidence that our models scale effectively. Many different vision tasks can be solved by designing suitable visual prompts at test time.

- **Summary**: Recent approaches to point tracking are able to recover the trajectory of any scene point through a large portion of a video despite the presence of occlusions. They are, however, too slow in practice to track every point observed in a single frame in a reasonable amount of time. This paper introduces DOT, a novel, simple and efficient method for solving this problem. It first extracts a small set of tracks from key regions at motion boundaries using an off-the-shelf point tracking algorithm. Given source and target frames, DOT then computes rough initial estimates of a dense flow field and visibility mask through nearest-neighbor interpolation, before refining them using a learnable optical flow estimator that explicitly handles occlusions and can be trained on synthetic data with ground-truth correspondences. We show that DOT is significantly more accurate than current optical flow techniques, outperforms sophisticated "universal" trackers like OmniMotion, and is on par with, or better than, the best point tracking algorithms like CoTracker while being at least two orders of magnitude faster. Quantitative and qualitative experiments with synthetic and real videos validate the promise of the proposed approach. Code, data, and videos showcasing the capabilities of our approach are available in the project webpage: https://16lemoing.github.io/dot .

- **Summary**: We propose a method to efficiently equip the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the ability to generate regional captions. SAM presents strong generalizability to segment anything while is short for semantic understanding. By introducing a lightweight query-based feature mixer, we align the region-specific features with the embedding space of language models for later caption generation. As the number of trainable parameters is small (typically in the order of tens of millions), it costs less computation, less memory usage, and less communication bandwidth, resulting in both fast and scalable training. To address the scarcity problem of regional caption data, we propose to first pre-train our model on objection detection and segmentation tasks. We call this step weak supervision pretraining since the pre-training data only contains category names instead of full-sentence descriptions. The weak supervision pretraining allows us to leverage many publicly available object detection and segmentation datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our method and validate each design choice. This work serves as a stepping stone towards scaling up regional captioning data and sheds light on exploring efficient ways to augment SAM with regional semantics.

- **Summary**: We present 3DiFACE, a novel method for personalized speech-driven 3D facial animation and editing. While existing methods deterministically predict facial animations from speech, they overlook the inherent one-to-many relationship between speech and facial expressions, i.e., there are multiple reasonable facial expression animations matching an audio input. It is especially important in content creation to be able to modify generated motion or to specify keyframes. To enable stochasticity as well as motion editing, we propose a lightweight audio-conditioned diffusion model for 3D facial motion. This diffusion model can be trained on a small 3D motion dataset, maintaining expressive lip motion output. In addition, it can be finetuned for specific subjects, requiring only a short video of the person. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and yields speech-driven animations with greater fidelity and diversity.

- **Summary**: Vision-language foundation models have shown remarkable performance in various zero-shot settings such as image retrieval, classification, or captioning. But so far, those models seem to fall behind when it comes to zero-shot localization of referential expressions and objects in images. As a result, they need to be fine-tuned for this task. In this paper, we show that pretrained vision-language (VL) models allow for zero-shot open-vocabulary object localization without any fine-tuning. To leverage those capabilities, we propose a Grounding Everything Module (GEM) that generalizes the idea of value-value attention introduced by CLIPSurgery to a self-self attention path. We show that the concept of self-self attention corresponds to clustering, thus enforcing groups of tokens arising from the same object to be similar while preserving the alignment with the language space. To further guide the group formation, we propose a set of regularizations that allows the model to finally generalize across datasets and backbones. We evaluate the proposed GEM framework on various benchmark tasks and datasets for semantic segmentation. It shows that GEM not only outperforms other training-free open-vocabulary localization methods, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on the recently proposed OpenImagesV7 large-scale segmentation benchmark.

- **Summary**: Online continual learning, the process of training models on streaming data, has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, a critical aspect often overlooked is the label delay, where new data may not be labeled due to slow and costly annotation processes. We introduce a new continual learning framework with explicit modeling of the label delay between data and label streams over time steps. In each step, the framework reveals both unlabeled data from the current time step $t$ and labels delayed with $d$ steps, from the time step $t-d$. In our extensive experiments amounting to 1060 GPU days, we show that merely augmenting the computational resources is insufficient to tackle this challenge. Our findings underline a notable performance decline when solely relying on labeled data when the label delay becomes significant. More surprisingly, when using state-of-the-art SSL and TTA techniques to utilize the newer, unlabeled data, they fail to surpass the performance of a na\"ive method that simply trains on the delayed supervised stream. To this end, we introduce a simple, efficient baseline that rehearses from the labeled memory samples that are most similar to the new unlabeled samples. This method bridges the accuracy gap caused by label delay without significantly increasing computational complexity. We show experimentally that our method is the least affected by the label delay factor and in some cases successfully recovers the accuracy of the non-delayed counterpart. We conduct various ablations and sensitivity experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: We propose to answer zero-shot questions about videos by generating short procedural programs that derive a final answer from solving a sequence of visual subtasks. We present Procedural Video Querying (ProViQ), which uses a large language model to generate such programs from an input question and an API of visual modules in the prompt, then executes them to obtain the output. Recent similar procedural approaches have proven successful for image question answering, but videos remain challenging: we provide ProViQ with modules intended for video understanding, allowing it to generalize to a wide variety of videos. This code generation framework additionally enables ProViQ to perform other video tasks in addition to question answering, such as multi-object tracking or basic video editing. ProViQ achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of benchmarks, with improvements of up to 25% on short, long, open-ended, and multimodal video question-answering datasets.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: While perspective is a well-studied topic in art, it is generally taken for granted in images. However, for the recent wave of high-quality image synthesis methods such as latent diffusion models, perspective accuracy is not an explicit requirement. Since these methods are capable of outputting a wide gamut of possible images, it is difficult for these synthesized images to adhere to the principles of linear perspective. We introduce a novel geometric constraint in the training process of generative models to enforce perspective accuracy. We show that outputs of models trained with this constraint both appear more realistic and improve performance of downstream models trained on generated images. Subjective human trials show that images generated with latent diffusion models trained with our constraint are preferred over images from the Stable Diffusion V2 model 70% of the time. SOTA monocular depth estimation models such as DPT and PixelFormer, fine-tuned on our images, outperform the original models trained on real images by up to 7.03% in RMSE and 19.3% in SqRel on the KITTI test set for zero-shot transfer.

- **Summary**: Object 6D pose estimation methods can achieve high accuracy when trained and tested on the same objects. However, estimating the pose of objects that are absent at training time is still a challenge. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art in zero-shot object 6D pose estimation by proposing the first method that fuses the contribution of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that train their pipeline on data specifically crafted for the 6D pose estimation task, our method does not require task-specific finetuning. Instead, our method, which we name PoMZ, combines geometric descriptors learned from point cloud data with visual features learned from large-scale web images to produce distinctive 3D point-level descriptors. By applying an off-the-shelf registration algorithm, like RANSAC, PoMZ outperforms all state-of-the-art zero-shot object 6D pose estimation approaches. We extensively evaluate PoMZ across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, encompassing over a hundred objects and 20 thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. PoMZ ranks first in the BOP Benchmark under the category Task 4: 6D localization of unseen objects. We will release the source code publicly.

- **Summary**: Training visual embeddings with labeled data supervision has been the de facto setup for representation learning in computer vision. Inspired by recent success of adopting masked image modeling (MIM) in self-supervised representation learning, we propose a simple yet effective setup that can easily integrate MIM into existing supervised training paradigms. In our design, in addition to the original classification task applied to a vision transformer image encoder, we add a shallow transformer-based decoder on top of the encoder and introduce an MIM task which tries to reconstruct image tokens based on masked image inputs. We show with minimal change in architecture and no overhead in inference that this setup is able to improve the quality of the learned representations for downstream tasks such as classification, image retrieval, and semantic segmentation. We conduct a comprehensive study and evaluation of our setup on public benchmarks. On ImageNet-1k, our ViT-B/14 model achieves 81.72% validation accuracy, 2.01% higher than the baseline model. On K-Nearest-Neighbor image retrieval evaluation with ImageNet-1k, the same model outperforms the baseline by 1.32%. We also show that this setup can be easily scaled to larger models and datasets. Code and checkpoints will be released.

- **Summary**: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) exhibit remarkable performance across numerous tasks. However, generalist LMMs often suffer from performance degradation when tuned over a large collection of tasks. Recent research suggests that Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures are useful for instruction tuning, but for LMMs of parameter size around O(50-100B), the prohibitive cost of replicating and storing the expert models severely limits the number of experts we can use. We propose Omni-SMoLA, an architecture that uses the Soft MoE approach to (softly) mix many multimodal low rank experts, and avoids introducing a significant number of new parameters compared to conventional MoE models. The core intuition here is that the large model provides a foundational backbone, while different lightweight experts residually learn specialized knowledge, either per-modality or multimodally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SMoLA approach helps improve the generalist performance across a broad range of generative vision-and-language tasks, achieving new SoTA generalist performance that often matches or outperforms single specialized LMM baselines, as well as new SoTA specialist performance.

- **Summary**: Given a 3D mesh with a UV parameterization, we introduce a novel approach to generating textures from text prompts. While prior work uses optimization from Text-to-Image Diffusion models to generate textures and geometry, this is slow and requires significant compute resources. Alternatively, there are projection based approaches that use the same Text-to-Image models that paint images onto a mesh, but lack consistency at different viewing angles, we propose a method that uses a single Depth-to-Image diffusion network, and generates a single consistent texture when rendered on the 3D surface by first unifying multiple 2D image's diffusion paths, and hoisting that to 3D with MultiDiffusion~\cite{multidiffusion}. We demonstrate our approach on a dataset containing 30 meshes, taking approximately 5 minutes per mesh. To evaluate the quality of our approach, we use CLIP-score~\cite{clipscore} and Frechet Inception Distance (FID)~\cite{frechet} to evaluate the quality of the rendering, and show our improvement over prior work.

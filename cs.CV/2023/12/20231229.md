- **Summary**: Terrain surface roughness, often described abstractly, poses challenges in quantitative characterisation with various descriptors found in the literature. This study compares five commonly used roughness descriptors, exploring correlations among their quantified terrain surface roughness maps across three terrains with distinct spatial variations. Additionally, the study investigates the impacts of spatial scales and interpolation methods on these correlations. Dense point cloud data obtained through Light Detection and Ranging technique are used in this study. The findings highlight both global pattern similarities and local pattern distinctions in the derived roughness maps, emphasizing the significance of incorporating multiple descriptors in studies where local roughness values play a crucial role in subsequent analyses. The spatial scales were found to have a smaller impact on rougher terrain, while interpolation methods had minimal influence on roughness maps derived from different descriptors.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of evaluating dynamic consistency in discrete time probabilistic filters that approximate stochastic system state densities with Gaussian mixtures. Dynamic consistency means that the estimated probability distributions correctly describe the actual uncertainties. As such, the problem of consistency testing naturally arises in applications with regards to estimator tuning and validation. However, due to the general complexity of the density functions involved, straightforward approaches for consistency testing of mixture-based estimators have remained challenging to define and implement. This paper derives a new exact result for Gaussian mixture consistency testing within the framework of normalized deviation squared (NDS) statistics. It is shown that NDS test statistics for generic multivariate Gaussian mixture models exactly follow mixtures of generalized chi-square distributions, for which efficient computational tools are available. The accuracy and utility of the resulting consistency tests are numerically demonstrated on static and dynamic mixture estimation examples.

- **Summary**: Unbiased Scene Graph Generation (USGG) aims to address biased predictions in SGG. To that end, data transfer methods are designed to convert coarse-grained predicates into fine-grained ones, mitigating imbalanced distribution. However, them overlook contextual relevance between transferred labels and subject-object pairs, such as unsuitability of 'eating' for 'woman-table'. Furthermore, they typically involve a two-stage process with significant computational costs, starting with pre-training a model for data transfer, followed by training from scratch using transferred labels. Thus, we introduce a plug-and-play method named CITrans, which iteratively trains SGG models with progressively enhanced data. First, we introduce Context-Restricted Transfer (CRT), which imposes subject-object constraints within predicates' semantic space to achieve fine-grained data transfer. Subsequently, Efficient Iterative Learning (EIL) iteratively trains models and progressively generates enhanced labels which are consistent with model's learning state, thereby accelerating the training process. Finally, extensive experiments show that CITrans achieves state-of-the-art and results with high efficiency.

- **Summary**: Change Detection (CD) has been attracting extensive interests with the availability of bi-temporal datasets. However, due to the huge cost of multi-temporal images acquisition and labeling, existing change detection datasets are small in quantity, short in temporal, and low in practicability. Therefore, a large-scale practical-oriented dataset covering wide temporal phases is urgently needed to facilitate the community. To this end, the ChangeNet dataset is presented especially for multi-temporal change detection, along with the new task of ``Asymmetric Change Detection". Specifically, ChangeNet consists of 31,000 multi-temporal images pairs, a wide range of complex scenes from 100 cities, and 6 pixel-level annotated categories, which is far superior to all the existing change detection datasets including LEVIR-CD, WHU Building CD, etc.. In addition, ChangeNet contains amounts of real-world perspective distortions in different temporal phases on the same areas, which is able to promote the practical application of change detection algorithms. The ChangeNet dataset is suitable for both binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) tasks. Accordingly, we benchmark the ChangeNet dataset on six BCD methods and two SCD methods, and extensive experiments demonstrate its challenges and great significance. The dataset is available at https://github.com/jankyee/ChangeNet.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot Natural Language-Video Localization (NLVL) methods have exhibited promising results in training NLVL models exclusively with raw video data by dynamically generating video segments and pseudo-query annotations. However, existing pseudo-queries often lack grounding in the source video, resulting in unstructured and disjointed content. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of commonsense reasoning in zero-shot NLVL. Specifically, we present CORONET, a zero-shot NLVL framework that leverages commonsense to bridge the gap between videos and generated pseudo-queries via a commonsense enhancement module. CORONET employs Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) to encode commonsense information extracted from a knowledge graph, conditioned on the video, and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the encoded video and pseudo-query representations prior to localization. Through empirical evaluations on two benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that CORONET surpasses both zero-shot and weakly supervised baselines, achieving improvements up to 32.13% across various recall thresholds and up to 6.33% in mIoU. These results underscore the significance of leveraging commonsense reasoning for zero-shot NLVL.

- **Summary**: Recent research has shown that adversarial patches can manipulate outputs from object detection models. However, the conspicuous patterns on these patches may draw more attention and raise suspicions among humans. Moreover, existing works have primarily focused on the attack performance of individual models and have neglected the generation of adversarial patches for ensemble attacks on multiple object detection models. To tackle these concerns, we propose a novel approach referred to as the More Vivid Patch (MVPatch), which aims to improve the transferability and stealthiness of adversarial patches while considering the limitations observed in prior paradigms, such as easy identification and poor transferability. Our approach incorporates an attack algorithm that decreases object confidence scores of multiple object detectors by using the ensemble attack loss function, thereby enhancing the transferability of adversarial patches. Additionally, we propose a lightweight visual similarity measurement algorithm realized by the Compared Specified Image Similarity (CSS) loss function, which allows for the generation of natural and stealthy adversarial patches without the reliance on additional generative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MVPatch algorithm achieves superior attack transferability compared to similar algorithms in both digital and physical domains, while also exhibiting a more natural appearance. These findings emphasize the remarkable stealthiness and transferability of the proposed MVPatch attack algorithm.

- **Summary**: Coarse-to-fine schemes are widely used in traditional single-image motion deblur; however, in the context of deep learning, existing multi-scale algorithms not only require the use of complex modules for feature fusion of low-scale RGB images and deep semantics, but also manually generate low-resolution pairs of images that do not have sufficient confidence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale network based on single-input and multiple-outputs(SIMO) for motion deblurring. This simplifies the complexity of algorithms based on a coarse-to-fine scheme. To alleviate restoration defects impacting detail information brought about by using a multi-scale architecture, we combine the characteristics of real-world blurring trajectories with a learnable wavelet transform module to focus on the directional continuity and frequency features of the step-by-step transitions between blurred images to sharp images. In conclusion, we propose a multi-scale network with a learnable discrete wavelet transform (MLWNet), which exhibits state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world deblurred datasets, in terms of both subjective and objective quality as well as computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: The laws of model size, data volume, computation and model performance have been extensively studied in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the scaling laws in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) have not yet been investigated. To address this, we conducted comprehensive studies that involved examining the correlation between performance and the scale of models, data volume and computation in the field of text recognition.Conclusively, the study demonstrates smooth power laws between performance and model size, as well as training data volume, when other influencing factors are held constant. Additionally, we have constructed a large-scale dataset called REBU-Syn, which comprises 6 million real samples and 18 million synthetic samples. Based on our scaling law and new dataset, we have successfully trained a scene text recognition model, achieving a new state-ofthe-art on 6 common test benchmarks with a top-1 average accuracy of 97.42%.

- **Summary**: Advances in perception modeling have significantly improved the performance of object tracking. However, the current methods for specifying the target object in the initial frame are either by 1) using a box or mask template, or by 2) providing an explicit language description. These manners are cumbersome and do not allow the tracker to have self-reasoning ability. Therefore, this work proposes a new tracking task -- Instruction Tracking, which involves providing implicit tracking instructions that require the trackers to perform tracking automatically in video frames. To achieve this, we investigate the integration of knowledge and reasoning capabilities from a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) for object tracking. Specifically, we propose a tracker called TrackGPT, which is capable of performing complex reasoning-based tracking. TrackGPT first uses LVLM to understand tracking instructions and condense the cues of what target to track into referring embeddings. The perception component then generates the tracking results based on the embeddings. To evaluate the performance of TrackGPT, we construct an instruction tracking benchmark called InsTrack, which contains over one thousand instruction-video pairs for instruction tuning and evaluation. Experiments show that TrackGPT achieves competitive performance on referring video object segmentation benchmarks, such as getting a new state-of the-art performance of 66.5 $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ on Refer-DAVIS. It also demonstrates a superior performance of instruction tracking under new evaluation protocols.

### FerKD: Surgical Label Adaptation for Efficient Distillation

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present FerKD, a novel efficient knowledge distillation framework that incorporates partial soft-hard label adaptation coupled with a region-calibration mechanism. Our approach stems from the observation and intuition that standard data augmentations, such as RandomResizedCrop, tend to transform inputs into diverse conditions: easy positives, hard positives, or hard negatives. In traditional distillation frameworks, these transformed samples are utilized equally through their predictive probabilities derived from pretrained teacher models. However, merely relying on prediction values from a pretrained teacher, a common practice in prior studies, neglects the reliability of these soft label predictions. To address this, we propose a new scheme that calibrates the less-confident regions to be the context using softened hard groundtruth labels. Our approach involves the processes of hard regions mining + calibration. We demonstrate empirically that this method can dramatically improve the convergence speed and final accuracy. Additionally, we find that a consistent mixing strategy can stabilize the distributions of soft supervision, taking advantage of the soft labels. As a result, we introduce a stabilized SelfMix augmentation that weakens the variation of the mixed images and corresponding soft labels through mixing similar regions within the same image. FerKD is an intuitive and well-designed learning system that eliminates several heuristics and hyperparameters in former FKD solution. More importantly, it achieves remarkable improvement on ImageNet-1K and downstream tasks. For instance, FerKD achieves 81.2% on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, outperforming FKD and FunMatch by remarkable margins. Leveraging better pre-trained weights and larger architectures, our finetuned ViT-G14 even achieves 89.9%. Our code is available at https://github.com/szq0214/FKD/tree/main/FerKD.

- **Summary**: Estimating the 6D object pose from a single RGB image often involves noise and indeterminacy due to challenges such as occlusions and cluttered backgrounds. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown appealing performance in generating high-quality images from random noise with high indeterminacy through step-by-step denoising. Inspired by their denoising capability, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our framework, to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence, we formulate 2D keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate such a denoising process, we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion process and condition the reverse process on the object features. Extensive experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Unsupervised object discovery and localization aims to detect or segment objects in an image without any supervision. Recent efforts have demonstrated a notable potential to identify salient foreground objects by utilizing self-supervised transformer features. However, their scopes only build upon patch-level features within an image, neglecting region/image-level and cross-image relationships at a broader scale. Moreover, these methods cannot differentiate various semantics from multiple instances. To address these problems, we introduce Hierarchical mErging framework via contrAstive grouPing (HEAP). Specifically, a novel lightweight head with cross-attention mechanism is designed to adaptively group intra-image patches into semantically coherent regions based on correlation among self-supervised features. Further, to ensure the distinguishability among various regions, we introduce a region-level contrastive clustering loss to pull closer similar regions across images. Also, an image-level contrastive loss is present to push foreground and background representations apart, with which foreground objects and background are accordingly discovered. HEAP facilitates efficient hierarchical image decomposition, which contributes to more accurate object discovery while also enabling differentiation among objects of various classes. Extensive experimental results on semantic segmentation retrieval, unsupervised object discovery, and saliency detection tasks demonstrate that HEAP achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: The quality of a face crop in an image is decided by many factors such as camera resolution, distance, and illumination condition. This makes the discrimination of face images with different qualities a challenging problem in realistic applications. However, most existing approaches are designed specifically for high-quality (HQ) or low-quality (LQ) images, and the performances would degrade for the mixed-quality images. Besides, many methods ask for pre-trained feature extractors or other auxiliary structures to support the training and the evaluation. In this paper, we point out that the key to better understand both the HQ and the LQ images simultaneously is to apply different learning methods according to their qualities. We propose a novel quality-guided joint training approach for mixed-quality face recognition, which could simultaneously learn the images of different qualities with a single encoder. Based on quality partition, classification-based method is employed for HQ data learning. Meanwhile, for the LQ images which lack identity information, we learn them with self-supervised image-image contrastive learning. To effectively catch up the model update and improve the discriminability of contrastive learning in our joint training scenario, we further propose a proxy-updated real-time queue to compose the contrastive pairs with features from the genuine encoder. Experiments on the low-quality datasets SCface and Tinyface, the mixed-quality dataset IJB-B, and five high-quality datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in recognizing face images of different qualities.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion techniques have shown exceptional capability of producing high-quality images from text descriptions. This indicates that there exists a strong correlation between the visual and textual domains. In addition, text-image discriminative models such as CLIP excel in image labelling from text prompts, thanks to the rich and diverse information available from open concepts. In this paper, we leverage these technical advances to solve a challenging problem in computer vision: camouflaged instance segmentation. Specifically, we propose a method built upon a state-of-the-art diffusion model, empowered by open-vocabulary to learn multi-scale textual-visual features for camouflaged object representations. Such cross-domain representations are desirable in segmenting camouflaged objects where visual cues are subtle to distinguish the objects from the background, especially in segmenting novel objects which are not seen in training. We also develop technically supportive components to effectively fuse cross-domain features and engage relevant features towards respective foreground objects. We validate our method and compare it with existing ones on several benchmark datasets of camouflaged instance segmentation and generic open-vocabulary instance segmentation. Experimental results confirm the advances of our method over existing ones. We will publish our code and pre-trained models to support future research.

- **Summary**: Recent deep-learning-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods have shown impressive performance whereas typical methods train their networks by minimizing the pixel-wise distance with respect to a given high-resolution (HR) image. However, despite the basic training scheme being the predominant choice, its use in the context of ill-posed inverse problems has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we aim to provide a better comprehension of the underlying constituent by decomposing target HR images into two subcomponents: (1) the optimal centroid which is the expectation over multiple potential HR images, and (2) the inherent noise defined as the residual between the HR image and the centroid. Our findings show that the current training scheme cannot capture the ill-posed nature of SISR and becomes vulnerable to the inherent noise term, especially during early training steps. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel optimization method that can effectively remove the inherent noise term in the early steps of vanilla training by estimating the optimal centroid and directly optimizing toward the estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively enhance the stability of vanilla training, leading to overall performance gain. Codes are available at github.com/2minkyulee/ECO.

- **Summary**: Distributed deep learning has recently been attracting more attention in remote sensing (RS) applications due to the challenges posed by the increased amount of open data that are produced daily by Earth observation programs. However, the high communication costs of sending model updates among multiple nodes are a significant bottleneck for scalable distributed learning. Gradient sparsification has been validated as an effective gradient compression (GC) technique for reducing communication costs and thus accelerating the training speed. Existing state-of-the-art gradient sparsification methods are mostly based on the "larger-absolute-more-important" criterion, ignoring the importance of small gradients, which is generally observed to affect the performance. Inspired by informative representation of manifold structures from neighborhood information, we propose a simple yet effective dynamic gradient compression scheme leveraging neighborhood statistics indicator for RS image interpretation, termed RS-DGC. We first enhance the interdependence between gradients by introducing the gradient neighborhood to reduce the effect of random noise. The key component of RS-DGC is a Neighborhood Statistical Indicator (NSI), which can quantify the importance of gradients within a specified neighborhood on each node to sparsify the local gradients before gradient transmission in each iteration. Further, a layer-wise dynamic compression scheme is proposed to track the importance changes of each layer in real time. Extensive downstream tasks validate the superiority of our method in terms of intelligent interpretation of RS images. For example, we achieve an accuracy improvement of 0.51% with more than 50 times communication compression on the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset using VGG-19 network.

- **Summary**: Despite the potential benefits of data augmentation for mitigating the data insufficiency, traditional augmentation methods primarily rely on the prior intra-domain knowledge. On the other hand, advanced generative adversarial networks (GANs) generate inter-domain samples with limited variety. These previous methods make limited contributions to describing the decision boundaries for binary classification. In this paper, we propose a distance guided GAN (DisGAN) which controls the variation degrees of generated samples in the hyperplane space. Specifically, we instantiate the idea of DisGAN by combining two ways. The first way is vertical distance GAN (VerDisGAN) where the inter-domain generation is conditioned on the vertical distances. The second way is horizontal distance GAN (HorDisGAN) where the intra-domain generation is conditioned on the horizontal distances. Furthermore, VerDisGAN can produce the class-specific regions by mapping the source images to the hyperplane. Experimental results show that DisGAN consistently outperforms the GAN-based augmentation methods with explainable binary classification. The proposed method can apply to different classification architectures and has potential to extend to multi-class classification.

- **Summary**: Background: Accurate volumetric assessment of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a labor-intensive task performed with current manual and semiautomatic methods that might be relevant for its clinical and prognostic implications. In the present research, we sought to develop and validate an artificial intelligence-driven, fully automated blood segmentation tool for SAH patients via noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) scans employing a transformer-based Swin UNETR architecture. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed NCCT scans from patients with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) utilizing the Swin UNETR for segmentation. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated against manually segmented ground truth data using metrics such as Dice score, intersection over union (IoU), the volumetric similarity index (VSI), the symmetric average surface distance (SASD), and sensitivity and specificity. A validation cohort from an external institution was included to test the generalizability of the model. Results: The model demonstrated high accuracy with robust performance metrics across the internal and external validation cohorts. Notably, it achieved high Dice coefficient (0.873), IoU (0.810), VSI (0.840), sensitivity (0.821) and specificity (0.996) values and a low SASD (1.866), suggesting proficiency in segmenting blood in SAH patients. The model's efficiency was reflected in its processing speed, indicating potential for real-time applications. Conclusions: Our Swin UNETR-based model offers significant advances in the automated segmentation of blood after aSAH on NCCT images. Despite the computational intensity, the model operates effectively on standard hardware with a user-friendly interface, facilitating broader clinical adoption. Further validation across diverse datasets is warranted to confirm its clinical reliability.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a powerful method for image-based 3D reconstruction, but the lengthy per-scene optimization limits their practical usage, especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches solve this issue by reducing the number of input views and regularizing the learned volumetric representation with either complex losses or additional inputs from other modalities. In this paper, we present KeyNeRF, a simple yet effective method for training NeRF in few-shot scenarios by focusing on key informative rays. Such rays are first selected at camera level by a view selection algorithm that promotes baseline diversity while guaranteeing scene coverage, then at pixel level by sampling from a probability distribution based on local image entropy. Our approach performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods, while requiring minimal changes to existing NeRF codebases.

- **Summary**: The early detection of breast abnormalities is a matter of critical significance. Notably, infrared thermography has emerged as a valuable tool in breast cancer screening and clinical breast examination (CBE). Measuring heterogeneous thermal patterns is the key to incorporating computational dynamic thermography, which can be achieved by matrix factorization techniques. These approaches focus on extracting the predominant thermal patterns from the entire thermal sequence. Yet, the task of singling out the dominant image that effectively represents the prevailing temporal changes remains a challenging pursuit within the field of computational thermography. In this context, we propose applying James-Stein for eigenvector (JSE) and Weibull embedding approaches, as two novel strategies in response to this challenge. The primary objective is to create a low-dimensional (LD) representation of the thermal data stream. This LD approximation serves as the foundation for extracting thermomics and training a classification model with optimized hyperparameters, for early breast cancer detection. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various embedding adjuncts to matrix factorization methods. The results of the proposed method indicate an enhancement in the projection of the predominant basis vector, yielding classification accuracy of 81.7% (+/-5.2%) using Weibull embedding, which outperformed other embedding approaches we proposed previously. In comparison analysis, Sparse PCT and Deep SemiNMF showed the highest accuracies having 80.9% and 78.6%, respectively. These findings suggest that JSE and Weibull embedding techniques substantially help preserve crucial thermal patterns as a biomarker leading to improved CBE and enabling the very early detection of breast cancer.

- **Summary**: Inferring missing regions from severely occluded point clouds is highly challenging. Especially for 3D shapes with rich geometry and structure details, inherent ambiguities of the unknown parts are existing. Existing approaches either learn a one-to-one mapping in a supervised manner or train a generative model to synthesize the missing points for the completion of 3D point cloud shapes. These methods, however, lack the controllability for the completion process and the results are either deterministic or exhibiting uncontrolled diversity. Inspired by the prompt-driven data generation and editing, we propose a novel prompt-guided point cloud completion framework, coined P2M2-Net, to enable more controllable and more diverse shape completion. Given an input partial point cloud and a text prompt describing the part-aware information such as semantics and structure of the missing region, our Transformer-based completion network can efficiently fuse the multimodal features and generate diverse results following the prompt guidance. We train the P2M2-Net on a new large-scale PartNet-Prompt dataset and conduct extensive experiments on two challenging shape completion benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative results show the efficacy of incorporating prompts for more controllable part-aware point cloud completion and generation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we devise a novel lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) design dubbed as Multi-Rate Magnitude Pruning (MRMP) that jointly trains network topology and weights. Our method is variational and proceeds by aligning the weight distribution of the learned networks with an a priori distribution. In the one hand, this allows implementing any fixed pruning rate, and also enhancing the generalization performances of the designed lightweight GCNs. In the other hand, MRMP achieves a joint training of multiple GCNs, on top of shared weights, in order to extrapolate accurate networks at any targeted pruning rate without retraining their weights. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging task of skeleton-based recognition show a substantial gain of our lightweight GCNs particularly at very high pruning regimes.

- **Summary**: The domain of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is of paramount significance within the realm of video analysis. However, both traditional methodologies and deep learning-based approaches within this domain exhibit inherent limitations. Deep learning methods driven exclusively by data exhibit challenges in accurately discerning the motion states of objects, while traditional methods relying on comprehensive mathematical models may suffer from suboptimal tracking precision. To address these challenges, we introduce the Model-Data-Driven Motion-Static Object Tracking Method (MoD2T). We propose a novel architecture that adeptly amalgamates traditional mathematical modeling with deep learning-based MOT frameworks, thereby effectively mitigating the limitations associated with sole reliance on established methodologies or advanced deep learning techniques. MoD2T's fusion of mathematical modeling and deep learning augments the precision of object motion determination, consequently enhancing tracking accuracy. Our empirical experiments robustly substantiate MoD2T's efficacy across a diverse array of scenarios, including UAV aerial surveillance and street-level tracking. To assess MoD2T's proficiency in discerning object motion states, we introduce MVF1 metric. This novel performance metric is designed to measure the accuracy of motion state classification, providing a comprehensive evaluation of MoD2T's performance. Meticulous experiments substantiate the rationale behind MVF1's formulation. To provide a comprehensive assessment of MoD2T's performance, we meticulously annotate diverse datasets and subject MoD2T to rigorous testing. The achieved MVF1 scores, which measure the accuracy of motion state classification, are particularly noteworthy in scenarios marked by minimal or mild camera motion, with values of 0.774 on the KITTI dataset, 0.521 on MOT17, and 0.827 on UAVDT.

- **Summary**: This study aims to explore the complex relationship between perceptual and cognitive interactions in multimodal data analysis,with a specific emphasis on spatial experience design in overseas Chinese gardens. It is found that evaluation content and images on social media can reflect individuals' concerns and sentiment responses, providing a rich data base for cognitive research that contains both sentimental and image-based cognitive information. Leveraging deep learning techniques, we analyze textual and visual data from social media, thereby unveiling the relationship between people's perceptions and sentiment cognition within the context of overseas Chinese gardens. In addition, our study introduces a multi-agent system (MAS)alongside AI agents. Each agent explores the laws of aesthetic cognition through chat scene simulation combined with web search. This study goes beyond the traditional approach of translating perceptions into sentiment scores, allowing for an extension of the research methodology in terms of directly analyzing texts and digging deeper into opinion data. This study provides new perspectives for understanding aesthetic experience and its impact on architecture and landscape design across diverse cultural contexts, which is an essential contribution to the field of cultural communication and aesthetic understanding.

- **Summary**: Visual grounding aims to align visual information of specific regions of images with corresponding natural language expressions. Current visual grounding methods leverage pre-trained visual and language backbones separately to obtain visual features and linguistic features. Although these two types of features are then fused via delicately designed networks, the heterogeneity of the features makes them inapplicable for multi-modal reasoning. This problem arises from the domain gap between the single-modal pre-training backbone used in current visual grounding methods, which can hardly be overcome by the traditional end-to-end training method. To alleviate this, our work proposes an Empowering pre-trained model for Visual Grounding (EpmVG) framework, which distills a multimodal pre-trained model to guide the visual grounding task. EpmVG is based on a novel cross-modal distillation mechanism, which can effectively introduce the consistency information of images and texts in the pre-trained model, to reduce the domain gap existing in the backbone networks, thereby improving the performance of the model in the visual grounding task. Extensive experiments are carried out on five conventionally used datasets, and results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In contrast to extensive studies on general vision, pre-training for scalable visual autonomous driving remains seldom explored. Visual autonomous driving applications require features encompassing semantics, 3D geometry, and temporal information simultaneously for joint perception, prediction, and planning, posing dramatic challenges for pre-training. To resolve this, we bring up a new pre-training task termed as visual point cloud forecasting - predicting future point clouds from historical visual input. The key merit of this task captures the synergic learning of semantics, 3D structures, and temporal dynamics. Hence it shows superiority in various downstream tasks. To cope with this new problem, we present ViDAR, a general model to pre-train downstream visual encoders. It first extracts historical embeddings by the encoder. These representations are then transformed to 3D geometric space via a novel Latent Rendering operator for future point cloud prediction. Experiments show significant gain in downstream tasks, e.g., 3.1% NDS on 3D detection, ~10% error reduction on motion forecasting, and ~15% less collision rate on planning.

- **Summary**: The burgeoning interest in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4V(ision), has significantly impacted both academic and industrial realms. These models enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced visual understanding capabilities, facilitating their application in a variety of multimodal tasks. Recently, Google introduced Gemini, a cutting-edge MLLM designed specifically for multimodal integration. Despite its advancements, preliminary benchmarks indicate that Gemini lags behind GPT models in commonsense reasoning tasks. However, this assessment, based on a limited dataset (i.e., HellaSWAG), does not fully capture Gemini's authentic commonsense reasoning potential. To address this gap, our study undertakes a thorough evaluation of Gemini's performance in complex reasoning tasks that necessitate the integration of commonsense knowledge across modalities. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of 12 commonsense reasoning datasets, ranging from general to domain-specific tasks. This includes 11 datasets focused solely on language, as well as one that incorporates multimodal elements. Our experiments across four LLMs and two MLLMs demonstrate Gemini's competitive commonsense reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we identify common challenges faced by current LLMs and MLLMs in addressing commonsense problems, underscoring the need for further advancements in enhancing the commonsense reasoning abilities of these models.

- **Summary**: As an important component of the detector localization branch, bounding box regression loss plays a significant role in object detection tasks. The existing bounding box regression methods usually consider the geometric relationship between the GT box and the predicted box, and calculate the loss by using the relative position and shape of the bounding boxes, while ignoring the influence of inherent properties such as the shape and scale of the bounding boxes on bounding box regression. In order to make up for the shortcomings of existing research, this article proposes a bounding box regression method that focuses on the shape and scale of the bounding box itself. Firstly, we analyzed the regression characteristics of the bounding boxes and found that the shape and scale factors of the bounding boxes themselves will have an impact on the regression results. Based on the above conclusions, we propose the Shape IoU method, which can calculate the loss by focusing on the shape and scale of the bounding box itself, thereby making the bounding box regression more accurate. Finally, we validated our method through a large number of comparative experiments, which showed that our method can effectively improve detection performance and outperform existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in different detection tasks.Code is available at https://github.com/malagoutou/Shape-IoU

- **Summary**: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is an important network of arteries connecting major circulations of the brain. Its vascular architecture is believed to affect the risk, severity, and clinical outcome of serious neuro-vascular diseases. However, characterizing the highly variable CoW anatomy is still a manual and time-consuming expert task. The CoW is usually imaged by two angiographic imaging modalities, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA), but there exist limited public datasets with annotations on CoW anatomy, especially for CTA. Therefore we organized the TopCoW Challenge in 2023 with the release of an annotated CoW dataset and invited submissions worldwide for the CoW segmentation task, which attracted over 140 registered participants from four continents. TopCoW dataset was the first public dataset with voxel-level annotations for CoW's 13 vessel components, made possible by virtual-reality (VR) technology. It was also the first dataset with paired MRA and CTA from the same patients. TopCoW challenge aimed to tackle the CoW characterization problem as a multiclass anatomical segmentation task with an emphasis on topological metrics. The top performing teams managed to segment many CoW components to Dice scores around 90%, but with lower scores for communicating arteries and rare variants. There were also topological mistakes for predictions with high Dice scores. Additional topological analysis revealed further areas for improvement in detecting certain CoW components and matching CoW variant's topology accurately. TopCoW represented a first attempt at benchmarking the CoW anatomical segmentation task for MRA and CTA, both morphologically and topologically.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have transformed the image-to-image (I2I) synthesis and are now permeating into videos. However, the advancement of video-to-video (V2V) synthesis has been hampered by the challenge of maintaining temporal consistency across video frames. This paper proposes a consistent V2V synthesis framework by jointly leveraging spatial conditions and temporal optical flow clues within the source video. Contrary to prior methods that strictly adhere to optical flow, our approach harnesses its benefits while handling the imperfection in flow estimation. We encode the optical flow via warping from the first frame and serve it as a supplementary reference in the diffusion model. This enables our model for video synthesis by editing the first frame with any prevalent I2I models and then propagating edits to successive frames. Our V2V model, FlowVid, demonstrates remarkable properties: (1) Flexibility: FlowVid works seamlessly with existing I2I models, facilitating various modifications, including stylization, object swaps, and local edits. (2) Efficiency: Generation of a 4-second video with 30 FPS and 512x512 resolution takes only 1.5 minutes, which is 3.1x, 7.2x, and 10.5x faster than CoDeF, Rerender, and TokenFlow, respectively. (3) High-quality: In user studies, our FlowVid is preferred 45.7% of the time, outperforming CoDeF (3.5%), Rerender (10.2%), and TokenFlow (40.4%).

- **Summary**: Action Localization is a challenging problem that combines detection and recognition tasks, which are often addressed separately. State-of-the-art methods rely on off-the-shelf bounding box detections pre-computed at high resolution and propose transformer models that focus on the classification task alone. Such two-stage solutions are prohibitive for real-time deployment. On the other hand, single-stage methods target both tasks by devoting part of the network (generally the backbone) to sharing the majority of the workload, compromising performance for speed. These methods build on adding a DETR head with learnable queries that, after cross- and self-attention can be sent to corresponding MLPs for detecting a person's bounding box and action. However, DETR-like architectures are challenging to train and can incur in big complexity.   In this paper, we observe that a straight bipartite matching loss can be applied to the output tokens of a vision transformer. This results in a backbone + MLP architecture that can do both tasks without the need of an extra encoder-decoder head and learnable queries. We show that a single MViT-S architecture trained with bipartite matching to perform both tasks surpasses the same MViT-S when trained with RoI align on pre-computed bounding boxes. With a careful design of token pooling and the proposed training pipeline, our MViTv2-S model achieves +3 mAP on AVA2.2. w.r.t. the two-stage counterpart. Code and models will be released after paper revision.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel generative model, the Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN), that approximates data distribution using hierarchical discrete distributions. We posit that since the features within a network inherently contain distributional information, liberating the network from a single output to concurrently generate multiple samples proves to be highly effective. Therefore, DDN fits the target distribution, including continuous ones, by generating multiple discrete sample points. To capture finer details of the target data, DDN selects the output that is closest to the Ground Truth (GT) from the coarse results generated in the first layer. This selected output is then fed back into the network as a condition for the second layer, thereby generating new outputs more similar to the GT. As the number of DDN layers increases, the representational space of the outputs expands exponentially, and the generated samples become increasingly similar to the GT. This hierarchical output pattern of discrete distributions endows DDN with two intriguing properties: highly compressed representation and more general zero-shot conditional generation. We demonstrate the efficacy of DDN and these intriguing properties through experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ.

- **Summary**: Recent work on object-centric world models aim to factorize representations in terms of objects in a completely unsupervised or self-supervised manner. Such world models are hypothesized to be a key component to address the generalization problem. While self-supervision has shown improved performance however, OOD generalization has not been systematically and explicitly tested. In this paper, we conduct an extensive study on the generalization properties of contrastive world model. We systematically test the model under a number of different OOD generalization scenarios such as extrapolation to new object attributes, introducing new conjunctions or new attributes. Our experiments show that the contrastive world model fails to generalize under the different OOD tests and the drop in performance depends on the extent to which the samples are OOD. When visualizing the transition updates and convolutional feature maps, we observe that any changes in object attributes (such as previously unseen colors, shapes, or conjunctions of color and shape) breaks down the factorization of object representations. Overall, our work highlights the importance of object-centric representations for generalization and current models are limited in their capacity to learn such representations required for human-level generalization.

- **Summary**: Addressing the uncertainty and variability in the quality of 3D printed metals can further the wide spread use of this technology. Process mapping for new alloys is crucial for determining optimal process parameters that consistently produce acceptable printing quality. Process mapping is typically performed by conventional methods and is used for the design of experiments and ex situ characterization of printed parts. On the other hand, in situ approaches are limited because their observable features are limited and they require complex high-cost setups to obtain temperature measurements to boost accuracy. Our method relaxes these limitations by incorporating the temporal features of molten metal dynamics during laser-metal interactions using video vision transformers and high-speed imaging. Our approach can be used in existing commercial machines and can provide in situ process maps for efficient defect and variability quantification. The generalizability of the approach is demonstrated by performing cross-dataset evaluations on alloys with different compositions and intrinsic thermofluid properties.

- **Summary**: Statistical Shape Modeling (SSM) is a quantitative method for analyzing morphological variations in anatomical structures. These analyses often necessitate building models on targeted anatomical regions of interest to focus on specific morphological features. We propose an extension to \particle-based shape modeling (PSM), a widely used SSM framework, to allow shape modeling to arbitrary regions of interest. Existing methods to define regions of interest are computationally expensive and have topological limitations. To address these shortcomings, we use mesh fields to define free-form constraints, which allow for delimiting arbitrary regions of interest on shape surfaces. Furthermore, we add a quadratic penalty method to the model optimization to enable computationally efficient enforcement of any combination of cutting-plane and free-form constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a challenging synthetic dataset and two medical datasets.

- **Summary**: Re-identifying participants in ultra-distance running competitions can be daunting due to the extensive distances and constantly changing terrain. To overcome these challenges, computer vision techniques have been developed to analyze runners' faces, numbers on their bibs, and clothing. However, our study presents a novel gait-based approach for runners' re-identification (re-ID) by leveraging various pre-trained human action recognition (HAR) models and loss functions. Our results show that this approach provides promising results for re-identifying runners in ultra-distance competitions. Furthermore, we investigate the significance of distinct human body movements when athletes are approaching their endurance limits and their potential impact on re-ID accuracy. Our study examines how the recognition of a runner's gait is affected by a competition's critical point (CP), defined as a moment of severe fatigue and the point where the finish line comes into view, just a few kilometers away from this location. We aim to determine how this CP can improve the accuracy of athlete re-ID. Our experimental results demonstrate that gait recognition can be significantly enhanced (up to a 9% increase in mAP) as athletes approach this point. This highlights the potential of utilizing gait recognition in real-world scenarios, such as ultra-distance competitions or long-duration surveillance tasks.

- **Summary**: The recent progress in language-based open-vocabulary object detection can be largely attributed to finding better ways of leveraging large-scale data with free-form text annotations. Training such models with a discriminative objective function has proven successful, but requires good positive and negative samples. However, the free-form nature and the open vocabulary of object descriptions make the space of negatives extremely large. Prior works randomly sample negatives or use rule-based techniques to build them. In contrast, we propose to leverage the vast knowledge built into modern generative models to automatically build negatives that are more relevant to the original data. Specifically, we use large-language-models to generate negative text descriptions, and text-to-image diffusion models to also generate corresponding negative images. Our experimental analysis confirms the relevance of the generated negative data, and its use in language-based detectors improves performance on two complex benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Compressing a predefined deep neural network (DNN) into a compact sub-network with competitive performance is crucial in the efficient machine learning realm. This topic spans various techniques, from structured pruning to neural architecture search, encompassing both pruning and erasing operators perspectives. Despite advancements, existing methods suffers from complex, multi-stage processes that demand substantial engineering and domain knowledge, limiting their broader applications. We introduce the third-generation Only-Train-Once (OTOv3), which first automatically trains and compresses a general DNN through pruning and erasing operations, creating a compact and competitive sub-network without the need of fine-tuning. OTOv3 simplifies and automates the training and compression process, minimizes the engineering efforts required from users. It offers key technological advancements: (i) automatic search space construction for general DNNs based on dependency graph analysis; (ii) Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG) and its enhanced version with hierarchical search (H2SPG) to reliably solve (hierarchical) structured sparsity problems and ensure sub-network validity; and (iii) automated sub-network construction using solutions from DHSPG/H2SPG and dependency graphs. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of OTOv3 across various benchmarks in structured pruning and neural architecture search. OTOv3 produces sub-networks that match or exceed the state-of-the-arts. The source code will be available at https://github.com/tianyic/only_train_once.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the focus on anomaly detection and localization in industrial inspection tasks has intensified. While existing studies have demonstrated impressive outcomes, they often rely heavily on extensive training datasets or robust features extracted from pre-trained models trained on diverse datasets like ImageNet. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging the visual-linguistic CLIP model to adeptly train a backbone model tailored to the manufacturing domain. Our approach concurrently considers visual and text-aligned embedding spaces for normal and abnormal conditions. The resulting pre-trained backbone markedly enhances performance in industrial downstream tasks, particularly in anomaly detection and localization. Notably, this improvement is substantiated through experiments conducted on multiple datasets such as MVTecAD, BTAD, and KSDD2. Furthermore, using our pre-trained backbone weights allows previous works to achieve superior performance in few-shot scenarios with less training data. The proposed anomaly backbone provides a foundation model for more precise anomaly detection and localization.

- **Summary**: In response to the rapidly evolving nature of adversarial attacks on a monthly basis, numerous defenses have been proposed to generalize against as many known attacks as possible. However, designing a defense method that can generalize to all types of attacks, including unseen ones, is not realistic because the environment in which defense systems operate is dynamic and comprises various unique attacks used by many attackers. The defense system needs to upgrade itself by utilizing few-shot defense feedback and efficient memory. Therefore, we propose the first continual adversarial defense (CAD) framework that adapts to any attacks in a dynamic scenario, where various attacks emerge stage by stage. In practice, CAD is modeled under four principles: (1) continual adaptation to new attacks without catastrophic forgetting, (2) few-shot adaptation, (3) memory-efficient adaptation, and (4) high accuracy on both clean and adversarial images. We leverage cutting-edge continual learning, few-shot learning, and ensemble learning techniques to qualify the principles. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 validate the effectiveness of our approach against multiple stages of 10 modern adversarial attacks and significant improvements over 10 baseline methods. In particular, CAD is capable of quickly adapting with minimal feedback and a low cost of defense failure, while maintaining good performance against old attacks. Our research sheds light on a brand-new paradigm for continual defense adaptation against dynamic and evolving attacks.

- **Summary**: While recent test-time adaptations exhibit efficacy by adjusting batch normalization to narrow domain disparities, their effectiveness diminishes with realistic mini-batches due to inaccurate target estimation. As previous attempts merely introduce source statistics to mitigate this issue, the fundamental problem of inaccurate target estimation still persists, leaving the intrinsic test-time domain shifts unresolved. This paper delves into the problem of mini-batch degradation. By unraveling batch normalization, we discover that the inexact target statistics largely stem from the substantially reduced class diversity in batch. Drawing upon this insight, we introduce a straightforward tool, Test-time Exponential Moving Average (TEMA), to bridge the class diversity gap between training and testing batches. Importantly, our TEMA adaptively extends the scope of typical methods beyond the current batch to incorporate a diverse set of class information, which in turn boosts an accurate target estimation. Built upon this foundation, we further design a novel layer-wise rectification strategy to consistently promote test-time performance. Our proposed method enjoys a unique advantage as it requires neither training nor tuning parameters, offering a truly hassle-free solution. It significantly enhances model robustness against shifted domains and maintains resilience in diverse real-world scenarios with various batch sizes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several major benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), has grabbed significant attention in the field of computer vision. This project focuses on the application of GAN in image deblurring with the aim of generating clearer images from blurry inputs caused by factors such as motion blur. However, traditional image restoration techniques have limitations in handling complex blurring patterns. Hence, a GAN-based framework is proposed as a solution to generate high-quality deblurred images. The project defines a GAN model in Tensorflow and trains it with GoPRO dataset. The Generator will intake blur images directly to create fake images to convince the Discriminator which will receive clear images at the same time and distinguish between the real image and the fake image. After obtaining the trained parameters, the model was used to deblur motion-blur images taken in daily life as well as testing set for validation. The result shows that the pretrained network of GAN can obtain sharper pixels in image, achieving an average of 29.3 Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and 0.72 Structural Similarity Assessment (SSIM). This help to effectively address the challenges posed by image blurring, leading to the generation of visually pleasing and sharp images. By exploiting the adversarial learning framework, the proposed approach enhances the potential for real-world applications in image restoration.

- **Summary**: Motion prediction is a crucial task in autonomous driving, and one of its major challenges lands in the multimodality of future behaviors. Many successful works have utilized mixture models which require identification of positive mixture components, and correspondingly fall into two main lines: prediction-based and anchor-based matching. The prediction clustering phenomenon in prediction-based matching makes it difficult to pick representative trajectories for downstream tasks, while the anchor-based matching suffers from a limited regression capability. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm, named Evolving and Distinct Anchors (EDA), to define the positive and negative components for multimodal motion prediction based on mixture models. We enable anchors to evolve and redistribute themselves under specific scenes for an enlarged regression capacity. Furthermore, we select distinct anchors before matching them with the ground truth, which results in impressive scoring performance. Our approach enhances all metrics compared to the baseline MTR, particularly with a notable relative reduction of 13.5% in Miss Rate, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

- **Summary**: Text-video retrieval, a prominent sub-field within the broader domain of multimedia content management, has witnessed remarkable growth and innovation over the past decade. However, existing methods assume the video scenes are consistent and the description annotators are unbiased. These limitations fail to align with fluid real-world scenarios, and descriptions can be influenced by annotator biases, diverse writing styles, and varying textual perspectives. To overcome the aforementioned problems, we introduce WAVER, a cross-domain knowledge distillation mechanism designed to tackle the challenge of handling writing-style agnostics. WAVER capitalizes on the open-vocabulary properties inherent in pre-trained vision-language models and employs an implicit knowledge distillation approach to transfer text-based knowledge from a teacher model to a vision-based student. Empirical studies conducted across four standard benchmark datasets, encompassing various settings, provide compelling evidence that \WAVER can achieve state-of-the-art performance in text-video retrieval tasks while handling writing-style variations.

- **Summary**: Image reconstruction from radio-frequency data is pivotal in ultrafast plane wave ultrasound imaging. Unlike the conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) technique, which relies on somewhat imprecise assumptions, deep learning-based methods perform image reconstruction by training on paired data, leading to a notable enhancement in image quality. Nevertheless, these strategies often exhibit limited generalization capabilities. Recently, denoising diffusion models have become the preferred paradigm for image reconstruction tasks. However, their reliance on an iterative sampling procedure results in prolonged generation time. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling framework that concurrently enforces data consistency of ultrasound signals and data-driven priors. By leveraging the advanced diffusion model, the generation of high-quality images is substantially expedited. Experimental evaluations on an in-vivo dataset indicate that our approach with a single plane wave surpasses DAS with spatial coherent compounding of 75 plane waves.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction of ultrasound (US) images from radio-frequency data can be conceptualized as a linear inverse problem. Traditional deep learning approaches, which aim to improve the quality of US images by directly learning priors, often encounter challenges in generalization. Recently, diffusion-based generative models have received significant attention within the research community due to their robust performance in image reconstruction tasks. However, a limitation of these models is their inherent low speed in generating image samples from pure Gaussian noise progressively. In this study, we exploit the inherent similarity between the US images reconstructed from a single plane wave (PW) and PW compounding PWC). We hypothesize that a single PW can take a shortcut to reach the diffusion trajectory of PWC, removing the need to begin with Gaussian noise. By employing an advanced diffusion model, we demonstrate its effectiveness in US image reconstruction, achieving a substantial reduction in sampling steps. In-vivo experimental results indicate that our approach can reduce sampling steps by 60%, while preserving comparable performance metrics with the conventional diffusion model.

- **Summary**: In Autonomous Driving (AD), real-time perception is a critical component responsible for detecting surrounding objects to ensure safe driving. While researchers have extensively explored the integrity of AD perception due to its safety and security implications, the aspect of availability (real-time performance) or latency has received limited attention. Existing works on latency-based attack have focused mainly on object detection, i.e., a component in camera-based AD perception, overlooking the entire camera-based AD perception, which hinders them to achieve effective system-level effects, such as vehicle crashes. In this paper, we propose SlowTrack, a novel framework for generating adversarial attacks to increase the execution time of camera-based AD perception. We propose a novel two-stage attack strategy along with the three new loss function designs. Our evaluation is conducted on four popular camera-based AD perception pipelines, and the results demonstrate that SlowTrack significantly outperforms existing latency-based attacks while maintaining comparable imperceptibility levels. Furthermore, we perform the evaluation on Baidu Apollo, an industry-grade full-stack AD system, and LGSVL, a production-grade AD simulator, with two scenarios to compare the system-level effects of SlowTrack and existing attacks. Our evaluation results show that the system-level effects can be significantly improved, i.e., the vehicle crash rate of SlowTrack is around 95% on average while existing works only have around 30%.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper presents DriveTrack, a new benchmark and data generation framework for long-range keypoint tracking in real-world videos. DriveTrack is motivated by the observation that the accuracy of state-of-the-art trackers depends strongly on visual attributes around the selected keypoints, such as texture and lighting. The problem is that these artifacts are especially pronounced in real-world videos, but these trackers are unable to train on such scenes due to a dearth of annotations. DriveTrack bridges this gap by building a framework to automatically annotate point tracks on autonomous driving datasets. We release a dataset consisting of 1 billion point tracks across 24 hours of video, which is seven orders of magnitude greater than prior real-world benchmarks and on par with the scale of synthetic benchmarks. DriveTrack unlocks new use cases for point tracking in real-world videos. First, we show that fine-tuning keypoint trackers on DriveTrack improves accuracy on real-world scenes by up to 7%. Second, we analyze the sensitivity of trackers to visual artifacts in real scenes and motivate the idea of running assistive keypoint selectors alongside trackers.

- **Summary**: The optical flow guidance strategy is ideal for obtaining motion information of objects in the video. It is widely utilized in video segmentation tasks. However, existing optical flow-based methods have a significant dependency on optical flow, which results in poor performance when the optical flow estimation fails for a particular scene. The temporal consistency provided by the optical flow could be effectively supplemented by modeling in a structural form. This paper proposes a new hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) architecture, dubbed hierarchical graph pattern understanding (HGPU), for zero-shot video object segmentation (ZS-VOS). Inspired by the strong ability of GNNs in capturing structural relations, HGPU innovatively leverages motion cues (\ie, optical flow) to enhance the high-order representations from the neighbors of target frames. Specifically, a hierarchical graph pattern encoder with message aggregation is introduced to acquire different levels of motion and appearance features in a sequential manner. Furthermore, a decoder is designed for hierarchically parsing and understanding the transformed multi-modal contexts to achieve more accurate and robust results. HGPU achieves state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available benchmarks (DAVIS-16, YouTube-Objects, Long-Videos and DAVIS-17).

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This report describes the solution that secured the first place in the "View Synthesis Challenge for Human Heads (VSCHH)" at the ICCV 2023 workshop. Given the sparse view images of human heads, the objective of this challenge is to synthesize images from novel viewpoints. Due to the complexity of textures on the face and the impact of lighting, the baseline method TensoRF yields results with significant artifacts, seriously affecting facial reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose TI-Face, which improves facial reconstruction through tensorial radiance fields (T-Face) and implicit surfaces (I-Face), respectively. Specifically, we employ an SAM-based approach to obtain the foreground mask, thereby filtering out intense lighting in the background. Additionally, we design mask-based constraints and sparsity constraints to eliminate rendering artifacts effectively. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed improvements and superior performance of our method on face reconstruction. The code will be available at https://github.com/RuijieZhu94/TI-Face.

- **Summary**: Explainability is key to enhancing artificial intelligence's trustworthiness in medicine. However, several issues remain concerning the actual benefit of explainable models for clinical decision-making. Firstly, there is a lack of consensus on an evaluation framework for quantitatively assessing the practical benefits that effective explainability should provide to practitioners. Secondly, physician-centered evaluations of explainability are limited. Thirdly, the utility of built-in attention mechanisms in transformer-based models as an explainability technique is unclear. We hypothesize that superior attention maps should align with the information that physicians focus on, potentially reducing prediction uncertainty and increasing model reliability. We employed a multimodal transformer to predict lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer using clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging, exploring how well attention maps, visualized through a state-of-the-art technique, can achieve agreement with physician understanding. We estimated the model's uncertainty using meta-level information like prediction probability variance and quantified agreement. Our assessment of whether this agreement reduces uncertainty found no significant effect. In conclusion, this case study did not confirm the anticipated benefit of attention maps in enhancing model reliability. Superficial explanations could do more harm than good by misleading physicians into relying on uncertain predictions, suggesting that the current state of attention mechanisms in explainability should not be overestimated. Identifying explainability mechanisms truly beneficial for clinical decision-making remains essential.

- **Summary**: The introduction of large, foundational models to computer vision has led to drastically improved performance on the task of semantic segmentation. However, these existing methods exhibit a large performance drop when testing on images degraded by weather conditions such as rain, fog, or snow. We introduce a general paired-training method that can be applied to all current foundational model architectures that leads to improved performance on images in adverse weather conditions. To this end, we create the WeatherProof Dataset, the first semantic segmentation dataset with accurate clear and adverse weather image pairs, which not only enables our new training paradigm, but also improves the evaluation of the performance gap between clear and degraded segmentation. We find that training on these paired clear and adverse weather frames which share an underlying scene results in improved performance on adverse weather data. With this knowledge, we propose a training pipeline which accentuates the advantages of paired-data training using consistency losses and language guidance, which leads to performance improvements by up to 18.4% as compared to standard training procedures.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present AEGIS-Net, a novel indoor place recognition model that takes in RGB point clouds and generates global place descriptors by aggregating lower-level color, geometry features and higher-level implicit semantic features. However, rather than simple feature concatenation, self-attention modules are employed to select the most important local features that best describe an indoor place. Our AEGIS-Net is made of a semantic encoder, a semantic decoder and an attention-guided feature embedding. The model is trained in a 2-stage process with the first stage focusing on an auxiliary semantic segmentation task and the second one on the place recognition task. We evaluate our AEGIS-Net on the ScanNetPR dataset and compare its performance with a pre-deep-learning feature-based method and five state-of-the-art deep-learning-based methods. Our AEGIS-Net achieves exceptional performance and outperforms all six methods.

- **Summary**: Video motion magnification amplifies invisible small motions to be perceptible, which provides humans with spatially dense and holistic understanding about small motions from the scene of interest. This is based on the premise that magnifying small motions enhances the legibility of the motion. In the real world, however, vibrating objects often possess complex systems, having complex natural frequencies, modes, and directions. Existing motion magnification often fails to improve the legibility since the intricate motions still retain complex characteristics even when magnified, which distracts us from analyzing them. In this work, we focus on improving the legibility by proposing a new concept, axial motion magnification, which magnifies decomposed motions along the user-specified direction. Axial motion magnification can be applied to various applications where motions of specific axes are critical, by providing simplified and easily readable motion information. We propose a novel learning-based axial motion magnification method with the Motion Separation Module that enables to disentangle and magnify the motion representation along axes of interest. Further, we build a new synthetic training dataset for the axial motion magnification task. Our proposed method improves the legibility of resulting motions along certain axes, while adding additional user controllability. Our method can be directly adopted to the generic motion magnification and achieves favorable performance against competing methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, despite the unprecedented success of large pre-trained visual-language models (VLMs) on a wide range of downstream tasks, the real-world unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem is still not well explored. Therefore, in this paper, we first experimentally demonstrate that the unsupervised-trained VLMs can significantly reduce the distribution discrepancy between source and target domains, thereby improving the performance of UDA. However, a major challenge for directly deploying such models on downstream UDA tasks is prompt engineering, which requires aligning the domain knowledge of source and target domains, since the performance of UDA is severely influenced by a good domain-invariant representation. We further propose a Prompt-based Distribution Alignment (PDA) method to incorporate the domain knowledge into prompt learning. Specifically, PDA employs a two-branch prompt-tuning paradigm, namely base branch and alignment branch. The base branch focuses on integrating class-related representation into prompts, ensuring discrimination among different classes. To further minimize domain discrepancy, for the alignment branch, we construct feature banks for both the source and target domains and propose image-guided feature tuning (IFT) to make the input attend to feature banks, which effectively integrates self-enhanced and cross-domain features into the model. In this way, these two branches can be mutually promoted to enhance the adaptation of VLMs for UDA. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarks to demonstrate that our proposed PDA achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: As physical adversarial attacks become extensively applied in unearthing the potential risk of security-critical scenarios, especially in autonomous driving, their vulnerability to environmental changes has also been brought to light. The non-robust nature of physical adversarial attack methods brings less-than-stable performance consequently. To enhance the robustness of physical adversarial attacks in the real world, instead of statically optimizing a robust adversarial example via an off-line training manner like the existing methods, this paper proposes a brand new robust adversarial attack framework: Embodied Adversarial Attack (EAA) from the perspective of dynamic adaptation, which aims to employ the paradigm of embodied intelligence: Perception-Decision-Control to dynamically adjust the optimal attack strategy according to the current situations in real time. For the perception module, given the challenge of needing simulation for the victim's viewpoint, EAA innovatively devises a Perspective Transformation Network to estimate the target's transformation from the attacker's perspective. For the decision and control module, EAA adopts the laser-a highly manipulable medium to implement physical attacks, and further trains an attack agent with reinforcement learning to make it capable of instantaneously determining the best attack strategy based on the perceived information. Finally, we apply our framework to the autonomous driving scenario. A variety of experiments verify the high effectiveness of our method under complex scenes.

- **Summary**: Compared with transferable untargeted attacks, transferable targeted adversarial attacks could specify the misclassification categories of adversarial samples, posing a greater threat to security-critical tasks. In the meanwhile, 3D adversarial samples, due to their potential of multi-view robustness, can more comprehensively identify weaknesses in existing deep learning systems, possessing great application value. However, the field of transferable targeted 3D adversarial attacks remains vacant. The goal of this work is to develop a more effective technique that could generate transferable targeted 3D adversarial examples, filling the gap in this field. To achieve this goal, we design a novel framework named TT3D that could rapidly reconstruct from few multi-view images into Transferable Targeted 3D textured meshes. While existing mesh-based texture optimization methods compute gradients in the high-dimensional mesh space and easily fall into local optima, leading to unsatisfactory transferability and distinct distortions, TT3D innovatively performs dual optimization towards both feature grid and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) parameters in the grid-based NeRF space, which significantly enhances black-box transferability while enjoying naturalness. Experimental results show that TT3D not only exhibits superior cross-model transferability but also maintains considerable adaptability across different renders and vision tasks. More importantly, we produce 3D adversarial examples with 3D printing techniques in the real world and verify their robust performance under various scenarios.

- **Summary**: We address the challenge of generating 3D articulated objects in a controllable fashion. Currently, modeling articulated 3D objects is either achieved through laborious manual authoring, or using methods from prior work that are hard to scale and control directly. We leverage the interplay between part shape, connectivity, and motion using a denoising diffusion-based method with attention modules designed to extract correlations between part attributes. Our method takes an object category label and a part connectivity graph as input and generates an object's geometry and motion parameters. The generated objects conform to user-specified constraints on the object category, part shape, and part articulation. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in articulated object generation, producing more realistic objects while conforming better to user constraints.

- **Summary**: Radiation therapy is a primary and effective NasoPharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) treatment strategy. The precise delineation of Gross Tumor Volumes (GTVs) and Organs-At-Risk (OARs) is crucial in radiation treatment, directly impacting patient prognosis. Previously, the delineation of GTVs and OARs was performed by experienced radiation oncologists. Recently, deep learning has achieved promising results in many medical image segmentation tasks. However, for NPC OARs and GTVs segmentation, few public datasets are available for model development and evaluation. To alleviate this problem, the SegRap2023 challenge was organized in conjunction with MICCAI2023 and presented a large-scale benchmark for OAR and GTV segmentation with 400 Computed Tomography (CT) scans from 200 NPC patients, each with a pair of pre-aligned non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT scans. The challenge's goal was to segment 45 OARs and 2 GTVs from the paired CT scans. In this paper, we detail the challenge and analyze the solutions of all participants. The average Dice similarity coefficient scores for all submissions ranged from 76.68\% to 86.70\%, and 70.42\% to 73.44\% for OARs and GTVs, respectively. We conclude that the segmentation of large-size OARs is well-addressed, and more efforts are needed for GTVs and small-size or thin-structure OARs. The benchmark will remain publicly available here: https://segrap2023.grand-challenge.org

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Segment anything model (SAM) addresses two practical yet challenging segmentation tasks: \textbf{segment anything (SegAny)}, which utilizes a certain point to predict the mask for a single object of interest, and \textbf{segment everything (SegEvery)}, which predicts the masks for all objects on the image. What makes SegAny slow for SAM is its heavyweight image encoder, which has been addressed by MobileSAM via decoupled knowledge distillation. The efficiency bottleneck of SegEvery with SAM, however, lies in its mask decoder because it needs to first generate numerous masks with redundant grid-search prompts and then perform filtering to obtain the final valid masks. We propose to improve its efficiency by directly generating the final masks with only valid prompts, which can be obtained through object discovery. Our proposed approach not only helps reduce the total time on the mask decoder by at least 16 times but also achieves superior performance. Specifically, our approach yields an average performance boost of 3.6\% (42.5\% \textit{v.s.} 38.9\%) for zero-shot object proposal on the LVIS dataset with the mask AR@$K$ metric. Qualitative results show that our approach generates fine-grained masks while avoiding over-segmenting things. This project targeting faster SegEvery than the original SAM is termed MobileSAMv2 to differentiate from MobileSAM which targets faster SegAny. Moreover, we demonstrate that our new prompt sampling is also compatible with the distilled image encoders in MobileSAM, contributing to a unified framework for efficient SegAny and SegEvery.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the task of weakly-supervised object localization. The goal is to learn object localization using only image-level class labels, which are much easier to obtain compared to bounding box annotations. This task is important because it reduces the need for labor-intensive ground-truth annotations. However, methods for object localization trained using weak supervision often suffer from limited accuracy in localization. To address this challenge and enhance localization accuracy, we propose a multiscale object localization transformer (MOLT). It comprises multiple object localization transformers that extract patch embeddings across various scales. Moreover, we introduce a deep clustering-guided refinement method that further enhances localization accuracy by utilizing separately extracted image segments. These segments are obtained by clustering pixels using convolutional neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by conducting experiments on the publicly available ILSVRC-2012 dataset.

- **Summary**: Cross-domain few-shot classification (CDFSC) is a challenging and tough task due to the significant distribution discrepancies across different domains. To address this challenge, many approaches aim to learn transferable representations. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) has shown its capability to learn transferable representations in various downstream tasks, such as unsupervised image classification and supervised concept generalization. However, its potential in the few-shot settings has yet to be comprehensively explored. In this study, we investigate the potential of MLP to assist in addressing the challenges of CDFSC. Specifically, we introduce three distinct frameworks incorporating MLP in accordance with three types of few-shot classification methods to verify the effectiveness of MLP. We reveal that MLP can significantly enhance discriminative capabilities and alleviate distribution shifts, which can be supported by our expensive experiments involving 10 baseline models and 12 benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our method even compares favorably against other state-of-the-art CDFSC algorithms.

- **Summary**: Active domain adaptation has emerged as a solution to balance the expensive annotation cost and the performance of trained models in semantic segmentation. However, existing works usually ignore the correlation between selected samples and its local context in feature space, which leads to inferior usage of annotation budgets. In this work, we revisit the theoretical bound of the classical Core-set method and identify that the performance is closely related to the local sample distribution around selected samples. To estimate the density of local samples efficiently, we introduce a local proxy estimator with Dynamic Masked Convolution and develop a Density-aware Greedy algorithm to optimize the bound. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Moreover, with very few labels, our scheme achieves comparable performance to the fully supervised counterpart.

- **Summary**: Due to the advantages of leveraging unlabeled data and learning meaningful representations, semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning have been progressively combined to achieve better performances in popular applications with few labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. One common manner is assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples and selecting positive and negative samples from pseudo-labeled samples to apply contrastive learning. However, the real-world data may be imbalanced, causing pseudo-labels to be biased toward the majority classes and further undermining the effectiveness of contrastive learning. To address the challenge, we propose Contrastive Learning with Augmented Features (CLAF). We design a class-dependent feature augmentation module to alleviate the scarcity of minority class samples in contrastive learning. For each pseudo-labeled sample, we select positive and negative samples from labeled data instead of unlabeled data to compute contrastive loss. Comprehensive experiments on imbalanced image classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CLAF in the context of imbalanced semi-supervised learning.

- **Summary**: One of the key components within diffusion models is the UNet for noise prediction. While several works have explored basic properties of the UNet decoder, its encoder largely remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of the UNet encoder. We empirically analyze the encoder features and provide insights to important questions regarding their changes at the inference process. In particular, we find that encoder features change gently, whereas the decoder features exhibit substantial variations across different time-steps. This finding inspired us to omit the encoder at certain adjacent time-steps and reuse cyclically the encoder features in the previous time-steps for the decoder. Further based on this observation, we introduce a simple yet effective encoder propagation scheme to accelerate the diffusion sampling for a diverse set of tasks. By benefiting from our propagation scheme, we are able to perform in parallel the decoder at certain adjacent time-steps. Additionally, we introduce a prior noise injection method to improve the texture details in the generated image. Besides the standard text-to-image task, we also validate our approach on other tasks: text-to-video, personalized generation and reference-guided generation. Without utilizing any knowledge distillation technique, our approach accelerates both the Stable Diffusion (SD) and the DeepFloyd-IF models sampling by 41$\%$ and 24$\%$ respectively, while maintaining high-quality generation performance.

- **Summary**: Great progress has been made in learning-based object detection methods in the last decade. Two-stage detectors often have higher detection accuracy than one-stage detectors, due to the use of region of interest (RoI) feature extractors which extract transformation-invariant RoI features for different RoI proposals, making refinement of bounding boxes and prediction of object categories more robust and accurate. However, previous RoI feature extractors can only extract invariant features under limited transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel RoI feature extractor, termed Semantic RoI Align (SRA), which is capable of extracting invariant RoI features under a variety of transformations for two-stage detectors. Specifically, we propose a semantic attention module to adaptively determine different sampling areas by leveraging the global and local semantic relationship within the RoI. We also propose a Dynamic Feature Sampler which dynamically samples features based on the RoI aspect ratio to enhance the efficiency of SRA, and a new position embedding, \ie Area Embedding, to provide more accurate position information for SRA through an improved sampling area representation. Experiments show that our model significantly outperforms baseline models with slight computational overhead. In addition, it shows excellent generalization ability and can be used to improve performance with various state-of-the-art backbones and detection methods.

- **Summary**: Multi-spectral object Re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve specific objects by leveraging complementary information from different image spectra. It delivers great advantages over traditional single-spectral ReID in complex visual environment. However, the significant distribution gap among different image spectra poses great challenges for effective multi-spectral feature representations. In addition, most of current Transformer-based ReID methods only utilize the global feature of class tokens to achieve the holistic retrieval, ignoring the local discriminative ones. To address the above issues, we step further to utilize all the tokens of Transformers and propose a cyclic token permutation framework for multi-spectral object ReID, dubbled TOP-ReID. More specifically, we first deploy a multi-stream deep network based on vision Transformers to preserve distinct information from different image spectra. Then, we propose a Token Permutation Module (TPM) for cyclic multi-spectral feature aggregation. It not only facilitates the spatial feature alignment across different image spectra, but also allows the class token of each spectrum to perceive the local details of other spectra. Meanwhile, we propose a Complementary Reconstruction Module (CRM), which introduces dense token-level reconstruction constraints to reduce the distribution gap across different image spectra. With the above modules, our proposed framework can generate more discriminative multi-spectral features for robust object ReID. Extensive experiments on three ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100 and MSVR310) verify the effectiveness of our methods. The code is available at https://github.com/924973292/TOP-ReID.

- **Summary**: Learning to ground natural language queries to target objects or regions in 3D point clouds is quite essential for 3D scene understanding. Nevertheless, existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{3D-VLA}, a weakly supervised approach for \textbf{3D} visual grounding based on \textbf{V}isual \textbf{L}inguistic \textbf{A}lignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Large-scale language-image pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP) have shown superior performances on many cross-modal retrieval tasks. However, the problem of transferring the knowledge learned from such models to video-based person re-identification (ReID) has barely been explored. In addition, there is a lack of decent text descriptions in current ReID benchmarks. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a novel one-stage text-free CLIP-based learning framework named TF-CLIP for video-based person ReID. More specifically, we extract the identity-specific sequence feature as the CLIP-Memory to replace the text feature. Meanwhile, we design a Sequence-Specific Prompt (SSP) module to update the CLIP-Memory online. To capture temporal information, we further propose a Temporal Memory Diffusion (TMD) module, which consists of two key components: Temporal Memory Construction (TMC) and Memory Diffusion (MD). Technically, TMC allows the frame-level memories in a sequence to communicate with each other, and to extract temporal information based on the relations within the sequence. MD further diffuses the temporal memories to each token in the original features to obtain more robust sequence features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method shows much better results than other state-of-the-art methods on MARS, LS-VID and iLIDS-VID.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering is gaining considerable attention owing to recent methods that overcome the inefficiency and misleading results from the absence of supervised information. Contrastive learning methods excel at existing pixel level and super pixel level HSI clustering tasks. The pixel-level contrastive learning method can effectively improve the ability of the model to capture fine features of HSI but requires a large time overhead. The super pixel-level contrastive learning method utilizes the homogeneity of HSI and reduces computing resources; however, it yields rough classification results. To exploit the strengths of both methods, we present a pixel super pixel contrastive learning and pseudo-label correction (PSCPC) method for the HSI clustering. PSCPC can reasonably capture domain-specific and fine-grained features through super pixels and the comparative learning of a small number of pixels within the super pixels. To improve the clustering performance of super pixels, this paper proposes a pseudo-label correction module that aligns the clustering pseudo-labels of pixels and super-pixels. In addition, pixel-level clustering results are used to supervise super pixel-level clustering, improving the generalization ability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PSCPC.

- **Summary**: Recovering detailed interactions between humans/hands and objects is an appealing yet challenging task. Existing methods typically use template-based representations to track human/hand and objects in interactions. Despite the progress, they fail to handle the invisible contact surfaces. In this paper, we propose Ins-HOI, an end-to-end solution to recover human/hand-object reconstruction via instance-level implicit reconstruction. To this end, we introduce an instance-level occupancy field to support simultaneous human/hand and object representation, and a complementary training strategy to handle the lack of instance-level ground truths. Such a representation enables learning a contact prior implicitly from sparse observations. During the complementary training, we augment the real-captured data with synthesized data by randomly composing individual scans of humans/hands and objects and intentionally allowing for penetration. In this way, our network learns to recover individual shapes as completely as possible from the synthesized data, while being aware of the contact constraints and overall reasonability based on real-captured scans. As demonstrated in experiments, our method Ins-HOI can produce reasonable and realistic non-visible contact surfaces even in cases of extremely close interaction. To facilitate the research of this task, we collect a large-scale, high-fidelity 3D scan dataset, including 5.2k high-quality scans with real-world human-chair and hand-object interactions. We will release our dataset and source codes. Data examples and the video results of our method can be found on the project page.

- **Summary**: Robot calligraphy is an emerging exploration of artificial intelligence in the fields of art and education. Traditional calligraphy generation researches mainly focus on methods such as tool-based image processing, generative models, and style transfer. Unlike the English alphabet, the number of Chinese characters is tens of thousands, which leads to difficulties in the generation of a style consistent Chinese calligraphic font with over 6000 characters. Due to the lack of high-quality data sets, formal definitions of calligraphy knowledge, and scientific art evaluation methods, The results generated are frequently of low quality and falls short of professional-level requirements. To address the above problem, this paper proposes an automatic calligraphy generation model based on deep generative adversarial networks (deepGAN) that can generate style calligraphy fonts with professional standards. The key highlights of the proposed method include: (1) The datasets use a high-precision calligraphy synthesis method to ensure its high quality and sufficient quantity; (2) Professional calligraphers are invited to conduct a series of Turing tests to evaluate the gap between model generation results and human artistic level; (3) Experimental results indicate that the proposed model is the state-of-the-art among current calligraphy generation methods. The Turing tests and similarity evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction in traffic scenes involves accurately forecasting the behaviour of surrounding vehicles. To achieve this objective it is crucial to consider contextual information, including the driving path of vehicles, road topology, lane dividers, and traffic rules. Although studies demonstrated the potential of leveraging heterogeneous context for improving trajectory prediction, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches still rely on a limited subset of this information. This is mainly due to the limited availability of comprehensive representations. This paper presents an approach that utilizes knowledge graphs to model the diverse entities and their semantic connections within traffic scenes. Further, we present nuScenes Knowledge Graph (nSKG), a knowledge graph for the nuScenes dataset, that models explicitly all scene participants and road elements, as well as their semantic and spatial relationships. To facilitate the usage of the nSKG via graph neural networks for trajectory prediction, we provide the data in a format, ready-to-use by the PyG library.

- **Summary**: Recently, learning urban region representations utilizing multi-modal data (information views) has become increasingly popular, for deep understanding of the distributions of various socioeconomic features in cities. However, previous methods usually blend multi-view information in a posteriors stage, falling short in learning coherent and consistent representations across different views. In this paper, we form a new pipeline to learn consistent representations across varying views, and propose the multi-view Contrastive Prediction model for urban Region embedding (ReCP), which leverages the multiple information views from point-of-interest (POI) and human mobility data. Specifically, ReCP comprises two major modules, namely an intra-view learning module utilizing contrastive learning and feature reconstruction to capture the unique information from each single view, and inter-view learning module that perceives the consistency between the two views using a contrastive prediction learning scheme. We conduct thorough experiments on two downstream tasks to assess the proposed model, i.e., land use clustering and region popularity prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods significantly in urban region representation learning.

- **Summary**: Many species face the threat of extinction. It's important to study these species and gather information about them as much as possible to preserve biodiversity. Due to the rarity of endangered species, there is a limited amount of data available, making it difficult to apply data requiring generative AI methods to this domain. We aim to study the feasibility of generating consistent and real-like 3D models of endangered animals using limited data. Such a phenomenon leads us to utilize zero-shot stable diffusion models that can generate a 3D model out of a single image of the target species. This paper investigates the intricate relationship between elevation angle and the output quality of 3D model generation, focusing on the innovative approach presented in DreamGaussian. DreamGaussian, a novel framework utilizing Generative Gaussian Splatting along with novel mesh extraction and refinement algorithms, serves as the focal point of our study. We conduct a comprehensive analysis, analyzing the effect of varying elevation angles on DreamGaussian's ability to reconstruct 3D scenes accurately. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate how changes in elevation angle impact the generated images' spatial coherence, structural integrity, and perceptual realism. We observed that giving a correct elevation angle with the input image significantly affects the result of the generated 3D model. We hope this study to be influential for the usability of AI to preserve endangered animals; while the penultimate aim is to obtain a model that can output biologically consistent 3D models via small samples, the qualitative interpretation of an existing state-of-the-art model such as DreamGaussian will be a step forward in our goal.

- **Summary**: This paper provides a novel parsimonious yet efficient design for zero-shot learning (ZSL), dubbed ParsNets, where we are interested in learning a composition of on-device friendly linear networks, each with orthogonality and low-rankness properties, to achieve equivalent or even better performance against existing deep models. Concretely, we first refactor the core module of ZSL, i.e., visual-semantics mapping function, into several base linear networks that correspond to diverse components of the semantic space, where the complex nonlinearity can be collapsed into simple local linearities. Then, to facilitate the generalization of local linearities, we construct a maximal margin geometry on the learned features by enforcing low-rank constraints on intra-class samples and high-rank constraints on inter-class samples, resulting in orthogonal subspaces for different classes and each subspace lies on a compact manifold. To enhance the model's adaptability and counterbalance over/under-fittings in ZSL, a set of sample-wise indicators is employed to select a sparse subset from these base linear networks to form a composite semantic predictor for each sample. Notably, maximal margin geometry can guarantee the diversity of features, and meanwhile, local linearities guarantee efficiency. Thus, our ParsNets can generalize better to unseen classes and can be deployed flexibly on resource-constrained devices. Theoretical explanations and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Visual retrieval aims to search for the most relevant visual items, e.g., images and videos, from a candidate gallery with a given query item. Accuracy and efficiency are two competing objectives in retrieval tasks. Instead of crafting a new method pursuing further improvement on accuracy, in this paper we propose a multi-teacher distillation framework Whiten-MTD, which is able to transfer knowledge from off-the-shelf pre-trained retrieval models to a lightweight student model for efficient visual retrieval. Furthermore, we discover that the similarities obtained by different retrieval models are diversified and incommensurable, which makes it challenging to jointly distill knowledge from multiple models. Therefore, we propose to whiten the output of teacher models before fusion, which enables effective multi-teacher distillation for retrieval models. Whiten-MTD is conceptually simple and practically effective. Extensive experiments on two landmark image retrieval datasets and one video retrieval dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and its good balance of retrieval performance and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks have shown promising classification performance when predicting certain biomarkers from Whole Slide Images in digital pathology. However, the calibration of the networks' output probabilities is often not evaluated. Communicating uncertainty by providing reliable confidence scores is of high relevance in the medical context. In this work, we compare three neural network architectures that combine feature representations on patch-level to a slide-level prediction with respect to their classification performance and evaluate their calibration. As slide-level classification task, we choose the prediction of Microsatellite Instability from Colorectal Cancer tissue sections. We observe that Transformers lead to good results in terms of classification performance and calibration. When evaluating the classification performance on a separate dataset, we observe that Transformers generalize best. The investigation of reliability diagrams provides additional insights to the Expected Calibration Error metric and we observe that especially Transformers push the output probabilities to extreme values, which results in overconfident predictions.

- **Summary**: Skiing is a popular winter sport discipline with a long history of competitive events. In this domain, computer vision has the potential to enhance the understanding of athletes' performance, but its application lags behind other sports due to limited studies and datasets. This paper makes a step forward in filling such gaps. A thorough investigation is performed on the task of skier tracking in a video capturing his/her complete performance. Obtaining continuous and accurate skier localization is preemptive for further higher-level performance analyses. To enable the study, the largest and most annotated dataset for computer vision in skiing, SkiTB, is introduced. Several visual object tracking algorithms, including both established methodologies and a newly introduced skier-optimized baseline algorithm, are tested using the dataset. The results provide valuable insights into the applicability of different tracking methods for vision-based skiing analysis. SkiTB, code, and results are available at https://machinelearning.uniud.it/datasets/skitb.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel, resource-efficient approach to Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) leveraging speech representations produced by any trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. Moving away from the resource-intensive trends prevalent in recent literature, our method distills knowledge from a trained Conformer-based ASR model, achieving competitive performance on standard VSR benchmarks with significantly less resource utilization. Using unlabeled audio-visual data only, our baseline model achieves a word error rate (WER) of 47.4% and 54.7% on the LRS2 and LRS3 test benchmarks, respectively. After fine-tuning the model with limited labeled data, the word error rate reduces to 35% (LRS2) and 45.7% (LRS3). Our model can be trained on a single consumer-grade GPU within a few days and is capable of performing real-time end-to-end VSR on dated hardware, suggesting a path towards more accessible and resource-efficient VSR methodologies.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance field (NeRF) has achieved great success in novel view synthesis and 3D representation for static scenarios. Existing dynamic NeRFs usually exploit a locally dense grid to fit the deformation field; however, they fail to capture the global dynamics and concomitantly yield models of heavy parameters. We observe that the 4D space is inherently sparse. Firstly, the deformation field is sparse in spatial but dense in temporal due to the continuity of of motion. Secondly, the radiance field is only valid on the surface of the underlying scene, usually occupying a small fraction of the whole space. We thus propose to represent the 4D scene using a learnable sparse latent space, a.k.a. SLS4D. Specifically, SLS4D first uses dense learnable time slot features to depict the temporal space, from which the deformation field is fitted with linear multi-layer perceptions (MLP) to predict the displacement of a 3D position at any time. It then learns the spatial features of a 3D position using another sparse latent space. This is achieved by learning the adaptive weights of each latent code with the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our SLS4D: it achieves the best 4D novel view synthesis using only about $6\%$ parameters of the most recent work.

- **Summary**: Facial animation in virtual reality environments is essential for applications that necessitate clear visibility of the user's face and the ability to convey emotional signals. In our scenario, we animate the face of an operator who controls a robotic Avatar system. The use of facial animation is particularly valuable when the perception of interacting with a specific individual, rather than just a robot, is intended. Purely keypoint-driven animation approaches struggle with the complexity of facial movements. We present a hybrid method that uses both keypoints and direct visual guidance from a mouth camera. Our method generalizes to unseen operators and requires only a quick enrolment step with capture of two short videos. Multiple source images are selected with the intention to cover different facial expressions. Given a mouth camera frame from the HMD, we dynamically construct the target keypoints and apply an attention mechanism to determine the importance of each source image. To resolve keypoint ambiguities and animate a broader range of mouth expressions, we propose to inject visual mouth camera information into the latent space. We enable training on large-scale speaking head datasets by simulating the mouth camera input with its perspective differences and facial deformations. Our method outperforms a baseline in quality, capability, and temporal consistency. In addition, we highlight how the facial animation contributed to our victory at the ANA Avatar XPRIZE Finals.

- **Summary**: Diffusion and Poisson flow models have shown impressive performance in a wide range of generative tasks, including low-dose CT image denoising. However, one limitation in general, and for clinical applications in particular, is slow sampling. Due to their iterative nature, the number of function evaluations (NFE) required is usually on the order of $10-10^3$, both for conditional and unconditional generation. In this paper, we present posterior sampling Poisson flow generative models (PPFM), a novel image denoising technique for low-dose and photon-counting CT that produces excellent image quality whilst keeping NFE=1. Updating the training and sampling processes of Poisson flow generative models (PFGM)++, we learn a conditional generator which defines a trajectory between the prior noise distribution and the posterior distribution of interest. We additionally hijack and regularize the sampling process to achieve NFE=1. Our results shed light on the benefits of the PFGM++ framework compared to diffusion models. In addition, PPFM is shown to perform favorably compared to current state-of-the-art diffusion-style models with NFE=1, consistency models, as well as popular deep learning and non-deep learning-based image denoising techniques, on clinical low-dose CT images and clinical images from a prototype photon-counting CT system.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in a variety of downstream generative tasks, yet remain under-explored in the important and challenging expressive talking head generation. In this work, we propose a DreamTalk framework to fulfill this gap, which employs meticulous design to unlock the potential of diffusion models in generating expressive talking heads. Specifically, DreamTalk consists of three crucial components: a denoising network, a style-aware lip expert, and a style predictor. The diffusion-based denoising network is able to consistently synthesize high-quality audio-driven face motions across diverse expressions. To enhance the expressiveness and accuracy of lip motions, we introduce a style-aware lip expert that can guide lip-sync while being mindful of the speaking styles. To eliminate the need for expression reference video or text, an extra diffusion-based style predictor is utilized to predict the target expression directly from the audio. By this means, DreamTalk can harness powerful diffusion models to generate expressive faces effectively and reduce the reliance on expensive style references. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamTalk is capable of generating photo-realistic talking faces with diverse speaking styles and achieving accurate lip motions, surpassing existing state-of-the-art counterparts.

- **Summary**: We introduce RANRAC, a robust reconstruction algorithm for 3D objects handling occluded and distracted images, which is a particularly challenging scenario that prior robust reconstruction methods cannot deal with. Our solution supports single-shot reconstruction by involving light-field networks, and is also applicable to photo-realistic, robust, multi-view reconstruction from real-world images based on neural radiance fields. While the algorithm imposes certain limitations on the scene representation and, thereby, the supported scene types, it reliably detects and excludes inconsistent perspectives, resulting in clean images without floating artifacts. Our solution is based on a fuzzy adaption of the random sample consensus paradigm, enabling its application to large scale models. We interpret the minimal number of samples to determine the model parameters as a tunable hyperparameter. This is applicable, as a cleaner set of samples improves reconstruction quality. Further, this procedure also handles outliers. Especially for conditioned models, it can result in the same local minimum in the latent space as would be obtained with a completely clean set. We report significant improvements for novel-view synthesis in occluded scenarios, of up to 8dB PSNR compared to the baseline.

- **Summary**: Explaining predictions of black-box neural networks is crucial when applied to decision-critical tasks. Thus, attribution maps are commonly used to identify important image regions, despite prior work showing that humans prefer explanations based on similar examples. To this end, ProtoPNet learns a set of class-representative feature vectors (prototypes) for case-based reasoning. During inference, similarities of latent features to prototypes are linearly classified to form predictions and attribution maps are provided to explain the similarity. In this work, we evaluate whether architectures for case-based reasoning fulfill established axioms required for faithful explanations using the example of ProtoPNet. We show that such architectures allow the extraction of faithful explanations. However, we prove that the attribution maps used to explain the similarities violate the axioms. We propose a new procedure to extract explanations for trained ProtoPNets, named ProtoPFaith. Conceptually, these explanations are Shapley values, calculated on the similarity scores of each prototype. They allow to faithfully answer which prototypes are present in an unseen image and quantify each pixel's contribution to that presence, thereby complying with all axioms. The theoretical violations of ProtoPNet manifest in our experiments on three datasets (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, RSNA) and five architectures (ConvNet, ResNet, ResNet50, WideResNet50, ResNeXt50). Our experiments show a qualitative difference between the explanations given by ProtoPNet and ProtoPFaith. Additionally, we quantify the explanations with the Area Over the Perturbation Curve, on which ProtoPFaith outperforms ProtoPNet on all experiments by a factor $>10^3$.

- **Summary**: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) deals with training a model on a labeled source domain with the aim of generalizing to unseen domains during inference. Existing DGSS methods typically effectuate robust features by means of Domain Randomization (DR). Such an approach is often limited as it can only account for style diversification and not content. In this work, we take an orthogonal approach to DGSS and propose to use an assembly of CoLlaborative FOUndation models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (CLOUDS). In detail, CLOUDS is a framework that integrates FMs of various kinds: (i) CLIP backbone for its robust feature representation, (ii) generative models to diversify the content, thereby covering various modes of the possible target distribution, and (iii) Segment Anything Model (SAM) for iteratively refining the predictions of the segmentation model. Extensive experiments show that our CLOUDS excels in adapting from synthetic to real DGSS benchmarks and under varying weather conditions, notably outperforming prior methods by 5.6% and 6.7% on averaged miou, respectively.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) based image analysis has an immense potential to support diagnostic histopathology, including cancer diagnostics. However, developing supervised AI methods requires large-scale annotated datasets. A potentially powerful solution is to augment training data with synthetic data. Latent diffusion models, which can generate high-quality, diverse synthetic images, are promising. However, the most common implementations rely on detailed textual descriptions, which are not generally available in this domain. This work proposes a method that constructs structured textual prompts from automatically extracted image features. We experiment with the PCam dataset, composed of tissue patches only loosely annotated as healthy or cancerous. We show that including image-derived features in the prompt, as opposed to only healthy and cancerous labels, improves the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 178.8 to 90.2. We also show that pathologists find it challenging to detect synthetic images, with a median sensitivity/specificity of 0.55/0.55. Finally, we show that synthetic data effectively trains AI models.

- **Summary**: Occluded person re-identification (ReID) is a very challenging task due to the occlusion disturbance and incomplete target information. Leveraging external cues such as human pose or parsing to locate and align part features has been proven to be very effective in occluded person ReID. Meanwhile, recent Transformer structures have a strong ability of long-range modeling. Considering the above facts, we propose a Teacher-Student Decoder (TSD) framework for occluded person ReID, which utilizes the Transformer decoder with the help of human parsing. More specifically, our proposed TSD consists of a Parsing-aware Teacher Decoder (PTD) and a Standard Student Decoder (SSD). PTD employs human parsing cues to restrict Transformer's attention and imparts this information to SSD through feature distillation. Thereby, SSD can learn from PTD to aggregate information of body parts automatically. Moreover, a mask generator is designed to provide discriminative regions for better ReID. In addition, existing occluded person ReID benchmarks utilize occluded samples as queries, which will amplify the role of alleviating occlusion interference and underestimate the impact of the feature absence issue. Contrastively, we propose a new benchmark with non-occluded queries, serving as a complement to the existing benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is superior and the new benchmark is essential. The source codes are available at https://github.com/hh23333/TSD.

- **Summary**: Image prefiltering with just noticeable distortion (JND) improves coding efficiency in a visual lossless way by filtering the perceptually redundant information prior to compression. However, real JND cannot be well modeled with inaccurate masking equations in traditional approaches or image-level subject tests in deep learning approaches. Thus, this paper proposes a fine-grained JND prefiltering dataset guided by image quality assessment for accurate block-level JND modeling. The dataset is constructed from decoded images to include coding effects and is also perceptually enhanced with block overlap and edge preservation. Furthermore, based on this dataset, we propose a lightweight JND prefiltering network, IQNet, which can be applied directly to different quantization cases with the same model and only needs 3K parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed approach to Versatile Video Coding could yield maximum/average bitrate savings of 41\%/15\% and 53\%/19\% for all-intra and low-delay P configurations, respectively, with negligible subjective quality loss. Our method demonstrates higher perceptual quality and a model size that is an order of magnitude smaller than previous deep learning methods.

- **Summary**: Event cameras offer the exciting possibility of tracking the camera's pose during high-speed motion and in adverse lighting conditions. Despite this promise, existing event-based monocular visual odometry (VO) approaches demonstrate limited performance on recent benchmarks. To address this limitation, some methods resort to additional sensors such as IMUs, stereo event cameras, or frame-based cameras. Nonetheless, these additional sensors limit the application of event cameras in real-world devices since they increase cost and complicate system requirements. Moreover, relying on a frame-based camera makes the system susceptible to motion blur and HDR. To remove the dependency on additional sensors and to push the limits of using only a single event camera, we present Deep Event VO (DEVO), the first monocular event-only system with strong performance on a large number of real-world benchmarks. DEVO sparsely tracks selected event patches over time. A key component of DEVO is a novel deep patch selection mechanism tailored to event data. We significantly decrease the pose tracking error on seven real-world benchmarks by up to 97% compared to event-only methods and often surpass or are close to stereo or inertial methods.

- **Summary**: Understanding vehicles in images is important for various applications such as intelligent transportation and self-driving system. Existing vehicle-centric works typically pre-train models on large-scale classification datasets and then fine-tune them for specific downstream tasks. However, they neglect the specific characteristics of vehicle perception in different tasks and might thus lead to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel vehicle-centric pre-training framework called VehicleMAE, which incorporates the structural information including the spatial structure from vehicle profile information and the semantic structure from informative high-level natural language descriptions for effective masked vehicle appearance reconstruction. To be specific, we explicitly extract the sketch lines of vehicles as a form of the spatial structure to guide vehicle reconstruction. The more comprehensive knowledge distilled from the CLIP big model based on the similarity between the paired/unpaired vehicle image-text sample is further taken into consideration to help achieve a better understanding of vehicles. A large-scale dataset is built to pre-train our model, termed Autobot1M, which contains about 1M vehicle images and 12693 text information. Extensive experiments on four vehicle-based downstream tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our VehicleMAE. The source code and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/VehicleMAE.

- **Summary**: We propose a systematic analysis of deep neural networks (DNNs) based on a signal processing technique for network parameter removal, in the form of synaptic filters that identifies the fragility, robustness and antifragility characteristics of DNN parameters. Our proposed analysis investigates if the DNN performance is impacted negatively, invariantly, or positively on both clean and adversarially perturbed test datasets when the DNN undergoes synaptic filtering. We define three \textit{filtering scores} for quantifying the fragility, robustness and antifragility characteristics of DNN parameters based on the performances for (i) clean dataset, (ii) adversarial dataset, and (iii) the difference in performances of clean and adversarial datasets. We validate the proposed systematic analysis on ResNet-18, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-v1.1 and ShuffleNet V2 x1.0 network architectures for MNIST, CIFAR10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. The filtering scores, for a given network architecture, identify network parameters that are invariant in characteristics across different datasets over learning epochs. Vice-versa, for a given dataset, the filtering scores identify the parameters that are invariant in characteristics across different network architectures. We show that our synaptic filtering method improves the test accuracy of ResNet and ShuffleNet models on adversarial datasets when only the robust and antifragile parameters are selectively retrained at any given epoch, thus demonstrating applications of the proposed strategy in improving model robustness.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the growing interest in deploying deep learning models directly in-sensor. We present "Q-Segment", a quantized real-time segmentation algorithm, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation on two low-power edge vision platforms, namely Sony IMX500, which has an in-sensors processor, and Sony Spresense, a low-power multi-core ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. One of the main goals of the model is to achieve end-to-end image segmentation for vessel-based medical diagnosis. Deployed on the IMX500 platform, Q-Segment achieves ultra-low inference time in-sensor of only 1.9 ms and energy consumption of only 5.7 mJ. We compare the proposed network with outperforming existing networks on various platforms by a factor of 75x (compared to ERFNet). The network architecture employs an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, and results in a binary accuracy of 97.25% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 96.97% on the CHASE dataset. This research contributes valuable insights into edge-based image segmentation, laying the foundation for efficient algorithms tailored to low-power environments.

- **Summary**: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown encouraging results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we present PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system which performs high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation, PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features. We also incorporate multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature, smoothness, and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments). The code will be open-sourced upon paper acceptance.

- **Summary**: Large amounts of digitized histopathological data display a promising future for developing pathological foundation models via self-supervised learning methods. Foundation models pretrained with these methods serve as a good basis for downstream tasks. However, the gap between natural and histopathological images hinders the direct application of existing methods. In this work, we present PathoDuet, a series of pretrained models on histopathological images, and a new self-supervised learning framework in histopathology. The framework is featured by a newly-introduced pretext token and later task raisers to explicitly utilize certain relations between images, like multiple magnifications and multiple stains. Based on this, two pretext tasks, cross-scale positioning and cross-stain transferring, are designed to pretrain the model on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) images and transfer the model to immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, respectively. To validate the efficacy of our models, we evaluate the performance over a wide variety of downstream tasks, including patch-level colorectal cancer subtyping and whole slide image (WSI)-level classification in H\&E field, together with expression level prediction of IHC marker and tumor identification in IHC field. The experimental results show the superiority of our models over most tasks and the efficacy of proposed pretext tasks.

- **Summary**: Segmentation quality assessment (SQA) plays a critical role in the deployment of a medical image based AI system. Users need to be informed/alerted whenever an AI system generates unreliable/incorrect predictions. With the introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a general foundation segmentation model, new research opportunities emerged in how one can utilize SAM for medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel SQA method, called SQA-SAM, which exploits SAM to enhance the accuracy of quality assessment for medical image segmentation. When a medical image segmentation model (MedSeg) produces predictions for a test image, we generate visual prompts based on the predictions, and SAM is utilized to generate segmentation maps corresponding to the visual prompts. How well MedSeg's segmentation aligns with SAM's segmentation indicates how well MedSeg's segmentation aligns with the general perception of objectness and image region partition. We develop a score measure for such alignment. In experiments, we find that the generated scores exhibit moderate to strong positive correlation (in Pearson correlation and Spearman correlation) with Dice coefficient scores reflecting the true segmentation quality.

- **Summary**: Online video super-resolution (online-VSR) highly relies on an effective alignment module to aggregate temporal information, while the strict latency requirement makes accurate and efficient alignment very challenging. Though much progress has been achieved, most of the existing online-VSR methods estimate the motion fields of each frame separately to perform alignment, which is computationally redundant and ignores the fact that the motion fields of adjacent frames are correlated. In this work, we propose an efficient Temporal Motion Propagation (TMP) method, which leverages the continuity of motion field to achieve fast pixel-level alignment among consecutive frames. Specifically, we first propagate the offsets from previous frames to the current frame, and then refine them in the neighborhood, which significantly reduces the matching space and speeds up the offset estimation process. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of alignment, we perform spatial-wise weighting on the warped features, where the positions with more precise offsets are assigned higher importance. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed TMP method achieves leading online-VSR accuracy as well as inference speed. The source code of TMP can be found at \href{https://github.com/xtudbxk/TMP}{https://github.com/xtudbxk/TMP}.

- **Summary**: Due to the omnipresence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), the interest towards editable implicit 3D representations has surged over the last years. However, editing implicit or hybrid representations as used for NeRFs is difficult due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry encoded in the model parameters. Despite these challenges, recent research has shown first promising steps towards photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance edits. The main open issues of related work include limited interactivity, a lack of support for local edits and large memory requirements, rendering them less useful in practice. We address these limitations with LAENeRF, a unified framework for photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of NeRFs. To tackle local editing, we leverage a voxel grid as starting point for region selection. We learn a mapping from expected ray terminations to final output color, which can optionally be supervised by a style loss, resulting in a framework which can perform photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of selected regions. Relying on a single point per ray for our mapping, we limit memory requirements and enable fast optimization. To guarantee interactivity, we compose the output color using a set of learned, modifiable base colors, composed with additive layer mixing. Compared to concurrent work, LAENeRF enables recoloring and stylization while keeping processing time low. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Despite the decomposition of convolutional kernels for lightweight CNNs being well studied, existing works that rely on tensor network diagrams or hyperdimensional abstraction lack geometry intuition. This work devises a new perspective by linking a 3D-reshaped kernel tensor to its various slice-wise and rank-1 decompositions, permitting a straightforward connection between various tensor approximations and efficient CNN modules. Specifically, it is discovered that a pointwise-depthwise-pointwise (PDP) configuration constitutes a viable construct for lightweight CNNs. Moreover, a novel link to the latest ShiftNet is established, inspiring a first-ever shift layer pruning that achieves nearly 50% compression with < 1% drop in accuracy for ShiftResNet.

- **Summary**: CNC manufacturing is a process that employs computer numerical control (CNC) machines to govern the movements of various industrial tools and machinery, encompassing equipment ranging from grinders and lathes to mills and CNC routers. However, the reliance on manual CNC programming has become a bottleneck, and the requirement for expert knowledge can result in significant costs. Therefore, we introduce a pioneering approach named CNC-Net, representing the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) to simulate CNC machines and grasp intricate operations when supplied with raw materials. CNC-Net constitutes a self-supervised framework that exclusively takes an input 3D model and subsequently generates the essential operation parameters required by the CNC machine to construct the object. Our method has the potential to transformative automation in manufacturing by offering a cost-effective alternative to the high costs of manual CNC programming while maintaining exceptional precision in 3D object production. Our experiments underscore the effectiveness of our CNC-Net in constructing the desired 3D objects through the utilization of CNC operations. Notably, it excels in preserving finer local details, exhibiting a marked enhancement in precision compared to the state-of-the-art 3D CAD reconstruction approaches.

- **Summary**: Video recognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Recent studies show that style transfer-based and patch-based unrestricted perturbations can effectively improve attack efficiency. These attacks, however, face two main challenges: 1) Adding large stylized perturbations to all pixels reduces the naturalness of the video and such perturbations can be easily detected. 2) Patch-based video attacks are not extensible to targeted attacks due to the limited search space of reinforcement learning that has been widely used in video attacks recently. In this paper, we focus on the video black-box setting and propose a novel attack framework named LogoStyleFool by adding a stylized logo to the clean video. We separate the attack into three stages: style reference selection, reinforcement-learning-based logo style transfer, and perturbation optimization. We solve the first challenge by scaling down the perturbation range to a regional logo, while the second challenge is addressed by complementing an optimization stage after reinforcement learning. Experimental results substantiate the overall superiority of LogoStyleFool over three state-of-the-art patch-based attacks in terms of attack performance and semantic preservation. Meanwhile, LogoStyleFool still maintains its performance against two existing patch-based defense methods. We believe that our research is beneficial in increasing the attention of the security community to such subregional style transfer attacks.

- **Summary**: Images acquired in hazy conditions have degradations induced in them. Dehazing such images is a vexed and ill-posed problem. Scores of prior-based and learning-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate the effect of haze and generate haze-free images. Many conventional methods are constrained by their lack of awareness regarding scene depth and their incapacity to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, a method that uses residual learning and vision transformers in an attention module is proposed. It essentially comprises two networks: In the first one, the network takes the ratio of a hazy image and the approximated transmission matrix to estimate a residual map. The second network takes this residual image as input and passes it through convolution layers before superposing it on the generated feature maps. It is then passed through global context and depth-aware transformer encoders to obtain channel attention. The attention module then infers the spatial attention map before generating the final haze-free image. Experimental results, including several quantitative metrics, demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the suggested methodology.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of interconnected line networks, such as grain boundaries in polycrystalline material microstructures, poses a significant challenge due to the fragmented masks produced by conventional computer vision algorithms, including convolutional neural networks. These algorithms struggle with thin masks, often necessitating intricate post-processing for effective contour closure and continuity. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a fast, high-fidelity post-processing technique, leveraging domain knowledge about grain boundary connectivity and employing conditional random fields and perceptual grouping rules. This approach significantly enhances segmentation mask accuracy, achieving a 79% segment identification accuracy in validation with a U-Net model on electron microscopy images of a polycrystalline oxide. Additionally, a novel grain alignment metric is introduced, showing a 51% improvement in grain alignment, providing a more detailed assessment of segmentation performance for complex microstructures. This method not only enables rapid and accurate segmentation but also facilitates an unprecedented level of data analysis, significantly improving the statistical representation of grain boundary networks, making it suitable for a range of disciplines where precise segmentation of interconnected line networks is essential.

- **Summary**: Untrained neural networks pioneered by Deep Image Prior (DIP) have recently enabled MRI reconstruction without requiring fully-sampled measurements for training. Their success is widely attributed to the implicit regularization induced by suitable network architectures. However, the lack of understanding of such architectural priors results in superfluous design choices and sub-optimal outcomes. This work aims to simplify the architectural design decisions for DIP-MRI to facilitate its practical deployment. We observe that certain architectural components are more prone to causing overfitting regardless of the number of parameters, incurring severe reconstruction artifacts by hindering accurate extrapolation on the un-acquired measurements. We interpret this phenomenon from a frequency perspective and find that the architectural characteristics favoring low frequencies, i.e., deep and narrow with unlearnt upsampling, can lead to enhanced generalization and hence better reconstruction. Building on this insight, we propose two architecture-agnostic remedies: one to constrain the frequency range of the white-noise input and the other to penalize the Lipschitz constants of the network. We demonstrate that even with just one extra line of code on the input, the performance gap between the ill-designed models and the high-performing ones can be closed. These results signify that for the first time, architectural biases on untrained MRI reconstruction can be mitigated without architectural modifications.

- **Summary**: Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) comprises a wide selection of various problems similar to those used in human IQ tests. Recent years have brought dynamic progress in solving particular AVR tasks, however, in the contemporary literature AVR problems are largely dealt with in isolation, leading to highly specialized task-specific methods. With the aim of developing universal learning systems in the AVR domain, we propose the unified model for solving Single-Choice Abstract visual Reasoning tasks (SCAR), capable of solving various single-choice AVR tasks, without making any a priori assumptions about the task structure, in particular the number and location of panels. The proposed model relies on a novel Structure-Aware dynamic Layer (SAL), which adapts its weights to the structure of the considered AVR problem. Experiments conducted on Raven's Progressive Matrices, Visual Analogy Problems, and Odd One Out problems show that SCAR (SAL-based models, in general) effectively solves diverse AVR tasks, and its performance is on par with the state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. What is more, SCAR demonstrates effective knowledge reuse in multi-task and transfer learning settings. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful attempt to construct a general single-choice AVR solver relying on self-configurable architecture and unified solving method. With this work we aim to stimulate and foster progress on task-independent research paths in the AVR domain, with the long-term goal of development of a general AVR solver.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved impressive general-purpose vision-language capabilities through visual instruction tuning. However, current MLLMs primarily focus on image-level or box-level understanding, falling short of achieving fine-grained vision-language alignment at the pixel level. Besides, the lack of mask-based instruction data limits their advancements. In this paper, we propose Osprey, a mask-text instruction tuning approach, to extend MLLMs by incorporating fine-grained mask regions into language instruction, aiming at achieving pixel-wise visual understanding. To achieve this goal, we first meticulously curate a mask-based region-text dataset with 724K samples, and then design a vision-language model by injecting pixel-level representation into LLM. Especially, Osprey adopts a convolutional CLIP backbone as the vision encoder and employs a mask-aware visual extractor to extract precise visual mask features from high resolution input. Experimental results demonstrate Osprey's superiority in various region understanding tasks, showcasing its new capability for pixel-level instruction tuning. In particular, Osprey can be integrated with Segment Anything Model (SAM) seamlessly to obtain multi-granularity semantics.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and its variants have recently emerged as successful methods for novel view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. However, most current NeRF models either achieve high accuracy using large model sizes, or achieve high memory-efficiency by trading off accuracy. This limits the applicable scope of any single model, since high-accuracy models might not fit in low-memory devices, and memory-efficient models might not satisfy high-quality requirements. To this end, we present SlimmeRF, a model that allows for instant test-time trade-offs between model size and accuracy through slimming, thus making the model simultaneously suitable for scenarios with different computing budgets. We achieve this through a newly proposed algorithm named Tensorial Rank Incrementation (TRaIn) which increases the rank of the model's tensorial representation gradually during training. We also observe that our model allows for more effective trade-offs in sparse-view scenarios, at times even achieving higher accuracy after being slimmed. We credit this to the fact that erroneous information such as floaters tend to be stored in components corresponding to higher ranks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Shiran-Yuan/SlimmeRF.

- **Summary**: This paper is not motivated to seek innovation within the attention mechanism. Instead, it focuses on overcoming the existing trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency within the context of point cloud processing, leveraging the power of scale. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in 3D large-scale representation learning, we recognize that model performance is more influenced by scale than by intricate design. Therefore, we present Point Transformer V3 (PTv3), which prioritizes simplicity and efficiency over the accuracy of certain mechanisms that are minor to the overall performance after scaling, such as replacing the precise neighbor search by KNN with an efficient serialized neighbor mapping of point clouds organized with specific patterns. This principle enables significant scaling, expanding the receptive field from 16 to 1024 points while remaining efficient (a 3x increase in processing speed and a 10x improvement in memory efficiency compared with its predecessor, PTv2). PTv3 attains state-of-the-art results on over 20 downstream tasks that span both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Further enhanced with multi-dataset joint training, PTv3 pushes these results to a higher level.

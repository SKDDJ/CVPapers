- **Summary**: With the prevalence of the Pretraining-Finetuning paradigm in transfer learning, the robustness of downstream tasks has become a critical concern. In this work, we delve into adversarial robustness in transfer learning and reveal the critical role of initialization, including both the pretrained model and the linear head. First, we discover the necessity of an adversarially robust pretrained model. Specifically, we reveal that with a standard pretrained model, Parameter-Efficient Finetuning~(PEFT) methods either fail to be adversarially robust or continue to exhibit significantly degraded adversarial robustness on downstream tasks, even with adversarial training during finetuning. Leveraging a robust pretrained model, surprisingly, we observe that a simple linear probing can outperform full finetuning and other PEFT methods with random initialization on certain datasets. We further identify that linear probing excels in preserving robustness from the robust pretraining. Based on this, we propose Robust Linear Initialization~(RoLI) for adversarial finetuning, which initializes the linear head with the weights obtained by adversarial linear probing to maximally inherit the robustness from pretraining. Across five different image classification datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RoLI and achieve new state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel approach to multi-view action recognition where we guide learned action representations to be separated from view-relevant information in a video. When trying to classify action instances captured from multiple viewpoints, there is a higher degree of difficulty due to the difference in background, occlusion, and visibility of the captured action from different camera angles. To tackle the various problems introduced in multi-view action recognition, we propose a novel configuration of learnable transformer decoder queries, in conjunction with two supervised contrastive losses, to enforce the learning of action features that are robust to shifts in viewpoints. Our disentangled feature learning occurs in two stages: the transformer decoder uses separate queries to separately learn action and view information, which are then further disentangled using our two contrastive losses. We show that our model and method of training significantly outperforms all other uni-modal models on four multi-view action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, and N-UCLA. Compared to previous RGB works, we see maximal improvements of 1.5\%, 4.8\%, 2.2\%, and 4.8\% on each dataset, respectively.

- **Summary**: Our understanding of the human connectome is fundamentally limited by the resolution of diffusion MR images. Reconstructing a connectome's constituent neural pathways with tractography requires following a continuous field of fiber directions. Typically, this field is found with simple trilinear interpolation in low-resolution, noisy diffusion MRIs. However, trilinear interpolation struggles following fine-scale changes in low-quality data. Recent deep learning methods in super-resolving diffusion MRIs have focused on upsampling to a fixed spatial grid, but this does not satisfy tractography's need for a continuous field. In this work, we propose FENRI, a novel method that learns spatially-continuous fiber orientation density functions from low-resolution diffusion-weighted images. To quantify FENRI's capabilities in tractography, we also introduce an expanded simulated dataset built for evaluating deep-learning tractography models. We demonstrate that FENRI accurately predicts high-resolution fiber orientations from realistic low-quality data, and that FENRI-based tractography offers improved streamline reconstruction over the current use of trilinear interpolation.

- **Summary**: Recently, Stitchable Neural Networks (SN-Net) is proposed to stitch some pre-trained networks for quickly building numerous networks with different complexity and performance trade-offs. In this way, the burdens of designing or training the variable-sized networks, which can be used in application scenarios with diverse resource constraints, are alleviated. However, SN-Net still faces a few challenges. 1) Stitching from multiple independently pre-trained anchors introduces high storage resource consumption. 2) SN-Net faces challenges to build smaller models for low resource constraints. 3). SN-Net uses an unlearned initialization method for stitch layers, limiting the final performance. To overcome these challenges, motivated by the recently proposed Learngene framework, we propose a novel method called Learngene Pool. Briefly, Learngene distills the critical knowledge from a large pre-trained model into a small part (termed as learngene) and then expands this small part into a few variable-sized models. In our proposed method, we distill one pretrained large model into multiple small models whose network blocks are used as learngene instances to construct the learngene pool. Since only one large model is used, we do not need to store more large models as SN-Net and after distilling, smaller learngene instances can be created to build small models to satisfy low resource constraints. We also insert learnable transformation matrices between the instances to stitch them into variable-sized models to improve the performance of these models. Exhaustive experiments have been implemented and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Learngene Pool compared with SN-Net.

- **Summary**: Object detection is integral to a bevy of real-world applications, from robotics to medical image analysis. To be used reliably in such applications, models must be capable of handling unexpected - or novel - objects. The open world object detection (OWD) paradigm addresses this challenge by enabling models to detect unknown objects and learn discovered ones incrementally. However, OWD method development is hindered due to the stringent benchmark and task definitions. These definitions effectively prohibit foundation models. Here, we aim to relax these definitions and investigate the utilization of pre-trained foundation models in OWD. First, we show that existing benchmarks are insufficient in evaluating methods that utilize foundation models, as even naive integration methods nearly saturate these benchmarks. This result motivated us to curate a new and challenging benchmark for these models. Therefore, we introduce a new benchmark that includes five real-world application-driven datasets, including challenging domains such as aerial and surgical images, and establish baselines. We exploit the inherent connection between classes in application-driven datasets and introduce a novel method, Foundation Object detection Model for the Open world, or FOMO, which identifies unknown objects based on their shared attributes with the base known objects. FOMO has ~3x unknown object mAP compared to baselines on our benchmark. However, our results indicate a significant place for improvement - suggesting a great research opportunity in further scaling object detection methods to real-world domains. Our code and benchmark are available at https://orrzohar.github.io/projects/fomo/.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) is a promising approach for generating photorealistic images and representing complex scenes. However, when processing data sequentially, it can suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where previous data is easily forgotten after training with new data. Existing incremental learning methods using knowledge distillation assume that continuous data chunks contain both 2D images and corresponding camera pose parameters, pre-estimated from the complete dataset. This poses a paradox as the necessary camera pose must be estimated from the entire dataset, even though the data arrives sequentially and future chunks are inaccessible. In contrast, we focus on a practical scenario where camera poses are unknown. We propose IL-NeRF, a novel framework for incremental NeRF training, to address this challenge. IL-NeRF's key idea lies in selecting a set of past camera poses as references to initialize and align the camera poses of incoming image data. This is followed by a joint optimization of camera poses and replay-based NeRF distillation. Our experiments on real-world indoor and outdoor scenes show that IL-NeRF handles incremental NeRF training and outperforms the baselines by up to $54.04\%$ in rendering quality.

- **Summary**: In this study, we benchmark query strategies for deep actice learning~(DAL). DAL reduces annotation costs by annotating only high-quality samples selected by query strategies. Existing research has two main problems, that the experimental settings are not standardized, making the evaluation of existing methods is difficult, and that most of experiments were conducted on the CIFAR or MNIST datasets. Therefore, we develop standardized experimental settings for DAL and investigate the effectiveness of various query strategies using six datasets, including those that contain medical and visual inspection images. In addition, since most current DAL approaches are model-based, we perform verification experiments using fully-trained models for querying to investigate the effectiveness of these approaches for the six datasets.

- **Summary**: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to predict the semantic occupancy of each voxel in the entire 3D scene from limited observations, which is an emerging and critical task for autonomous driving. Recently, many studies have turned to camera-based SSC solutions due to the richer visual cues and cost-effectiveness of cameras. However, existing methods usually rely on sophisticated and heavy 3D models to directly process the lifted 3D features that are not discriminative enough for clear segmentation boundaries. In this paper, we adopt the dense-sparse-dense design and propose an end-to-end camera-based SSC framework, termed SGN, to diffuse semantics from the semantic- and occupancy-aware seed voxels to the whole scene based on geometry prior and occupancy information. By designing hybrid guidance (sparse semantic and geometry guidance) and effective voxel aggregation for spatial occupancy and geometry priors, we enhance the feature separation between different categories and expedite the convergence of semantic diffusion. Extensive experimental results on the SemanticKITTI dataset demonstrate the superiority of our SGN over existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has revolutionized autonomous driving by enabling vehicles to perceive and interpret their surroundings with remarkable accuracy. This progress is attributed to various deep learning models, including Mediated Perception, Behavior Reflex, and Direct Perception, each offering unique advantages and challenges in enhancing autonomous driving capabilities. However, there is a gap in research addressing integrating these approaches and understanding their relevance in diverse driving scenarios. This study introduces three distinct neural network models corresponding to Mediated Perception, Behavior Reflex, and Direct Perception approaches. We explore their significance across varying driving conditions, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of each approach. Our architecture fuses information from the base, future latent vector prediction, and auxiliary task networks, using global routing commands to select appropriate action sub-networks. We aim to provide insights into effectively utilizing diverse modeling strategies in autonomous driving by conducting experiments and evaluations. The results show that the ensemble model performs better than the individual approaches, suggesting that each modality contributes uniquely toward the performance of the overall model. Moreover, by exploring the significance of each modality, this study offers a roadmap for future research in autonomous driving, emphasizing the importance of leveraging multiple models to achieve robust performance.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown impressive zero-shot transfer performance for various computer vision tasks recently. However, its heavy computation costs remain daunting for practical applications. MobileSAM proposes to replace the heavyweight image encoder in SAM with TinyViT by employing distillation, which results in a significant reduction in computational requirements. However, its deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices still encounters challenges due to the substantial memory and computational overhead caused by self-attention mechanisms. Recently, RepViT achieves the state-of-the-art performance and latency trade-off on mobile devices by incorporating efficient architectural designs of ViTs into CNNs. Here, to achieve real-time segmenting anything on mobile devices, following MobileSAM, we replace the heavyweight image encoder in SAM with RepViT model, ending up with the RepViT-SAM model. Extensive experiments show that RepViT-SAM can enjoy significantly better zero-shot transfer capability than MobileSAM, along with nearly $10\times$ faster inference speed.

- **Summary**: Anomaly inspection plays an important role in industrial manufacture. Existing anomaly inspection methods are limited in their performance due to insufficient anomaly data. Although anomaly generation methods have been proposed to augment the anomaly data, they either suffer from poor generation authenticity or inaccurate alignment between the generated anomalies and masks. To address the above problems, we propose AnomalyDiffusion, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly generation model, which utilizes the strong prior information of latent diffusion model learned from large-scale dataset to enhance the generation authenticity under few-shot training data. Firstly, we propose Spatial Anomaly Embedding, which consists of a learnable anomaly embedding and a spatial embedding encoded from an anomaly mask, disentangling the anomaly information into anomaly appearance and location information. Moreover, to improve the alignment between the generated anomalies and the anomaly masks, we introduce a novel Adaptive Attention Re-weighting Mechanism. Based on the disparities between the generated anomaly image and normal sample, it dynamically guides the model to focus more on the areas with less noticeable generated anomalies, enabling generation of accurately-matched anomalous image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generation authenticity and diversity, and effectively improves the performance of downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

### Negative Pre-aware for Noisy Cross-modal Matching

- **Summary**: Cross-modal noise-robust learning is a challenging task since noisy correspondence is hard to recognize and rectify. Due to the cumulative and unavoidable negative impact of unresolved noise, existing methods cannot maintain a stable performance when the noise increases. In this paper, we present a novel Negative Pre-aware Cross-modal (NPC) matching solution for large visual-language model fine-tuning on noisy downstream tasks. It is featured in two aspects: (1) For noise recognition and resistance, previous methods usually directly filter out a noise subset, we propose to estimate the negative impact of each sample. It does not need additional correction mechanisms that may predict unreliable correction results, leading to self-reinforcing error. We assign a confidence weight to each sample according to its negative impact in the training process. This adaptively adjusts the contribution of each sample to avoid noisy accumulation. (2) For maintaining stable performance with increasing noise, we utilize the memorization effect of DNNs by maintaining a memory bank. Specifically, we apply GMM to select high-confident clean samples as the memory entry, where the memory entry is used to estimate the negative impact of each sample. Since clean samples are easier distinguished by GMM with increasing noise, the memory bank can still maintain high quality at a high noise ratio. Compared to the correction mechanism focusing on noise samples, memory bank-based estimation is more robust, which makes the model performance stable on noisy datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves matching accuracy and performance stability at increasing noise ratio. Our approach also surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neuro-degenerative disorder that affects movement, speech, and coordination. Timely diagnosis and treatment can improve the quality of life for PD patients. However, access to clinical diagnosis is limited in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Therefore, development of automated screening tools for PD can have a huge social impact, particularly in the public health sector. In this paper, we present PULSAR, a novel method to screen for PD from webcam-recorded videos of the finger-tapping task from the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). PULSAR is trained and evaluated on data collected from 382 participants (183 self-reported as PD patients). We used an adaptive graph convolutional neural network to dynamically learn the spatio temporal graph edges specific to the finger-tapping task. We enhanced this idea with a multi stream adaptive convolution model to learn features from different modalities of data critical to detect PD, such as relative location of the finger joints, velocity and acceleration of tapping. As the labels of the videos are self-reported, there could be cases of undiagnosed PD in the non-PD labeled samples. We leveraged the idea of Positive Unlabeled (PU) Learning that does not need labeled negative data. Our experiments show clear benefit of modeling the problem in this way. PULSAR achieved 80.95% accuracy in validation set and a mean accuracy of 71.29% (2.49% standard deviation) in independent test, despite being trained with limited amount of data. This is specially promising as labeled data is scarce in health care sector. We hope PULSAR will make PD screening more accessible to everyone. The proposed techniques could be extended for assessment of other movement disorders, such as ataxia, and Huntington's disease.

- **Summary**: The commencement of the decade brought along with it a grave pandemic and in response the movement of education forums predominantly into the online world. With a surge in the usage of online video conferencing platforms and tools to better gauge student understanding, there needs to be a mechanism to assess whether instructors can grasp the extent to which students understand the subject and their response to the educational stimuli. The current systems consider only a single cue with a lack of focus in the educational domain. Thus, there is a necessity for the measurement of an all-encompassing holistic overview of the students' reaction to the subject matter. This paper highlights the need for a multimodal approach to affect recognition and its deployment in the online classroom while considering four cues, posture and gesture, facial, eye tracking and verbal recognition. It compares the various machine learning models available for each cue and provides the most suitable approach given the available dataset and parameters of classroom footage. A multimodal approach derived from weighted majority voting is proposed by combining the most fitting models from this analysis of individual cues based on accuracy, ease of procuring data corpus, sensitivity and any major drawbacks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel framework named DRL-CPG to learn disentangled latent representation for controllable person image generation, which can produce realistic person images with desired poses and human attributes (e.g., pose, head, upper clothes, and pants) provided by various source persons. Unlike the existing works leveraging the semantic masks to obtain the representation of each component, we propose to generate disentangled latent code via a novel attribute encoder with transformers trained in a manner of curriculum learning from a relatively easy step to a gradually hard one. A random component mask-agnostic strategy is introduced to randomly remove component masks from the person segmentation masks, which aims at increasing the difficulty of training and promoting the transformer encoder to recognize the underlying boundaries between each component. This enables the model to transfer both the shape and texture of the components. Furthermore, we propose a novel attribute decoder network to integrate multi-level attributes (e.g., the structure feature and the attribute representation) with well-designed Dual Adaptive Denormalization (DAD) residual blocks. Extensive experiments strongly demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to transfer both the texture and shape of different human parts and yield realistic results. To our knowledge, we are the first to learn disentangled latent representations with transformers for person image generation.

- **Summary**: Depth super-resolution (DSR) aims to restore high-resolution (HR) depth from low-resolution (LR) one, where RGB image is often used to promote this task. Recent image guided DSR approaches mainly focus on spatial domain to rebuild depth structure. However, since the structure of LR depth is usually blurry, only considering spatial domain is not very sufficient to acquire satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose structure guided network (SGNet), a method that pays more attention to gradient and frequency domains, both of which have the inherent ability to capture high-frequency structure. Specifically, we first introduce the gradient calibration module (GCM), which employs the accurate gradient prior of RGB to sharpen the LR depth structure. Then we present the Frequency Awareness Module (FAM) that recursively conducts multiple spectrum differencing blocks (SDB), each of which propagates the precise high-frequency components of RGB into the LR depth. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SGNet, reaching the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Conventional super-resolution methods suffer from two drawbacks: substantial computational cost in upscaling an entire large image, and the introduction of extraneous or potentially detrimental information for downstream computer vision tasks during the refinement of the background. To solve these issues, we propose a novel transformer-based algorithm, Selective Super-Resolution (SSR), which partitions images into non-overlapping tiles, selects tiles of interest at various scales with a pyramid architecture, and exclusively reconstructs these selected tiles with deep features. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the efficiency and robust performance of our approach for super-resolution. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the FID score is reduced from 26.78 to 10.41 with 40% reduction in computation cost for the BDD100K dataset.

- **Summary**: The generation of 3D clothed humans has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, existing work cannot generate layered high-quality 3D humans with consistent body structures. As a result, these methods are unable to arbitrarily and separately change and edit the body and clothing of the human. In this paper, we propose a text-driven layered 3D human generation framework based on a novel physically-decoupled semantic-aware diffusion model. To keep the generated clothing consistent with the target text, we propose a semantic-confidence strategy for clothing that can eliminate the non-clothing content generated by the model. To match the clothing with different body shapes, we propose a SMPL-driven implicit field deformation network that enables the free transfer and reuse of clothing. Besides, we introduce uniform shape priors based on the SMPL model for body and clothing, respectively, which generates more diverse 3D content without being constrained by specific templates. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only generates 3D humans with consistent body structures but also allows free editing in a layered manner. The source code will be made public.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) enables leveraging distributed private data for model training in a privacy-preserving way. However, data heterogeneity significantly limits the performance of current FL methods. In this paper, we propose a novel FL framework termed FedGC, designed to mitigate data heterogeneity issues by diversifying private data with generative content. FedGC is a simple-to-implement framework as it only introduces a one-shot step of data generation. In data generation, we summarize three crucial and worth-exploring aspects (budget allocation, prompt design, and generation guidance) and propose three solution candidates for each aspect. Specifically, to achieve a better trade-off between data diversity and fidelity for generation guidance, we propose to generate data based on the guidance of prompts and real data simultaneously. The generated data is then merged with private data to facilitate local model training. Such generative data increases the diversity of private data to prevent each client from fitting the potentially biased private data, alleviating the issue of data heterogeneity. We conduct a systematic empirical study on FedGC, covering diverse baselines, datasets, scenarios, and modalities. Interesting findings include (1) FedGC consistently and significantly enhances the performance of FL methods, even when notable disparities exist between generative and private data; (2) FedGC achieves both better performance and privacy-preservation. We wish this work can inspire future works to further explore the potential of enhancing FL with generative content.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D human appearance from a single image is crucial for achieving holographic communication and immersive social experiences. However, this remains a challenge for existing methods, which typically rely on multi-camera setups or are limited to offline operations. In this paper, we propose R$^2$Human, the first approach for real-time inference and rendering of photorealistic 3D human appearance from a single image. The core of our approach is to combine the strengths of implicit texture fields and explicit neural rendering with our novel representation, namely Z-map. Based on this, we present an end-to-end network that performs high-fidelity color reconstruction of visible areas and provides reliable color inference for occluded regions. To further enhance the 3D perception ability of our network, we leverage the Fourier occupancy field to reconstruct a detailed 3D geometry, which serves as a prior for the texture field generation and provides a sampling surface in the rendering stage. Experiments show that our end-to-end method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and challenging real-world images and even outperforms many offline methods.

- **Summary**: Effectively modeling discriminative spatio-temporal information is essential for segmenting activities in long action sequences. However, we observe that existing methods are limited in weak spatio-temporal modeling capability due to two forms of decoupled modeling: (i) cascaded interaction couples spatial and temporal modeling, which over-smooths motion modeling over the long sequence, and (ii) joint-shared temporal modeling adopts shared weights to model each joint, ignoring the distinct motion patterns of different joints. We propose a Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Framework (DeST) to address the above issues. Firstly, we decouple the cascaded spatio-temporal interaction to avoid stacking multiple spatio-temporal blocks, while achieving sufficient spatio-temporal interaction. Specifically, DeST performs once unified spatial modeling and divides the spatial features into different groups of subfeatures, which then adaptively interact with temporal features from different layers. Since the different sub-features contain distinct spatial semantics, the model could learn the optimal interaction pattern at each layer. Meanwhile, inspired by the fact that different joints move at different speeds, we propose joint-decoupled temporal modeling, which employs independent trainable weights to capture distinctive temporal features of each joint. On four large-scale benchmarks of different scenes, DeST significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with less computational complexity.

- **Summary**: Despite the successful application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in object detection tasks, their efficiency in detecting faults from freight train images remains inadequate for implementation in real-world engineering scenarios. Existing modeling shortcomings of spatial invariance and pooling layers in conventional CNNs often ignore the neglect of crucial global information, resulting in error localization for fault objection tasks of freight trains. To solve these problems, we design a spatial-wise dynamic distillation framework based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for visual fault detection of freight trains. We initially present the axial shift strategy, which allows the MLP-like architecture to overcome the challenge of spatial invariance and effectively incorporate both local and global cues. We propose a dynamic distillation method without a pre-training teacher, including a dynamic teacher mechanism that can effectively eliminate the semantic discrepancy with the student model. Such an approach mines more abundant details from lower-level feature appearances and higher-level label semantics as the extra supervision signal, which utilizes efficient instance embedding to model the global spatial and semantic information. In addition, the proposed dynamic teacher can jointly train with students to further enhance the distillation efficiency. Extensive experiments executed on six typical fault datasets reveal that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art detectors and achieves the highest accuracy with real-time detection at a lower computational cost.

- **Summary**: Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have showcased incredible capabilities in generating coherent images based on textual descriptions, enabling vast applications in content generation. While recent advancements have introduced control over factors such as object localization, posture, and image contours, a crucial gap remains in our ability to control the interactions between objects in the generated content. Well-controlling interactions in generated images could yield meaningful applications, such as creating realistic scenes with interacting characters. In this work, we study the problems of conditioning T2I diffusion models with Human-Object Interaction (HOI) information, consisting of a triplet label (person, action, object) and corresponding bounding boxes. We propose a pluggable interaction control model, called InteractDiffusion that extends existing pre-trained T2I diffusion models to enable them being better conditioned on interactions. Specifically, we tokenize the HOI information and learn their relationships via interaction embeddings. A conditioning self-attention layer is trained to map HOI tokens to visual tokens, thereby conditioning the visual tokens better in existing T2I diffusion models. Our model attains the ability to control the interaction and location on existing T2I diffusion models, which outperforms existing baselines by a large margin in HOI detection score, as well as fidelity in FID and KID.

- **Summary**: Adopting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to long-duration dynamic sequences has been challenging. Existing methods struggle to balance between quality and storage size and encounter difficulties with complex scene changes such as topological changes and large motions. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel neural video-based radiance fields (NeVRF) representation. NeVRF marries neural radiance field with image-based rendering to support photo-realistic novel view synthesis on long-duration dynamic inward-looking scenes. We introduce a novel multi-view radiance blending approach to predict radiance directly from multi-view videos. By incorporating continual learning techniques, NeVRF can efficiently reconstruct frames from sequential data without revisiting previous frames, enabling long-duration free-viewpoint video. Furthermore, with a tailored compression approach, NeVRF can compactly represent dynamic scenes, making dynamic radiance fields more practical in real-world scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NeVRF in enabling long-duration sequence rendering, sequential data reconstruction, and compact data storage.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a video inversion approach for zero-shot video editing, which aims to model the input video with low-rank representation during the inversion process. The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or na\"ive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

- **Summary**: The complex dynamics of animal manoeuvrability in the wild is extremely challenging to study. The cheetah ($\textit{Acinonyx jubatus}$) is a perfect example: despite great interest in its unmatched speed and manoeuvrability, obtaining complete whole-body motion data from these animals remains an unsolved problem. This is especially difficult in wild cheetahs, where it is essential that the methods used are remote and do not constrain the animal's motion. In this work, we use data obtained from cheetahs in the wild to present a trajectory optimisation approach for estimating the 3D kinematics and joint torques of subjects remotely. We call this approach kinetic full trajectory estimation (K-FTE). We validate the method on a dataset comprising synchronised video and force plate data. We are able to reconstruct the 3D kinematics with an average reprojection error of 17.69 pixels (62.94 $\%$ PCK using the nose-to-eye(s) length segment as a threshold), while the estimates produce an average root-mean-square error of 171.3 N ($\approx$ 17.16 $\%$ of peak force during stride) for the estimated ground reaction force when compared against the force plate data. While the joint torques cannot be directly validated against ground truth data, as no such data is available for cheetahs, the estimated torques agree with previous studies of quadrupeds in controlled settings. These results will enable deeper insight into the study of animal locomotion in a more natural environment for both biologists and roboticists.

- **Summary**: The analysis of the psoas muscle in morphological and functional imaging has proved to be an accurate approach to assess sarcopenia, i.e. a systemic loss of skeletal muscle mass and function that may be correlated to multifactorial etiological aspects. The inclusion of sarcopenia assessment into a radiological workflow would need the implementation of computational pipelines for image processing that guarantee segmentation reliability and a significant degree of automation. The present study utilizes three-dimensional numerical schemes for psoas segmentation in low-dose X-ray computed tomography images. Specifically, here we focused on the level set methodology and compared the performances of two standard approaches, a classical evolution model and a three-dimension geodesic model, with the performances of an original first-order modification of this latter one. The results of this analysis show that these gradient-based schemes guarantee reliability with respect to manual segmentation and that the first-order scheme requires a computational burden that is significantly smaller than the one needed by the second-order approach.

- **Summary**: Joint camera pose and dense geometry estimation from a set of images or a monocular video remains a challenging problem due to its computational complexity and inherent visual ambiguities. Most dense incremental reconstruction systems operate directly on image pixels and solve for their 3D positions using multi-view geometry cues. Such pixel-level approaches suffer from ambiguities or violations of multi-view consistency (e.g. caused by textureless or specular surfaces).   We address this issue with a new image representation which we call a SuperPrimitive. SuperPrimitives are obtained by splitting images into semantically correlated local regions and enhancing them with estimated surface normal directions, both of which are predicted by state-of-the-art single image neural networks. This provides a local geometry estimate per SuperPrimitive, while their relative positions are adjusted based on multi-view observations.   We demonstrate the versatility of our new representation by addressing three 3D reconstruction tasks: depth completion, few-view structure from motion, and monocular dense visual odometry.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has gained widespread attention beyond the computer science community. Due to various issues arising from continuous creation of AI-generated images (AIGI), AIGC image quality assessment (AIGCIQA), which aims to evaluate the quality of AIGIs from human perception perspectives, has emerged as a novel topic in the field of computer vision. However, most existing AIGCIQA methods directly regress predicted scores from a single generated image, overlooking the inherent differences among AIGIs and scores. Additionally, operations like resizing and cropping may cause global geometric distortions and information loss, thus limiting the performance of models. To address these issues, we propose a patches sampling-based contrastive regression (PSCR) framework. We suggest introducing a contrastive regression framework to leverage differences among various generated images for learning a better representation space. In this space, differences and score rankings among images can be measured by their relative scores. By selecting exemplar AIGIs as references, we also overcome the limitations of previous models that could not utilize reference images on the no-reference image databases. To avoid geometric distortions and information loss in image inputs, we further propose a patches sampling strategy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PSCR framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three mainstream AIGCIQA databases including AGIQA-1K, AGIQA-3K and AIGCIQA2023. The results show significant improvements in model performance with the introduction of our proposed PSCR framework. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/jiquan123/PSCR}.

- **Summary**: Following the technological advancements in medicine, the operation rooms are evolving into intelligent environments. The context-aware systems (CAS) can comprehensively interpret the surgical state, enable real-time warning, and support decision-making, especially for novice surgeons. These systems can automatically analyze surgical videos and perform indexing, documentation, and post-operative report generation. The ever-increasing demand for such automatic systems has sparked machine-learning-based approaches for surgical video analysis. This thesis addresses the significant challenges in cataract surgery video analysis to pave the way for building efficient context-aware systems. The main contributions of this thesis are five folds: (1) This thesis demonstrates that spatio-temporal localization of the relevant content can considerably improve phase recognition accuracy. (2) This thesis proposes a novel deep-learning-based framework for relevance-based compression to enable real-time streaming and adaptive storage of cataract surgery videos. (3) Several convolutional modules are proposed to boost the networks' semantic interpretation performance in challenging conditions. These challenges include blur and reflection distortion, transparency, deformability, color and texture variation, blunt edges, and scale variation. (4) This thesis proposes and evaluates the first framework for automatic irregularity detection in cataract surgery videos. (5) To alleviate the requirement for manual pixel-based annotations, this thesis proposes novel strategies for self-supervised representation learning adapted to semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: With the strong robusticity on illumination variations, near-infrared (NIR) can be an effective and essential complement to visible (VIS) facial expression recognition in low lighting or complete darkness conditions. However, facial expression recognition (FER) from NIR images presents more challenging problem than traditional FER due to the limitations imposed by the data scale and the difficulty of extracting discriminative features from incomplete visible lighting contents. In this paper, we give the first attempt to deep NIR facial expression recognition and proposed a novel method called near-infrared facial expression transformer (NFER-Former). Specifically, to make full use of the abundant label information in the field of VIS, we introduce a Self-Attention Orthogonal Decomposition mechanism that disentangles the expression information and spectrum information from the input image, so that the expression features can be extracted without the interference of spectrum variation. We also propose a Hypergraph-Guided Feature Embedding method that models some key facial behaviors and learns the structure of the complex correlations between them, thereby alleviating the interference of inter-class similarity. Additionally, we have constructed a large NIR-VIS Facial Expression dataset that includes 360 subjects to better validate the efficiency of NFER-Former. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that NFER-Former significantly improves the performance of NIR FER and achieves state-of-the-art results on the only two available NIR FER datasets, Oulu-CASIA and Large-HFE.

- **Summary**: Illumination variation has been a long-term challenge in real-world facial expression recognition(FER). Under uncontrolled or non-visible light conditions, Near-infrared (NIR) can provide a simple and alternative solution to obtain high-quality images and supplement the geometric and texture details that are missing in the visible domain. Due to the lack of existing large-scale NIR facial expression datasets, directly extending VIS FER methods to the NIR spectrum may be ineffective. Additionally, previous heterogeneous image synthesis methods are restricted by low controllability without prior task knowledge. To tackle these issues, we present the first approach, called for NIR-FER Stochastic Differential Equations (NFER-SDE), that transforms face expression appearance between heterogeneous modalities to the overfitting problem on small-scale NIR data. NFER-SDE is able to take the whole VIS source image as input and, together with domain-specific knowledge, guide the preservation of modality-invariant information in the high-frequency content of the image. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that NFER-SDE significantly improves the performance of NIR FER and achieves state-of-the-art results on the only two available NIR FER datasets, Oulu-CASIA and Large-HFE.

- **Summary**: We aim to leverage diffusion to address the challenging image matting task. However, the presence of high computational overhead and the inconsistency of noise sampling between the training and inference processes pose significant obstacles to achieving this goal. In this paper, we present DiffMatte, a solution designed to effectively overcome these challenges. First, DiffMatte decouples the decoder from the intricately coupled matting network design, involving only one lightweight decoder in the iterations of the diffusion process. With such a strategy, DiffMatte mitigates the growth of computational overhead as the number of samples increases. Second, we employ a self-aligned training strategy with uniform time intervals, ensuring a consistent noise sampling between training and inference across the entire time domain. Our DiffMatte is designed with flexibility in mind and can seamlessly integrate into various modern matting architectures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffMatte not only reaches the state-of-the-art level on the Composition-1k test set, surpassing the best methods in the past by 5% and 15% in the SAD metric and MSE metric respectively, but also show stronger generalization ability in other benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Video Individual Counting (VIC) aims to predict the number of unique individuals in a single video. % Existing methods learn representations based on trajectory labels for individuals, which are annotation-expensive. % To provide a more realistic reflection of the underlying practical challenge, we introduce a weakly supervised VIC task, wherein trajectory labels are not provided. Instead, two types of labels are provided to indicate traffic entering the field of view (inflow) and leaving the field view (outflow). % We also propose the first solution as a baseline that formulates the task as a weakly supervised contrastive learning problem under group-level matching. In doing so, we devise an end-to-end trainable soft contrastive loss to drive the network to distinguish inflow, outflow, and the remaining. % To facilitate future study in this direction, we generate annotations from the existing VIC datasets SenseCrowd and CroHD and also build a new dataset, UAVVIC. % Extensive results show that our baseline weakly supervised method outperforms supervised methods, and thus, little information is lost in the transition to the more practically relevant weakly supervised task.

- **Summary**: The popularity of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has led to increased concerns about Model Stealing Attacks (MSA), which aim to craft a clone model by querying MLaaS. Currently, most research on MSA assumes that MLaaS can provide soft labels and that the attacker has a proxy dataset with a similar distribution. However, this fails to encapsulate the more practical scenario where only hard labels are returned by MLaaS and the data distribution remains elusive. Furthermore, most existing work focuses solely on stealing the model accuracy, neglecting the model robustness, while robustness is essential in security-sensitive scenarios, e.g., face-scan payment. Notably, improving model robustness often necessitates the use of expensive techniques such as adversarial training, thereby further making stealing robustness a more lucrative prospect. In response to these identified gaps, we introduce a novel Data-Free Hard-Label Robustness Stealing (DFHL-RS) attack in this paper, which enables the stealing of both model accuracy and robustness by simply querying hard labels of the target model without the help of any natural data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The clone model achieves a clean accuracy of 77.86% and a robust accuracy of 39.51% against AutoAttack, which are only 4.71% and 8.40% lower than the target model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly exceeding the baselines.

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning and Imitation Learning approaches utilize policy learning strategies that are difficult to generalize well with just a few examples of a task. In this work, we propose a language-conditioned semantic search-based method to produce an online search-based policy from the available demonstration dataset of state-action trajectories. Here we directly acquire actions from the most similar manipulation trajectories found in the dataset. Our approach surpasses the performance of the baselines on the CALVIN benchmark and exhibits strong zero-shot adaptation capabilities. This holds great potential for expanding the use of our online search-based policy approach to tasks typically addressed by Imitation Learning or Reinforcement Learning-based policies.

- **Summary**: Neural style transfer (NST) has evolved significantly in recent years. Yet, despite its rapid progress and advancement, existing NST methods either struggle to transfer aesthetic information from a style effectively or suffer from high computational costs and inefficiencies in feature disentanglement due to using pre-trained models. This work proposes a lightweight but effective model, AesFA -- Aesthetic Feature-Aware NST. The primary idea is to decompose the image via its frequencies to better disentangle aesthetic styles from the reference image while training the entire model in an end-to-end manner to exclude pre-trained models at inference completely. To improve the network's ability to extract more distinct representations and further enhance the stylization quality, this work introduces a new aesthetic feature: contrastive loss. Extensive experiments and ablations show the approach not only outperforms recent NST methods in terms of stylization quality, but it also achieves faster inference.

- **Summary**: Real-time rendering of photorealistic and controllable human avatars stands as a cornerstone in Computer Vision and Graphics. While recent advances in neural implicit rendering have unlocked unprecedented photorealism for digital avatars, real-time performance has mostly been demonstrated for static scenes only. To address this, we propose ASH, an animatable Gaussian splatting approach for photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans in real-time. We parameterize the clothed human as animatable 3D Gaussians, which can be efficiently splatted into image space to generate the final rendering. However, naively learning the Gaussian parameters in 3D space poses a severe challenge in terms of compute. Instead, we attach the Gaussians onto a deformable character model, and learn their parameters in 2D texture space, which allows leveraging efficient 2D convolutional architectures that easily scale with the required number of Gaussians. We benchmark ASH with competing methods on pose-controllable avatars, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing real-time methods by a large margin and shows comparable or even better results than offline methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning in medical imaging often requires large-scale, high-quality data or initiation with suitably pre-trained weights. However, medical datasets are limited by data availability, domain-specific knowledge, and privacy concerns, and the creation of large and diverse radiologic databases like RadImageNet is highly resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce RadImageGAN, the first multi-modal radiologic data generator, which was developed by training StyleGAN-XL on the real RadImageNet dataset of 102,774 patients. RadImageGAN can generate high-resolution synthetic medical imaging datasets across 12 anatomical regions and 130 pathological classes in 3 modalities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RadImageGAN generators can be utilized with BigDatasetGAN to generate multi-class pixel-wise annotated paired synthetic images and masks for diverse downstream segmentation tasks with minimal manual annotation. We showed that using synthetic auto-labeled data from RadImageGAN can significantly improve performance on four diverse downstream segmentation datasets by augmenting real training data and/or developing pre-trained weights for fine-tuning. This shows that RadImageGAN combined with BigDatasetGAN can improve model performance and address data scarcity while reducing the resources needed for annotations for segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: With the advent of the pandemic, the use of video conferencing platforms as a means of communication has greatly increased and with it, so have the remote opportunities. The deaf and dumb have traditionally faced several issues in communication, but now the effect is felt more severely. This paper proposes an all-encompassing video conferencing utility that can be used with existing video conferencing platforms to address these issues. Appropriate semantically correct sentences are generated from the signer's gestures which would be interpreted by the system. Along with an audio to emit this sentence, the user's feed is also used to annotate the sentence. This can be viewed by all participants, thus aiding smooth communication with all parties involved. This utility utilizes a simple LSTM model for classification of gestures. The sentences are constructed by a t5 based model. In order to achieve the required data flow, a virtual camera is used.

- **Summary**: In federated learning (FL), data heterogeneity is one key bottleneck that causes model divergence and limits performance. Addressing this, existing methods often regard data heterogeneity as an inherent property and propose to mitigate its adverse effects by correcting models. In this paper, we seek to break this inherent property by generating data to complement the original dataset to fundamentally mitigate heterogeneity level. As a novel attempt from the perspective of data, we propose federated learning with consensus-oriented generation (FedCOG). FedCOG consists of two key components at the client side: complementary data generation, which generates data extracted from the shared global model to complement the original dataset, and knowledge-distillation-based model training, which distills knowledge from global model to local model based on the generated data to mitigate over-fitting the original heterogeneous dataset. FedCOG has two critical advantages: 1) it can be a plug-and-play module to further improve the performance of most existing FL methods, and 2) it is naturally compatible with standard FL protocols such as Secure Aggregation since it makes no modification in communication process. Extensive experiments on classical and real-world FL datasets show that FedCOG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Purpose: General consensus amongst researchers and industry points to a lack of large, representative annotated datasets as the biggest obstacle to progress in the field of surgical data science. Self-supervised learning represents a solution to part of this problem, removing the reliance on annotations. However, the robustness of current self-supervised learning methods to domain shifts remains unclear, limiting our understanding of its utility for leveraging diverse sources of surgical data. Methods: In this work, we employ self-supervised learning to flexibly leverage diverse surgical datasets, thereby learning taskagnostic representations that can be used for various surgical downstream tasks. Based on this approach, to elucidate the impact of pre-training on downstream task performance, we explore 22 different pre-training dataset combinations by modulating three variables: source hospital, type of surgical procedure, and pre-training scale (number of videos). We then finetune the resulting model initializations on three diverse downstream tasks: namely, phase recognition and critical view of safety in laparoscopic cholecystectomy and phase recognition in laparoscopic hysterectomy. Results: Controlled experimentation highlights sizable boosts in performance across various tasks, datasets, and labeling budgets. However, this performance is intricately linked to the composition of the pre-training dataset, robustly proven through several study stages. Conclusion: The composition of pre-training datasets can severely affect the effectiveness of SSL methods for various downstream tasks and should critically inform future data collection efforts to scale the application of SSL methodologies.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based quality assessments have significantly enhanced perceptual multimedia quality assessment, however it is still in the early stages for 3D visual data such as 3D point clouds (PCs). Due to the high volume of 3D-PCs, such quantities are frequently compressed for transmission and viewing, which may affect perceived quality. Therefore, we propose no-reference quality metric of a given 3D-PC. Comparing to existing methods that mostly focus on geometry or color aspects, we propose integrating frequency magnitudes as indicator of spatial degradation patterns caused by the compression. To map the input attributes to quality score, we use a light-weight hybrid deep model; combined of Deformable Convolutional Network (DCN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). Experiments are carried out on ICIP20 [1], PointXR [2] dataset, and a new big dataset called BASICS [3]. The results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art NR-PCQA measures and even some FR-PCQA on PointXR. The implementation code can be found at: https://github.com/o-messai/3D-PCQA

- **Summary**: Explainability is an aspect of modern AI that is vital for impact and usability in the real world. The main objective of this paper is to emphasise the need to understand the predictions of Computer Vision models, specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models. Existing methods of explaining CNN predictions are mostly based on Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM) and solely focus on a single target class. We show that from the point of the target class selection, we make an assumption on the prediction process, hence neglecting a large portion of the predictor CNN model's thinking process. In this paper, we present an exhaustive methodology called Fused Multi-class Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (FM-G-CAM) that considers multiple top predicted classes, which provides a holistic explanation of the predictor CNN's thinking rationale. We also provide a detailed and comprehensive mathematical and algorithmic description of our method. Furthermore, along with a concise comparison of existing methods, we compare FM-G-CAM with Grad-CAM, highlighting its benefits through real-world practical use cases. Finally, we present an open-source Python library with FM-G-CAM implementation to conveniently generate saliency maps for CNN-based model predictions.

- **Summary**: Neural fields have become widely used in various fields, from shape representation to neural rendering, and for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). With the advent of hybrid neural field representations like Instant NGP that leverage small MLPs and explicit representations, these models train quickly and can fit large scenes. Yet in many applications like rendering and simulation, hybrid neural fields can cause noticeable and unreasonable artifacts. This is because they do not yield accurate spatial derivatives needed for these downstream applications. In this work, we propose two ways to circumvent these challenges. Our first approach is a post hoc operator that uses local polynomial-fitting to obtain more accurate derivatives from pre-trained hybrid neural fields. Additionally, we also propose a self-supervised fine-tuning approach that refines the neural field to yield accurate derivatives directly while preserving the initial signal. We show the application of our method on rendering, collision simulation, and solving PDEs. We observe that using our approach yields more accurate derivatives, reducing artifacts and leading to more accurate simulations in downstream applications.

- **Summary**: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from MRI is key to investigating brain structure and function. While recent deep learning approaches have significantly improved the speed of CSR, a substantial amount of runtime is still needed to map the cortex to a topologically-correct spherical manifold to facilitate downstream geometric analyses. Moreover, this mapping is possible only if the topology of the surface mesh is homotopic to a sphere. Here, we present a method for simultaneous CSR and spherical mapping efficiently within seconds. Our approach seamlessly connects two sub-networks for white and pial surface generation. Residual diffeomorphic deformations are learned iteratively to gradually warp a spherical template mesh to the white and pial surfaces while preserving mesh topology and uniformity. The one-to-one vertex correspondence between the template sphere and the cortical surfaces allows easy and direct mapping of geometric features like convexity and curvature to the sphere for visualization and downstream processing. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on infant brain MRI, which poses significant challenges to CSR due to tissue contrast changes associated with rapid brain development during the first postnatal year. Performance evaluation based on a dataset of infants from 0 to 12 months demonstrates that our method substantially enhances mesh regularity and reduces geometric errors, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, all while maintaining high computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Estimating the relative camera pose from $n \geq 5$ correspondences between two calibrated views is a fundamental task in computer vision. This process typically involves two stages: 1) estimating the essential matrix between the views, and 2) disambiguating among the four candidate relative poses that satisfy the epipolar geometry. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel approach that, for the first time, bypasses the second stage. Specifically, we show that it is possible to directly estimate the correct relative camera pose from correspondences without needing a post-processing step to enforce the cheirality constraint on the correspondences. Building on recent advances in certifiable non-minimal optimization, we frame the relative pose estimation as a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP). By applying the appropriate constraints, we ensure the estimation of a camera pose that corresponds to a valid 3D geometry and that is globally optimal when certified. We validate our method through exhaustive synthetic and real-world experiments, confirming the efficacy, efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Learning-based monocular depth estimation leverages geometric priors present in the training data to enable metric depth perception from a single image, a traditionally ill-posed problem. However, these priors are often specific to a particular domain, leading to limited generalization performance on unseen data. Apart from the well studied environmental domain gap, monocular depth estimation is also sensitive to the domain gap induced by varying camera parameters, an aspect that is often overlooked in current state-of-the-art approaches. This issue is particularly evident in autonomous driving scenarios, where datasets are typically collected with a single vehicle-camera setup, leading to a bias in the training data due to a fixed perspective geometry. In this paper, we challenge this trend and introduce GenDepth, a novel model capable of performing metric depth estimation for arbitrary vehicle-camera setups. To address the lack of data with sufficiently diverse camera parameters, we first create a bespoke synthetic dataset collected with different vehicle-camera systems. Then, we design GenDepth to simultaneously optimize two objectives: (i) equivariance to the camera parameter variations on synthetic data, (ii) transferring the learned equivariance to real-world environmental features using a single real-world dataset with a fixed vehicle-camera system. To achieve this, we propose a novel embedding of camera parameters as the ground plane depth and present a novel architecture that integrates these embeddings with adversarial domain alignment. We validate GenDepth on several autonomous driving datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art generalization capability for different vehicle-camera systems.

- **Summary**: Despite diffusion models' superior capabilities in modeling complex distributions, there are still non-trivial distributional discrepancies between generated and ground-truth images, which has resulted in several notable problems in image generation, including missing object errors in text-to-image generation and low image quality. Existing methods that attempt to address these problems mostly do not tend to address the fundamental cause behind these problems, which is the distributional discrepancies, and hence achieve sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose a particle filtering framework that can effectively address both problems by explicitly reducing the distributional discrepancies. Specifically, our method relies on a set of external guidance, including a small set of real images and a pre-trained object detector, to gauge the distribution gap, and then design the resampling weight accordingly to correct the gap. Experiments show that our methods can effectively correct missing object errors and improve image quality in various image generation tasks. Notably, our method outperforms the existing strongest baseline by 5% in object occurrence and 1.0 in FID on MS-COCO.

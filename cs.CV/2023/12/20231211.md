- **Summary**: Global feature based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) models are often poorly localized when using Grad-CAM for attribute response analysis, which has a significant impact on the interpretability, generalizability and performance. Previous researches have attempted to improve generalization and interpretation through meticulous model design, yet they often have neglected or underutilized effective prior information crucial for PAR. To this end, a novel Scale and Spatial Priors Guided Network (SSPNet) is proposed for PAR, which is mainly composed of the Adaptive Feature Scale Selection (AFSS) and Prior Location Extraction (PLE) modules. The AFSS module learns to provide reasonable scale prior information for different attribute groups, allowing the model to focus on different levels of feature maps with varying semantic granularity. The PLE module reveals potential attribute spatial prior information, which avoids unnecessary attention on irrelevant areas and lowers the risk of model over-fitting. More specifically, the scale prior in AFSS is adaptively learned from different layers of feature pyramid with maximum accuracy, while the spatial priors in PLE can be revealed from part feature with different granularity (such as image blocks, human pose keypoint and sparse sampling points). Besides, a novel IoU based attribute localization metric is proposed for Weakly-supervised Pedestrian Attribute Localization (WPAL) based on the improved Grad-CAM for attribute response mask. The experimental results on the intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of mean accuracy (mA). Furthermore, it also achieves superior performance on the PCS dataset for attribute localization in terms of IoU. Code will be released at https://github.com/guotengg/SSPNet.

- **Summary**: In recent years, transformer-based models have dominated panoptic segmentation, thanks to their strong modeling capabilities and their unified representation for both semantic and instance classes as global binary masks. In this paper, we revisit pure convolution model and propose a novel panoptic architecture named MaskConver. MaskConver proposes to fully unify things and stuff representation by predicting their centers. To that extent, it creates a lightweight class embedding module that can break the ties when multiple centers co-exist in the same location. Furthermore, our study shows that the decoder design is critical in ensuring that the model has sufficient context for accurate detection and segmentation. We introduce a powerful ConvNeXt-UNet decoder that closes the performance gap between convolution- and transformerbased models. With ResNet50 backbone, our MaskConver achieves 53.6% PQ on the COCO panoptic val set, outperforming the modern convolution-based model, Panoptic FCN, by 9.3% as well as transformer-based models such as Mask2Former (+1.7% PQ) and kMaX-DeepLab (+0.6% PQ). Additionally, MaskConver with a MobileNet backbone reaches 37.2% PQ, improving over Panoptic-DeepLab by +6.4% under the same FLOPs/latency constraints. A further optimized version of MaskConver achieves 29.7% PQ, while running in real-time on mobile devices. The code and model weights will be publicly available

- **Summary**: We present an approach for analyzing grouping information contained within a neural network's activations, permitting extraction of spatial layout and semantic segmentation from the behavior of large pre-trained vision models. Unlike prior work, our method conducts a wholistic analysis of a network's activation state, leveraging features from all layers and obviating the need to guess which part of the model contains relevant information. Motivated by classic spectral clustering, we formulate this analysis in terms of an optimization objective involving a set of affinity matrices, each formed by comparing features within a different layer. Solving this optimization problem using gradient descent allows our technique to scale from single images to dataset-level analysis, including, in the latter, both intra- and inter-image relationships. Analyzing a pre-trained generative transformer provides insight into the computational strategy learned by such models. Equating affinity with key-query similarity across attention layers yields eigenvectors encoding scene spatial layout, whereas defining affinity by value vector similarity yields eigenvectors encoding object identity. This result suggests that key and query vectors coordinate attentional information flow according to spatial proximity (a `where' pathway), while value vectors refine a semantic category representation (a `what' pathway).

- **Summary**: Images produced by text-to-image diffusion models might not always faithfully represent the semantic intent of the provided text prompt, where the model might overlook or entirely fail to produce certain objects. Existing solutions often require customly tailored functions for each of these problems, leading to sub-optimal results, especially for complex prompts. Our work introduces a novel perspective by tackling this challenge in a contrastive context. Our approach intuitively promotes the segregation of objects in attention maps while also maintaining that pairs of related attributes are kept close to each other. We conduct extensive experiments across a wide variety of scenarios, each involving unique combinations of objects, attributes, and scenes. These experiments effectively showcase the versatility, efficiency, and flexibility of our method in working with both latent and pixel-based diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion and Imagen. Moreover, we publicly share our source code to facilitate further research.

- **Summary**: We propose a new framework that formulates point cloud registration as a denoising diffusion process from noisy transformation to object transformation. During training stage, object transformation diffuses from ground-truth transformation to random distribution, and the model learns to reverse this noising process. In sampling stage, the model refines randomly generated transformation to the output result in a progressive way. We derive the variational bound in closed form for training and provide implementations of the model. Our work provides the following crucial findings: (i) In contrast to most existing methods, our framework, Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Point Cloud Registration (PCRDiffusion) does not require repeatedly update source point cloud to refine the predicted transformation. (ii) Point cloud registration, one of the representative discriminative tasks, can be solved by a generative way and the unified probabilistic formulation. Finally, we discuss and provide an outlook on the application of diffusion model in different scenarios for point cloud registration. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in point cloud registration. In correspondence-free and correspondence-based scenarios, PCRDifussion can both achieve exceeding 50\% performance improvements.

- **Summary**: High-dimensional and complex spectral structures make the clustering of hyperspectral images (HSI) a challenging task. Subspace clustering is an effective approach for addressing this problem. However, current subspace clustering algorithms are primarily designed for a single view and do not fully exploit the spatial or textural feature information in HSI. In this study, contrastive multi-view subspace clustering of HSI was proposed based on graph convolutional networks. Pixel neighbor textural and spatial-spectral information were sent to construct two graph convolutional subspaces to learn their affinity matrices. To maximize the interaction between different views, a contrastive learning algorithm was introduced to promote the consistency of positive samples and assist the model in extracting robust features. An attention-based fusion module was used to adaptively integrate these affinity matrices, constructing a more discriminative affinity matrix. The model was evaluated using four popular HSI datasets: Indian Pines, Pavia University, Houston, and Xu Zhou. It achieved overall accuracies of 97.61%, 96.69%, 87.21%, and 97.65%, respectively, and significantly outperformed state-of-the-art clustering methods. In conclusion, the proposed model effectively improves the clustering accuracy of HSI.

- **Summary**: Real-world aerial scene understanding is limited by a lack of datasets that contain densely annotated images curated under a diverse set of conditions. Due to inherent challenges in obtaining such images in controlled real-world settings, we present SkyScenes, a synthetic dataset of densely annotated aerial images captured from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspectives. We carefully curate SkyScenes images from CARLA to comprehensively capture diversity across layout (urban and rural maps), weather conditions, times of day, pitch angles and altitudes with corresponding semantic, instance and depth annotations. Through our experiments using SkyScenes, we show that (1) Models trained on SkyScenes generalize well to different real-world scenarios, (2) augmenting training on real images with SkyScenes data can improve real-world performance, (3) controlled variations in SkyScenes can offer insights into how models respond to changes in viewpoint conditions, and (4) incorporating additional sensor modalities (depth) can improve aerial scene understanding.

- **Summary**: Obtaining large-scale radiology reports can be difficult for medical images due to various reasons, limiting the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training in the medical image domain and underscoring the need for alternative methods. In this paper, we propose eye-tracking as an alternative to text reports, as it allows for the passive collection of gaze signals without disturbing radiologist's routine diagnosis process. By tracking the gaze of radiologists as they read and diagnose medical images, we can understand their visual attention and clinical reasoning. When a radiologist has similar gazes for two medical images, it may indicate semantic similarity for diagnosis, and these images should be treated as positive pairs when pre-training a computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) network through contrastive learning. Accordingly, we introduce the Medical contrastive Gaze Image Pre-training (McGIP) as a plug-and-play module for contrastive learning frameworks. McGIP uses radiologist's gaze to guide contrastive pre-training. We evaluate our method using two representative types of medical images and two common types of gaze data. The experimental results demonstrate the practicality of McGIP, indicating its high potential for various clinical scenarios and applications.

- **Summary**: In climate science and meteorology, local precipitation predictions are limited by the immense computational costs induced by the high spatial resolution that simulation methods require. A common workaround is statistical downscaling (aka superresolution), where a low-resolution prediction is super-resolved using statistical approaches. While traditional computer vision tasks mainly focus on human perception or mean squared error, applications in weather and climate require capturing the conditional distribution of high-resolution patterns given low-resolution patterns so that reliable ensemble averages can be taken. Our approach relies on extending recent video diffusion models to precipitation superresolution: an optical flow on the high-resolution output induces temporally coherent predictions, whereas a temporally-conditioned diffusion model generates residuals that capture the correct noise characteristics and high-frequency patterns. We test our approach on X-SHiELD, an established large-scale climate simulation dataset, and compare against two state-of-the-art baselines, focusing on CRPS, MSE, precipitation distributions, as well as an illustrative case -- the complex terrain of California. Our approach sets a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling.

- **Summary**: Many deep learning based automated medical image segmentation systems, in reality, face difficulties in deployment due to the cost of massive data annotation and high latency in model iteration. We propose a dynamic interactive learning framework that addresses these challenges by integrating interactive segmentation into end-to-end weak supervised learning with streaming tasks. We develop novel replay and label smoothing schemes that overcome catastrophic forgetting and improve online learning robustness. For each image, our multi-round interactive segmentation module simultaneously optimizes both front-end predictions and deep learning segmenter. In each round, a 3D "proxy mask" is propagated from sparse user inputs based on image registration, serving as weak supervision that enable knowledge distillation from the unknown ground truth. In return, the trained segmenter explicitly guides next step's user interventions according to a spatial residual map from consecutive front or back-end predictions. Evaluation on 3D segmentation tasks (NCI-ISBI2013 and BraTS2015) shows that our framework generates online learning performances that match offline training benchmark. In addition, with a 62% reduction in total annotation efforts, our framework produces competitive dice scores comparing to online and offline learning which equipped with full ground truth. Furthermore, such a framework, with its flexibility and responsiveness, could be deployed behind hospital firewall that guarantees data security and easy maintenance.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Audio-Visual LLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model that takes both visual and auditory inputs for holistic video understanding. A key design is the modality-augmented training, which involves the integration of modality-specific tokens engineered to activate the appropriate visual and/or auditory encoder selectively. This mechanism is pivotal in enabling end-to-end joint training with video data at different modalities, including visual-only, audio-only, and audio-visual formats. Moreover, we introduce a high-quality video instruction dataset, derived from GPT-4. This dataset allows Audio-Visual LLM to adeptly process a variety of task-oriented video instructions, ranging from multi-turn conversations and audio-visual narratives to complex reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Audio-Visual LLM impressively achieves strong zero-shot results across a range of video understanding tasks. For example, Audio-Visual LLM achieves an accuracy of 53.7% on MSRVTT-QA, outperforming non-LLM-based InterVideo by 6.6% and LLM-based Valley by 4.4%, respectively. Additionally, our Audio-Visual LLM also achieves competitive performance on audio tasks (e.g., AudioCaps).

- **Summary**: Ancient history relies on the study of ancient characters. However, real-world scanned oracle characters are difficult to collect and annotate, posing a major obstacle for oracle character recognition (OrCR). Besides, serious abrasion and inter-class similarity also make OrCR more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method for OrCR, which enables to transfer knowledge from labeled handprinted oracle characters to unlabeled scanned data. We leverage pseudo-labeling to incorporate the semantic information into adaptation and constrain augmentation consistency to make the predictions of scanned samples consistent under different perturbations, leading to the model robustness to abrasion, stain and distortion. Simultaneously, an unsupervised transition loss is proposed to learn more discriminative features on the scanned domain by optimizing both between-class and within-class transition probability. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art result on Oracle-241 dataset and substantially outperforms the recently proposed structure-texture separation network by 15.1%.

- **Summary**: The ability to understand physical dynamics is essential to learning agents acting in the world. This paper presents Counterfactual World Modeling (CWM), a candidate pure vision foundational model for physical dynamics understanding. CWM consists of three basic concepts. First, we propose a simple and powerful temporally-factored masking policy for masked prediction of video data, which encourages the model to learn disentangled representations of scene appearance and dynamics. Second, as a result of the factoring, CWM is capable of generating counterfactual next-frame predictions by manipulating a few patch embeddings to exert meaningful control over scene dynamics. Third, the counterfactual modeling capability enables the design of counterfactual queries to extract vision structures similar to keypoints, optical flows, and segmentations, which are useful for dynamics understanding. We show that zero-shot readouts of these structures extracted by the counterfactual queries attain competitive performance to prior methods on real-world datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that CWM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Physion benchmark for evaluating physical dynamics understanding.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel two-stage approach for reconstructing human faces from sparse-view images, a task made challenging by the unique geometry and complex skin reflectance of each individual. Our method focuses on decomposing key facial attributes, including geometry, diffuse reflectance, and specular reflectance, from ambient light. Initially, we create a general facial template from a diverse collection of individual faces, capturing essential geometric and reflectance characteristics. Guided by this template, we refine each specific face model in the second stage, which further considers the interaction between geometry and reflectance, as well as the subsurface scattering effects on facial skin. Our method enables the reconstruction of high-quality facial representations from as few as three images, offering improved geometric accuracy and reflectance detail. Through comprehensive evaluations and comparisons, our method demonstrates superiority over existing techniques. Our method effectively disentangles geometry and reflectance components, leading to enhanced quality in synthesizing new views and opening up possibilities for applications such as relighting and reflectance editing. We will make the code publicly available.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), building upon the powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with exceptional reasoning and generalization capability, have opened up new avenues for embodied task planning. MLLMs excel in their ability to integrate diverse environmental inputs, such as real-time task progress, visual observations, and open-form language instructions, which are crucial for executable task planning. In this work, we introduce a benchmark with human annotations, EgoPlan-Bench, to quantitatively investigate the potential of MLLMs as embodied task planners in real-world scenarios. Our benchmark is distinguished by realistic tasks derived from real-world videos, a diverse set of actions involving interactions with hundreds of different objects, and complex visual observations from varied environments. We evaluate various open-source MLLMs, revealing that these models have not yet evolved into embodied planning generalists (even GPT-4V). We further construct an instruction-tuning dataset EgoPlan-IT from videos of human-object interactions, to facilitate the learning of high-level task planning in intricate real-world situations. The experiment results demonstrate that the model tuned on EgoPlan-IT not only significantly improves performance on our benchmark, but also effectively acts as embodied planner in simulations.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of social media has given rise to a new form of communication: memes. Memes are multimodal and often contain a combination of text and visual elements that convey meaning, humor, and cultural significance. While meme analysis has been an active area of research, little work has been done on unsupervised multimodal topic modeling of memes, which is important for content moderation, social media analysis, and cultural studies. We propose \textsf{PromptMTopic}, a novel multimodal prompt-based model designed to learn topics from both text and visual modalities by leveraging the language modeling capabilities of large language models. Our model effectively extracts and clusters topics learned from memes, considering the semantic interaction between the text and visual modalities. We evaluate our proposed model through extensive experiments on three real-world meme datasets, which demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art topic modeling baselines in learning descriptive topics in memes. Additionally, our qualitative analysis shows that \textsf{PromptMTopic} can identify meaningful and culturally relevant topics from memes. Our work contributes to the understanding of the topics and themes of memes, a crucial form of communication in today's society.\\ \red{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains sensitive content that may be disturbing to some readers.}}

- **Summary**: The rise of social media platforms has brought about a new digital culture called memes. Memes, which combine visuals and text, can strongly influence public opinions on social and cultural issues. As a result, people have become interested in categorizing memes, leading to the development of various datasets and multimodal models that show promising results in this field. However, there is currently a lack of a single library that allows for the reproduction, evaluation, and comparison of these models using fair benchmarks and settings. To fill this gap, we introduce the Meme Analytical Tool Kit (MATK), an open-source toolkit specifically designed to support existing memes datasets and cutting-edge multimodal models. MATK aims to assist researchers and engineers in training and reproducing these multimodal models for meme classification tasks, while also providing analysis techniques to gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

- **Summary**: Raw low light image enhancement (LLIE) has achieved much better performance than the sRGB domain enhancement methods due to the merits of raw data. However, the ambiguity between noisy to clean and raw to sRGB mappings may mislead the single-stage enhancement networks. The two-stage networks avoid ambiguity by decoupling the two mappings but usually have large computing complexity. To solve this problem, we propose a single-stage network empowered by Feature Domain Adaptation (FDA) to decouple the denoising and color mapping tasks in raw LLIE. The denoising encoder is supervised by the clean raw image, and then the denoised features are adapted for the color mapping task by an FDA module. We propose a Lineformer to serve as the FDA, which can well explore the global and local correlations with fewer line buffers (friendly to the line-based imaging process). During inference, the raw supervision branch is removed. In this way, our network combines the advantage of a two-stage enhancement process with the efficiency of single-stage inference. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer computing costs (60\% FLOPs of the two-stage method DNF). \textit{Our codes will be released after the acceptance of this work.}

- **Summary**: Conventional super-resolution (SR) schemes make heavy use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which involve intensive multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, and require specialized hardware such as graphics processing units. This contradicts the regime of edge AI that often runs on devices strained by power, computing, and storage resources. Such a challenge has motivated a series of lookup table (LUT)-based SR schemes that employ simple LUT readout and largely elude CNN computation. Nonetheless, the multi-megabyte LUTs in existing methods still prohibit on-chip storage and necessitate off-chip memory transport. This work tackles this storage hurdle and innovates hundred-kilobyte LUT (HKLUT) models amenable to on-chip cache. Utilizing an asymmetric two-branch multistage network coupled with a suite of specialized kernel patterns, HKLUT demonstrates an uncompromising performance and superior hardware efficiency over existing LUT schemes.

- **Summary**: Synthetic data (SIM) drawn from simulators have emerged as a popular alternative for training models where acquiring annotated real-world images is difficult. However, transferring models trained on synthetic images to real-world applications can be challenging due to appearance disparities. A commonly employed solution to counter this SIM2REAL gap is unsupervised domain adaptation, where models are trained using labeled SIM data and unlabeled REAL data. Mispredictions made by such SIM2REAL adapted models are often associated with miscalibration - stemming from overconfident predictions on real data. In this paper, we introduce AUGCAL, a simple training-time patch for unsupervised adaptation that improves SIM2REAL adapted models by - (1) reducing overall miscalibration, (2) reducing overconfidence in incorrect predictions and (3) improving confidence score reliability by better guiding misclassification detection - all while retaining or improving SIM2REAL performance. Given a base SIM2REAL adaptation algorithm, at training time, AUGCAL involves replacing vanilla SIM images with strongly augmented views (AUG intervention) and additionally optimizing for a training time calibration loss on augmented SIM predictions (CAL intervention). We motivate AUGCAL using a brief analytical justification of how to reduce miscalibration on unlabeled REAL data. Through our experiments, we empirically show the efficacy of AUGCAL across multiple adaptation methods, backbones, tasks and shifts.

- **Summary**: Modern Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enjoy the same vision vocabulary -- CLIP, which can cover most common vision tasks. However, for some special vision task that needs dense and fine-grained vision perception, e.g., document-level OCR or chart understanding, especially in non-English scenarios, the CLIP-style vocabulary may encounter low efficiency in tokenizing the vision knowledge and even suffer out-of-vocabulary problem. Accordingly, we propose Vary, an efficient and effective method to scale up the vision vocabulary of LVLMs. The procedures of Vary are naturally divided into two folds: the generation and integration of a new vision vocabulary. In the first phase, we devise a vocabulary network along with a tiny decoder-only transformer to produce the desired vocabulary via autoregression. In the next, we scale up the vanilla vision vocabulary by merging the new one with the original one (CLIP), enabling the LVLMs can quickly garner new features. Compared to the popular BLIP-2, MiniGPT4, and LLaVA, Vary can maintain its vanilla capabilities while enjoying more excellent fine-grained perception and understanding ability. Specifically, Vary is competent in new document parsing features (OCR or markdown conversion) while achieving 78.2% ANLS in DocVQA and 36.2% in MMVet. Our code will be publicly available on the homepage.

- **Summary**: We consider the critical issue of false negatives in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), a challenge that arises from the inherent many-to-many correspondence of image-text pairs in large-scale web-crawled datasets. The presence of false negatives can impede achieving optimal performance and even lead to learning failures. To address this challenge, we propose a method called COSMO (COnverting and SMOoothing false negatives) that manages the false negative issues, especially powerful in hard negative sampling. Building upon the recently developed GRouped mIni-baTch sampling (GRIT) strategy, our approach consists of two pivotal components: 1) an efficient connection mining process that identifies and converts false negatives into positives, and 2) label smoothing for the image-text contrastive loss (ITC). Our comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of COSMO across multiple downstream tasks, emphasizing the crucial role of addressing false negatives in VLP, potentially even surpassing the importance of addressing false positives. In addition, the compatibility of COSMO with the recent BLIP-family model is also demonstrated.

- **Summary**: Accurate and efficient object detection is crucial for safe and efficient operation of earth-moving equipment in mining. Traditional 2D image-based methods face limitations in dynamic and complex mine environments. To overcome these challenges, 3D object detection using point cloud data has emerged as a comprehensive approach. However, training models for mining scenarios is challenging due to sensor height variations, viewpoint changes, and the need for diverse annotated datasets. This paper presents novel contributions to address these challenges. We introduce a synthetic dataset SimMining 3D [1] specifically designed for 3D object detection in mining environments. The dataset captures objects and sensors positioned at various heights within mine benches, accurately reflecting authentic mining scenarios. An automatic annotation pipeline through ROS interface reduces manual labor and accelerates dataset creation. We propose evaluation metrics accounting for sensor-to-object height variations and point cloud density, enabling accurate model assessment in mining scenarios. Real data tests validate our models effectiveness in object prediction. Our ablation study emphasizes the importance of altitude and height variation augmentations in improving accuracy and reliability. The publicly accessible synthetic dataset [1] serves as a benchmark for supervised learning and advances object detection techniques in mining with complimentary pointwise annotations for each scene. In conclusion, our work bridges the gap between synthetic and real data, addressing the domain shift challenge in 3D object detection for mining. We envision robust object detection systems enhancing safety and efficiency in mining and related domains.

- **Summary**: In this work, we systematically study the problem of personalized text-to-image generation, where the output image is expected to portray information about specific human subjects. E.g., generating images of oneself appearing at imaginative places, interacting with various items, or engaging in fictional activities. To this end, we focus on text-to-image systems that input a single image of an individual to ground the generation process along with text describing the desired visual context. Our first contribution is to fill the literature gap by curating high-quality, appropriate data for this task. Namely, we introduce a standardized dataset (Stellar) that contains personalized prompts coupled with images of individuals that is an order of magnitude larger than existing relevant datasets and where rich semantic ground-truth annotations are readily available. Having established Stellar to promote cross-systems fine-grained comparisons further, we introduce a rigorous ensemble of specialized metrics that highlight and disentangle fundamental properties such systems should obey. Besides being intuitive, our new metrics correlate significantly more strongly with human judgment than currently used metrics on this task. Last but not least, drawing inspiration from the recent works of ELITE and SDXL, we derive a simple yet efficient, personalized text-to-image baseline that does not require test-time fine-tuning for each subject and which sets quantitatively and in human trials a new SoTA.

- **Summary**: 3D Single Object Tracking (SOT) stands a forefront task of computer vision, proving essential for applications like autonomous driving. Sparse and occluded data in scene point clouds introduce variations in the appearance of tracked objects, adding complexity to the task. In this research, we unveil M3SOT, a novel 3D SOT framework, which synergizes multiple input frames (template sets), multiple receptive fields (continuous contexts), and multiple solution spaces (distinct tasks) in ONE model. Remarkably, M3SOT pioneers in modeling temporality, contexts, and tasks directly from point clouds, revisiting a perspective on the key factors influencing SOT. To this end, we design a transformer-based network centered on point cloud targets in the search area, aggregating diverse contextual representations and propagating target cues by employing historical frames. As M3SOT spans varied processing perspectives, we've streamlined the network-trimming its depth and optimizing its structure-to ensure a lightweight and efficient deployment for SOT applications. We posit that, backed by practical construction, M3SOT sidesteps the need for complex frameworks and auxiliary components to deliver sterling results. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that M3SOT achieves state-of-the-art performance at 38 FPS.

- **Summary**: Generating multiview images from a single view facilitates the rapid generation of a 3D mesh conditioned on a single image. Recent methods that introduce 3D global representation into diffusion models have shown the potential to generate consistent multiviews, but they have reduced generation speed and face challenges in maintaining generalizability and quality. To address this issue, we propose EpiDiff, a localized interactive multiview diffusion model. At the core of the proposed approach is to insert a lightweight epipolar attention block into the frozen diffusion model, leveraging epipolar constraints to enable cross-view interaction among feature maps of neighboring views. The newly initialized 3D modeling module preserves the original feature distribution of the diffusion model, exhibiting compatibility with a variety of base diffusion models. Experiments show that EpiDiff generates 16 multiview images in just 12 seconds, and it surpasses previous methods in quality evaluation metrics, including PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. Additionally, EpiDiff can generate a more diverse distribution of views, improving the reconstruction quality from generated multiviews.

- **Summary**: Artistic style transfer aims to repaint the content image with the learned artistic style. Existing artistic style transfer methods can be divided into two categories: small model-based approaches and pre-trained large-scale model-based approaches. Small model-based approaches can preserve the content strucuture, but fail to produce highly realistic stylized images and introduce artifacts and disharmonious patterns; Pre-trained large-scale model-based approaches can generate highly realistic stylized images but struggle with preserving the content structure. To address the above issues, we propose ArtBank, a novel artistic style transfer framework, to generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving the content structure of the content images. Specifically, to sufficiently dig out the knowledge embedded in pre-trained large-scale models, an Implicit Style Prompt Bank (ISPB), a set of trainable parameter matrices, is designed to learn and store knowledge from the collection of artworks and behave as a visual prompt to guide pre-trained large-scale models to generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving content structure. Besides, to accelerate training the above ISPB, we propose a novel Spatial-Statistical-based self-Attention Module (SSAM). The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods.

- **Summary**: Siamese network-based trackers have shown remarkable success in aerial tracking. Most previous works, however, usually perform template matching only between the initial template and the search region and thus fail to deal with rapidly changing targets that often appear in aerial tracking. As a remedy, this work presents Building Appearance Collection Tracking (BACTrack). This simple yet effective tracking framework builds a dynamic collection of target templates online and performs efficient multi-template matching to achieve robust tracking. Specifically, BACTrack mainly comprises a Mixed-Temporal Transformer (MTT) and an appearance discriminator. The former is responsible for efficiently building relationships between the search region and multiple target templates in parallel through a mixed-temporal attention mechanism. At the same time, the appearance discriminator employs an online adaptive template-update strategy to ensure that the collected multiple templates remain reliable and diverse, allowing them to closely follow rapid changes in the target's appearance and suppress background interference during tracking. Extensive experiments show that our BACTrack achieves top performance on four challenging aerial tracking benchmarks while maintaining an impressive speed of over 87 FPS on a single GPU. Speed tests on embedded platforms also validate our potential suitability for deployment on UAV platforms.

- **Summary**: The massive growth of image-text data through web crawling inherently presents the challenge of variability in data quality. This paper introduces a novel algorithm, rooted in human knowledge, to compress this vast corpus of web-crawled image-text datasets to a compact and high-quality form. Our method unfolds in three major steps. First, we collect an image-text dataset, wherein each image is associated with multiple captions sourced from diverse origins. Then, to systemically capture human preferences regarding the best caption paired with each image, we establish a comprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria for critically guiding the alignment assessment from labelers. Lastly, we train a reward model on the annotated dataset to internalize the nuanced human understanding of image-text alignment. The resulting reward model thus can act as a human-like referee to filter misaligned/low-quality image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we are able to secure (or even improve) model performance by compressing the image-text datasets up to ~90%. An impressive example is that, by aggressively reducing the total training sample from 130M to 15.5M (e.g., ~9x smaller), our BLIP-B/16 models still consistently show superior performance compared with the full-size-dataset counterpart on image-text retrieval (Flickr30K, COCO) by ~2.5% in Recall@1, and on image-captioning (Nocaps, COCO) by ~10.0% in CIDEr and ~2.7% in SPICE.

- **Summary**: The current state-of-the-art No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) methods typically use feature extraction in upstream backbone networks, which assumes that all extracted features are relevant. However, we argue that not all features are beneficial, and some may even be harmful, necessitating careful selection. Empirically, we find that many image pairs with small feature spatial distances can have vastly different quality scores. To address this issue, we propose a Quality-Aware Feature Matching IQA metric(QFM-IQM) that employs contrastive learning to remove harmful features from the upstream task. Specifically, our approach enhances the semantic noise distinguish capabilities of neural networks by comparing image pairs with similar semantic features but varying quality scores and adaptively adjusting the upstream task's features by introducing disturbance. Furthermore, we utilize a distillation framework to expand the dataset and improve the model's generalization ability. Our approach achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods on 8 standard NR-IQA datasets, achieving PLCC values of 0.932 (vs. 0.908 in TID2013) and 0.913 (vs. 0.894 in LIVEC).

- **Summary**: Image restoration has always been a cutting-edge topic in the academic and industrial fields of computer vision. Since degradation signals are often random and diverse, "all-in-one" models that can do blind image restoration have been concerned in recent years. Early works require training specialized headers and tails to handle each degradation of concern, which are manually cumbersome. Recent works focus on learning visual prompts from data distribution to identify degradation type. However, the prompts employed in most of models are non-text, lacking sufficient emphasis on the importance of human-in-the-loop. In this paper, an effective textual prompt guided image restoration model has been proposed. In this model, task-specific BERT is fine-tuned to accurately understand user's instructions and generating textual prompt guidance. Depth-wise multi-head transposed attentions and gated convolution modules are designed to bridge the gap between textual prompts and visual features. The proposed model has innovatively introduced semantic prompts into low-level visual domain. It highlights the potential to provide a natural, precise, and controllable way to perform image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments have been done on public denoising, dehazing and deraining datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that, compared with popular state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model can obtain much more superior performance, achieving accurate recognition and removal of degradation without increasing model's complexity.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, the susceptibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) has garnered significant attention. Researchers are exploring patch-based physical attacks, yet traditional approaches, while effective, often result in conspicuous patches covering target objects. This leads to easy detection by human observers. Recently, novel camera-based physical attacks have emerged, leveraging camera patches to execute stealthy attacks. These methods circumvent target object modifications by introducing perturbations directly to the camera lens, achieving a notable breakthrough in stealthiness. However, prevailing camera-based strategies necessitate the deployment of multiple patches on the camera lens, which introduces complexity. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Camera Patch (ADCP).



### Implicit Shape Modeling for Anatomical Structure Refinement of Volumetric Medical Images

- **Summary**: Shape modeling of volumetric medical images is a critical task for quantitative analysis and surgical plans in computer-aided diagnosis. To relieve the burden of expert clinicians, the reconstructed shapes are widely acquired from deep learning models, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), followed by marching cube algorithm. However, automatically obtaining reconstructed shapes can not always achieve perfect results due to the limited resolution of images and lack of shape prior constraints. In this paper, we design a unified framework for the refinement of medical image segmentation on top of an implicit neural network. Specifically, To learn a sharable shape prior from different instances within the same category in the training phase, the physical information of volumetric medical images are firstly utilized to construct the Physical-Informed Continuous Coordinate Transform (PICCT). PICCT transforms the input data in an aligned manner fed into the implicit shape modeling. To better learn shape representation, we introduce implicit shape constraints on top of the signed distance function (SDF) into the implicit shape modeling of both instances and latent template. For the inference phase, a template interaction module (TIM) is proposed to refine initial results produced by CNNs via deforming deep implicit templates with latent codes. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach in shape refinement. The Chamfer Distance/Earth Mover's Distance achieved by the proposed method are 0.232/0.087 on the Liver dataset, 0.128/0.069 on the Pancreas dataset, and 0.417/0.100 on the Lung Lobe dataset.



### Bag of Tricks: Semi-Supervised Cross-domain Crater Detection with Poor Data Quality

- **Summary**: With the development of spaceflight and the exploration of extraterrestrial planets, exoplanet crater detection has gradually gained attention. However, with the current scarcity of relevant datasets, high sample background complexity, and large inter-domain differences, few existing detection models can achieve good robustness and generalization across domains by training on data with more background interference. To obtain a better robust model with better cross-domain generalization in the presence of poor data quality, we propose the SCPQ model, in which we first propose a method for fusing shallow information using attention mechanism (FSIAM), which utilizes feature maps fused with deep convolved feature maps after fully extracting the global sensory field of shallow information via the attention mechanism module, which can fully fit the data to obtain a better sense of the domain in the presence of poor data, and thus better multiscale adaptability. Secondly, we propose a pseudo-label and data augment strategy (PDAS) and a smooth hard example mining (SHEM) loss function to improve cross-domain performance. PDAS adopts high-quality pseudo-labeled data from the target domain to the finetune model, and adopts different strong and weak data enhancement strategies for different domains, which mitigates the different distribution of information inherent in the source and target domains, and obtains a better generalization effect. Meanwhile, our proposed SHEM loss function can solve the problem of poor robustness of hard examples due to partial background interference learning during the training process. The SHEM loss function can smooth this interference and has generalization while learning hard examples. Experimental results show that we achieved better performance on the DACD dataset and improved the Recall of cross-domain detection by 24.04\% over baseline.

- **Summary**: Uveitis demands the precise diagnosis of anterior chamber inflammation (ACI) for optimal treatment. However, current diagnostic methods only rely on a limited single-modal disease perspective, which leads to poor performance. In this paper, we investigate a promising yet challenging way to fuse multimodal data for ACI diagnosis. Notably, existing fusion paradigms focus on empowering implicit modality interactions (i.e., self-attention and its variants), but neglect to inject explicit modality interactions, especially from clinical knowledge and imaging property. To this end, we propose a jointly Explicit and implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network (EiCI-Net) for Anterior Chamber Inflammation Diagnosis that uses anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images, slit-lamp images, and clinical data jointly. Specifically, we first develop CNN-Based Encoders and Tabular Processing Module (TPM) to extract efficient feature representations in different modalities. Then, we devise an Explicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module (ECIM) to generate attention maps as a kind of explicit clinical knowledge based on the tabular feature maps, then integrated them into the slit-lamp feature maps, allowing the CNN-Based Encoder to focus on more effective informativeness of the slit-lamp images. After that, the Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module (ICIM), a transformer-based network, further implicitly enhances modality interactions. Finally, we construct a considerable real-world dataset from our collaborative hospital and conduct sufficient experiments to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed EiCI-Net compared with the state-of-the-art classification methods in various metrics.

- **Summary**: Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval (MMIR) as a flexible search paradigm has attracted wide attention. However, previous approaches always achieve limited performance, due to two critical factors are seriously overlooked. 1) The contribution of image and text modalities is different, but incorrectly treated equally. 2) There exist inherent labeling noises in describing users' intentions with text in web datasets from diverse real-world scenarios, giving rise to overfitting. We propose a Dynamic Weighted Combiner (DWC) to tackle the above challenges, which includes three merits. First, we propose an Editable Modality De-equalizer (EMD) by taking into account the contribution disparity between modalities, containing two modality feature editors and an adaptive weighted combiner. Second, to alleviate labeling noises and data bias, we propose a dynamic soft-similarity label generator (SSG) to implicitly improve noisy supervision. Finally, to bridge modality gaps and facilitate similarity learning, we propose a CLIP-based mutual enhancement module alternately trained by a mixed-modality contrastive loss. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Radiation therapy serves as an effective and standard method for cancer treatment. Excellent radiation therapy plans always rely on high-quality dose distribution maps obtained through repeated trial and error by experienced experts. However, due to individual differences and complex clinical situations, even seasoned expert teams may need help to achieve the best treatment plan every time quickly. Many automatic dose distribution prediction methods have been proposed recently to accelerate the radiation therapy planning process and have achieved good results. However, these results suffer from over-smoothing issues, with the obtained dose distribution maps needing more high-frequency details, limiting their clinical application. To address these limitations, we propose a dose prediction diffusion model based on SwinTransformer and a projector, SP-DiffDose. To capture the direct correlation between anatomical structure and dose distribution maps, SP-DiffDose uses a structural encoder to extract features from anatomical images, then employs a conditional diffusion process to blend noise and anatomical images at multiple scales and gradually map them to dose distribution maps. To enhance the dose prediction distribution for organs at risk, SP-DiffDose utilizes SwinTransformer in the deeper layers of the network to capture features at different scales in the image. To learn good representations from the fused features, SP-DiffDose passes the fused features through a designed projector, improving dose prediction accuracy. Finally, we evaluate SP-DiffDose on an internal dataset. The results show that SP-DiffDose outperforms existing methods on multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating the superiority and generalizability of our method.

- **Summary**: Manually tracking nutritional intake via food diaries is error-prone and burdensome. Automated computer vision techniques show promise for dietary monitoring but require large and diverse food image datasets. To address this need, we introduce NutritionVerse-Synth (NV-Synth), a large-scale synthetic food image dataset. NV-Synth contains 84,984 photorealistic meal images rendered from 7,082 dynamically plated 3D scenes. Each scene is captured from 12 viewpoints and includes perfect ground truth annotations such as RGB, depth, semantic, instance, and amodal segmentation masks, bounding boxes, and detailed nutritional information per food item. We demonstrate the diversity of NV-Synth across foods, compositions, viewpoints, and lighting. As the largest open-source synthetic food dataset, NV-Synth highlights the value of physics-based simulations for enabling scalable and controllable generation of diverse photorealistic meal images to overcome data limitations and drive advancements in automated dietary assessment using computer vision. In addition to the dataset, the source code for our data generation framework is also made publicly available at https://saeejithnair.github.io/nvsynth.

- **Summary**: In this work, we focus on exploring explicit fine-grained control of generative facial image editing, all while generating faithful and consistent personalized facial appearances. We identify the key challenge of this task as the exploration of disentangled conditional control in the generation process, and accordingly propose a novel diffusion-based framework, named DisControlFace, comprising two decoupled components. Specifically, we leverage an off-the-shelf diffusion reconstruction model as the backbone and freeze its pre-trained weights, which helps to reduce identity shift and recover editing-unrelated details of the input image. Furthermore, we construct a parallel control network that is compatible with the reconstruction backbone to generate spatial control conditions based on estimated explicit face parameters. Finally, we further reformulate the training pipeline into a masked-autoencoding form to effectively achieve disentangled training of our DisControlFace. Our DisControlNet can perform robust editing on any facial image through training on large-scale 2D in-the-wild portraits and also supports low-cost fine-tuning with few additional images to further learn diverse personalized priors of a specific person. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisControlFace can generate realistic facial images corresponding to various face control conditions, while significantly improving the preservation of the personalized facial details.

- **Summary**: We present a novel multimodal dataset developed by expert astronomers to automate the detection and localisation of multi-component extended radio galaxies and their corresponding infrared hosts. The dataset comprises 4,155 instances of galaxies in 2,800 images with both radio and infrared modalities. Each instance contains information on the extended radio galaxy class, its corresponding bounding box that encompasses all of its components, pixel-level segmentation mask, and the position of its corresponding infrared host galaxy. Our dataset is the first publicly accessible dataset that includes images from a highly sensitive radio telescope, infrared satellite, and instance-level annotations for their identification. We benchmark several object detection algorithms on the dataset and propose a novel multimodal approach to identify radio galaxies and the positions of infrared hosts simultaneously.

- **Summary**: Generating multi-view images from a single input view using image-conditioned diffusion models is a recent advancement and has shown considerable potential. However, issues such as the lack of consistency in synthesized views and over-smoothing in extracted geometry persist. Previous methods integrate multi-view consistency modules or impose additional supervisory to enhance view consistency while compromising on the flexibility of camera positioning and limiting the versatility of view synthesis. In this study, we consider the radiance field optimized during geometry extraction as a more rigid consistency prior, compared to volume and ray aggregation used in previous works. We further identify and rectify a critical bias in the traditional radiance field optimization process through score distillation from a multi-view diffuser. We introduce an Unbiased Score Distillation (USD) that utilizes unconditioned noises from a 2D diffusion model, greatly refining the radiance field fidelity. we leverage the rendered views from the optimized radiance field as the basis and develop a two-step specialization process of a 2D diffusion model, which is adept at conducting object-specific denoising and generating high-quality multi-view images. Finally, we recover faithful geometry and texture directly from the refined multi-view images. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our optimized geometry and view distillation technique generates comparable results to the state-of-the-art models trained on extensive datasets, all while maintaining freedom in camera positioning.

- **Summary**: Adversarial transferability enables black-box attacks on unknown victim deep neural networks (DNNs), rendering attacks viable in real-world scenarios. Current transferable attacks create adversarial perturbation over the entire image, resulting in excessive noise that overfit the source model. Concentrating perturbation to dominant image regions that are model-agnostic is crucial to improving adversarial efficacy. However, limiting perturbation to local regions in the spatial domain proves inadequate in augmenting transferability. To this end, we propose a transferable adversarial attack with fine-grained perturbation optimization in the frequency domain, creating centralized perturbation. We devise a systematic pipeline to dynamically constrain perturbation optimization to dominant frequency coefficients. The constraint is optimized in parallel at each iteration, ensuring the directional alignment of perturbation optimization with model prediction. Our approach allows us to centralize perturbation towards sample-specific important frequency features, which are shared by DNNs, effectively mitigating source model overfitting. Experiments demonstrate that by dynamically centralizing perturbation on dominating frequency coefficients, crafted adversarial examples exhibit stronger transferability, and allowing them to bypass various defenses.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models trained on large datasets can synthesize photo-realistic images of remarkable quality and diversity. However, attributing these images back to the training data-that is, identifying specific training examples which caused an image to be generated-remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework that: (i) provides a formal notion of data attribution in the context of diffusion models, and (ii) allows us to counterfactually validate such attributions. Then, we provide a method for computing these attributions efficiently. Finally, we apply our method to find (and evaluate) such attributions for denoising diffusion probabilistic models trained on CIFAR-10 and latent diffusion models trained on MS COCO. We provide code at https://github.com/MadryLab/journey-TRAK .

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present a novel end-to-end method for long-form video temporal grounding to locate specific moments described by natural language queries. Prior long-video methods for this task typically contain two stages: proposal selection and grounding regression. However, the proposal selection of these methods is disjoint from the grounding network and is not trained end-to-end, which limits the effectiveness of these methods. Moreover, these methods operate uniformly over the entire temporal window, which is suboptimal given redundant and irrelevant features in long videos. In contrast to these prior approaches, we introduce RGNet, a unified network designed for jointly selecting proposals from hour-long videos and locating moments specified by natural language queries within them. To achieve this, we redefine proposal selection as a video-text retrieval task, i.e., retrieving the correct candidate videos given a text query. The core component of RGNet is a unified cross-modal RG-Encoder that bridges the two stages with shared features and mutual optimization. The encoder strategically focuses on relevant time frames using a sparse sampling technique. RGNet outperforms previous methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on long video temporal grounding datasets MAD and Ego4D. The code is released at https://github.com/Tanveer81/RGNet

- **Summary**: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) poses a significant challenge in training a well-generalized model while avoiding overfitting to corrupted labels. Recent advances have achieved impressive performance by identifying clean labels and correcting corrupted labels for training. However, the current approaches rely heavily on the model's predictions and evaluate each sample independently without considering either the global and local structure of the sample distribution. These limitations typically result in a suboptimal solution for the identification and correction processes, which eventually leads to models overfitting to incorrect labels. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal transport (OT) formulation, called Curriculum and Structure-aware Optimal Transport (CSOT). CSOT concurrently considers the inter- and intra-distribution structure of the samples to construct a robust denoising and relabeling allocator. During the training process, the allocator incrementally assigns reliable labels to a fraction of the samples with the highest confidence. These labels have both global discriminability and local coherence. Notably, CSOT is a new OT formulation with a nonconvex objective function and curriculum constraints, so it is not directly compatible with classical OT solvers. Here, we develop a lightspeed computational method that involves a scaling iteration within a generalized conditional gradient framework to solve CSOT efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over the current state-of-the-arts in LNL. Code is available at https://github.com/changwxx/CSOT-for-LNL.

- **Summary**: Medical Vision Language Pretraining (VLP) has recently emerged as a promising solution to the scarcity of labeled data in the medical domain. By leveraging paired/unpaired vision and text datasets through self-supervised learning, models can be trained to acquire vast knowledge and learn robust feature representations. Such pretrained models have the potential to enhance multiple downstream medical tasks simultaneously, reducing the dependency on labeled data. However, despite recent progress and its potential, there is no such comprehensive survey paper that has explored the various aspects and advancements in medical VLP. In this paper, we specifically review existing works through the lens of different pretraining objectives, architectures, downstream evaluation tasks, and datasets utilized for pretraining and downstream tasks. Subsequently, we delve into current challenges in medical VLP, discussing existing and potential solutions, and conclude by highlighting future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey focused on medical VLP.

- **Summary**: This paper considers the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem under the setting that both style distribution shift and spurious features exist and domain labels are missing. This setting frequently arises in real-world applications and is underlooked because previous approaches mainly handle either of these two factors. The critical challenge is decoupling style and spurious features in the absence of domain labels. To address this challenge, we first propose a structural causal model (SCM) for the image generation process, which captures both style distribution shift and spurious features. The proposed SCM enables us to design a new framework called IRSS, which can gradually separate style distribution and spurious features from images by introducing adversarial neural networks and multi-environment optimization, thus achieving OOD generalization. Moreover, it does not require additional supervision (e.g., domain labels) other than the images and their corresponding labels. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that IRSS outperforms traditional OOD methods and solves the problem of Invariant risk minimization (IRM) degradation, enabling the extraction of invariant features under distribution shift.

- **Summary**: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) aims to generate clear images from low-quality underwater images. Due to the unavailability of clear reference images, researchers often synthesize them to construct paired datasets for training deep models. However, these synthesized images may sometimes lack quality, adversely affecting training outcomes. To address this issue, we propose UIE with Diffusion Prior (UIEDP), a novel framework treating UIE as a posterior distribution sampling process of clear images conditioned on degraded underwater inputs. Specifically, UIEDP combines a pre-trained diffusion model capturing natural image priors with any existing UIE algorithm, leveraging the latter to guide conditional generation. The diffusion prior mitigates the drawbacks of inferior synthetic images, resulting in higher-quality image generation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our UIEDP yields significant improvements across various metrics, especially no-reference image quality assessment. And the generated enhanced images also exhibit a more natural appearance.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding human instructions, driving the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) with instruction tuning. However, acquiring high-quality multimodal instruction tuning data poses a significant challenge. Previous approaches relying on GPT-4 for data generation proved expensive and exhibited unsatisfactory performance for certain tasks. To solve this, we present Genixer, an innovative data generation pipeline producing high-quality multimodal instruction tuning data for various tasks. Genixer collects datasets for ten prevalent multimodal tasks and designs instruction templates to transform these datasets into instruction-tuning data. It then trains pretrained MLLMs to generate task-specific instruction data and proposes an effective data filtering strategy to ensure high quality. To evaluate Genixer, a base MLLM model, Kakapo, is built and achieves SoTA performance in image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks across multiple datasets. Experimental results show that filtered data from Genixer continually improves Kakapo for image captioning and VQA tasks. For the SoTA Shikra MLLM model on the image-region-related tasks, e.g., region caption and detection, Genixer also successfully generates corresponding data and improves its performance. Genixer opens avenues for generating high-quality multimodal instruction data for diverse tasks, enabling innovative applications across domains. The code and models will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation has attracted a lot of attention due to its ability to alleviate the heavy reliance on fine-grained annotations of point clouds. However, in practice, sparse annotation usually exhibits a distinct non-uniform distribution in point cloud, which poses challenges for weak supervision. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive annotation distribution method for weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the probability density function into the gradient sampling approximation analysis and investigate the impact of sparse annotations distributions. Based on our analysis, we propose a label-aware point cloud downsampling strategy to increase the proportion of annotations involved in the training stage. Furthermore, we design the multiplicative dynamic entropy as the gradient calibration function to mitigate the gradient bias caused by non-uniformly distributed sparse annotations and explicitly reduce the epistemic uncertainty. Without any prior restrictions and additional information, our proposed method achieves comprehensive performance improvements at multiple label rates with different annotation distributions on S3DIS, ScanNetV2 and SemanticKITTI.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation has witnessed remarkable advancements with the adaptation of the Transformer architecture. Parallel to the strides made by the Transformer, CNN-based U-Net has seen significant progress, especially in high-resolution medical imaging and remote sensing. This dual success inspired us to merge the strengths of both, leading to the inception of a U-Net-based vision transformer decoder tailored for efficient contextual encoding. Here, we propose a novel transformer decoder, U-MixFormer, built upon the U-Net structure, designed for efficient semantic segmentation. Our approach distinguishes itself from the previous transformer methods by leveraging lateral connections between the encoder and decoder stages as feature queries for the attention modules, apart from the traditional reliance on skip connections. Moreover, we innovatively mix hierarchical feature maps from various encoder and decoder stages to form a unified representation for keys and values, giving rise to our unique mix-attention module. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various configurations. Extensive experiments show that U-MixFormer outperforms SegFormer, FeedFormer, and SegNeXt by a large margin. For example, U-MixFormer-B0 surpasses SegFormer-B0 and FeedFormer-B0 with 3.8% and 2.0% higher mIoU and 27.3% and 21.8% less computation and outperforms SegNext with 3.3% higher mIoU with MSCAN-T encoder on ADE20K.

- **Summary**: The deep model training procedure requires large-scale datasets of annotated data. Due to the difficulty of annotating a large number of samples, label noise caused by incorrect annotations is inevitable, resulting in low model performance and poor model generalization. To combat label noise, current methods usually select clean samples based on the small-loss criterion and use these samples for training. Due to some noisy samples similar to clean ones, these small-loss criterion-based methods are still affected by label noise. To address this issue, in this work, we propose Regroup Median Loss (RML) to reduce the probability of selecting noisy samples and correct losses of noisy samples. RML randomly selects samples with the same label as the training samples based on a new loss processing method. Then, we combine the stable mean loss and the robust median loss through a proposed regrouping strategy to obtain robust loss estimation for noisy samples. To further improve the model performance against label noise, we propose a new sample selection strategy and build a semi-supervised method based on RML. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, for both the traditionally trained and semi-supervised models, RML achieves a significant improvement on synthetic and complex real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Applying pre-trained medical segmentation models on out-of-domain images often yields predictions of insufficient quality. Several strategies have been proposed to maintain model performance, such as finetuning or unsupervised- and source-free domain adaptation. These strategies set restrictive requirements for data availability. In this study, we propose to combine domain generalization and test-time adaptation to create a highly effective approach for reusing pre-trained models in unseen target domains. Domain-generalized pre-training on source data is used to obtain the best initial performance in the target domain. We introduce the MIND descriptor previously used in image registration tasks as a further technique to achieve generalization and present superior performance for small-scale datasets compared to existing approaches. At test-time, high-quality segmentation for every single unseen scan is ensured by optimizing the model weights for consistency given different image augmentations. That way, our method enables separate use of source and target data and thus removes current data availability barriers. Moreover, the presented method is highly modular as it does not require specific model architectures or prior knowledge of involved domains and labels. We demonstrate this by integrating it into the nnUNet, which is currently the most popular and accurate framework for medical image segmentation. We employ multiple datasets covering abdominal, cardiac, and lumbar spine scans and compose several out-of-domain scenarios in this study. We demonstrate that our method, combined with pre-trained whole-body CT models, can effectively segment MR images with high accuracy in all of the aforementioned scenarios.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models achieve remarkable quality in image generation, but at a cost. Iterative denoising requires many time steps to produce high fidelity images. We argue that the denoising process is crucially limited by an accumulation of the reconstruction error due to an initial inaccurate reconstruction of the target data. This leads to lower quality outputs, and slower convergence. To address this issue, we propose compensation sampling to guide the generation towards the target domain. We introduce a compensation term, implemented as a U-Net, which adds negligible computation overhead during training and, optionally, inference. Our approach is flexible and we demonstrate its application in unconditional generation, face inpainting, and face de-occlusion using benchmark datasets CIFAR-10, CelebA, CelebA-HQ, FFHQ-256, and FSG. Our approach consistently yields state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality, while accelerating the denoising process to converge during training by up to an order of magnitude.

- **Summary**: LiDAR Upsampling is a challenging task for the perception systems of robots and autonomous vehicles, due to the sparse and irregular structure of large-scale scene contexts. Recent works propose to solve this problem by converting LiDAR data from 3D Euclidean space into an image super-resolution problem in 2D image space. Although their methods can generate high-resolution range images with fine-grained details, the resulting 3D point clouds often blur out details and predict invalid points. In this paper, we propose TULIP, a new method to reconstruct high-resolution LiDAR point clouds from low-resolution LiDAR input. We also follow a range image-based approach but specifically modify the patch and window geometries of a Swin-Transformer-based network to better fit the characteristics of range images. We conducted several experiments on three different public real-world and simulated datasets. TULIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all relevant metrics and generates robust and more realistic point clouds than prior works.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the landscape of computer-assisted interventions and post-operative surgical video analysis has been dramatically reshaped by deep-learning techniques, resulting in significant advancements in surgeons' skills, operation room management, and overall surgical outcomes. However, the progression of deep-learning-powered surgical technologies is profoundly reliant on large-scale datasets and annotations. Particularly, surgical scene understanding and phase recognition stand as pivotal pillars within the realm of computer-assisted surgery and post-operative assessment of cataract surgery videos. In this context, we present the largest cataract surgery video dataset that addresses diverse requisites for constructing computerized surgical workflow analysis and detecting post-operative irregularities in cataract surgery. We validate the quality of annotations by benchmarking the performance of several state-of-the-art neural network architectures for phase recognition and surgical scene segmentation. Besides, we initiate the research on domain adaptation for instrument segmentation in cataract surgery by evaluating cross-domain instrument segmentation performance in cataract surgery videos. The dataset and annotations will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to novel object captioning which employs relative contrastive learning to learn visual and semantic alignment. Our approach maximizes compatibility between regions and object tags in a contrastive manner. To set up a proper contrastive learning objective, for each image, we augment tags by leveraging the relative nature of positive and negative pairs obtained from foundation models such as CLIP. We then use the rank of each augmented tag in a list as a relative relevance label to contrast each top-ranked tag with a set of lower-ranked tags. This learning objective encourages the top-ranked tags to be more compatible with their image and text context than lower-ranked tags, thus improving the discriminative ability of the learned multi-modality representation. We evaluate our approach on two datasets and show that our proposed RCA-NOC approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving vision-language representation for novel object captioning.

- **Summary**: Precipitation nowcasting is an important spatio-temporal prediction task to predict the radar echoes sequences based on current observations, which can serve both meteorological science and smart city applications. Due to the chaotic evolution nature of the precipitation systems, it is a very challenging problem. Previous studies address the problem either from the perspectives of deterministic modeling or probabilistic modeling. However, their predictions suffer from the blurry, high-value echoes fading away and position inaccurate issues. The root reason of these issues is that the chaotic evolutionary precipitation systems are not appropriately modeled. Inspired by the nature of the systems, we propose to decompose and model them from the perspective of global deterministic motion and local stochastic variations with residual mechanism. A unified and flexible framework that can equip any type of spatio-temporal models is proposed based on residual diffusion, which effectively tackles the shortcomings of previous methods. Extensive experimental results on four publicly available radar datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework, compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Our code will be made publicly available soon.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the often overlooked issue of fairness in the autonomous driving domain, particularly in vision-based perception and prediction systems, which play a pivotal role in the overall functioning of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). We focus our analysis on biases present in some of the most commonly used visual datasets for training person and vehicle detection systems. We introduce an annotation methodology and a specialised annotation tool, both designed to annotate protected attributes of agents in visual datasets. We validate our methodology through an inter-rater agreement analysis and provide the distribution of attributes across all datasets. These include annotations for the attributes age, sex, skin tone, group, and means of transport for more than 90K people, as well as vehicle type, colour, and car type for over 50K vehicles. Generally, diversity is very low for most attributes, with some groups, such as children, wheelchair users, or personal mobility vehicle users, being extremely underrepresented in the analysed datasets. The study contributes significantly to efforts to consider fairness in the evaluation of perception and prediction systems for AVs. This paper follows reproducibility principles. The annotation tool, scripts and the annotated attributes can be accessed publicly at https://github.com/ec-jrc/humaint_annotator.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning has attracted much attention due to its less dependence on acquiring abundant annotations from experts compared to fully supervised methods, which is especially important for medical image segmentation which typically requires intensive pixel/voxel-wise labeling by domain experts. Although semi-supervised methods can improve the performance by utilizing unlabeled data, there are still gaps between fully supervised methods under extremely limited annotation scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient strategy to explore the usage of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for enhancing semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Concretely, the segmentation model trained with domain knowledge provides information for localization and generating input prompts to the SAM. Then the generated pseudo-labels of SAM are utilized as additional supervision to assist in the learning procedure of the semi-supervised framework. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM's assistance significantly enhances the performance of existing semi-supervised frameworks, especially when only one or a few labeled images are available.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning has become a prevalent strategy for adapting vision-language foundation models to downstream tasks. As large language models (LLMs) have emerged, recent studies have explored the use of category-related descriptions as input to enhance prompt effectiveness. Nevertheless, conventional descriptions fall short of structured information that effectively represents the interconnections among entities or attributes linked to a particular category. To address this limitation and prioritize harnessing structured knowledge, this paper advocates for leveraging LLMs to build a graph for each description to model the entities and attributes describing the category, as well as their correlations. Preexisting prompt tuning methods exhibit inadequacies in managing this structured knowledge. Consequently, we propose a novel approach called Hierarchical Prompt Tuning (HPT), which enables simultaneous modeling of both structured and conventional linguistic knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a relationship-guided attention module to capture pair-wise associations among entities and attributes for low-level prompt learning. In addition, by incorporating high-level and global-level prompts modeling overall semantics, the proposed hierarchical structure forges cross-level interlinks and empowers the model to handle more complex and long-term relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HPT shows strong effectiveness and generalizes much better than existing SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, human actions often fall outside the distribution of training data, making it crucial for models to recognize known actions and reject unknown ones. However, using pure skeleton data in such open-set conditions poses challenges due to the lack of visual background cues and the distinct sparse structure of body pose sequences. In this paper, we tackle the unexplored Open-Set Skeleton-based Action Recognition (OS-SAR) task and formalize the benchmark on three skeleton-based datasets. We assess the performance of seven established open-set approaches on our task and identify their limits and critical generalization issues when dealing with skeleton information. To address these challenges, we propose a distance-based cross-modality ensemble method that leverages the cross-modal alignment of skeleton joints, bones, and velocities to achieve superior open-set recognition performance. We refer to the key idea as CrossMax - an approach that utilizes a novel cross-modality mean max discrepancy suppression mechanism to align latent spaces during training and a cross-modality distance-based logits refinement method during testing. CrossMax outperforms existing approaches and consistently yields state-of-the-art results across all datasets and backbones. The benchmark, code, and models will be released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/OS-SAR.

- **Summary**: Presently, self-training stands as a prevailing approach in cross-domain semantic segmentation, enhancing model efficacy by training with pixels assigned with reliable pseudo-labels. However, we find two critical limitations in this paradigm. (1) The majority of reliable pixels exhibit a speckle-shaped pattern and are primarily located in the central semantic region. This presents challenges for the model in accurately learning semantics. (2) Category noise in speckle pixels is difficult to locate and correct, leading to error accumulation in self-training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called Semantic Connectivity-driven pseudo-labeling (SeCo). This approach formulates pseudo-labels at the connectivity level and thus can facilitate learning structured and low-noise semantics. Specifically, SeCo comprises two key components: Pixel Semantic Aggregation (PSA) and Semantic Connectivity Correction (SCC). Initially, PSA divides semantics into 'stuff' and 'things' categories and aggregates speckled pseudo-labels into semantic connectivity through efficient interaction with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This enables us not only to obtain accurate boundaries but also simplifies noise localization. Subsequently, SCC introduces a simple connectivity classification task, which enables locating and correcting connectivity noise with the guidance of loss distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeCo can be flexibly applied to various cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks, including traditional unsupervised, source-free, and black-box domain adaptation, significantly improving the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/DZhaoXd/SeCo.

- **Summary**: Various methods have been proposed for utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in autonomous driving. One strategy of using LLMs for autonomous driving involves inputting surrounding objects as text prompts to the LLMs, along with their coordinate and velocity information, and then outputting the subsequent movements of the vehicle. When using LLMs for such purposes, capabilities such as spatial recognition and planning are essential. In particular, two foundational capabilities are required: (1) spatial-aware decision making, which is the ability to recognize space from coordinate information and make decisions to avoid collisions, and (2) the ability to adhere to traffic rules. However, quantitative research has not been conducted on how accurately different types of LLMs can handle these problems. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated these two abilities of LLMs in the context of autonomous driving. Furthermore, to conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) for the feasibility of implementing these abilities in actual vehicles, we developed a system that uses LLMs to drive a vehicle.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is one of the most important tasks in autonomous driving, which requires accurate recognition and complex situation evaluations. However, datasets annotated in a QA format, which guarantees precise language generation and scene recognition from driving scenes, have not been established yet. In this work, we introduce Markup-QA, a novel dataset annotation technique in which QAs are enclosed within markups. This approach facilitates the simultaneous evaluation of a model's capabilities in sentence generation and VQA. Moreover, using this annotation methodology, we designed the NuScenes-MQA dataset. This dataset empowers the development of vision language models, especially for autonomous driving tasks, by focusing on both descriptive capabilities and precise QA.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in personalized image generation using diffusion models have been noteworthy. However, existing methods suffer from inefficiencies due to the requirement for subject-specific fine-tuning. This computationally intensive process hinders efficient deployment, limiting practical usability. Moreover, these methods often grapple with identity distortion and limited expression diversity. In light of these challenges, we propose PortraitBooth, an innovative approach designed for high efficiency, robust identity preservation, and expression-editable text-to-image generation, without the need for fine-tuning. PortraitBooth leverages subject embeddings from a face recognition model for personalized image generation without fine-tuning. It eliminates computational overhead and mitigates identity distortion. The introduced dynamic identity preservation strategy further ensures close resemblance to the original image identity. Moreover, PortraitBooth incorporates emotion-aware cross-attention control for diverse facial expressions in generated images, supporting text-driven expression editing. Its scalability enables efficient and high-quality image creation, including multi-subject generation. Extensive results demonstrate superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods in both single and multiple image generation scenarios.

- **Summary**: Surgical decisions are informed by aligning rapid portable 2D intraoperative images (e.g., X-rays) to a high-fidelity 3D preoperative reference scan (e.g., CT). 2D/3D image registration often fails in practice: conventional optimization methods are prohibitively slow and susceptible to local minima, while neural networks trained on small datasets fail on new patients or require impractical landmark supervision. We present DiffPose, a self-supervised approach that leverages patient-specific simulation and differentiable physics-based rendering to achieve accurate 2D/3D registration without relying on manually labeled data. Preoperatively, a CNN is trained to regress the pose of a randomly oriented synthetic X-ray rendered from the preoperative CT. The CNN then initializes rapid intraoperative test-time optimization that uses the differentiable X-ray renderer to refine the solution. Our work further proposes several geometrically principled methods for sampling camera poses from $\mathbf{SE}(3)$, for sparse differentiable rendering, and for driving registration in the tangent space $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ with geodesic and multiscale locality-sensitive losses. DiffPose achieves sub-millimeter accuracy across surgical datasets at intraoperative speeds, improving upon existing unsupervised methods by an order of magnitude and even outperforming supervised baselines.

- **Summary**: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), as one of the biologically inspired neural network infrastructures, has drawn increasing attention recently. It adopts binary spike activations to transmit information, thus the multiplications of activations and weights can be substituted by additions, which brings high energy efficiency. However, in the paper, we theoretically and experimentally prove that the binary spike activation map cannot carry enough information, thus causing information loss and resulting in accuracy decreasing. To handle the problem, we propose a ternary spike neuron to transmit information. The ternary spike neuron can also enjoy the event-driven and multiplication-free operation advantages of the binary spike neuron but will boost the information capacity. Furthermore, we also embed a trainable factor in the ternary spike neuron to learn the suitable spike amplitude, thus our SNN will adopt different spike amplitudes along layers, which can better suit the phenomenon that the membrane potential distributions are different along layers. To retain the efficiency of the vanilla ternary spike, the trainable ternary spike SNN will be converted to a standard one again via a re-parameterization technique in the inference. Extensive experiments with several popular network structures over static and dynamic datasets show that the ternary spike can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (3D-HPE) is an inherently ambiguous task, as a 2D pose in an image might originate from different possible 3D poses. Yet, most 3D-HPE methods rely on regression models, which assume a one-to-one mapping between inputs and outputs. In this work, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, because of this ambiguity, common regression models are bound to predict topologically inconsistent poses, and that traditional evaluation metrics, such as the MPJPE, P-MPJPE and PCK, are insufficient to assess this aspect. As a solution, we propose ManiPose, a novel manifold-constrained multi-hypothesis model capable of proposing multiple candidate 3D poses for each 2D input, together with their corresponding plausibility. Unlike previous multi-hypothesis approaches, our solution is completely supervised and does not rely on complex generative models, thus greatly facilitating its training and usage. Furthermore, by constraining our model to lie within the human pose manifold, we can guarantee the consistency of all hypothetical poses predicted with our approach, which was not possible in previous works. We illustrate the usefulness of ManiPose in a synthetic 1D-to-2D lifting setting and demonstrate on real-world datasets that it outperforms state-of-the-art models in pose consistency by a large margin, while still reaching competitive MPJPE performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene dynamics from multi-view videos. Unlike the majority of existing works which usually focus on the common task of novel view synthesis within the training time period, we propose to simultaneously learn the geometry, appearance, and physical velocity of 3D scenes only from video frames, such that multiple desirable applications can be supported, including future frame extrapolation, unsupervised 3D semantic scene decomposition, and dynamic motion transfer. Our method consists of three major components, 1) the keyframe dynamic radiance field, 2) the interframe velocity field, and 3) a joint keyframe and interframe optimization module which is the core of our framework to effectively train both networks. To validate our method, we further introduce two dynamic 3D datasets: 1) Dynamic Object dataset, and 2) Dynamic Indoor Scene dataset. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our method over all baselines, particularly in the critical tasks of future frame extrapolation and unsupervised 3D semantic scene decomposition.

Our method is scalable and can generalise to multiple identities while producing high-quality results. We train and evaluate our proposed approach and compare it against existing methods of talking head synthesis. We show that our model can compete with these methods in terms of visual quality and lip-sync accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our proposed approach to be used for a wide range of applications, including virtual assistants, entertainment, and education.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities to downstream tasks. However, existing prompt tuning based frameworks need to parallelize learnable textual inputs for all categories, suffering from massive GPU memory consumption when there is a large number of categories in the target dataset. Moreover, previous works require to include category names within prompts, exhibiting subpar performance when dealing with ambiguous category names. To address these shortcomings, we propose Compound Text-Guided Prompt Tuning (TGP-T) that significantly reduces resource demand while achieving superior performance. We introduce text supervision to the optimization of prompts, which enables two benefits: 1) releasing the model reliance on the pre-defined category names during inference, thereby enabling more flexible prompt generation; 2) reducing the number of inputs to the text encoder, which decreases GPU memory consumption significantly. Specifically, we found that compound text supervisions, i.e., category-wise and content-wise, is highly effective, since they provide inter-class separability and capture intra-class variations, respectively. Moreover, we condition the prompt generation on visual features through a module called Bonder, which facilitates the alignment between prompts and visual features. Extensive experiments on few-shot recognition and domain generalization demonstrate that TGP-T achieves superior performance with consistently lower training costs. It reduces GPU memory usage by 93% and attains a 2.5% performance gain on 16-shot ImageNet. The code is available at https://github.com/EricTan7/TGP-T.

- **Summary**: Recently, several methods have been proposed to estimate 3D human pose from multi-view images and achieved impressive performance on public datasets collected in relatively easy scenarios. However, there are limited approaches for extracting 3D human skeletons from multimodal inputs (e.g., RGB and pointcloud) that can enhance the accuracy of predicting 3D poses in challenging situations. We fill this gap by introducing a pipeline called PointVoxel that fuses multi-view RGB and pointcloud inputs to obtain 3D human poses. We demonstrate that volumetric representation is an effective architecture for integrating these different modalities. Moreover, in order to overcome the challenges of annotating 3D human pose labels in difficult scenarios, we develop a synthetic dataset generator for pretraining and design an unsupervised domain adaptation strategy so that we can obtain a well-trained 3D human pose estimator without using any manual annotations. We evaluate our approach on four datasets (two public datasets, one synthetic dataset, and one challenging dataset named BasketBall collected by ourselves), showing promising results. The code and dataset will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Data leakage is a critical issue when training and evaluating any method based on supervised learning. The state-of-the-art methods for online mapping are based on supervised learning and are trained predominantly using two datasets: nuScenes and Argoverse 2. These datasets revisit the same geographic locations across training, validation, and test sets. Specifically, over $80$% of nuScenes and $40$% of Argoverse 2 validation and test samples are located less than $5$ m from a training sample. This allows methods to localize within a memorized implicit map during testing and leads to inflated performance numbers being reported. To reveal the true performance in unseen environments, we introduce geographical splits of the data. Experimental results show significantly lower performance numbers, for some methods dropping with more than $45$ mAP, when retraining and reevaluating existing online mapping models with the proposed split. Additionally, a reassessment of prior design choices reveals diverging conclusions from those based on the original split. Notably, the impact of the lifting method and the support from auxiliary tasks (e.g., depth supervision) on performance appears less substantial or follows a different trajectory than previously perceived. Geographical splits can be found https://github.com/LiljaAdam/geographical-splits

- **Summary**: Trajectory recovery based on the snapshots from the city-wide multi-camera network facilitates urban mobility sensing and driveway optimization. The state-of-the-art solutions devoted to such a vision-based scheme typically incorporate predefined rules or unsupervised iterative feedback, struggling with multi-fold challenges such as lack of open-source datasets for training the whole pipeline, and the vulnerability to the noises from visual inputs. In response to the dilemma, this paper proposes VisionTraj, the first learning-based model that reconstructs vehicle trajectories from snapshots recorded by road network cameras. Coupled with it, we elaborate on two rational vision-trajectory datasets, which produce extensive trajectory data along with corresponding visual snapshots, enabling supervised vision-trajectory interplay extraction. Following the data creation, based on the results from the off-the-shelf multi-modal vehicle clustering, we first re-formulate the trajectory recovery problem as a generative task and introduce the canonical Transformer as the autoregressive backbone. Then, to identify clustering noises (e.g., false positives) with the bound on the snapshots' spatiotemporal dependencies, a GCN-based soft-denoising module is conducted based on the fine- and coarse-grained Re-ID clusters. Additionally, we harness strong semantic information extracted from the tracklet to provide detailed insights into the vehicle's entry and exit actions during trajectory recovery. The denoising and tracklet components can also act as plug-and-play modules to boost baselines. Experimental results on the two hand-crafted datasets show that the proposed VisionTraj achieves a maximum +11.5% improvement against the sub-best model.

- **Summary**: 3D generation has raised great attention in recent years. With the success of text-to-image diffusion models, the 2D-lifting technique becomes a promising route to controllable 3D generation. However, these methods tend to present inconsistent geometry, which is also known as the Janus problem. We observe that the problem is caused mainly by two aspects, i.e., viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion models and overfitting of the optimization objective. To address it, we propose a two-stage 2D-lifting framework, namely DreamControl, which optimizes coarse NeRF scenes as 3D self-prior and then generates fine-grained objects with control-based score distillation. Specifically, adaptive viewpoint sampling and boundary integrity metric are proposed to ensure the consistency of generated priors. The priors are then regarded as input conditions to maintain reasonable geometries, in which conditional LoRA and weighted score are further proposed to optimize detailed textures. DreamControl can generate high-quality 3D content in terms of both geometry consistency and texture fidelity. Moreover, our control-based optimization guidance is applicable to more downstream tasks, including user-guided generation and 3D animation.

- **Summary**: As a new emerging and promising type of generative models, diffusion models have proven to outperform Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in multiple tasks, including image synthesis. In this work, we explore semantic image synthesis for abdominal CT using conditional diffusion models, which can be used for downstream applications such as data augmentation. We systematically evaluated the performance of three diffusion models, as well as to other state-of-the-art GAN-based approaches, and studied the different conditioning scenarios for the semantic mask. Experimental results demonstrated that diffusion models were able to synthesize abdominal CT images with better quality. Additionally, encoding the mask and the input separately is more effective than na\"ive concatenating.

- **Summary**: Directly predicting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status from widely available hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) can reduce technical costs and expedite treatment selection. Accurately predicting HER2 requires large collections of multi-site WSIs. Federated learning enables collaborative training of these WSIs without gigabyte-size WSIs transportation and data privacy concerns. However, federated learning encounters challenges in addressing label imbalance in multi-site WSIs from the real world. Moreover, existing WSI classification methods cannot simultaneously exploit local context information and long-range dependencies in the site-end feature representation of federated learning. To address these issues, we present a point transformer with federated learning for multi-site HER2 status prediction from HE-stained WSIs. Our approach incorporates two novel designs. We propose a dynamic label distribution strategy and an auxiliary classifier, which helps to establish a well-initialized model and mitigate label distribution variations across sites. Additionally, we propose a farthest cosine sampling based on cosine distance. It can sample the most distinctive features and capture the long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments and analysis show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance at four sites with a total of 2687 WSIs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can generalize to two unseen sites with 229 WSIs.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel Attentional Scale Sequence Fusion based You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework (ASF-YOLO) which combines spatial and scale features for accurate and fast cell instance segmentation. Built on the YOLO segmentation framework, we employ the Scale Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) module to enhance the multi-scale information extraction capability of the network, and the Triple Feature Encoder (TPE) module to fuse feature maps of different scales to increase detailed information. We further introduce a Channel and Position Attention Mechanism (CPAM) to integrate both the SSFF and TPE modules, which focus on informative channels and spatial position-related small objects for improved detection and segmentation performance. Experimental validations on two cell datasets show remarkable segmentation accuracy and speed of the proposed ASF-YOLO model. It achieves a box mAP of 0.91, mask mAP of 0.887, and an inference speed of 47.3 FPS on the 2018 Data Science Bowl dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, an audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task has been introduced, aiming to group pixels with sounding objects within a given video. This task necessitates a first-ever audio-driven pixel-level understanding of the scene, posing significant challenges. In this paper, we propose an innovative audio-visual transformer framework, termed COMBO, an acronym for COoperation of Multi-order Bilateral relatiOns. For the first time, our framework explores three types of bilateral entanglements within AVS: pixel entanglement, modality entanglement, and temporal entanglement. Regarding pixel entanglement, we employ a Siam-Encoder Module (SEM) that leverages prior knowledge to generate more precise visual features from the foundational model. For modality entanglement, we design a Bilateral-Fusion Module (BFM), enabling COMBO to align corresponding visual and auditory signals bi-directionally. As for temporal entanglement, we introduce an innovative adaptive inter-frame consistency loss according to the inherent rules of temporal. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on AVSBench-object (84.7 mIoU on S4, 59.2 mIou on MS3) and AVSBench-semantic (42.1 mIoU on AVSS) datasets demonstrate that COMBO surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: For few-shot semantic segmentation, the primary task is to extract class-specific intrinsic information from limited labeled data. However, the semantic ambiguity and inter-class similarity of previous methods limit the accuracy of pixel-level foreground-background classification. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Relevant Intrinsic Feature Enhancement Network (RiFeNet). To improve the semantic consistency of foreground instances, we propose an unlabeled branch as an efficient data utilization method, which teaches the model how to extract intrinsic features robust to intra-class differences. Notably, during testing, the proposed unlabeled branch is excluded without extra unlabeled data and computation. Furthermore, we extend the inter-class variability between foreground and background by proposing a novel multi-level prototype generation and interaction module. The different-grained complementarity between global and local prototypes allows for better distinction between similar categories. The qualitative and quantitative performance of RiFeNet surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL-5i and COCO benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundation model for interactive segmentation, and it has catalyzed major advances in generative AI, computational photography, and medical imaging. This model takes in an arbitrary user input and provides segmentation masks of the corresponding objects. It is our goal to develop a version of SAM that is appropriate for use in a photography app. The original SAM model has a few challenges in this setting. First, original SAM a 600 million parameter based on ViT-H, and its high computational cost and large model size that are not suitable for todays mobile hardware. We address this by proposing the SqueezeSAM model architecture, which is 50x faster and 100x smaller than SAM. Next, when a user takes a photo on their phone, it might not occur to them to click on the image and get a mask. Our solution is to use salient object detection to generate the first few clicks. This produces an initial segmentation mask that the user can interactively edit. Finally, when a user clicks on an object, they typically expect all related pieces of the object to be segmented. For instance, if a user clicks on a person t-shirt in a photo, they expect the whole person to be segmented, but SAM typically segments just the t-shirt. We address this with a new data augmentation scheme, and the end result is that if the user clicks on a person holding a basketball, the person and the basketball are all segmented together.

- **Summary**: Predicting future frames of a video is challenging because it is difficult to learn the uncertainty of the underlying factors influencing their contents. In this paper, we propose a novel video prediction model, which has infinite-dimensional latent variables over the spatio-temporal domain. Specifically, we first decompose the video motion and content information, then take a neural stochastic differential equation to predict the temporal motion information, and finally, an image diffusion model autoregressively generates the video frame by conditioning on the predicted motion feature and the previous frame. The better expressiveness and stronger stochasticity learning capability of our model lead to state-of-the-art video prediction performances. As well, our model is able to achieve temporal continuous prediction, i.e., predicting in an unsupervised way the future video frames with an arbitrarily high frame rate.

- **Summary**: Security is an important topic in our contemporary world, and the ability to automate the detection of any events of interest that can take place in a crowd is of great interest to a population. We hypothesize that the detection of events in videos is correlated with significant changes in pedestrian behaviors. In this paper, we examine three different scenarios of crowd behavior, containing both the cases where an event triggers a change in the behavior of the crowd and two video sequences where the crowd and its motion remain mostly unchanged. With both the videos and the tracking of the individual pedestrians (performed in a pre-processed phase), we use Geomind, a software we developed to extract significant data about the scene, in particular, the geometrical features, personalities, and emotions of each person. We then examine the output, seeking a significant change in the way each person acts as a function of the time, that could be used as a basis to identify events or to model realistic crowd actions. When applied to the games area, our method can use the detected events to find some sort of pattern to be then used in agent simulation. Results indicate that our hypothesis seems valid in the sense that the visually observed events could be automatically detected using GeoMind.

- **Summary**: Existing approaches to video understanding, mainly designed for short videos from a third-person perspective, are limited in their applicability in certain fields, such as robotics. In this paper, we delve into open-ended question-answering (QA) in long, egocentric videos, which allows individuals or robots to inquire about their own past visual experiences. This task presents unique challenges, including the complexity of temporally grounding queries within extensive video content, the high resource demands for precise data annotation, and the inherent difficulty of evaluating open-ended answers due to their ambiguous nature. Our proposed approach tackles these challenges by (i) integrating query grounding and answering within a unified model to reduce error propagation; (ii) employing large language models for efficient and scalable data synthesis; and (iii) introducing a close-ended QA task for evaluation, to manage answer ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QAEgo4D and Ego4D-NLQ benchmarks. We plan to publicly release the codes, model, and constructed datasets for future research.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) driven by textual prompts. Instead of a single model, our key insight is to take a modular design and decompose the complex task into simpler sub-tasks. We first develop a dual-branch diffusion model (HOI-DM) to generate both human and object motions conditioning on the input text, and encourage coherent motions by a cross-attention communication module between the human and object motion generation branches. We also develop an affordance prediction diffusion model (APDM) to predict the contacting area between the human and object during the interactions driven by the textual prompt. The APDM is independent of the results by the HOI-DM and thus can correct potential errors by the latter. Moreover, it stochastically generates the contacting points to diversify the generated motions. Finally, we incorporate the estimated contacting points into the classifier-guidance to achieve accurate and close contact between humans and objects. To train and evaluate our approach, we annotate BEHAVE dataset with text descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to produce realistic HOIs with various interactions and different types of objects.

- **Summary**: We study recovering fluid density and velocity from sparse multiview videos. Existing neural dynamic reconstruction methods predominantly rely on optical flows; therefore, they cannot accurately estimate the density and uncover the underlying velocity due to the inherent visual ambiguities of fluid velocity, as fluids are often shapeless and lack stable visual features. The challenge is further pronounced by the turbulent nature of fluid flows, which calls for properly designed fluid velocity representations. To address these challenges, we propose hybrid neural fluid fields (HyFluid), a neural approach to jointly infer fluid density and velocity fields. Specifically, to deal with visual ambiguities of fluid velocity, we introduce a set of physics-based losses that enforce inferring a physically plausible velocity field, which is divergence-free and drives the transport of density. To deal with the turbulent nature of fluid velocity, we design a hybrid neural velocity representation that includes a base neural velocity field that captures most irrotational energy and a vortex particle-based velocity that models residual turbulent velocity. We show that our method enables recovering vortical flow details. Our approach opens up possibilities for various learning and reconstruction applications centered around 3D incompressible flow, including fluid re-simulation and editing, future prediction, and neural dynamic scene composition.

- **Summary**: The ability to provide fine-grained control for generating and editing visual imagery has profound implications for computer vision and its applications. Previous works have explored extending controllability in two directions: instruction tuning with text-based prompts and multi-modal conditioning. However, these works make one or more unnatural assumptions on the number and/or type of modality inputs used to express controllability. We propose InstructAny2Pix, a flexible multi-modal instruction-following system that enables users to edit an input image using instructions involving audio, images, and text. InstructAny2Pix consists of three building blocks that facilitate this capability: a multi-modal encoder that encodes different modalities such as images and audio into a unified latent space, a diffusion model that learns to decode representations in this latent space into images, and a multi-modal LLM that can understand instructions involving multiple images and audio pieces and generate a conditional embedding of the desired output, which can be used by the diffusion decoder. Additionally, to facilitate training efficiency and improve generation quality, we include an additional refinement prior module that enhances the visual quality of LLM outputs. These designs are critical to the performance of our system. We demonstrate that our system can perform a series of novel instruction-guided editing tasks.

- **Summary**: Current instruction-based editing methods, such as InstructPix2Pix, often fail to produce satisfactory results in complex scenarios due to their dependence on the simple CLIP text encoder in diffusion models. To rectify this, this paper introduces SmartEdit, a novel approach to instruction-based image editing that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance their understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, direct integration of these elements still faces challenges in situations requiring complex reasoning. To mitigate this, we propose a Bidirectional Interaction Module that enables comprehensive bidirectional information interactions between the input image and the MLLM output. During training, we initially incorporate perception data to boost the perception and understanding capabilities of diffusion models. Subsequently, we demonstrate that a small amount of complex instruction editing data can effectively stimulate SmartEdit's editing capabilities for more complex instructions. We further construct a new evaluation dataset, Reason-Edit, specifically tailored for complex instruction-based image editing. Both quantitative and qualitative results on this evaluation dataset indicate that our SmartEdit surpasses previous methods, paving the way for the practical application of complex instruction-based image editing.

- **Summary**: We present Monocular Neural Parametric Head Models (MonoNPHM) for dynamic 3D head reconstructions from monocular RGB videos. To this end, we propose a latent appearance space that parameterizes a texture field on top of a neural parametric model. We constrain predicted color values to be correlated with the underlying geometry such that gradients from RGB effectively influence latent geometry codes during inverse rendering. To increase the representational capacity of our expression space, we augment our backward deformation field with hyper-dimensions, thus improving color and geometry representation in topologically challenging expressions. Using MonoNPHM as a learned prior, we approach the task of 3D head reconstruction using signed distance field based volumetric rendering. By numerically inverting our backward deformation field, we incorporated a landmark loss using facial anchor points that are closely tied to our canonical geometry representation. To evaluate the task of dynamic face reconstruction from monocular RGB videos we record 20 challenging Kinect sequences under casual conditions. MonoNPHM outperforms all baselines with a significant margin, and makes an important step towards easily accessible neural parametric face models through RGB tracking.

- **Summary**: The field of image synthesis has made tremendous strides forward in the last years. Besides defining the desired output image with text-prompts, an intuitive approach is to additionally use spatial guidance in form of an image, such as a depth map. For this, a recent and highly popular approach is to use a controlling network, such as ControlNet, in combination with a pre-trained image generation model, such as Stable Diffusion. When evaluating the design of existing controlling networks, we observe that they all suffer from the same problem of a delay in information flowing between the generation and controlling process. This, in turn, means that the controlling network must have generative capabilities. In this work we propose a new controlling architecture, called ControlNet-XS, which does not suffer from this problem, and hence can focus on the given task of learning to control. In contrast to ControlNet, our model needs only a fraction of parameters, and hence is about twice as fast during inference and training time. Furthermore, the generated images are of higher quality and the control is of higher fidelity. All code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Volumetric video is a technology that digitally records dynamic events such as artistic performances, sporting events, and remote conversations. When acquired, such volumography can be viewed from any viewpoint and timestamp on flat screens, 3D displays, or VR headsets, enabling immersive viewing experiences and more flexible content creation in a variety of applications such as sports broadcasting, video conferencing, gaming, and movie productions. With the recent advances and fast-growing interest in neural scene representations for volumetric video, there is an urgent need for a unified open-source library to streamline the process of volumetric video capturing, reconstruction, and rendering for both researchers and non-professional users to develop various algorithms and applications of this emerging technology. In this paper, we present EasyVolcap, a Python & Pytorch library for accelerating neural volumetric video research with the goal of unifying the process of multi-view data processing, 4D scene reconstruction, and efficient dynamic volumetric video rendering.

- **Summary**: We present WildHands, a method for 3D hand pose estimation in egocentric images in the wild. This is challenging due to (a) lack of 3D hand pose annotations for images in the wild, and (b) a form of perspective distortion-induced shape ambiguity that arises in the analysis of crops around hands. For the former, we use auxiliary supervision on in-the-wild data in the form of segmentation masks & grasp labels in addition to 3D supervision available in lab datasets. For the latter, we provide spatial cues about the location of the hand crop in the camera's field of view. Our approach achieves the best 3D hand pose on the ARCTIC leaderboard and outperforms FrankMocap, a popular and robust approach for estimating hand pose in the wild, by 45.3% when evaluated on 2D hand pose on our EPIC-HandKps dataset.

- **Summary**: We present the first application of 3D Gaussian Splatting to incremental 3D reconstruction using a single moving monocular or RGB-D camera. Our Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) method, which runs live at 3fps, utilises Gaussians as the only 3D representation, unifying the required representation for accurate, efficient tracking, mapping, and high-quality rendering. Several innovations are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a live camera. First, to move beyond the original 3DGS algorithm, which requires accurate poses from an offline Structure from Motion (SfM) system, we formulate camera tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D Gaussians, and show that this enables fast and robust tracking with a wide basin of convergence. Second, by utilising the explicit nature of the Gaussians, we introduce geometric verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction. Finally, we introduce a full SLAM system which not only achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and trajectory estimation, but also reconstruction of tiny and even transparent objects.

- **Summary**: Quick and automated earthquake-damaged building detection from post-event satellite imagery is crucial, yet it is challenging due to the scarcity of training data required to develop robust algorithms. This letter presents the first dataset dedicated to detecting earthquake-damaged buildings from post-event very high resolution (VHR) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery. Utilizing open satellite imagery and annotations acquired after the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquakes, we deliver a dataset of coregistered building footprints and satellite image patches of both SAR and optical data, encompassing more than four thousand buildings. The task of damaged building detection is formulated as a binary image classification problem, that can also be treated as an anomaly detection problem due to extreme class imbalance. We provide baseline methods and results to serve as references for comparison. Researchers can utilize this dataset to expedite algorithm development, facilitating the rapid detection of damaged buildings in response to future events. The dataset and codes together with detailed explanations are made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ya0-sun/PostEQ-SARopt-BuildingDamage}.

- **Summary**: In this work, we address in-context learning (ICL) for the task of image segmentation, introducing a novel approach that adapts a modern Video Object Segmentation (VOS) technique for visual in-context learning. This adaptation is inspired by the VOS method's ability to efficiently and flexibly learn objects from a few examples. Through evaluations across a range of support set sizes and on diverse segmentation datasets, our method consistently surpasses existing techniques. Notably, it excels with data containing classes not encountered during training. Additionally, we propose a technique for support set selection, which involves choosing the most relevant images to include in this set. By employing support set selection, the performance increases for all tested methods without the need for additional training or prompt tuning. The code can be found at https://github.com/v7labs/XMem_ICL/.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Objects undergo varying amounts of perspective distortion as they move across a camera's field of view. Models for predicting 3D from a single image often work with crops around the object of interest and ignore the location of the object in the camera's field of view. We note that ignoring this location information further exaggerates the inherent ambiguity in making 3D inferences from 2D images and can prevent models from even fitting to the training data. To mitigate this ambiguity, we propose Intrinsics-Aware Positional Encoding (KPE), which incorporates information about the location of crops in the image and camera intrinsics. Experiments on three popular 3D-from-a-single-image benchmarks: depth prediction on NYU, 3D object detection on KITTI & nuScenes, and predicting 3D shapes of articulated objects on ARCTIC, show the benefits of KPE.

- **Summary**: Early action recognition is an important and challenging problem that enables the recognition of an action from a partially observed video stream where the activity is potentially unfinished or even not started. In this work, we propose a novel model that learns a prototypical representation of the full action for each class and uses it to regularize the architecture and the visual representations of the partial observations. Our model is very simple in design and also efficient. We decompose the video into short clips, where a visual encoder extracts features from each clip independently. Later, a decoder aggregates together in an online fashion features from all the clips for the final class prediction. During training, for each partial observation, the model is jointly trained to both predict the label as well as the action prototypical representation which acts as a regularizer. We evaluate our method on multiple challenging real-world datasets and outperform the current state-of-the-art by a significant margin. For example, on early recognition observing only the first 10% of each video, our method improves the SOTA by +2.23 Top-1 accuracy on Something-Something-v2, +3.55 on UCF-101, +3.68 on SSsub21, and +5.03 on EPIC-Kitchens-55, where prior work used either multi-modal inputs (e.g. optical-flow) or batched inference. Finally, we also present exhaustive ablation studies to motivate the design choices we made, as well as gather insights regarding what our model is learning semantically.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction-based approaches have achieved remarkable outcomes in anomaly detection. The exceptional image reconstruction capabilities of recently popular diffusion models have sparked research efforts to utilize them for enhanced reconstruction of anomalous images. Nonetheless, these methods might face challenges related to the preservation of image categories and pixel-wise structural integrity in the more practical multi-class setting. To solve the above problems, we propose a Difusion-based Anomaly Detection (DiAD) framework for multi-class anomaly detection, which consists of a pixel-space autoencoder, a latent-space Semantic-Guided (SG) network with a connection to the stable diffusion's denoising network, and a feature-space pre-trained feature extractor. Firstly, The SG network is proposed for reconstructing anomalous regions while preserving the original image's semantic information. Secondly, we introduce Spatial-aware Feature Fusion (SFF) block to maximize reconstruction accuracy when dealing with extensively reconstructed areas. Thirdly, the input and reconstructed images are processed by a pre-trained feature extractor to generate anomaly maps based on features extracted at different scales. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving 96.8/52.6 and 97.2/99.0 (AUROC/AP) for localization and detection respectively on multi-class MVTec-AD dataset.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning for sequential data have given rise to fast and powerful models that produce realistic videos of talking humans. The state of the art in talking face generation focuses mainly on lip-syncing, being conditioned on audio clips. However, having the ability to synthesize talking humans from text transcriptions rather than audio is particularly beneficial for many applications and is expected to receive more and more attention, following the recent breakthroughs in large language models. For that, most methods implement a cascaded 2-stage architecture of a text-to-speech module followed by an audio-driven talking face generator, but this ignores the highly complex interplay between audio and visual streams that occurs during speaking. In this paper, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, text-driven audiovisual speech synthesizer that uses Transformers and does not follow a cascaded approach. Our method, which we call NEUral Text to ARticulate Talk (NEUTART), is a talking face generator that uses a joint audiovisual feature space, as well as speech-informed 3D facial reconstructions and a lip-reading loss for visual supervision. The proposed model produces photorealistic talking face videos with human-like articulation and well-synced audiovisual streams. Our experiments on audiovisual datasets as well as in-the-wild videos reveal state-of-the-art generation quality both in terms of objective metrics and human evaluation.

- **Summary**: The success of deep networks in medical image segmentation relies heavily on massive labeled training data. However, acquiring dense annotations is a time-consuming process. Weakly-supervised methods normally employ less expensive forms of supervision, among which scribbles started to gain popularity lately thanks to its flexibility. However, due to lack of shape and boundary information, it is extremely challenging to train a deep network on scribbles that generalizes on unlabeled pixels. In this paper, we present a straightforward yet effective scribble supervised learning framework. Inspired by recent advances of transformer based segmentation, we create a pluggable spatial self-attention module which could be attached on top of any internal feature layers of arbitrary fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone. The module infuses global interaction while keeping the efficiency of convolutions. Descended from this module, we construct a similarity metric based on normalized and symmetrized attention. This attentive similarity leads to a novel regularization loss that imposes consistency between segmentation prediction and visual affinity. This attentive similarity loss optimizes the alignment of FCN encoders, attention mapping and model prediction. Ultimately, the proposed FCN+Attention architecture can be trained end-to-end guided by a combination of three learning objectives: partial segmentation loss, a customized masked conditional random fields and the proposed attentive similarity loss. Extensive experiments on public datasets (ACDC and CHAOS) showed that our framework not just out-performs existing state-of-the-art, but also delivers close performance to fully-supervised benchmark. Code will be available upon publication.

- **Summary**: Training on large-scale datasets can boost the performance of video instance segmentation while the annotated datasets for VIS are hard to scale up due to the high labor cost. What we possess are numerous isolated filed-specific datasets, thus, it is appealing to jointly train models across the aggregation of datasets to enhance data volume and diversity. However, due to the heterogeneity in category space, as mask precision increases with the data volume, simply utilizing multiple datasets will dilute the attention of models on different taxonomies. Thus, increasing the data scale and enriching taxonomy space while improving classification precision is important. In this work, we analyze that providing extra taxonomy information can help models concentrate on specific taxonomy, and propose our model named Taxonomy-aware Multi-dataset Joint Training for Video Instance Segmentation (TMT-VIS) to address this vital challenge. Specifically, we design a two-stage taxonomy aggregation module that first compiles taxonomy information from input videos and then aggregates these taxonomy priors into instance queries before the transformer decoder. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on four popular and challenging benchmarks, including YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and UVO. Our model shows significant improvement over the baseline solutions, and sets new state-of-the-art records on all benchmarks. These appealing and encouraging results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in robotics have enabled robots to navigate complex scenes or manipulate diverse objects independently. However, robots are still impotent in many household tasks requiring coordinated behaviors such as opening doors. The factorization of navigation and manipulation, while effective for some tasks, fails in scenarios requiring coordinated actions. To address this challenge, we introduce, HarmonicMM, an end-to-end learning method that optimizes both navigation and manipulation, showing notable improvement over existing techniques in everyday tasks. This approach is validated in simulated and real-world environments and adapts to novel unseen settings without additional tuning. Our contributions include a new benchmark for mobile manipulation and the successful deployment in a real unseen apartment, demonstrating the potential for practical indoor robot deployment in daily life.

- **Summary**: Text-based diffusion models have exhibited remarkable success in generation and editing, showing great promise for enhancing visual content with their generative prior. However, applying these models to video super-resolution remains challenging due to the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, which is complicated by the inherent randomness in diffusion models. Our study introduces Upscale-A-Video, a text-guided latent diffusion framework for video upscaling. This framework ensures temporal coherence through two key mechanisms: locally, it integrates temporal layers into U-Net and VAE-Decoder, maintaining consistency within short sequences; globally, without training, a flow-guided recurrent latent propagation module is introduced to enhance overall video stability by propagating and fusing latent across the entire sequences. Thanks to the diffusion paradigm, our model also offers greater flexibility by allowing text prompts to guide texture creation and adjustable noise levels to balance restoration and generation, enabling a trade-off between fidelity and quality. Extensive experiments show that Upscale-A-Video surpasses existing methods in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as well as in AI-generated videos, showcasing impressive visual realism and temporal consistency.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction tasks. However, their performance suffers under challenging scenarios with sparse input views. We present CorresNeRF, a novel method that leverages image correspondence priors computed by off-the-shelf methods to supervise NeRF training. We design adaptive processes for augmentation and filtering to generate dense and high-quality correspondences. The correspondences are then used to regularize NeRF training via the correspondence pixel reprojection and depth loss terms. We evaluate our methods on novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction tasks with density-based and SDF-based NeRF models on different datasets. Our method outperforms previous methods in both photometric and geometric metrics. We show that this simple yet effective technique of using correspondence priors can be applied as a plug-and-play module across different NeRF variants.

- **Summary**: Collaborative robots (cobots) are widely used in industrial applications, yet extensive research is still needed to enhance human-robot collaborations and operator experience. A potential approach to improve the collaboration experience involves adapting cobot behavior based on natural cues from the operator. Inspired by the literature on human-human interactions, we conducted a wizard-of-oz study to examine whether a gaze towards the cobot can serve as a trigger for initiating joint activities in collaborative sessions. In this study, 37 participants engaged in an assembly task while their gaze behavior was analyzed. We employ a gaze-based attention recognition model to identify when the participants look at the cobot. Our results indicate that in most cases (84.88\%), the joint activity is preceded by a gaze towards the cobot. Furthermore, during the entire assembly cycle, the participants tend to look at the cobot around the time of the joint activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the natural gaze behavior of participants working on a joint activity with a robot during a collaborative assembly task.

- **Summary**: We introduce AnyHome, a framework that translates open-vocabulary descriptions, ranging from simple labels to elaborate paragraphs, into well-structured and textured 3D indoor scenes at a house-scale. Inspired by cognition theories, AnyHome employs an amodal structured representation to capture 3D spatial cues from textual narratives and then uses egocentric inpainting to enrich these scenes. To this end, we begin by using specially designed template prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs), which enable precise control over the textual input. We then utilize intermediate representations to maintain the spatial structure's consistency, ensuring that the 3D scenes align closely with the textual description. Then, we apply a Score Distillation Sampling process to refine the placement of objects. Lastly, an egocentric inpainting process is incorporated to enhance the realism and appearance of the scenes. AnyHome stands out due to its hierarchical structured representation combined with the versatility of open-vocabulary text interpretation. This allows for extensive customization of indoor scenes at various levels of granularity. We demonstrate that AnyHome can reliably generate a range of diverse indoor scenes, characterized by their detailed spatial structures and textures, all corresponding to the free-form textual inputs.

- **Summary**: Despite their impressive predictive performance in various computer vision tasks, deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to make overly confident predictions, which hinders their widespread use in safety-critical applications. While there have been recent attempts to calibrate DNNs, most of these efforts have primarily been focused on classification tasks, thus neglecting DNN-based object detectors. Although several recent works addressed calibration for object detection and proposed differentiable penalties, none of them are consistent estimators of established concepts in calibration. In this work, we tackle the challenge of defining and estimating calibration error specifically for this task. In particular, we adapt the definition of classification calibration error to handle the nuances associated with object detection, and predictions in structured output spaces more generally. Furthermore, we propose a consistent and differentiable estimator of the detection calibration error, utilizing kernel density estimation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimator against competing train-time and post-hoc calibration methods, while maintaining similar detection performance.

- **Summary**: Current machine learning models for vision are often highly specialized and limited to a single modality and task. In contrast, recent large language models exhibit a wide range of capabilities, hinting at a possibility for similarly versatile models in computer vision. In this paper, we take a step in this direction and propose a multimodal training scheme called 4M. It consists of training a single unified Transformer encoder-decoder using a masked modeling objective across a wide range of input/output modalities - including text, images, geometric, and semantic modalities, as well as neural network feature maps. 4M achieves scalability by unifying the representation space of all modalities through mapping them into discrete tokens and performing multimodal masked modeling on a small randomized subset of tokens.   4M leads to models that exhibit several key capabilities: (1) they can perform a diverse set of vision tasks out of the box, (2) they excel when fine-tuned for unseen downstream tasks or new input modalities, and (3) they can function as a generative model that can be conditioned on arbitrary modalities, enabling a wide variety of expressive multimodal editing capabilities with remarkable flexibility.   Through experimental analyses, we demonstrate the potential of 4M for training versatile and scalable foundation models for vision tasks, setting the stage for further exploration in multimodal learning for vision and other domains.

- **Summary**: Existing UV mapping algorithms are designed to operate on well-behaved meshes, instead of the geometry representations produced by state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and generation techniques. As such, applying these methods to the volume densities recovered by neural radiance fields and related techniques (or meshes triangulated from such fields) results in texture atlases that are too fragmented to be useful for tasks such as view synthesis or appearance editing. We present a UV mapping method designed to operate on geometry produced by 3D reconstruction and generation techniques. Instead of computing a mapping defined on a mesh's vertices, our method Nuvo uses a neural field to represent a continuous UV mapping, and optimizes it to be a valid and well-behaved mapping for just the set of visible points, i.e. only points that affect the scene's appearance. We show that our model is robust to the challenges posed by ill-behaved geometry, and that it produces editable UV mappings that can represent detailed appearance.

- **Summary**: In Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a visual projector plays a crucial role in bridging pre-trained vision encoders with LLMs, enabling profound visual understanding while harnessing the LLMs' robust capabilities. Despite the importance of the visual projector, it has been relatively less explored. In this study, we first identify two essential projector properties: (i) flexibility in managing the number of visual tokens, crucial for MLLMs' overall efficiency, and (ii) preservation of local context from visual features, vital for spatial understanding. Based on these findings, we propose a novel projector design that is both flexible and locality-enhanced, effectively satisfying the two desirable properties. Additionally, we present comprehensive strategies to effectively utilize multiple and multifaceted instruction datasets. Through extensive experiments, we examine the impact of individual design choices. Finally, our proposed MLLM, Honeybee, remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, and LLaVA-Bench, achieving significantly higher efficiency.

- **Summary**: Human trajectory prediction is typically posed as a zero-shot generalization problem: a predictor is learnt on a dataset of human motion in training scenes, and then deployed on unseen test scenes. While this paradigm has yielded tremendous progress, it fundamentally assumes that trends in human behavior within the deployment scene are constant over time. As such, current prediction models are unable to adapt to scene-specific transient human behaviors, such as crowds temporarily gathering to see buskers, pedestrians hurrying through the rain and avoiding puddles, or a protest breaking out. We formalize the problem of scene-specific adaptive trajectory prediction and propose a new adaptation approach inspired by prompt tuning called latent corridors. By augmenting the input of any pre-trained human trajectory predictor with learnable image prompts, the predictor can improve in the deployment scene by inferring trends from extremely small amounts of new data (e.g., 2 humans observed for 30 seconds). With less than 0.1% additional model parameters, we see up to 23.9% ADE improvement in MOTSynth simulated data and 16.4% ADE in MOT and Wildtrack real pedestrian data. Qualitatively, we observe that latent corridors imbue predictors with an awareness of scene geometry and scene-specific human behaviors that non-adaptive predictors struggle to capture.

- **Summary**: Different outdoor illumination conditions drastically alter the appearance of urban scenes, and they can harm the performance of image-based robot perception systems if not seen during training. Camera simulation provides a cost-effective solution to create a large dataset of images captured under different lighting conditions. Towards this goal, we propose LightSim, a neural lighting camera simulation system that enables diverse, realistic, and controllable data generation. LightSim automatically builds lighting-aware digital twins at scale from collected raw sensor data and decomposes the scene into dynamic actors and static background with accurate geometry, appearance, and estimated scene lighting. These digital twins enable actor insertion, modification, removal, and rendering from a new viewpoint, all in a lighting-aware manner. LightSim then combines physically-based and learnable deferred rendering to perform realistic relighting of modified scenes, such as altering the sun location and modifying the shadows or changing the sun brightness, producing spatially- and temporally-consistent camera videos. Our experiments show that LightSim generates more realistic relighting results than prior work. Importantly, training perception models on data generated by LightSim can significantly improve their performance.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D content creation from text prompts has demonstrated remarkable progress by utilizing 2D and 3D diffusion models. While 3D diffusion models ensure great multi-view consistency, their ability to generate high-quality and diverse 3D assets is hindered by the limited 3D data. In contrast, 2D diffusion models find a distillation approach that achieves excellent generalization and rich details without any 3D data. However, 2D lifting methods suffer from inherent view-agnostic ambiguity thereby leading to serious multi-face Janus issues, where text prompts fail to provide sufficient guidance to learn coherent 3D results. Instead of retraining a costly viewpoint-aware model, we study how to fully exploit easily accessible coarse 3D knowledge to enhance the prompts and guide 2D lifting optimization for refinement. In this paper, we propose Sherpa3D, a new text-to-3D framework that achieves high-fidelity, generalizability, and geometric consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we design a pair of guiding strategies derived from the coarse 3D prior generated by the 3D diffusion model: a structural guidance for geometric fidelity and a semantic guidance for 3D coherence. Employing the two types of guidance, the 2D diffusion model enriches the 3D content with diversified and high-quality results. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our Sherpa3D over the state-of-the-art text-to-3D methods in terms of quality and 3D consistency.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. In view of such a deficiency, we propose to replace the color field with an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. To avoid the distortion effect and facilitate convenient editing, we complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture lookup. This field is carefully initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure naturalness of the aggregated appearance. Extensive experimental results on three datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, interactive drawing, and content extraction) with no need of re-optimization for each case, demonstrating its generalizability and efficiency.

- **Summary**: This paper presents EdgeSAM, an accelerated variant of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), optimized for efficient execution on edge devices with minimal compromise in performance. Our approach involves distilling the original ViT-based SAM image encoder into a purely CNN-based architecture, better suited for edge devices. We carefully benchmark various distillation strategies and demonstrate that task-agnostic encoder distillation fails to capture the full knowledge embodied in SAM. To overcome this bottleneck, we include both the prompt encoder and mask decoder in the distillation process, with box and point prompts in the loop, so that the distilled model can accurately capture the intricate dynamics between user input and mask generation. To mitigate dataset bias issues stemming from point prompt distillation, we incorporate a lightweight module within the encoder. EdgeSAM achieves a 40-fold speed increase compared to the original SAM, and it also outperforms MobileSAM, being 14 times as fast when deployed on edge devices while enhancing the mIoUs on COCO and LVIS by 2.3 and 3.2 respectively. It is also the first SAM variant that can run at over 30 FPS on an iPhone 14. Code and models are available at https://github.com/chongzhou96/EdgeSAM.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose UpFusion, a system that can perform novel view synthesis and infer 3D representations for an object given a sparse set of reference images without corresponding pose information. Current sparse-view 3D inference methods typically rely on camera poses to geometrically aggregate information from input views, but are not robust in-the-wild when such information is unavailable/inaccurate. In contrast, UpFusion sidesteps this requirement by learning to implicitly leverage the available images as context in a conditional generative model for synthesizing novel views. We incorporate two complementary forms of conditioning into diffusion models for leveraging the input views: a) via inferring query-view aligned features using a scene-level transformer, b) via intermediate attentional layers that can directly observe the input image tokens. We show that this mechanism allows generating high-fidelity novel views while improving the synthesis quality given additional (unposed) images. We evaluate our approach on the Co3Dv2 and Google Scanned Objects datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our method over pose-reliant sparse-view methods as well as single-view methods that cannot leverage additional views. Finally, we also show that our learned model can generalize beyond the training categories and even allow reconstruction from self-captured images of generic objects in-the-wild.

- **Summary**: We present W.A.L.T, a transformer-based approach for photorealistic video generation via diffusion modeling. Our approach has two key design decisions. First, we use a causal encoder to jointly compress images and videos within a unified latent space, enabling training and generation across modalities. Second, for memory and training efficiency, we use a window attention architecture tailored for joint spatial and spatiotemporal generative modeling. Taken together these design decisions enable us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on established video (UCF-101 and Kinetics-600) and image (ImageNet) generation benchmarks without using classifier free guidance. Finally, we also train a cascade of three models for the task of text-to-video generation consisting of a base latent video diffusion model, and two video super-resolution diffusion models to generate videos of $512 \times 896$ resolution at $8$ frames per second.

- **Summary**: The increased demand for 3D data in AR/VR, robotics and gaming applications, gave rise to powerful generative pipelines capable of synthesizing high-quality 3D objects. Most of these models rely on the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) algorithm to optimize a 3D representation such that the rendered image maintains a high likelihood as evaluated by a pre-trained diffusion model. However, finding a correct mode in the high-dimensional distribution produced by the diffusion model is challenging and often leads to issues such as over-saturation, over-smoothing, and Janus-like artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm for 3D synthesis that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models. Instead of focusing on mode-seeking, our method directly models the distribution discrepancy between multi-view renderings and diffusion priors in an adversarial manner, which unlocks the generation of high-fidelity and photorealistic 3D content, conditioned on a single image and prompt. Moreover, by harnessing the latent space of GANs and expressive diffusion model priors, our method facilitates a wide variety of 3D applications including single-view reconstruction, high diversity generation and continuous 3D interpolation in the open domain. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of our pipeline compared to previous works in terms of generation quality and diversity.

- **Summary**: Despite the promising performance of current 3D human pose estimation techniques, understanding and enhancing their generalization on challenging in-the-wild videos remain an open problem. In this work, we focus on the robustness of 2D-to-3D pose lifters. To this end, we develop two benchmark datasets, namely Human3.6M-C and HumanEva-I-C, to examine the robustness of video-based 3D pose lifters to a wide range of common video corruptions including temporary occlusion, motion blur, and pixel-level noise. We observe the poor generalization of state-of-the-art 3D pose lifters in the presence of corruption and establish two techniques to tackle this issue. First, we introduce Temporal Additive Gaussian Noise (TAGN) as a simple yet effective 2D input pose data augmentation. Additionally, to incorporate the confidence scores output by the 2D pose detectors, we design a confidence-aware convolution (CA-Conv) block. Extensively tested on corrupted videos, the proposed strategies consistently boost the robustness of 3D pose lifters and serve as new baselines for future research.

- **Summary**: We propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation method for point clouds that predicts "per-point" labels from just "whole-scene" annotations while achieving the performance of recent fully supervised approaches. Our core idea is to propagate the scene-level labels to each point in the point cloud by creating pseudo labels in a conservative way. Specifically, we over-segment point cloud features via unsupervised clustering and associate scene-level labels with clusters through bipartite matching, thus propagating scene labels only to the most relevant clusters, leaving the rest to be guided solely via unsupervised clustering. We empirically demonstrate that over-segmentation and bipartite assignment plays a crucial role. We evaluate our method on ScanNet and S3DIS datasets, outperforming state of the art, and demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to fully supervised methods.

- **Summary**: This research presents ADOD, a novel approach to address domain generalization in underwater object detection. Our method enhances the model's ability to generalize across diverse and unseen domains, ensuring robustness in various underwater environments. The first key contribution is Residual Attention YOLOv3, a novel variant of the YOLOv3 framework empowered by residual attention modules. These modules enable the model to focus on informative features while suppressing background noise, leading to improved detection accuracy and adaptability to different domains. The second contribution is the attention-based domain classification module, vital during training. This module helps the model identify domain-specific information, facilitating the learning of domain-invariant features. Consequently, ADOD can generalize effectively to underwater environments with distinct visual characteristics. Extensive experiments on diverse underwater datasets demonstrate ADOD's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, particularly in challenging scenarios. The proposed model achieves exceptional detection performance in both seen and unseen domains, showcasing its effectiveness in handling domain shifts in underwater object detection tasks. ADOD represents a significant advancement in adaptive object detection, providing a promising solution for real-world applications in underwater environments. With the prevalence of domain shifts in such settings, the model's strong generalization ability becomes a valuable asset for practical underwater surveillance and marine research endeavors.

- **Summary**: Recently, spatiotemporal graphs have emerged as a concise and elegant manner of representing video clips in an object-centric fashion, and have shown to be useful for downstream tasks such as action recognition. In this work, we investigate the use of latent spatiotemporal graphs to represent a surgical video in terms of the constituent anatomical structures and tools and their evolving properties over time. To build the graphs, we first predict frame-wise graphs using a pre-trained model, then add temporal edges between nodes based on spatial coherence and visual and semantic similarity. Unlike previous approaches, we incorporate long-term temporal edges in our graphs to better model the evolution of the surgical scene and increase robustness to temporary occlusions. We also introduce a novel graph-editing module that incorporates prior knowledge and temporal coherence to correct errors in the graph, enabling improved downstream task performance. Using our graph representations, we evaluate two downstream tasks, critical view of safety prediction and surgical phase recognition, obtaining strong results that demonstrate the quality and flexibility of the learned representations.

- **Summary**: $\textbf{Background and aims}$: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) is commonly used for polyp detection, but data seen in clinical settings can differ from model training. Few studies evaluate how well CADe detectors perform on colonoscopies from countries not seen during training, and none are able to evaluate performance without collecting expensive and time-intensive labels.   $\textbf{Methods}$: We trained a CADe polyp detector on Israeli colonoscopy videos (5004 videos, 1106 hours) and evaluated on Japanese videos (354 videos, 128 hours) by measuring the True Positive Rate (TPR) versus false alarms per minute (FAPM). We introduce a colonoscopy dissimilarity measure called "MAsked mediCal Embedding Distance" (MACE) to quantify differences between colonoscopies, without labels. We evaluated CADe on all Japan videos and on those with the highest MACE.   $\textbf{Results}$: MACE correctly quantifies that narrow-band imaging (NBI) and chromoendoscopy (CE) frames are less similar to Israel data than Japan whitelight (bootstrapped z-test, |z| > 690, p < $10^{-8}$ for both). Despite differences in the data, CADe performance on Japan colonoscopies was non-inferior to Israel ones without additional training (TPR at 0.5 FAPM: 0.957 and 0.972 for Israel and Japan; TPR at 1.0 FAPM: 0.972 and 0.989 for Israel and Japan; superiority test t > 45.2, p < $10^{-8}$). Despite not being trained on NBI or CE, TPR on those subsets were non-inferior to Japan overall (non-inferiority test t > 47.3, p < $10^{-8}$, $\delta$ = 1.5% for both).   $\textbf{Conclusion}$: Differences that prevent CADe detectors from performing well in non-medical settings do not degrade the performance of our AI CADe polyp detector when applied to data from a new country. MACE can help medical AI models internationalize by identifying the most "dissimilar" data on which to evaluate models.

- **Summary**: This paper tackles the intricate challenge of improving the quality of nighttime images under hazy and low-light conditions. Overcoming issues including nonuniform illumination glows, texture blurring, glow effects, color distortion, noise disturbance, and overall, low light have proven daunting. Despite the inherent difficulties, this paper introduces a pioneering solution named Nighttime Dehazing, Low-Light Enhancement, and Light Suppression (NDELS). NDELS utilizes a unique network that combines three essential processes to enhance visibility, brighten low-light regions, and effectively suppress glare from bright light sources. In contrast to limited progress in nighttime dehazing, unlike its daytime counterpart, NDELS presents a comprehensive and innovative approach. The efficacy of NDELS is rigorously validated through extensive comparisons with eight state-of-the-art algorithms across four diverse datasets. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of our method, demonstrating its outperformance in terms of overall image quality, including color and edge enhancement. Quantitative (PSNR, SSIM) and qualitative metrics (CLIPIQA, MANIQA, TRES), measure these results.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes the incorporation of techniques from stereophotoclinometry (SPC) into a keypoint-based structure-from-motion (SfM) system to estimate the surface normal and albedo at detected landmarks to improve autonomous surface and shape characterization of small celestial bodies from in-situ imagery. In contrast to the current state-of-the-practice method for small body shape reconstruction, i.e., SPC, which relies on human-in-the-loop verification and high-fidelity a priori information to achieve accurate results, we forego the expensive maplet estimation step and instead leverage dense keypoint measurements and correspondences from an autonomous keypoint detection and matching method based on deep learning to provide the necessary photogrammetric constraints. Moreover, we develop a factor graph-based approach allowing for simultaneous optimization of the spacecraft's pose, landmark positions, Sun-relative direction, and surface normals and albedos via fusion of Sun sensor measurements and image keypoint measurements. The proposed framework is validated on real imagery of the Cornelia crater on Asteroid 4 Vesta, along with pose estimation and mapping comparison against an SPC reconstruction, where we demonstrate precise alignment to the SPC solution without relying on any a priori camera pose and topography information or humans-in-the-loop

- **Summary**: Few-shot image classification is the task of classifying unseen images to one of N mutually exclusive classes, using only a small number of training examples for each class. The limited availability of these examples (denoted as K) presents a significant challenge to classification accuracy in some cases. To address this, we have developed a method for augmenting the set of K with an addition set of A retrieved images. We call this system Retrieval-Augmented Few-shot Image Classification (RAFIC). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that RAFIC markedly improves performance of few-shot image classification across two challenging datasets. RAFIC consists of two main components: (a) a retrieval component which uses CLIP, LAION-5B, and faiss, in order to efficiently retrieve images similar to the supplied images, and (b) retrieval meta-learning, which learns to judiciously utilize the retrieved images. Code and data is available at github.com/amirziai/rafic.

- **Summary**: Portrait harmonization aims to composite a subject into a new background, adjusting its lighting and color to ensure harmony with the background scene. Existing harmonization techniques often only focus on adjusting the global color and brightness of the foreground and ignore crucial illumination cues from the background such as apparent lighting direction, leading to unrealistic compositions. We introduce Relightful Harmonization, a lighting-aware diffusion model designed to seamlessly harmonize sophisticated lighting effect for the foreground portrait using any background image. Our approach unfolds in three stages. First, we introduce a lighting representation module that allows our diffusion model to encode lighting information from target image background. Second, we introduce an alignment network that aligns lighting features learned from image background with lighting features learned from panorama environment maps, which is a complete representation for scene illumination. Last, to further boost the photorealism of the proposed method, we introduce a novel data simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training pairs from a diverse range of natural images, which are used to refine the model. Our method outperforms existing benchmarks in visual fidelity and lighting coherence, showing superior generalization in real-world testing scenarios, highlighting its versatility and practicality.

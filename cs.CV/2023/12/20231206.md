- **Summary**: 3D scene representations have gained immense popularity in recent years. Methods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks such as novel view synthesis. In recent times, some work has emerged that aims to extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis, for semantically aware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field distillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and (b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts reducing feature quality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this work, we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering, we enable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D foundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively incorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework leads to warp-level divergence. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert this problem. Our proposed method is general, and our experiments showcase novel view semantic segmentation, language-guided editing and segment anything through learning feature fields from state-of-the-art 2D foundation models such as SAM and CLIP-LSeg. Across experiments, our distillation method is able to provide comparable or better results, while being significantly faster to both train and render. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first method to enable point and bounding-box prompting for radiance field manipulation, by leveraging the SAM model.

- **Summary**: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing poses a global threat to ocean habitats. Publicly available satellite data offered by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) provide an opportunity to actively monitor this activity. Effectively leveraging satellite data for maritime conservation requires highly reliable machine learning models operating globally with minimal latency. This paper introduces three specialized computer vision models designed for synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1), optical imagery (Sentinel-2), and nighttime lights (Suomi-NPP/NOAA-20). It also presents best practices for developing and delivering real-time computer vision services for conservation. These models have been deployed in Skylight, a real time maritime monitoring platform, which is provided at no cost to users worldwide.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have recently revolutionized the field of image synthesis due to their ability to generate photorealistic images. However, one of the major drawbacks of diffusion models is that the image generation process is costly. A large image-to-image network has to be applied many times to iteratively refine an image from random noise. While many recent works propose techniques to reduce the number of required steps, they generally treat the underlying denoising network as a black box. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the layers within the network and find that 1) the layers' output changes smoothly over time, 2) the layers show distinct patterns of change, and 3) the change from step to step is often very small. We hypothesize that many layer computations in the denoising network are redundant. Leveraging this, we introduce block caching, in which we reuse outputs from layer blocks of previous steps to speed up inference. Furthermore, we propose a technique to automatically determine caching schedules based on each block's changes over timesteps. In our experiments, we show through FID, human evaluation and qualitative analysis that Block Caching allows to generate images with higher visual quality at the same computational cost. We demonstrate this for different state-of-the-art models (LDM and EMU) and solvers (DDIM and DPM).

- **Summary**: Now many mobile phones embed deep-learning models for evaluation or guidance on photography. These models cannot provide detailed results like human pose scores or scene color scores because of the rare of corresponding aesthetic attribute data. However, the annotation of image aesthetic attribute scores requires experienced artists and professional photographers, which hinders the collection of large-scale fully-annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose to replace image attribute labels with feature extractors. First, a novel aesthetic attribute evaluation framework based on attribute features is proposed to predict attribute scores and overall scores. We call it the F2S (attribute features to attribute scores) model. We use networks from different tasks to provide attribute features to our F2S models. Then, we define an aesthetic attribute contribution to describe the role of aesthetic attributes throughout an image and use it with the attribute scores and the overall scores to train our F2S model. Sufficient experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our F2S model achieves comparable performance with those trained on the datasets with fully-annotated aesthetic attribute score labels. Our method makes it feasible to learn meaningful attribute scores for various aesthetic attribute sets in different types of images with only overall aesthetic scores.

- **Summary**: Existing salient object detection methods are capable of predicting binary maps that highlight visually salient regions. However, these methods are limited in their ability to differentiate the relative importance of multiple objects and the relationships among them, which can lead to errors and reduced accuracy in downstream tasks that depend on the relative importance of multiple objects. To conquer, this paper proposes a new paradigm for saliency ranking, which aims to completely focus on ranking salient objects by their "importance order". While previous works have shown promising performance, they still face ill-posed problems. First, the saliency ranking ground truth (GT) orders generation methods are unreasonable since determining the correct ranking order is not well-defined, resulting in false alarms. Second, training a ranking model remains challenging because most saliency ranking methods follow the multi-task paradigm, leading to conflicts and trade-offs among different tasks. Third, existing regression-based saliency ranking methods are complex for saliency ranking models due to their reliance on instance mask-based saliency ranking orders. These methods require a significant amount of data to perform accurately and can be challenging to implement effectively. To solve these problems, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the causes and proposes a whole-flow processing paradigm of saliency ranking task from the perspective of "GT data generation", "network structure design" and "training protocol". The proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the widely-used SALICON set, as demonstrated by extensive experiments with fair and reasonable comparisons. The saliency ranking task is still in its infancy, and our proposed unified framework can serve as a fundamental strategy to guide future work.

- **Summary**: We present a Human Body model based IDentification system (HMID) system that is jointly trained for shape, pose and biometric identification. HMID is based on the Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) network and we propose additional losses to improve and stabilize shape estimation and biometric identification while maintaining the pose and shape output. We show that when our HMID network is trained using additional shape and pose losses, it shows a significant improvement in biometric identification performance when compared to an identical model that does not use such losses. The HMID model uses raw images instead of silhouettes and is able to perform robust recognition on images collected at range and altitude as many anthropometric properties are reasonably invariant to clothing, view and range. We show results on the USF dataset as well as the BRIAR dataset which includes probes with both clothing and view changes. Our approach (using body model losses) shows a significant improvement in Rank20 accuracy and True Accuracy Rate on the BRIAR evaluation dataset.

- **Summary**: Quantification of real-time informal feedback delivered by an experienced surgeon to a trainee during surgery is important for skill improvements in surgical training. Such feedback in the live operating room is inherently multimodal, consisting of verbal conversations (e.g., questions and answers) as well as non-verbal elements (e.g., through visual cues like pointing to anatomic elements). In this work, we leverage a clinically-validated five-category classification of surgical feedback: "Anatomic", "Technical", "Procedural", "Praise" and "Visual Aid". We then develop a multi-label machine learning model to classify these five categories of surgical feedback from inputs of text, audio, and video modalities. The ultimate goal of our work is to help automate the annotation of real-time contextual surgical feedback at scale. Our automated classification of surgical feedback achieves AUCs ranging from 71.5 to 77.6 with the fusion improving performance by 3.1%. We also show that high-quality manual transcriptions of feedback audio from experts improve AUCs to between 76.5 and 96.2, which demonstrates a clear path toward future improvements. Empirically, we find that the Staged training strategy, with first pre-training each modality separately and then training them jointly, is more effective than training different modalities altogether. We also present intuitive findings on the importance of modalities for different feedback categories. This work offers an important first look at the feasibility of automated classification of real-world live surgical feedback based on text, audio, and video modalities.

- **Summary**: Despite the great success of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), its data-gathering process remains vague with only a general rule of thumb of sampling as densely as possible. The lack of understanding of what actually constitutes good views for NeRF makes it difficult to actively plan a sequence of views that yield the maximal reconstruction quality. We propose Surrogate Objectives for Active Radiance Fields (SOAR), which is a set of interpretable functions that evaluates the goodness of views using geometric and photometric visual cues - surface coverage, geometric complexity, textural complexity, and ray diversity. Moreover, by learning to infer the SOAR scores from a deep network, SOARNet, we are able to effectively select views in mere seconds instead of hours, without the need for prior visits to all the candidate views or training any radiance field during such planning. Our experiments show SOARNet outperforms the baselines with $\sim$80x speed-up while achieving better or comparable reconstruction qualities. We finally show that SOAR is model-agnostic, thus it generalizes across fully neural-implicit to fully explicit approaches.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training significantly improves adversarial robustness, but superior performance is primarily attained with large models. This substantial performance gap for smaller models has spurred active research into adversarial distillation (AD) to mitigate the difference. Existing AD methods leverage the teacher's logits as a guide. In contrast to these approaches, we aim to transfer another piece of knowledge from the teacher, the input gradient. In this paper, we propose a distillation module termed Indirect Gradient Distillation Module (IGDM) that indirectly matches the student's input gradient with that of the teacher. We hypothesize that students can better acquire the teacher's knowledge by matching the input gradient. Leveraging the observation that adversarial training renders the model locally linear on the input space, we employ Taylor approximation to effectively align gradients without directly calculating them. Experimental results show that IGDM seamlessly integrates with existing AD methods, significantly enhancing the performance of all AD methods. Particularly, utilizing IGDM on the CIFAR-100 dataset improves the AutoAttack accuracy from 28.06% to 30.32% with the ResNet-18 model and from 26.18% to 29.52% with the MobileNetV2 model when integrated into the SOTA method without additional data augmentation. The code will be made available.

- **Summary**: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used and achieved remarkable results in skeleton-based action recognition. We think the key to skeleton-based action recognition is a skeleton hanging in frames, so we focus on how the Graph Convolutional Convolution networks learn different topologies and effectively aggregate joint features in the global temporal and local temporal. In this work, we propose three Channel-wise Tolopogy Graph Convolution based on Channel-wise Topology Refinement Graph Convolution (CTR-GCN). Combining CTR-GCN with two joint cross-attention modules can capture the upper-lower body part and hand-foot relationship skeleton features. After that, to capture features of human skeletons changing in frames we design the Temporal Attention Transformers to extract skeletons effectively. The Temporal Attention Transformers can learn the temporal features of human skeleton sequences. Finally, we fuse the temporal features output scale with MLP and classification. We develop a powerful graph convolutional network named Spatial Temporal Effective Body-part Cross Attention Transformer which notably high-performance on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 datasets.

### Class Incremental Learning for Adversarial Robustness

- **Summary**: Adversarial training integrates adversarial examples during model training to enhance robustness. However, its application in fixed dataset settings differs from real-world dynamics, where data accumulates incrementally. In this study, we investigate Adversarially Robust Class Incremental Learning (ARCIL), a method that combines adversarial robustness with incremental learning. We observe that combining incremental learning with naive adversarial training easily leads to a loss of robustness. We discover that this is attributed to the disappearance of the flatness of the loss function, a characteristic of adversarial training. To address this issue, we propose the Flatness Preserving Distillation (FPD) loss that leverages the output difference between adversarial and clean examples. Additionally, we introduce the Logit Adjustment Distillation (LAD) loss, which adapts the model's knowledge to perform well on new tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over approaches that apply adversarial training to existing incremental learning methods, which provides a strong baseline for incremental learning on adversarial robustness in the future. Our method achieves AutoAttack accuracy that is 5.99\%p, 5.27\%p, and 3.90\%p higher on average than the baseline on split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, respectively. The code will be made available.

- **Summary**: Perception and planning under occlusion is essential for safety-critical tasks. Occlusion-aware planning often requires communicating the information of the occluded object to the ego agent for safe navigation. However, communicating rich sensor information under adverse conditions during communication loss and limited bandwidth may not be always feasible. Further, in GPS denied environments and indoor navigation, localizing and sharing of occluded objects can be challenging. To overcome this, relative pose estimation between connected agents sharing a common field of view can be a computationally effective way of communicating information about surrounding objects. In this paper, we design an end-to-end network that cooperatively estimates the current states of occluded pedestrian in the reference frame of ego agent and then predicts the trajectory with safety guarantees. Experimentally, we show that the uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction of occluded pedestrian by the ego agent is almost similar to the ground truth trajectory assuming no occlusion. The current research holds promise for uncertainty-aware navigation among multiple connected agents under occlusion.

- **Summary**: Point cloud streaming is increasingly getting popular, evolving into the norm for interactive service delivery and the future Metaverse. However, the substantial volume of data associated with point clouds presents numerous challenges, particularly in terms of high bandwidth consumption and large storage capacity. Despite various solutions proposed thus far, with a focus on point cloud compression, upsampling, and completion, these reconstruction-related methods continue to fall short in delivering high fidelity point cloud output. As a solution, in DiffPMAE, we propose an effective point cloud reconstruction architecture. Inspired by self-supervised learning concepts, we combine Masked Auto-Encoding and Diffusion Model mechanism to remotely reconstruct point cloud data. By the nature of this reconstruction process, DiffPMAE can be extended to many related downstream tasks including point cloud compression, upsampling and completion. Leveraging ShapeNet-55 and ModelNet datasets with over 60000 objects, we validate the performance of DiffPMAE exceeding many state-of-the-art methods in-terms of auto-encoding and downstream tasks considered.

- **Summary**: Self-training and contrastive learning have emerged as leading techniques for incorporating unlabeled data, both under distribution shift (unsupervised domain adaptation) and when it is absent (semi-supervised learning). However, despite the popularity and compatibility of these techniques, their efficacy in combination remains unexplored. In this paper, we undertake a systematic empirical investigation of this combination, finding that (i) in domain adaptation settings, self-training and contrastive learning offer significant complementary gains; and (ii) in semi-supervised learning settings, surprisingly, the benefits are not synergistic. Across eight distribution shift datasets (e.g., BREEDs, WILDS), we demonstrate that the combined method obtains 3--8% higher accuracy than either approach independently. We then theoretically analyze these techniques in a simplified model of distribution shift, demonstrating scenarios under which the features produced by contrastive learning can yield a good initialization for self-training to further amplify gains and achieve optimal performance, even when either method alone would fail.

- **Summary**: Recent few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods introduce an extra pre-training stage before meta-training to obtain a stronger backbone, which has become a standard step in few-shot learning. Despite the effectiveness, current pre-training scheme suffers from the merged background problem: only base classes are labelled as foregrounds, making it hard to distinguish between novel classes and actual background. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training scheme for FSS via decoupling the novel classes from background, called Background Clustering Pre-Training (BCPT). Specifically, we adopt online clustering to the pixel embeddings of merged background to explore the underlying semantic structures, bridging the gap between pre-training and adaptation to novel classes. Given the clustering results, we further propose the background mining loss and leverage base classes to guide the clustering process, improving the quality and stability of clustering results. Experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show that BCPT yields advanced performance. Code will be available.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has yielded remarkable outcomes in various domains. However, the challenge of requiring large-scale labeled samples still persists in deep learning. Thus, data augmentation has been introduced as a critical strategy to train deep learning models. However, data augmentation suffers from information loss and poor performance in small sample environments. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a feature augmentation method based on shape space theory, i.e., Geodesic curve feature augmentation, called GCFA in brevity. First, we extract features from the image with the neural network model. Then, the multiple image features are projected into a pre-shape space as features. In the pre-shape space, a Geodesic curve is built to fit the features. Finally, the many generated features on the Geodesic curve are used to train the various machine learning models. The GCFA module can be seamlessly integrated with most machine learning methods. And the proposed method is simple, effective and insensitive for the small sample datasets. Several examples demonstrate that the GCFA method can greatly improve the performance of the data preprocessing model in a small sample environment.



### Building Category Graphs Representation with Spatial and Temporal Attention for Visual Navigation

- **Summary**: Given an object of interest, visual navigation aims to reach the object's location based on a sequence of partial observations. To this end, an agent needs to 1) learn a piece of certain knowledge about the relations of object categories in the world during training and 2) look for the target object based on the pre-learned object category relations and its moving trajectory in the current unseen environment. In this paper, we propose a Category Relation Graph (CRG) to learn the knowledge of object category layout relations and a Temporal-Spatial-Region (TSR) attention architecture to perceive the long-term spatial-temporal dependencies of objects helping the navigation. We learn prior knowledge of object layout, establishing a category relationship graph to deduce the positions of specific objects. Subsequently, we introduced TSR to capture the relationships of objects in temporal, spatial, and regions within the observation trajectories. Specifically, we propose a Temporal attention module (T) to model the temporal structure of the observation sequence, which implicitly encodes the historical moving or trajectory information. Then, a Spatial attention module (S) is used to uncover the spatial context of the current observation objects based on the category relation graph and past observations. Last, a Region attention module (R) shifts the attention to the target-relevant region. Based on the visual representation extracted by our method, the agent can better perceive the environment and easily learn superior navigation policy. Experiments on AI2-THOR demonstrate our CRG-TSR method significantly outperforms existing methods regarding both effectiveness and efficiency. The code has been included in the supplementary material and will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Most deep learning-based point cloud processing methods are supervised and require large scale of labeled data. However, manual labeling of point cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Self-supervised representation learning can address the aforementioned issue by learning robust and generalized representations from unlabeled datasets. Nevertheless, the embedded features obtained by representation learning usually contain redundant information, and most current methods reduce feature redundancy by linear correlation constraints. In this paper, we propose PointJEM, a self-supervised representation learning method applied to the point cloud field. PointJEM comprises an embedding scheme and a loss function based on joint entropy. The embedding scheme divides the embedding vector into different parts, each part can learn a distinctive feature. To reduce redundant information in the features, PointJEM maximizes the joint entropy between the different parts, thereby rendering the learned feature variables pairwise independent. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that our method can significantly reduce feature redundancy beyond linear correlation. Furthermore, PointJEM achieves competitive performance in downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation.

- **Summary**: The construction of online vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps is critical for downstream prediction and planning. Recent efforts have built strong baselines for this task, however, shapes and relations of instances in urban road systems are still under-explored, such as parallelism, perpendicular, or rectangle-shape. In our work, we propose GeMap ($\textbf{Ge}$ometry $\textbf{Map}$), which end-to-end learns Euclidean shapes and relations of map instances beyond basic perception. Specifically, we design a geometric loss based on angle and distance clues, which is robust to rigid transformations. We also decouple self-attention to independently handle Euclidean shapes and relations. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the NuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets. Remarkably, it reaches a 71.8% mAP on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset, outperforming MapTR V2 by +4.4% and surpassing the 70% mAP threshold for the first time.

- **Summary**: 6-DoF object-agnostic grasping in unstructured environments is a critical yet challenging task in robotics. Most current works use non-optimized approaches to sample grasp locations and learn spatial features without concerning the grasping task. This paper proposes GraNet, a graph-based grasp pose generation framework that translates a point cloud scene into multi-level graphs and propagates features through graph neural networks. By building graphs at the scene level, object level, and grasp point level, GraNet enhances feature embedding at multiple scales while progressively converging to the ideal grasping locations by learning. Our pipeline can thus characterize the spatial distribution of grasps in cluttered scenes, leading to a higher rate of effective grasping. Furthermore, we enhance the representation ability of scalable graph networks by a structure-aware attention mechanism to exploit local relations in graphs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale GraspNet-1Billion benchmark, especially in grasping unseen objects (+11.62 AP). The real robot experiment shows a high success rate in grasping scattered objects, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach in unstructured environments.

- **Summary**: Large and rich data is a prerequisite for effective training of deep neural networks. However, the irregularity of point cloud data makes manual annotation time-consuming and laborious. Self-supervised representation learning, which leverages the intrinsic structure of large-scale unlabelled data to learn meaningful feature representations, has attracted increasing attention in the field of point cloud research. However, self-supervised representation learning often suffers from model collapse, resulting in reduced information and diversity of the learned representation, and consequently degrading the performance of downstream tasks. To address this problem, we propose PointMoment, a novel framework for point cloud self-supervised representation learning that utilizes a high-order mixed moment loss function rather than the conventional contrastive loss function. Moreover, our framework does not require any special techniques such as asymmetric network architectures, gradient stopping, etc. Specifically, we calculate the high-order mixed moment of the feature variables and force them to decompose into products of their individual moment, thereby making multiple variables more independent and minimizing the feature redundancy. We also incorporate a contrastive learning approach to maximize the feature invariance under different data augmentations of the same point cloud. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous unsupervised learning methods on the downstream task of 3D point cloud classification and segmentation.

- **Summary**: Since their introduction, Neural Fields have become very popular for 3D reconstruction and new view synthesis. Recent researches focused on accelerating the process, as well as improving the robustness to variation of the observation distance and limited number of supervised viewpoints. However, those approaches often led to dedicated solutions that cannot be easily combined. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new simple but efficient architecture named RING-NeRF, based on Residual Implicit Neural Grids, that provides a control on the level of detail of the mapping function between the scene and the latent spaces. Associated with a distance-aware forward mapping mechanism and a continuous coarse-to-fine reconstruction process, our versatile architecture demonstrates both fast training and state-of-the-art performances in terms of: (1) anti-aliased rendering, (2) reconstruction quality from few supervised viewpoints, and (3) robustness in the absence of appropriate scene-specific initialization for SDF-based NeRFs. We also demonstrate that our architecture can dynamically add grids to increase the details of the reconstruction, opening the way to adaptive reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Chest X-ray (CXR) is frequently employed in emergency departments and intensive care units to verify the proper placement of central lines and tubes and to rule out related complications. The automation of the X-ray reading process can be a valuable support tool for non-specialist technicians and minimize reporting delays due to non-availability of experts. While existing solutions for automated catheter segmentation and malposition detection show promising results, the disentanglement of individual catheters remains an open challenge, especially in complex cases where multiple devices appear superimposed in the X-ray projection. Moreover, conventional top-down instance segmentation methods are ineffective on such thin and long devices, that often extend through the entire image. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach based on associative embeddings for catheter instance segmentation, able to overcome those limitations and effectively handle device intersections.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of trees has always been a key task in precision forestry management and research. Due to the complex branch morphological structure of trees themselves and the occlusions from tree stems, branches and foliage, it is difficult to recreate a complete three-dimensional tree model from a two-dimensional image by conventional photogrammetric methods. In this study, based on tree images collected by various cameras in different ways, the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) method was used for individual tree reconstruction and the exported point cloud models are compared with point cloud derived from photogrammetric reconstruction and laser scanning methods. The results show that the NeRF method performs well in individual tree 3D reconstruction, as it has higher successful reconstruction rate, better reconstruction in the canopy area, it requires less amount of images as input. Compared with photogrammetric reconstruction method, NeRF has significant advantages in reconstruction efficiency and is adaptable to complex scenes, but the generated point cloud tends to be noisy and low resolution. The accuracy of tree structural parameters (tree height and diameter at breast height) extracted from the photogrammetric point cloud is still higher than those of derived from the NeRF point cloud. The results of this study illustrate the great potential of NeRF method for individual tree reconstruction, and it provides new ideas and research directions for 3D reconstruction and visualization of complex forest scenes.

- **Summary**: Recently, deep learning methods have achieved superior performance for Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar(PolSAR) image classification. Existing deep learning methods learn PolSAR data by converting the covariance matrix into a feature vector or complex-valued vector as the input. However, all these methods cannot learn the structure of complex matrix directly and destroy the channel correlation. To learn geometric structure of complex matrix, we propose a Riemannian complex matrix convolution network for PolSAR image classification in Riemannian space for the first time, which directly utilizes the complex matrix as the network input and defines the Riemannian operations to learn complex matrix's features. The proposed Riemannian complex matrix convolution network considers PolSAR complex matrix endowed in Riemannian manifold, and defines a series of new Riemannian convolution, ReLu and LogEig operations in Riemannian space, which breaks through the Euclidean constraint of conventional networks. Then, a CNN module is appended to enhance contextual Riemannian features. Besides, a fast kernel learning method is developed for the proposed method to learn class-specific features and reduce the computation time effectively. Experiments are conducted on three sets of real PolSAR data with different bands and sensors. Experiments results demonstrates the proposed method can obtain superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We present Egocentric Action Scene Graphs (EASGs), a new representation for long-form understanding of egocentric videos. EASGs extend standard manually-annotated representations of egocentric videos, such as verb-noun action labels, by providing a temporally evolving graph-based description of the actions performed by the camera wearer, including interacted objects, their relationships, and how actions unfold in time. Through a novel annotation procedure, we extend the Ego4D dataset by adding manually labeled Egocentric Action Scene Graphs offering a rich set of annotations designed for long-from egocentric video understanding. We hence define the EASG generation task and provide a baseline approach, establishing preliminary benchmarks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, egocentric action anticipation and egocentric activity summarization, highlight the effectiveness of EASGs for long-form egocentric video understanding. We will release the dataset and the code to replicate experiments and annotations.

- **Summary**: A critical yet unpredictable complication following cataract surgery is intraocular lens dislocation. Postoperative stability is imperative, as even a tiny decentration of multifocal lenses or inadequate alignment of the torus in toric lenses due to postoperative rotation can lead to a significant drop in visual acuity. Investigating possible intraoperative indicators that can predict post-surgical instabilities of intraocular lenses can help prevent this complication. In this paper, we develop and evaluate the first fully-automatic framework for the computation of lens unfolding delay, rotation, and instability during surgery. Adopting a combination of three types of CNNs, namely recurrent, region-based, and pixel-based, the proposed framework is employed to assess the possibility of predicting post-operative lens dislocation during cataract surgery. This is achieved via performing a large-scale study on the statistical differences between the behavior of different brands of intraocular lenses and aligning the results with expert surgeons' hypotheses and observations about the lenses. We exploit a large-scale dataset of cataract surgery videos featuring four intraocular lens brands. Experimental results confirm the reliability of the proposed framework in evaluating the lens' statistics during the surgery. The Pearson correlation and t-test results reveal significant correlations between lens unfolding delay and lens rotation and significant differences between the intra-operative rotations stability of four groups of lenses. These results suggest that the proposed framework can help surgeons select the lenses based on the patient's eye conditions and predict post-surgical lens dislocation.

- **Summary**: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as weather forecasting and traffic prediction, offer significant societal benefits. These tasks can be effectively approached as image forecasting problems using computer vision models. Vector quantization (VQ) is a well-known method for discrete representation that improves the latent space, leading to enhanced generalization and transfer learning capabilities. One of the main challenges in using VQ for spatiotemporal forecasting is how to balance between keeping enough details and removing noises from the original patterns for better generalization. We address this challenge by developing sparse vector quantization, or {\bf SVQ} for short, that leverages sparse regression to make better trade-off between the two objectives. The main innovation of this work is to approximate sparse regression by a two-layer MLP and a randomly fixed or learnable matrix, dramatically improving its computational efficiency. Through experiments conducted on diverse datasets in multiple fields including weather forecasting, traffic flow prediction, and video forecasting, we unequivocally demonstrate that our proposed method consistently enhances the performance of base models and achieves state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks.

- **Summary**: With the continuous maturation and application of autonomous driving technology, a systematic examination of open-source autonomous driving datasets becomes instrumental in fostering the robust evolution of the industry ecosystem. Current autonomous driving datasets can broadly be categorized into two generations. The first-generation autonomous driving datasets are characterized by relatively simpler sensor modalities, smaller data scale, and is limited to perception-level tasks. KITTI, introduced in 2012, serves as a prominent representative of this initial wave. In contrast, the second-generation datasets exhibit heightened complexity in sensor modalities, greater data scale and diversity, and an expansion of tasks from perception to encompass prediction and control. Leading examples of the second generation include nuScenes and Waymo, introduced around 2019. This comprehensive review, conducted in collaboration with esteemed colleagues from both academia and industry, systematically assesses over seventy open-source autonomous driving datasets from domestic and international sources. It offers insights into various aspects, such as the principles underlying the creation of high-quality datasets, the pivotal role of data engine systems, and the utilization of generative foundation models to facilitate scalable data generation. Furthermore, this review undertakes an exhaustive analysis and discourse regarding the characteristics and data scales that future third-generation autonomous driving datasets should possess. It also delves into the scientific and technical challenges that warrant resolution. These endeavors are pivotal in advancing autonomous innovation and fostering technological enhancement in critical domains.

- **Summary**: Semantic Segmentation plays a pivotal role in many applications related to medical image and video analysis. However, designing a neural network architecture for medical image and surgical video segmentation is challenging due to the diverse features of relevant classes, including heterogeneity, deformability, transparency, blunt boundaries, and various distortions. We propose a network architecture, DeepPyramid+, which addresses diverse challenges encountered in medical image and surgical video segmentation. The proposed DeepPyramid+ incorporates two major modules, namely "Pyramid View Fusion" (PVF) and "Deformable Pyramid Reception," (DPR), to address the outlined challenges. PVF replicates a deduction process within the neural network, aligning with the human visual system, thereby enhancing the representation of relative information at each pixel position. Complementarily, DPR introduces shape- and scale-adaptive feature extraction techniques using dilated deformable convolutions, enhancing accuracy and robustness in handling heterogeneous classes and deformable shapes. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets, including endometriosis videos, MRI images, OCT scans, and cataract and laparoscopy videos, demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepPyramid+ in handling various challenges such as shape and scale variation, reflection, and blur degradation. DeepPyramid+ demonstrates significant improvements in segmentation performance, achieving up to a 3.65% increase in Dice coefficient for intra-domain segmentation and up to a 17% increase in Dice coefficient for cross-domain segmentation. DeepPyramid+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art networks across diverse modalities considering different backbone networks, showcasing its versatility.

- **Summary**: An increasingly common approach for creating photo-realistic digital avatars is through the use of volumetric neural fields. The original neural radiance field (NeRF) allowed for impressive novel view synthesis of static heads when trained on a set of multi-view images, and follow up methods showed that these neural representations can be extended to dynamic avatars. Recently, new variants also surpassed the usual drawback of baked-in illumination in neural representations, showing that static neural avatars can be relit in any environment. In this work we simultaneously tackle both the motion and illumination problem, proposing a new method for relightable and animatable neural heads. Our method builds on a proven dynamic avatar approach based on a mixture of volumetric primitives, combined with a recently-proposed lightweight hardware setup for relightable neural fields, and includes a novel architecture that allows relighting dynamic neural avatars performing unseen expressions in any environment, even with nearfield illumination and viewpoints.

- **Summary**: Multimodal semantic segmentation is developing rapidly, but the modality of RGB-Polarization remains underexplored. To delve into this problem, we construct a UPLight RGB-P segmentation benchmark with 12 typical underwater semantic classes which provides data support for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to perform special perception tasks. In this work, we design the ShareCMP, an RGB-P semantic segmentation framework with a shared dual-branch architecture, which reduces the number of parameters by about 26-33% compared to previous dual-branch models. It encompasses a Polarization Generate Attention (PGA) module designed to generate polarization modal images with richer polarization properties for the encoder. In addition, we introduce the Class Polarization-Aware Loss (CPALoss) to improve the learning and understanding of the encoder for polarization modal information and to optimize the PGA module. With extensive experiments on a total of three RGB-P benchmarks, our ShareCMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in mIoU with fewer parameters on the UPLight (92.45%), ZJU (92.7%), and MCubeS (50.99%) datasets.

- **Summary**: We introduce Gaussian-Flow, a novel point-based approach for fast dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering from both multi-view and monocular videos. In contrast to the prevalent NeRF-based approaches hampered by slow training and rendering speeds, our approach harnesses recent advancements in point-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically, a novel Dual-Domain Deformation Model (DDDM) is proposed to explicitly model attribute deformations of each Gaussian point, where the time-dependent residual of each attribute is captured by a polynomial fitting in the time domain, and a Fourier series fitting in the frequency domain. The proposed DDDM is capable of modeling complex scene deformations across long video footage, eliminating the need for training separate 3DGS for each frame or introducing an additional implicit neural field to model 3D dynamics. Moreover, the explicit deformation modeling for discretized Gaussian points ensures ultra-fast training and rendering of a 4D scene, which is comparable to the original 3DGS designed for static 3D reconstruction. Our proposed approach showcases a substantial efficiency improvement, achieving a $5\times$ faster training speed compared to the per-frame 3DGS modeling. In addition, quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian-Flow significantly outperforms previous leading methods in novel view rendering quality.

- **Summary**: In response to the increasing global demand for food, feed, fiber, and fuel, digital agriculture is rapidly evolving to meet these demands while reducing environmental impact. This evolution involves incorporating data science, machine learning, sensor technologies, robotics, and new management strategies to establish a more sustainable agricultural framework. So far, machine learning research in digital agriculture has predominantly focused on model-centric approaches, focusing on model design and evaluation. These efforts aim to optimize model accuracy and efficiency, often treating data as a static benchmark. Despite the availability of agricultural data and methodological advancements, a saturation point has been reached, with many established machine learning methods achieving comparable levels of accuracy and facing similar limitations. To fully realize the potential of digital agriculture, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the role of data in the field and to adopt data-centric machine learning. This involves developing strategies to acquire and curate valuable data and implementing effective learning and evaluation strategies that utilize the intrinsic value of data. This approach has the potential to create accurate, generalizable, and adaptable machine learning methods that effectively and sustainably address agricultural tasks such as yield prediction, weed detection, and early disease identification

This hinders the model to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this problem, we contribute a new benchmark named \textbf{UFineBench} for text-based person retrieval with ultra-fine granularity.   Firstly, we construct a new \textbf{dataset} named UFine6926. We collect a large number of person images and manually annotate each image with two detailed textual descriptions, averaging 80.8 words each. The average word count is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of standard in-domain evaluation, we also propose a special \textbf{evaluation paradigm} more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation set with cross domains, cross textual granularity and cross textual styles, named UFine3C, and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval ability, named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover, we propose CFAM, a more efficient \textbf{algorithm} especially designed for text-based person retrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by adopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match mechanism.   With standard in-domain evaluation, CFAM establishes competitive performance across various datasets, especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926. Furthermore, by evaluating on UFine3C, we demonstrate that training on our UFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with other coarse-grained datasets. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Zplusdragon/UFineBench}.

- **Summary**: Facial geometry and appearance capture have demonstrated tremendous success in 3D scanning real humans in studios. Recent works propose to democratize this technique while keeping the results high quality. However, they are still inconvenient for daily usage. In addition, they focus on an easier problem of only capturing facial skin. This paper proposes a novel method for high-quality face capture, featuring an easy-to-use system and the capability to model the complete face with skin, mouth interior, hair, and eyes. We reconstruct facial geometry and appearance from a single co-located smartphone flashlight sequence captured in a dim room where the flashlight is the dominant light source (e.g. rooms with curtains or at night). To model the complete face, we propose a novel hybrid representation to effectively model both eyes and other facial regions, along with novel techniques to learn it from images. We apply a combined lighting model to compactly represent real illuminations and exploit a morphable face albedo model as a reflectance prior to disentangle diffuse and specular. Experiments show that our method can capture high-quality 3D relightable scans.

- **Summary**: Image-based crop growth modeling can substantially contribute to precision agriculture by revealing spatial crop development over time, which allows an early and location-specific estimation of relevant future plant traits, such as leaf area or biomass. A prerequisite for realistic and sharp crop image generation is the integration of multiple growth-influencing conditions in a model, such as an image of an initial growth stage, the associated growth time, and further information about the field treatment. We present a two-stage framework consisting first of an image prediction model and second of a growth estimation model, which both are independently trained. The image prediction model is a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (CWGAN). In the generator of this model, conditional batch normalization (CBN) is used to integrate different conditions along with the input image. This allows the model to generate time-varying artificial images dependent on multiple influencing factors of different kinds. These images are used by the second part of the framework for plant phenotyping by deriving plant-specific traits and comparing them with those of non-artificial (real) reference images. For various crop datasets, the framework allows realistic, sharp image predictions with a slight loss of quality from short-term to long-term predictions. Simulations of varying growth-influencing conditions performed with the trained framework provide valuable insights into how such factors relate to crop appearances, which is particularly useful in complex, less explored crop mixture systems. Further results show that adding process-based simulated biomass as a condition increases the accuracy of the derived phenotypic traits from the predicted images. This demonstrates the potential of our framework to serve as an interface between an image- and process-based crop growth model.

- **Summary**: Ambiguous optical illusions have been a paradigmatic object of fascination, research and inspiration in arts, psychology and video games. However, accurate computational models of perception of ambiguous figures have been elusive. In this paper, we design and train a deep neural network model to simulate the human's perception of the Necker cube, an ambiguous drawing with several alternating possible interpretations. Defining the weights of the neural network connection using a quantum generator of truly random numbers, in agreement with the emerging concepts of quantum artificial intelligence and quantum cognition we reveal that the actual perceptual state of the Necker cube is a qubit-like superposition of the two fundamental perceptual states predicted by classical theories. Our results will find applications in video games and virtual reality systems employed for training of astronauts and operators of unmanned aerial vehicles. They will also be useful for researchers working in the fields of machine learning and vision, psychology of perception and quantum-mechanical models of human mind and decision-making.

- **Summary**: Perceptual metrics are traditionally used to evaluate the quality of natural signals, such as images and audio. They are designed to mimic the perceptual behaviour of human observers and usually reflect structures found in natural signals. This motivates their use as loss functions for training generative models such that models will learn to capture the structure held in the metric. We take this idea to the extreme in the audio domain by training a compressive autoencoder to reconstruct uniform noise, in lieu of natural data. We show that training with perceptual losses improves the reconstruction of spectrograms and re-synthesized audio at test time over models trained with a standard Euclidean loss. This demonstrates better generalisation to unseen natural signals when using perceptual metrics.

- **Summary**: Recently Text-to-Video (T2V) synthesis has undergone a breakthrough by training transformers or diffusion models on large-scale datasets. Nevertheless, inferring such large models incurs huge costs.Previous inference acceleration works either require costly retraining or are model-specific.To address this issue, instead of retraining we explore the inference process of two mainstream T2V models using transformers and diffusion models.The exploration reveals the redundancy in temporal attention modules of both models, which are commonly utilized to establish temporal relations among frames.Consequently, we propose a training-free and generalized pruning strategy called F3-Pruning to prune redundant temporal attention weights.Specifically, when aggregate temporal attention values are ranked below a certain ratio, corresponding weights will be pruned.Extensive experiments on three datasets using a classic transformer-based model CogVideo and a typical diffusion-based model Tune-A-Video verify the effectiveness of F3-Pruning in inference acceleration, quality assurance and broad applicability.

- **Summary**: We have recently seen tremendous progress in photo-real human modeling and rendering. Yet, efficiently rendering realistic human performance and integrating it into the rasterization pipeline remains challenging. In this paper, we present HiFi4G, an explicit and compact Gaussian-based approach for high-fidelity human performance rendering from dense footage. Our core intuition is to marry the 3D Gaussian representation with non-rigid tracking, achieving a compact and compression-friendly representation. We first propose a dual-graph mechanism to obtain motion priors, with a coarse deformation graph for effective initialization and a fine-grained Gaussian graph to enforce subsequent constraints. Then, we utilize a 4D Gaussian optimization scheme with adaptive spatial-temporal regularizers to effectively balance the non-rigid prior and Gaussian updating. We also present a companion compression scheme with residual compensation for immersive experiences on various platforms. It achieves a substantial compression rate of approximately 25 times, with less than 2MB of storage per frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of optimization speed, rendering quality, and storage overhead.

- **Summary**: Mobile service robots are proving to be increasingly effective in a range of applications, such as healthcare, monitoring Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and facilitating Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). These robots heavily rely on Human Action Recognition (HAR) to interpret human actions and intentions. However, for HAR to function effectively on service robots, it requires prior knowledge of human presence (human detection) and identification of individuals to monitor (human tracking). In this work, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that encompasses the entire process, starting from human detection and tracking, leading to action recognition. The pipeline is designed to operate in near real-time while ensuring all stages of processing are performed on the edge, reducing the need for centralised computation. To identify the most suitable models for our mobile robot, we conducted a series of experiments comparing state-of-the-art solutions based on both their detection performance and efficiency. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline, we proposed a dataset comprising daily household activities. By presenting our findings and analysing the results, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in enabling mobile robots to understand and respond to human behaviour in real-world scenarios relying mainly on the data from their RGB cameras.

- **Summary**: The conventional pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm, while effective for common diseases with ample data, faces challenges in diagnosing data-scarce occupational diseases like pneumoconiosis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibits unprecedented ability when conducting multiple tasks in dialogue, bringing opportunities to diagnosis. A common strategy might involve using adapter layers for vision-language alignment and diagnosis in a dialogic manner. Yet, this approach often requires optimization of extensive learnable parameters in the text branch and the dialogue head, potentially diminishing the LLMs' efficacy, especially with limited training data. In our work, we innovate by eliminating the text branch and substituting the dialogue head with a classification head. This approach presents a more effective method for harnessing LLMs in diagnosis with fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, to balance the retention of detailed image information with progression towards accurate diagnosis, we introduce the contextual multi-token engine. This engine is specialized in adaptively generating diagnostic tokens. Additionally, we propose the information emitter module, which unidirectionally emits information from image tokens to diagnosis tokens. Comprehensive experiments validate the superiority of our methods and the effectiveness of proposed modules. Our codes can be found at https://github.com/CodeMonsterPHD/PneumoLLM/tree/main.

- **Summary**: The success of large language models has inspired the computer vision community to explore image segmentation foundation model that is able to zero/few-shot generalize through prompt engineering. Segment-Anything(SAM), among others, is the state-of-the-art image segmentation foundation model demonstrating strong zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the success, recent studies reveal the weakness of SAM under strong distribution shift. In particular, SAM performs awkwardly on corrupted natural images, camouflaged images, medical images, etc. Motivated by the observations, we aim to develop a self-training based strategy to adapt SAM to target distribution. Given the unique challenges of large source dataset, high computation cost and incorrect pseudo label, we propose a weakly supervised self-training architecture with anchor regularization and low-rank finetuning to improve the robustness and computation efficiency of adaptation. We validate the effectiveness on 5 types of downstream segmentation tasks including natural clean/corrupted images, medical images, camouflaged images and robotic images. Our proposed method is task-agnostic in nature and outperforms pre-trained SAM and state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on almost all downstream tasks with the same testing prompt inputs.

- **Summary**: Automatic detection and tracking of cells in microscopy images are major applications of computer vision technologies in both biomedical research and clinical practice. Though machine learning methods are increasingly common in these fields, classical algorithms still offer significant advantages for both tasks, including better explainability, faster computation, lower hardware requirements and more consistent performance. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on gravitational force fields that can compete with, and potentially outperform modern machine learning models when applied to fluorescence microscopy images. This method includes detection, segmentation, and tracking elements, with the results demonstrated on a Cell Tracking Challenge dataset.

- **Summary**: We present Kandinsky 3.0, a large-scale text-to-image generation model based on latent diffusion, continuing the series of text-to-image Kandinsky models and reflecting our progress to achieve higher quality and realism of image generation. Compared to previous versions of Kandinsky 2.x, Kandinsky 3.0 leverages a two times larger U-Net backbone, a ten times larger text encoder and removes diffusion mapping. We describe the architecture of the model, the data collection procedure, the training technique, and the production system of user interaction. We focus on the key components that, as we have identified as a result of a large number of experiments, had the most significant impact on improving the quality of our model compared to the others. By our side-by-side comparisons, Kandinsky becomes better in text understanding and works better on specific domains. Project page: https://ai-forever.github.io/Kandinsky-3

- **Summary**: The substantial computational costs of diffusion models, particularly due to the repeated denoising steps crucial for high-quality image generation, present a major obstacle to their widespread adoption. While several studies have attempted to address this issue by reducing the number of score function evaluations using advanced ODE solvers without fine-tuning, the decreased number of denoising iterations misses the opportunity to update fine details, resulting in noticeable quality degradation. In our work, we introduce an advanced acceleration technique that leverages the temporal redundancy inherent in diffusion models. Reusing feature maps with high temporal similarity opens up a new opportunity to save computation without sacrificing output quality. To realize the practical benefits of this intuition, we conduct an extensive analysis and propose a novel method, FRDiff. FRDiff is designed to harness the advantages of both reduced NFE and feature reuse, achieving a Pareto frontier that balances fidelity and latency trade-offs in various generative tasks.

- **Summary**: UAVs are playing an increasingly important role in the field of wilderness rescue by virtue of their flexibility. This paper proposes a fusion of UAV vision technology and satellite image analysis technology for active wildfires detection and road networks extraction of wildfire areas and real-time dynamic escape route planning for people in distress. Firstly, the fire source location and the segmentation of smoke and flames are targeted based on Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. Secondly, the road segmentation and the road condition assessment are performed by D-linkNet and NDVI values in the central area of the fire source by UAV. Finally, the dynamic optimal route planning for humans in real time is performed by the weighted A* algorithm in the road network with the dynamic fire spread model. Taking the Chongqing wildfire on August 24, 2022, as a case study, the results demonstrate that the dynamic escape route planning algorithm can provide an optimal real-time navigation path for humans in the presence of fire through the information fusion of UAVs and satellites.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on many tasks, are susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit inherent vulnerabilities in their architectures. Adversarial attacks manipulate the input data with imperceptible perturbations, causing the model to misclassify the data or produce erroneous outputs. This work is based on enhancing the robustness of targeted classifier models against adversarial attacks. To achieve this, an convolutional autoencoder-based approach is employed that effectively counters adversarial perturbations introduced to the input images. By generating images closely resembling the input images, the proposed methodology aims to restore the model's accuracy.

- **Summary**: Contemporary machine learning requires training large neural networks on massive datasets and thus faces the challenges of high computational demands. Dataset distillation, as a recent emerging strategy, aims to compress real-world datasets for efficient training. However, this line of research currently struggle with large-scale and high-resolution datasets, hindering its practicality and feasibility. To this end, we re-examine the existing dataset distillation methods and identify three properties required for large-scale real-world applications, namely, realism, diversity, and efficiency. As a remedy, we propose RDED, a novel computationally-efficient yet effective data distillation paradigm, to enable both diversity and realism of the distilled data. Extensive empirical results over various neural architectures and datasets demonstrate the advancement of RDED: we can distill the full ImageNet-1K to a small dataset comprising 10 images per class within 7 minutes, achieving a notable 42% top-1 accuracy with ResNet-18 on a single RTX-4090 GPU (while the SOTA only achieves 21% but requires 6 hours).

- **Summary**: Human pose forecasting is the task of predicting articulated human motion given past human motion. There exists a number of popular benchmarks that evaluate an array of different models performing human pose forecasting. These benchmarks do not reflect that a human interacting system, such as a delivery robot, observes and plans for the motion of the same individual over an extended period of time. Every individual has unique and distinct movement patterns. This is however not reflected in existing benchmarks that evaluate a model's ability to predict an average human's motion rather than a particular individual's. We reformulate the human motion forecasting problem and present a model-agnostic personalization method. Motion forecasting personalization can be performed efficiently online by utilizing a low-parametric time-series analysis model that personalizes neural network pose predictions.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Low-shot Object Learning with Mutual Exclusivity Bias (LSME), the first computational framing of mutual exclusivity bias, a phenomenon commonly observed in infants during word learning. We provide a novel dataset, comprehensive baselines, and a state-of-the-art method to enable the ML community to tackle this challenging learning task. The goal of LSME is to analyze an RGB image of a scene containing multiple objects and correctly associate a previously-unknown object instance with a provided category label. This association is then used to perform low-shot learning to test category generalization. We provide a data generation pipeline for the LSME problem and conduct a thorough analysis of the factors that contribute to its difficulty. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of multiple baselines, including state-of-the-art foundation models. Finally, we present a baseline approach that outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of low-shot accuracy.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art image generation models such as Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have demonstrated the capacity to produce visually striking food-related images. However, these generated images often exhibit an artistic or surreal quality that diverges from the authenticity of real-world food representations. This inadequacy renders them impractical for applications requiring realistic food imagery, such as training models for image-based dietary assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce FoodFusion, a Latent Diffusion model engineered specifically for the faithful synthesis of realistic food images from textual descriptions. The development of the FoodFusion model involves harnessing an extensive array of open-source food datasets, resulting in over 300,000 curated image-caption pairs. Additionally, we propose and employ two distinct data cleaning methodologies to ensure that the resulting image-text pairs maintain both realism and accuracy.

- **Summary**: In the field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), accurately discerning commander intent and executing linguistic commands within a visual context presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces a sophisticated encoder-decoder framework, developed to address visual grounding in AVs.Our Context-Aware Visual Grounding (CAVG) model is an advanced system that integrates five core encoders-Text, Image, Context, and Cross-Modal-with a Multimodal decoder. This integration enables the CAVG model to adeptly capture contextual semantics and to learn human emotional features, augmented by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-4. The architecture of CAVG is reinforced by the implementation of multi-head cross-modal attention mechanisms and a Region-Specific Dynamic (RSD) layer for attention modulation. This architectural design enables the model to efficiently process and interpret a range of cross-modal inputs, yielding a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between verbal commands and corresponding visual scenes. Empirical evaluations on the Talk2Car dataset, a real-world benchmark, demonstrate that CAVG establishes new standards in prediction accuracy and operational efficiency. Notably, the model exhibits exceptional performance even with limited training data, ranging from 50% to 75% of the full dataset. This feature highlights its effectiveness and potential for deployment in practical AV applications. Moreover, CAVG has shown remarkable robustness and adaptability in challenging scenarios, including long-text command interpretation, low-light conditions, ambiguous command contexts, inclement weather conditions, and densely populated urban environments. The code for the proposed model is available at our Github.

- **Summary**: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) has become increasingly popular recently. Due to the characteristics of ORSIs, ORSI-SOD is full of challenges, such as multiple objects, small objects, low illuminations, and irregular shapes. To address these challenges, we propose a concise yet effective Texture-Semantic Collaboration Network (TSCNet) to explore the collaboration of texture cues and semantic cues for ORSI-SOD. Specifically, TSCNet is based on the generic encoder-decoder structure. In addition to the encoder and decoder, TSCNet includes a vital Texture-Semantic Collaboration Module (TSCM), which performs valuable feature modulation and interaction on basic features extracted from the encoder. The main idea of our TSCM is to make full use of the texture features at the lowest level and the semantic features at the highest level to achieve the expression enhancement of salient regions on features. In the TSCM, we first enhance the position of potential salient regions using semantic features. Then, we render and restore the object details using the texture features. Meanwhile, we also perceive regions of various scales, and construct interactions between different regions. Thanks to the perfect combination of TSCM and generic structure, our TSCNet can take care of both the position and details of salient objects, effectively handling various scenes. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our TSCNet achieves competitive performance compared to 14 state-of-the-art methods. The code and results of our method are available at https://github.com/MathLee/TSCNet.

- **Summary**: Face inpainting is important in various applications, such as photo restoration, image editing, and virtual reality. Despite the significant advances in face generative models, ensuring that a person's unique facial identity is maintained during the inpainting process is still an elusive goal. Current state-of-the-art techniques, exemplified by MyStyle, necessitate resource-intensive fine-tuning and a substantial number of images for each new identity. Furthermore, existing methods often fall short in accommodating user-specified semantic attributes, such as beard or expression. To improve inpainting results, and reduce the computational complexity during inference, this paper proposes the use of Parallel Visual Attention (PVA) in conjunction with diffusion models. Specifically, we insert parallel attention matrices to each cross-attention module in the denoising network, which attends to features extracted from reference images by an identity encoder. We train the added attention modules and identity encoder on CelebAHQ-IDI, a dataset proposed for identity-preserving face inpainting. Experiments demonstrate that PVA attains unparalleled identity resemblance in both face inpainting and face inpainting with language guidance tasks, in comparison to various benchmarks, including MyStyle, Paint by Example, and Custom Diffusion. Our findings reveal that PVA ensures good identity preservation while offering effective language-controllability. Additionally, in contrast to Custom Diffusion, PVA requires just 40 fine-tuning steps for each new identity, which translates to a significant speed increase of over 20 times.

- **Summary**: This technical report presents LongViT, a vision Transformer that can process gigapixel images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we split the gigapixel image into a sequence of millions of patches and project them linearly into embeddings. LongNet is then employed to model the extremely long sequence, generating representations that capture both short-range and long-range dependencies. The linear computation complexity of LongNet, along with its distributed algorithm, enables us to overcome the constraints of both computation and memory. We apply LongViT in the field of computational pathology, aiming for cancer diagnosis and prognosis within gigapixel whole-slide images. Experimental results demonstrate that LongViT effectively encodes gigapixel images and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on cancer subtyping and survival prediction.

- **Summary**: The challenge of kinship verification from facial images represents a cutting-edge and formidable frontier in the realms of pattern recognition and computer vision. This area of study holds a myriad of potential applications, spanning from image annotation and forensic analysis to social media research. Our research stands out by integrating a preprocessing method named Multiscale Retinex (MSR), which elevates image quality and amplifies contrast, ultimately bolstering the end results. Strategically, our methodology capitalizes on the harmonious blend of deep and shallow texture descriptors, merging them proficiently at the score level through the Logistic Regression (LR) method. To elucidate, we employ the Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) descriptor to extract shallow texture characteristics. For deep feature extraction, we turn to the prowess of the VGG16 model, which is pre-trained on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The robustness and efficacy of our method have been put to the test through meticulous experiments on three rigorous kinship datasets, namely: Cornell Kin Face, UB Kin Face, and TS Kin Face.

- **Summary**: In real life, various degradation scenarios exist that might damage document images, making it harder to recognize and analyze them, thus binarization is a fundamental and crucial step for achieving the most optimal performance in any document analysis task. We propose DocBinFormer (Document Binarization Transformer), a novel two-level vision transformer (TL-ViT) architecture based on vision transformers for effective document image binarization. The presented architecture employs a two-level transformer encoder to effectively capture both global and local feature representation from the input images. These complimentary bi-level features are exploited for efficient document image binarization, resulting in improved results for system-generated as well as handwritten document images in a comprehensive approach. With the absence of convolutional layers, the transformer encoder uses the pixel patches and sub-patches along with their positional information to operate directly on them, while the decoder generates a clean (binarized) output image from the latent representation of the patches. Instead of using a simple vision transformer block to extract information from the image patches, the proposed architecture uses two transformer blocks for greater coverage of the extracted feature space on a global and local scale. The encoded feature representation is used by the decoder block to generate the corresponding binarized output. Extensive experiments on a variety of DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four metrics.

- **Summary**: We propose Context Diffusion, a diffusion-based framework that enables image generation models to learn from visual examples presented in context. Recent work tackles such in-context learning for image generation, where a query image is provided alongside context examples and text prompts. However, the quality and fidelity of the generated images deteriorate when the prompt is not present, demonstrating that these models are unable to truly learn from the visual context. To address this, we propose a novel framework that separates the encoding of the visual context and preserving the structure of the query images. This results in the ability to learn from the visual context and text prompts, but also from either one of them. Furthermore, we enable our model to handle few-shot settings, to effectively address diverse in-context learning scenarios. Our experiments and user study demonstrate that Context Diffusion excels in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, resulting in an overall enhancement in image quality and fidelity compared to counterpart models.

- **Summary**: This work aims to leverage pre-trained foundation models, such as contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) and segment anything model (SAM), to address weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level labels. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework based on CLIP and SAM for generating high-quality segmentation seeds. Specifically, we construct an image classification task and a seed segmentation task, which are jointly performed by CLIP with frozen weights and two sets of learnable task-specific prompts. A SAM-based seeding (SAMS) module is designed and applied to each task to produce either coarse or fine seed maps. Moreover, we design a multi-label contrastive loss supervised by image-level labels and a CAM activation loss supervised by the generated coarse seed map. These losses are used to learn the prompts, which are the only parts need to be learned in our framework. Once the prompts are learned, we input each image along with the learned segmentation-specific prompts into CLIP and the SAMS module to produce high-quality segmentation seeds. These seeds serve as pseudo labels to train an off-the-shelf segmentation network like other two-stage WSSS methods. Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and competitive results on MS COCO 2014.

- **Summary**: Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g. color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g. a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training.

- **Summary**: Achieving high-quality versatile image inpainting, where user-specified regions are filled with plausible content according to user intent, presents a significant challenge. Existing methods face difficulties in simultaneously addressing context-aware image inpainting and text-guided object inpainting due to the distinct optimal training strategies required. To overcome this challenge, we introduce PowerPaint, the first high-quality and versatile inpainting model that excels in both tasks. First, we introduce learnable task prompts along with tailored fine-tuning strategies to guide the model's focus on different inpainting targets explicitly. This enables PowerPaint to accomplish various inpainting tasks by utilizing different task prompts, resulting in state-of-the-art performance. Second, we demonstrate the versatility of the task prompt in PowerPaint by showcasing its effectiveness as a negative prompt for object removal. Additionally, we leverage prompt interpolation techniques to enable controllable shape-guided object inpainting. Finally, we extensively evaluate PowerPaint on various inpainting benchmarks to demonstrate its superior performance for versatile image inpainting. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://powerpaint.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-motion generation using diffusion and autoregressive models have shown promising results. However, these models often suffer from a trade-off between real-time performance, high fidelity, and motion editability. To address this gap, we introduce MMM, a novel yet simple motion generation paradigm based on Masked Motion Model. MMM consists of two key components: (1) a motion tokenizer that transforms 3D human motion into a sequence of discrete tokens in latent space, and (2) a conditional masked motion transformer that learns to predict randomly masked motion tokens, conditioned on the pre-computed text tokens. By attending to motion and text tokens in all directions, MMM explicitly captures inherent dependency among motion tokens and semantic mapping between motion and text tokens. During inference, this allows parallel and iterative decoding of multiple motion tokens that are highly consistent with fine-grained text descriptions, therefore simultaneously achieving high-fidelity and high-speed motion generation. In addition, MMM has innate motion editability. By simply placing mask tokens in the place that needs editing, MMM automatically fills the gaps while guaranteeing smooth transitions between editing and non-editing parts. Extensive experiments on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMM surpasses current leading methods in generating high-quality motion (evidenced by superior FID scores of 0.08 and 0.429), while offering advanced editing features such as body-part modification, motion in-betweening, and the synthesis of long motion sequences. In addition, MMM is two orders of magnitude faster on a single mid-range GPU than editable motion diffusion models. Our project page is available at \url{https://exitudio.github.io/MMM-page}.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results on many modalities including images, speech, and video. However, existing models are not tailored to support remote sensing data, which is widely used in important applications including environmental monitoring and crop-yield prediction. Satellite images are significantly different from natural images -- they can be multi-spectral, irregularly sampled across time -- and existing diffusion models trained on images from the Web do not support them. Furthermore, remote sensing data is inherently spatio-temporal, requiring conditional generation tasks not supported by traditional methods based on captions or images. In this paper, we present DiffusionSat, to date the largest generative foundation model trained on a collection of publicly available large, high-resolution remote sensing datasets. As text-based captions are sparsely available for satellite images, we incorporate the associated metadata such as geolocation as conditioning information. Our method produces realistic samples and can be used to solve multiple generative tasks including temporal generation, superresolution given multi-spectral inputs and in-painting. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for satellite image generation and is the first large-scale $\textit{generative}$ foundation model for satellite imagery.

- **Summary**: Learned object detection methods based on fusion of LiDAR and camera data require labeled training samples, but niche applications, such as warehouse robotics or automated infrastructure, require semantic classes not available in large existing datasets. Therefore, to facilitate the rapid creation of multimodal object detection datasets and alleviate the burden of human labeling, we propose a novel automated annotation pipeline. Our method uses an indoor positioning system (IPS) to produce accurate detection labels for both point clouds and images and eliminates manual annotation entirely. In an experiment, the system annotates objects of interest 261.8 times faster than a human baseline and speeds up end-to-end dataset creation by 61.5%.

- **Summary**: Utilizing pre-trained 2D large-scale generative models, recent works are capable of generating high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image. However, due to the lack of information from multiple views, these works encounter difficulties in generating controllable novel views. In this paper, we present DreamComposer, a flexible and scalable framework that can enhance existing view-aware diffusion models by injecting multi-view conditions. Specifically, DreamComposer first uses a view-aware 3D lifting module to obtain 3D representations of an object from multiple views. Then, it renders the latent features of the target view from 3D representations with the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally the target view features extracted from multi-view inputs are injected into a pre-trained diffusion model. Experiments show that DreamComposer is compatible with state-of-the-art diffusion models for zero-shot novel view synthesis, further enhancing them to generate high-fidelity novel view images with multi-view conditions, ready for controllable 3D object reconstruction and various other applications.

- **Summary**: We present TokenCompose, a Latent Diffusion Model for text-to-image generation that achieves enhanced consistency between user-specified text prompts and model-generated images. Despite its tremendous success, the standard denoising process in the Latent Diffusion Model takes text prompts as conditions only, absent explicit constraint for the consistency between the text prompts and the image contents, leading to unsatisfactory results for composing multiple object categories. TokenCompose aims to improve multi-category instance composition by introducing the token-wise consistency terms between the image content and object segmentation maps in the finetuning stage. TokenCompose can be applied directly to the existing training pipeline of text-conditioned diffusion models without extra human labeling information. By finetuning Stable Diffusion, the model exhibits significant improvements in multi-category instance composition and enhanced photorealism for its generated images.

- **Summary**: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a new paradigmatic vision foundation model, showcasing potent zero-shot generalization and flexible prompting. Despite SAM finding applications and adaptations in various domains, its primary limitation lies in the inability to grasp object semantics. In this paper, we present Sambor to seamlessly integrate SAM with the open-vocabulary object detector in an end-to-end framework. While retaining all the remarkable capabilities inherent to SAM, we enhance it with the capacity to detect arbitrary objects based on human inputs like category names or reference expressions. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel SideFormer module that extracts SAM features to facilitate zero-shot object localization and inject comprehensive semantic information for open-vocabulary recognition. In addition, we devise an open-set region proposal network (Open-set RPN), enabling the detector to acquire the open-set proposals generated by SAM. Sambor demonstrates superior zero-shot performance across benchmarks, including COCO and LVIS, proving highly competitive against previous SoTA methods. We aspire for this work to serve as a meaningful endeavor in endowing SAM to recognize diverse object categories and advancing open-vocabulary learning with the support of vision foundation models.

- **Summary**: While recent years have seen rapid progress in image-conditioned text generation, image captioning still suffers from the fundamental issue of hallucinations, the generation of spurious details that cannot be inferred from the given image. Dedicated methods for reducing hallucinations in image captioning largely focus on closed-vocabulary object tokens, ignoring most types of hallucinations that occur in practice. In this work, we propose MOCHa, an approach that harnesses advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) to address the sequence-level nature of hallucinations in an open-world setup. To optimize for caption fidelity to the input image, we leverage ground-truth reference captions as proxies to measure the logical consistency of generated captions. However, optimizing for caption fidelity alone fails to preserve the semantic adequacy of generations; therefore, we propose a multi-objective reward function that jointly targets these qualities, without requiring any strong supervision. We demonstrate that these goals can be simultaneously optimized with our framework, enhancing performance for various captioning models of different scales. Our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate MOCHa's superior performance across various established metrics. We also demonstrate the benefit of our method in the open-vocabulary setting. To this end, we contribute OpenCHAIR, a new benchmark for quantifying open-vocabulary hallucinations in image captioning models, constructed using generative foundation models. We will release our code, benchmark, and trained models.

- **Summary**: The vast majority of standard image and video content available online is represented in display-encoded color spaces, in which pixel values are conveniently scaled to a limited range (0-1) and the color distribution is approximately perceptually uniform. In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, up to 10-15 dB.

- **Summary**: Motions in a video primarily consist of camera motion, induced by camera movement, and object motion, resulting from object movement. Accurate control of both camera and object motion is essential for video generation. However, existing works either mainly focus on one type of motion or do not clearly distinguish between the two, limiting their control capabilities and diversity. Therefore, this paper presents MotionCtrl, a unified and flexible motion controller for video generation designed to effectively and independently control camera and object motion. The architecture and training strategy of MotionCtrl are carefully devised, taking into account the inherent properties of camera motion, object motion, and imperfect training data. Compared to previous methods, MotionCtrl offers three main advantages: 1) It effectively and independently controls camera motion and object motion, enabling more fine-grained motion control and facilitating flexible and diverse combinations of both types of motion. 2) Its motion conditions are determined by camera poses and trajectories, which are appearance-free and minimally impact the appearance or shape of objects in generated videos. 3) It is a relatively generalizable model that can adapt to a wide array of camera poses and trajectories once trained. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of MotionCtrl over existing methods.

- **Summary**: Double staining in histopathology, particularly for metaplastic breast cancer, typically employs H&E and P63 dyes. However, P63's tissue damage and high cost necessitate alternative methods. This study introduces xAI-CycleGAN, an advanced architecture combining Mask CycleGAN with explainability features and structure-preserving capabilities for transforming H&E stained breast tissue images into P63-like images. The architecture allows for output editing, enhancing resemblance to actual images and enabling further model refinement. We showcase xAI-CycleGAN's efficacy in maintaining structural integrity and generating high-quality images. Additionally, a histopathologist survey indicates the generated images' realism is often comparable to actual images, validating our model's high-quality output.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have garnered increasing interest in autonomous driving areas, due to their advanced capabilities in complex reasoning tasks essential for highly autonomous vehicle behavior. Despite their potential, research in autonomous systems is hindered by the lack of datasets with annotated reasoning chains that explain the decision-making processes in driving. To bridge this gap, we present Reason2Drive, a benchmark dataset with over 600K video-text pairs, aimed at facilitating the study of interpretable reasoning in complex driving environments. We distinctly characterize the autonomous driving process as a sequential combination of perception, prediction, and reasoning steps, and the question-answer pairs are automatically collected from a diverse range of open-source outdoor driving datasets, including nuScenes, Waymo and ONCE. Moreover, we introduce a novel aggregated evaluation metric to assess chain-based reasoning performance in autonomous systems, addressing the semantic ambiguities of existing metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conduct experiments to assess various existing VLMs, revealing insights into their reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we develop an efficient approach to empower VLMs to leverage object-level perceptual elements in both feature extraction and prediction, further enhancing their reasoning accuracy. The code and dataset will be released.

- **Summary**: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VITON) aims to transfer an in-shop garment image onto a target person. While existing methods focus on warping the garment to fit the body pose, they often overlook the synthesis quality around the garment-skin boundary and realistic effects like wrinkles and shadows on the warped garments. These limitations greatly reduce the realism of the generated results and hinder the practical application of VITON techniques. Leveraging the notable success of diffusion-based models in cross-modal image synthesis, some recent diffusion-based methods have ventured to tackle this issue. However, they tend to either consume a significant amount of training resources or struggle to achieve realistic try-on effects and retain garment details. For efficient and high-fidelity VITON, we propose WarpDiffusion, which bridges the warping-based and diffusion-based paradigms via a novel informative and local garment feature attention mechanism. Specifically, WarpDiffusion incorporates local texture attention to reduce resource consumption and uses a novel auto-mask module that effectively retains only the critical areas of the warped garment while disregarding unrealistic or erroneous portions. Notably, WarpDiffusion can be integrated as a plug-and-play component into existing VITON methodologies, elevating their synthesis quality. Extensive experiments on high-resolution VITON benchmarks and an in-the-wild test set demonstrate the superiority of WarpDiffusion, surpassing state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Non-isometric shape correspondence remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Traditional methods using Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO) eigenmodes face limitations in characterizing high-frequency extrinsic shape changes like bending and creases. We propose a novel approach of combining the non-orthogonal extrinsic basis of eigenfunctions of the elastic thin-shell hessian with the intrinsic ones of the LBO, creating a hybrid spectral space in which we construct functional maps. To this end, we present a theoretical framework to effectively integrate non-orthogonal basis functions into descriptor- and learning-based functional map methods. Our approach can be incorporated easily into existing functional map pipelines across varying applications and is able to handle complex deformations beyond isometries. We show extensive evaluations across various supervised and unsupervised settings and demonstrate significant improvements. Notably, our approach achieves up to 15% better mean geodesic error for non-isometric correspondence settings and up to 45% improvement in scenarios with topological noise.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based models, such as the Stable Diffusion model, have revolutionized text-to-image synthesis with their ability to produce high-quality, high-resolution images. These advancements have prompted significant progress in image generation and editing tasks. However, these models also raise concerns due to their tendency to memorize and potentially replicate exact training samples, posing privacy risks and enabling adversarial attacks. Duplication in training datasets is recognized as a major factor contributing to memorization, and various forms of memorization have been studied so far. This paper focuses on two distinct and underexplored types of duplication that lead to replication during inference in diffusion-based models, particularly in the Stable Diffusion model. We delve into these lesser-studied duplication phenomena and their implications through two case studies, aiming to contribute to the safer and more responsible use of generative models in various applications.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advancements in network-based image harmonization techniques, there still exists a domain disparity between typical training pairs and real-world composites encountered during inference. Most existing methods are trained to reverse global edits made on segmented image regions, which fail to accurately capture the lighting inconsistencies between the foreground and background found in composited images. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised illumination harmonization approach formulated in the intrinsic image domain. First, we estimate a simple global lighting model from mid-level vision representations to generate a rough shading for the foreground region. A network then refines this inferred shading to generate a harmonious re-shading that aligns with the background scene. In order to match the color appearance of the foreground and background, we utilize ideas from prior harmonization approaches to perform parameterized image edits in the albedo domain. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we present results from challenging real-world composites and conduct a user study to objectively measure the enhanced realism achieved compared to state-of-the-art harmonization methods.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their strong multimodal understanding capability. However, existing works rely heavily on modality-specific encoders, which usually differ in architecture and are limited to common modalities. In this paper, we present OneLLM, an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unified framework. We achieve this through a unified multimodal encoder and a progressive multimodal alignment pipeline. In detail, we first train an image projection module to connect a vision encoder with LLM. Then, we build a universal projection module (UPM) by mixing multiple image projection modules and dynamic routing. Finally, we progressively align more modalities to LLM with the UPM. To fully leverage the potential of OneLLM in following instructions, we also curated a comprehensive multimodal instruction dataset, including 2M items from image, audio, video, point cloud, depth/normal map, IMU and fMRI brain activity. OneLLM is evaluated on 25 diverse benchmarks, encompassing tasks such as multimodal captioning, question answering and reasoning, where it delivers excellent performance.

- **Summary**: This paper presents $\textbf{R}$epresentation-$\textbf{C}$onditioned image $\textbf{G}$eneration (RCG), a simple yet effective image generation framework which sets a new benchmark in class-unconditional image generation. RCG does not condition on any human annotations. Instead, it conditions on a self-supervised representation distribution which is mapped from the image distribution using a pre-trained encoder. During generation, RCG samples from such representation distribution using a representation diffusion model (RDM), and employs a pixel generator to craft image pixels conditioned on the sampled representation. Such a design provides substantial guidance during the generative process, resulting in high-quality image generation. Tested on ImageNet 256$\times$256, RCG achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 3.31 and an Inception Score (IS) of 253.4. These results not only significantly improve the state-of-the-art of class-unconditional image generation but also rival the current leading methods in class-conditional image generation, bridging the long-standing performance gap between these two tasks.

- **Summary**: In-context learning provides a new perspective for multi-task modeling for vision and NLP. Under this setting, the model can perceive tasks from prompts and accomplish them without any extra task-specific head predictions or model fine-tuning. However, Skeleton sequence modeling via in-context learning remains unexplored. Directly applying existing in-context models from other areas onto skeleton sequences fails due to the inter-frame and cross-task pose similarity that makes it outstandingly hard to perceive the task correctly from a subtle context. To address this challenge, we propose Skeleton-in-Context (SiC), an effective framework for in-context skeleton sequence modeling. Our SiC is able to handle multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously after a single training process and accomplish each task from context according to the given prompt. It can further generalize to new, unseen tasks according to customized prompts. To facilitate context perception, we additionally propose a task-unified prompt, which adaptively learns tasks of different natures, such as partial joint-level generation, sequence-level prediction, or 2D-to-3D motion prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our SiC on multiple tasks, including motion prediction, pose estimation, joint completion, and future pose estimation. We also evaluate its generalization capability on unseen tasks such as motion-in-between. These experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-task performance and even outperforms single-task methods on certain tasks.

- **Summary**: The fidelity of relighting is bounded by both geometry and appearance representations. For geometry, both mesh and volumetric approaches have difficulty modeling intricate structures like 3D hair geometry. For appearance, existing relighting models are limited in fidelity and often too slow to render in real-time with high-resolution continuous environments. In this work, we present Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatars, a method to build high-fidelity relightable head avatars that can be animated to generate novel expressions. Our geometry model based on 3D Gaussians can capture 3D-consistent sub-millimeter details such as hair strands and pores on dynamic face sequences. To support diverse materials of human heads such as the eyes, skin, and hair in a unified manner, we present a novel relightable appearance model based on learnable radiance transfer. Together with global illumination-aware spherical harmonics for the diffuse components, we achieve real-time relighting with spatially all-frequency reflections using spherical Gaussians. This appearance model can be efficiently relit under both point light and continuous illumination. We further improve the fidelity of eye reflections and enable explicit gaze control by introducing relightable explicit eye models. Our method outperforms existing approaches without compromising real-time performance. We also demonstrate real-time relighting of avatars on a tethered consumer VR headset, showcasing the efficiency and fidelity of our avatars.

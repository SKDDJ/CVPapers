- **Summary**: Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is an essential component of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. It enables the recognition of previously visited scenes to eliminate pose and map estimate drifts arising from long-term exploration. However, current appearance-based LCD methods face significant challenges, including high computational costs, viewpoint variance, and dynamic objects in scenes. This paper introduced an online appearance based LCD using local superpixel grids descriptor and dynamic node, i.e, LSGDDN-LCD, to find similarities between scenes via hand-crafted features extracted from LSGD. Unlike traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) based LCD, which requires pre-training, we proposed an adaptive mechanism to group similar images called $\textbf{\textit{dynamic}}$ $\textbf{\textit{node}}$, which incrementally adjusted the database in an online manner, allowing for efficient and online retrieval of previously viewed images without need of the pre-training. Experimental results confirmed that the LSGDDN-LCD significantly improved LCD precision-recall and efficiency, and outperformed several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple typical datasets, indicating its great potential as a generic LCD framework.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the application of unsupervised learning methods for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. To motivate our work, we review several existing priors, namely the truncated Gaussian prior, the $l_1$ prior, the total variation prior, and the deep image prior (DIP). We find that DIP outperforms the other three priors in terms of representational capability and visual performance. However, the performance of DIP deteriorates when the number of iterations exceeds a certain threshold due to overfitting. To address this issue, we propose a novel method (MCDIP-ADMM) based on Multi-Code Deep Image Prior and plug-and-play Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers. Specifically, MCDIP utilizes multiple latent codes to generate a series of feature maps at an intermediate layer within a generator model. These maps are then composed with trainable weights, representing the complete image prior. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MCDIP-ADMM compared to three existing competitors. In the case of parallel beam projection with Gaussian noise, MCDIP-ADMM achieves an average improvement of 4.3 dB over DIP, 1.7 dB over ADMM DIP-WTV, and 1.2 dB over PnP-DIP in terms of PSNR. Similarly, for fan-beam projection with Poisson noise, MCDIP-ADMM achieves an average improvement of 3.09 dB over DIP, 1.86 dB over ADMM DIP-WTV, and 0.84 dB over PnP-DIP in terms of PSNR.

- **Summary**: The internet gives the world an open platform to express their views and share their stories. While this is very valuable, it makes fake news one of our society's most pressing problems. Manual fact checking process is time consuming, which makes it challenging to disprove misleading assertions before they cause significant harm. This is he driving interest in automatic fact or claim verification. Some of the existing datasets aim to support development of automating fact-checking techniques, however, most of them are text based. Multi-modal fact verification has received relatively scant attention. In this paper, we provide a multi-modal fact-checking dataset called FACTIFY 2, improving Factify 1 by using new data sources and adding satire articles. Factify 2 has 50,000 new data instances. Similar to FACTIFY 1.0, we have three broad categories - support, no-evidence, and refute, with sub-categories based on the entailment of visual and textual data. We also provide a BERT and Vison Transformer based baseline, which acheives 65% F1 score in the test set. The baseline codes and the dataset will be made available at https://github.com/surya1701/Factify-2.0.

- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to electro-optical (EO) image translation is a fundamental task in remote sensing that can enrich the dataset by fusing information from different sources. Recently, many methods have been proposed to tackle this task, but they are still difficult to complete the conversion from low-resolution images to high-resolution images. Thus, we propose a framework, SAR2EO, aiming at addressing this challenge. Firstly, to generate high-quality EO images, we adopt the coarse-to-fine generator, multi-scale discriminators, and improved adversarial loss in the pix2pixHD model to increase the synthesis quality. Secondly, we introduce a denoising module to remove the noise in SAR images, which helps to suppress the noise while preserving the structural information of the images. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct experiments on the dataset of the Multi-modal Aerial View Imagery Challenge (MAVIC), which consists of large-scale SAR and EO image pairs. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, and we win the first place in the MAVIC held in CVPR PBVS 2023.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a framework for efficient 3D clothed avatar reconstruction. By combining the advantages of the high accuracy of optimization-based methods and the efficiency of learning-based methods, we propose a coarse-to-fine way to realize a high-fidelity clothed avatar reconstruction (CAR) from a single image. At the first stage, we use an implicit model to learn the general shape in the canonical space of a person in a learning-based way, and at the second stage, we refine the surface detail by estimating the non-rigid deformation in the posed space in an optimization way. A hyper-network is utilized to generate a good initialization so that the convergence o f the optimization process is greatly accelerated. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that the proposed CAR successfully produces high-fidelity avatars for arbitrarily clothed humans in real scenes.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot video object segmentation (ZS-VOS) aims to segment foreground objects in a video sequence without prior knowledge of these objects. However, existing ZS-VOS methods often struggle to distinguish between foreground and background or to keep track of the foreground in complex scenarios. The common practice of introducing motion information, such as optical flow, can lead to overreliance on optical flow estimation. To address these challenges, we propose an encoder-decoder-based hierarchical co-attention propagation network (HCPN) capable of tracking and segmenting objects. Specifically, our model is built upon multiple collaborative evolutions of the parallel co-attention module (PCM) and the cross co-attention module (CCM). PCM captures common foreground regions among adjacent appearance and motion features, while CCM further exploits and fuses cross-modal motion features returned by PCM. Our method is progressively trained to achieve hierarchical spatio-temporal feature propagation across the entire video. Experimental results demonstrate that our HCPN outperforms all previous methods on public benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness for ZS-VOS.

- **Summary**: In deep learning, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have once again garnered attention from researchers. This paper introduces MC-MLP, a general MLP-like backbone for computer vision that is composed of a series of fully-connected (FC) layers. In MC-MLP, we propose that the same semantic information has varying levels of difficulty in learning, depending on the coordinate frame of features. To address this, we perform an orthogonal transform on the feature information, equivalent to changing the coordinate frame of features. Through this design, MC-MLP is equipped with multi-coordinate frame receptive fields and the ability to learn information across different coordinate frames. Experiments demonstrate that MC-MLP outperforms most MLPs in image classification tasks, achieving better performance at the same parameter level. The code will be available at: https://github.com/ZZM11/MC-MLP.

- **Summary**: Infrared thermography has been widely used in several domains to capture and measure temperature distributions across surfaces and objects. This methodology can be further expanded to 3D applications if the spatial distribution of the temperature distribution is available. Structure from Motion (SfM) is a photometric range imaging technique that makes it possible to obtain 3D renderings from a cloud of 2D images. To explore the possibility of 3D reconstruction via SfM from infrared images, this article proposes a photometric correction model for infrared sensors based on temperature constancy. Photometric correction is accomplished by estimating the scene irradiance as the values from the solution to a differential equation for microbolometer pixel excitation with unknown coefficients and initial conditions. The model was integrated into an SfM framework and experimental evaluations demonstrate the contribution of the photometric correction for improving the estimates of both the camera motion and the scene structure. Further, experiments show that the reconstruction quality from the corrected infrared imagery achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art reconstruction using RGB sensors.

- **Summary**: Continual learning aims to efficiently learn from a non-stationary stream of data while avoiding forgetting the knowledge of old data. In many practical applications, data complies with non-Euclidean geometry. As such, the commonly used Euclidean space cannot gracefully capture non-Euclidean geometric structures of data, leading to inferior results. In this paper, we study continual learning from a novel perspective by exploring data geometry for the non-stationary stream of data. Our method dynamically expands the geometry of the underlying space to match growing geometric structures induced by new data, and prevents forgetting by keeping geometric structures of old data into account. In doing so, making use of the mixed curvature space, we propose an incremental search scheme, through which the growing geometric structures are encoded. Then, we introduce an angular-regularization loss and a neighbor-robustness loss to train the model, capable of penalizing the change of global geometric structures and local geometric structures. Experiments show that our method achieves better performance than baseline methods designed in Euclidean space.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a significant player in generative modeling by mapping lower-dimensional random noise to higher-dimensional spaces. These networks have been used to generate high-resolution images and 3D objects. The efficient modeling of 3D objects and human faces is crucial in the development process of 3D graphical environments such as games or simulations. 3D GANs are a new type of generative model used for 3D reconstruction, point cloud reconstruction, and 3D semantic scene completion. The choice of distribution for noise is critical as it represents the latent space. Understanding a GAN's latent space is essential for fine-tuning the generated samples, as demonstrated by the morphing of semantically meaningful parts of images. In this work, we explore the latent space and 3D GANs, examine several GAN variants and training methods to gain insights into improving 3D GAN training, and suggest potential future directions for further research.

- **Summary**: Normalizing flows (NFs) provide a powerful tool to construct an expressive distribution by a sequence of trackable transformations of a base distribution and form a probabilistic model of underlying data. Rotation, as an important quantity in computer vision, graphics, and robotics, can exhibit many ambiguities when occlusion and symmetry occur and thus demands such probabilistic models. Though much progress has been made for NFs in Euclidean space, there are no effective normalizing flows without discontinuity or many-to-one mapping tailored for SO(3) manifold. Given the unique non-Euclidean properties of the rotation manifold, adapting the existing NFs to SO(3) manifold is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a novel normalizing flow on SO(3) by combining a Mobius transformation-based coupling layer and a quaternion affine transformation. With our proposed rotation normalizing flows, one can not only effectively express arbitrary distributions on SO(3), but also conditionally build the target distribution given input observations. Extensive experiments show that our rotation normalizing flows significantly outperform the baselines on both unconditional and conditional tasks.

- **Summary**: Prenatal ultrasound imaging is the first-choice modality to assess fetal health. Medical image datasets for AI and ML methods must be diverse (i.e. diagnoses, diseases, pathologies, scanners, demographics, etc), however there are few public ultrasound fetal imaging datasets due to insufficient amounts of clinical data, patient privacy, rare occurrence of abnormalities in general practice, and limited experts for data collection and validation. To address such data scarcity, we proposed generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based models, diffusion-super-resolution-GAN and transformer-based-GAN, to synthesise images of fetal ultrasound brain planes from one public dataset. We reported that GAN-based methods can generate 256x256 pixel size of fetal ultrasound trans-cerebellum brain image plane with stable training losses, resulting in lower FID values for diffusion-super-resolution-GAN (average 7.04 and lower FID 5.09 at epoch 10) than the FID values of transformer-based-GAN (average 36.02 and lower 28.93 at epoch 60). The results of this work illustrate the potential of GAN-based methods to synthesise realistic high-resolution ultrasound images, leading to future work with other fetal brain planes, anatomies, devices and the need of a pool of experts to evaluate synthesised images.

- **Summary**: The observation and description of collective excitations in solids is a fundamental issue when seeking to understand the physics of a many-body system. Analysis of these excitations is usually carried out by measuring the dynamical structure factor, S(Q, $\omega$), with inelastic neutron or x-ray scattering techniques and comparing this against a calculated dynamical model. Here, we develop an artificial intelligence framework which combines a neural network trained to mimic simulated data from a model Hamiltonian with automatic differentiation to recover unknown parameters from experimental data. We benchmark this approach on a Linear Spin Wave Theory (LSWT) simulator and advanced inelastic neutron scattering data from the square-lattice spin-1 antiferromagnet La$_2$NiO$_4$. We find that the model predicts the unknown parameters with excellent agreement relative to analytical fitting. In doing so, we illustrate the ability to build and train a differentiable model only once, which then can be applied in real-time to multi-dimensional scattering data, without the need for human-guided peak finding and fitting algorithms. This prototypical approach promises a new technology for this field to automatically detect and refine more advanced models for ordered quantum systems.

- **Summary**: To bring digital avatars into people's lives, it is highly demanded to efficiently generate complete, realistic, and animatable head avatars. This task is challenging, and it is difficult for existing methods to satisfy all the requirements at once. To achieve these goals, we propose GANHead (Generative Animatable Neural Head Avatar), a novel generative head model that takes advantages of both the fine-grained control over the explicit expression parameters and the realistic rendering results of implicit representations. Specifically, GANHead represents coarse geometry, fine-gained details and texture via three networks in canonical space to obtain the ability to generate complete and realistic head avatars. To achieve flexible animation, we define the deformation filed by standard linear blend skinning (LBS), with the learned continuous pose and expression bases and LBS weights. This allows the avatars to be directly animated by FLAME parameters and generalize well to unseen poses and expressions. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, GANHead achieves superior performance on head avatar generation and raw scan fitting.

- **Summary**: Cyber attacks has always been of a great concern. Websites and services with poor security layers are the most vulnerable to such cyber attacks. The attackers can easily access sensitive data like credit card details and social security number from such vulnerable services. Currently to stop cyber attacks, various different methods are opted from using two-step verification methods like One-Time Password and push notification services to using high-end bio-metric devices like finger print reader and iris scanner are used as security layers. These current security measures carry a lot of cons and the worst is that user always need to carry the authentication device on them to access their data. To overcome this, we are proposing a technique of using keystroke dynamics (typing pattern) of a user to authenticate the genuine user. In the method, we are taking a data set of 51 users typing a password in 8 sessions done on alternate days to record mood fluctuations of the user. Developed and implemented anomaly-detection algorithm based on distance metrics and machine learning algorithms like Artificial Neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the users. In ANN, we implemented multi-class classification using 1-D convolution as the data was correlated and multi-class classification with negative class which was used to classify anomaly based on all users put together. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 95.05% using ANN with Negative Class. From the results achieved, we can say that the model works perfectly and can be bought into the market as a security layer and a good alternative to two-step verification using external devices. This technique will enable users to have two-step security layer without worrying about carry an authentication device.

- **Summary**: Anticipation problem has been studied considering different aspects such as predicting humans' locations, predicting hands and objects trajectories, and forecasting actions and human-object interactions. In this paper, we studied the short-term object interaction anticipation problem from the egocentric point of view, proposing a new end-to-end architecture named StillFast. Our approach simultaneously processes a still image and a video detecting and localizing next-active objects, predicting the verb which describes the future interaction and determining when the interaction will start. Experiments on the large-scale egocentric dataset EGO4D show that our method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on the considered task. Our method is ranked first in the public leaderboard of the EGO4D short term object interaction anticipation challenge 2022.

- **Summary**: Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved tremendous success in learning image representation. Despite the empirical success, most self-supervised learning methods are rather "inefficient" learners, typically taking hundreds of training epochs to fully converge. In this work, we show that the key towards efficient self-supervised learning is to increase the number of crops from each image instance. Leveraging one of the state-of-the-art SSL method, we introduce a simplistic form of self-supervised learning method called Extreme-Multi-Patch Self-Supervised-Learning (EMP-SSL) that does not rely on many heuristic techniques for SSL such as weight sharing between the branches, feature-wise normalization, output quantization, and stop gradient, etc, and reduces the training epochs by two orders of magnitude. We show that the proposed method is able to converge to 85.1% on CIFAR-10, 58.5% on CIFAR-100, 38.1% on Tiny ImageNet and 58.5% on ImageNet-100 in just one epoch. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves 91.5% on CIFAR-10, 70.1% on CIFAR-100, 51.5% on Tiny ImageNet and 78.9% on ImageNet-100 with linear probing in less than ten training epochs. In addition, we show that EMP-SSL shows significantly better transferability to out-of-domain datasets compared to baseline SSL methods. We will release the code in https://github.com/tsb0601/EMP-SSL.

- **Summary**: During the last few years, continual learning (CL) strategies for image classification and segmentation have been widely investigated designing innovative solutions to tackle catastrophic forgetting, like knowledge distillation and self-inpainting. However, the application of continual learning paradigms to point clouds is still unexplored and investigation is required, especially using architectures that capture the sparsity and uneven distribution of LiDAR data. The current paper analyzes the problem of class incremental learning applied to point cloud semantic segmentation, comparing approaches and state-of-the-art architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of class-incremental continual learning for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation. Different CL strategies were adapted to LiDAR point clouds and tested, tackling both classic fine-tuning scenarios and the Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm. The framework has been evaluated through two different architectures on SemanticKITTI, obtaining results in line with state-of-the-art CL strategies and standard offline learning.

- **Summary**: Failure to recognize samples from the classes unseen during training is a major limitation of artificial intelligence in the real-world implementation for recognition and classification of retinal anomalies. We established an uncertainty-inspired open-set (UIOS) model, which was trained with fundus images of 9 retinal conditions. Besides assessing the probability of each category, UIOS also calculated an uncertainty score to express its confidence. Our UIOS model with thresholding strategy achieved an F1 score of 99.55%, 97.01% and 91.91% for the internal testing set, external target categories (TC)-JSIEC dataset and TC-unseen testing set, respectively, compared to the F1 score of 92.20%, 80.69% and 64.74% by the standard AI model. Furthermore, UIOS correctly predicted high uncertainty scores, which would prompt the need for a manual check in the datasets of non-target categories retinal diseases, low-quality fundus images, and non-fundus images. UIOS provides a robust method for real-world screening of retinal anomalies.

- **Summary**: Existing dehazing approaches struggle to process real-world hazy images owing to the lack of paired real data and robust priors. In this work, we present a new paradigm for real image dehazing from the perspectives of synthesizing more realistic hazy data and introducing more robust priors into the network. Specifically, (1) instead of adopting the de facto physical scattering model, we rethink the degradation of real hazy images and propose a phenomenological pipeline considering diverse degradation types. (2) We propose a Real Image Dehazing network via high-quality Codebook Priors (RIDCP). Firstly, a VQGAN is pre-trained on a large-scale high-quality dataset to obtain the discrete codebook, encapsulating high-quality priors (HQPs). After replacing the negative effects brought by haze with HQPs, the decoder equipped with a novel normalized feature alignment module can effectively utilize high-quality features and produce clean results. However, although our degradation pipeline drastically mitigates the domain gap between synthetic and real data, it is still intractable to avoid it, which challenges HQPs matching in the wild. Thus, we re-calculate the distance when matching the features to the HQPs by a controllable matching operation, which facilitates finding better counterparts. We provide a recommendation to control the matching based on an explainable solution. Users can also flexibly adjust the enhancement degree as per their preference. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our data synthesis pipeline and the superior performance of RIDCP in real image dehazing.

- **Summary**: In the training process of the implicit 3D reconstruction network, the choice of spatial query points' sampling strategy affects the final performance of the model. Different works have differences in the selection of sampling strategies, not only in the spatial distribution of query points but also in the order of magnitude difference in the density of query points. For how to select the sampling strategy of query points, current works are more akin to an enumerating operation to find the optimal solution, which seriously affects work efficiency. In this work, we explored the relationship between sampling strategy and network final performance through classification analysis and experimental comparison from three aspects: the relationship between network type and sampling strategy, the relationship between implicit function and sampling strategy, and the impact of sampling density on model performance. In addition, we also proposed two methods, linear sampling and distance mask, to improve the sampling strategy of query points, making it more general and robust.

- **Summary**: Few Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) with few examples per class for each incremental session is the realistic setting of continual learning since obtaining large number of annotated samples is not feasible and cost effective. We present the framework MASIL as a step towards learning the maximal separable classifier. It addresses the common problem i.e forgetting of old classes and over-fitting to novel classes by learning the classifier weights to be maximally separable between classes forming a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame. We propose the idea of concept factorization explaining the collapsed features for base session classes in terms of concept basis and use these to induce classifier simplex for few shot classes. We further adds fine tuning to reduce any error occurred during factorization and train the classifier jointly on base and novel classes without retaining any base class samples in memory. Experimental results on miniImageNet, CIFAR-100 and CUB-200 demonstrate that MASIL outperforms all the benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been widely adopted as practical and versatile representations for 3D scenes, facilitating various downstream tasks. However, different architectures, including plain Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Tensors, low-rank Tensors, Hashtables, and their compositions, have their trade-offs. For instance, Hashtables-based representations allow for faster rendering but lack clear geometric meaning, making spatial-relation-aware editing challenging. To address this limitation and maximize the potential of each architecture, we propose Progressive Volume Distillation with Active Learning (PVD-AL), a systematic distillation method that enables any-to-any conversions between different architectures. PVD-AL decomposes each structure into two parts and progressively performs distillation from shallower to deeper volume representation, leveraging effective information retrieved from the rendering process. Additionally, a Three-Levels of active learning technique provides continuous feedback during the distillation process, resulting in high-performance results. Empirical evidence is presented to validate our method on multiple benchmark datasets. For example, PVD-AL can distill an MLP-based model from a Hashtables-based model at a 10~20X faster speed and 0.8dB~2dB higher PSNR than training the NeRF model from scratch. Moreover, PVD-AL permits the fusion of diverse features among distinct structures, enabling models with multiple editing properties and providing a more efficient model to meet real-time requirements.

- **Summary**: As deep learning advances, edge devices and lightweight neural networks are becoming more important. To reduce latency in the AI accelerator, it's essential to not only reduce FLOPs but also enhance hardware performance. We proposed an arithmetic intensity balancing convolution (ABConv) to address the issue of the overall intensity being limited by the small weight arithmetic intensity for convolution with a small spatial size. ABConv increased the maximum bound of overall arithmetic intensity and significantly reduced latency, without sacrificing accuracy. We tested the latency and hardware performance of ABConv on the Arm Ethos-U65 NPU in various configurations and used it to replace some of MobileNetV1 and ResNet50 in image classification for CIFAR100.

- **Summary**: Portrait retouching aims to improve the aesthetic quality of input portrait photos and especially requires human-region priority. The deep learning-based methods largely elevate the retouching efficiency and provide promising retouched results. However, existing portrait retouching methods focus on automatic retouching, which treats all human-regions equally and ignores users' preferences for specific individuals, thus suffering from limited flexibility in interactive scenarios. In this work, we emphasize the importance of users' intents and explore the interactive portrait retouching task. Specifically, we propose a region-aware retouching framework with two branches: an automatic branch and an interactive branch. The automatic branch involves an encoding-decoding process, which searches region candidates and performs automatic region-aware retouching without user guidance. The interactive branch encodes sparse user guidance into a priority condition vector and modulates latent features with a region selection module to further emphasize the user-specified regions. Experimental results show that our interactive branch effectively captures users' intents and generalizes well to unseen scenes with sparse user guidance, while our automatic branch also outperforms the state-of-the-art retouching methods due to improved region-awareness.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning, relying on effective positive and negative sample pairs, is beneficial to learn informative skeleton representations in unsupervised skeleton-based action recognition. To achieve these positive and negative pairs, existing weak/strong data augmentation methods have to randomly change the appearance of skeletons for indirectly pursuing semantic perturbations. However, such approaches have two limitations: 1) solely perturbing appearance cannot well capture the intrinsic semantic information of skeletons, and 2) randomly perturbation may change the original positive/negative pairs to soft positive/negative ones. To address the above dilemma, we start the first attempt to explore an attack-based augmentation scheme that additionally brings in direct semantic perturbation, for constructing hard positive pairs and further assisting in constructing hard negative pairs. In particular, we propose a novel Attack-Augmentation Mixing-Contrastive learning (A$^2$MC) to contrast hard positive features and hard negative features for learning more robust skeleton representations. In A$^2$MC, Attack-Augmentation (Att-Aug) is designed to collaboratively perform targeted and untargeted perturbations of skeletons via attack and augmentation respectively, for generating high-quality hard positive features. Meanwhile, Positive-Negative Mixer (PNM) is presented to mix hard positive features and negative features for generating hard negative features, which are adopted for updating the mixed memory banks. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that A$^2$MC is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Panoramic radiography (Panoramic X-ray, PX) is a widely used imaging modality for dental examination. However, PX only provides a flattened 2D image, lacking in a 3D view of the oral structure. In this paper, we propose a framework to estimate 3D oral structures from real-world PX. Our framework tackles full 3D reconstruction for varying subjects (patients) where each reconstruction is based only on a single panoramic image. We create an intermediate representation called simulated PX (SimPX) from 3D Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) data based on the Beer-Lambert law of X-ray rendering and rotational principles of PX imaging. SimPX aims at not only truthfully simulating PX, but also facilitates the reverting process back to 3D data. We propose a novel neural model based on ray tracing which exploits both global and local input features to convert SimPX to 3D output. At inference, a real PX image is translated to a SimPX-style image with semantic regularization, and the translated image is processed by generation module to produce high-quality outputs. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art in reconstruction tasks both quantitatively and qualitatively. Unlike prior methods, Our method does not require any prior information such as the shape of dental arches, nor the matched PX-CBCT dataset for training, which is difficult to obtain in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: We offer a study that connects robust discriminative classifiers trained with adversarial training (AT) with generative modeling in the form of Energy-based Models (EBM). We do so by decomposing the loss of a discriminative classifier and showing that the discriminative model is also aware of the input data density. Though a common assumption is that adversarial points leave the manifold of the input data, our study finds out that, surprisingly, untargeted adversarial points in the input space are very likely under the generative model hidden inside the discriminative classifier -- have low energy in the EBM. We present two evidence: untargeted attacks are even more likely than the natural data and their likelihood increases as the attack strength increases. This allows us to easily detect them and craft a novel attack called High-Energy PGD that fools the classifier yet has energy similar to the data set.

- **Summary**: Enable neural networks to capture 3D geometrical-aware features is essential in multi-view based vision tasks. Previous methods usually encode the 3D information of multi-view stereo into the 2D features. In contrast, we present a novel method, named POEM, that directly operates on the 3D POints Embedded in the Multi-view stereo for reconstructing hand mesh in it. Point is a natural form of 3D information and an ideal medium for fusing features across views, as it has different projections on different views. Our method is thus in light of a simple yet effective idea, that a complex 3D hand mesh can be represented by a set of 3D points that 1) are embedded in the multi-view stereo, 2) carry features from the multi-view images, and 3) encircle the hand. To leverage the power of points, we design two operations: point-based feature fusion and cross-set point attention mechanism. Evaluation on three challenging multi-view datasets shows that POEM outperforms the state-of-the-art in hand mesh reconstruction. Code and models are available for research at https://github.com/lixiny/POEM.

- **Summary**: In geospatial planning, it is often essential to represent objects in a vectorized format, as this format easily translates to downstream tasks such as web development, graphics, or design. While these problems are frequently addressed using semantic segmentation, which requires additional post-processing to vectorize objects in a non-trivial way, we present an Image-to-Sequence model that allows for direct shape inference and is ready for vector-based workflows out of the box. We demonstrate the model's performance in various ways, including perturbations to the image input that correspond to variations or artifacts commonly encountered in remote sensing applications. Our model outperforms prior works when using ground truth bounding boxes (one object per image), achieving the lowest maximum tangent angle error.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted much attention since it reduces the expensive costs of collecting adequate well-labeled training data, especially for deep learning methods. However, traditional SSL is built upon an assumption that labeled and unlabeled data should be from the same distribution e.g., classes and domains. However, in practical scenarios, unlabeled data would be from unseen classes or unseen domains, and it is still challenging to exploit them by existing SSL methods. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a unified framework to leverage these unseen unlabeled data for open-scenario semi-supervised medical image classification. We first design a novel scoring mechanism, called dual-path outliers estimation, to identify samples from unseen classes. Meanwhile, to extract unseen-domain samples, we then apply an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) pre-training. After that, we conduct domain adaptation to fully exploit the value of the detected unseen-domain samples to boost semi-supervised training. We evaluated our proposed framework on dermatology and ophthalmology tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model can achieve superior classification performance in various medical SSL scenarios.

We present an innovative method for regenerating flawed facial structures, yielding 3D printable outputs that effectively support physicians in their patient treatment process. Our results highlight the model's capacity for concealing scars and achieving comprehensive facial reconstructions without discernible scarring. By capitalizing on pre-trained models and necessitating only a few hours of supplementary training, our methodology adeptly devises an optimal model for reconstructing damaged and imperfect facial features. Harnessing contemporary 3D printing technology, we institute a standardized protocol for fabricating realistic, camouflaging mask models for patients in a laboratory environment.

- **Summary**: Identifying the type of kidney stones can allow urologists to determine their cause of formation, improving the prescription of appropriate treatments to diminish future relapses. Currently, the associated ex-vivo diagnosis (known as Morpho-constitutional Analysis, MCA) is time-consuming, expensive and requires a great deal of experience, as it requires a visual analysis component that is highly operator dependant. Recently, machine learning methods have been developed for in-vivo endoscopic stone recognition. Deep Learning (DL) based methods outperform non-DL methods in terms of accuracy but lack explainability. Despite this trade-off, when it comes to making high-stakes decisions, it's important to prioritize understandable Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) that suggests a course of action based on reasonable evidence, rather than a model prescribing a course of action. In this proposal, we learn Prototypical Parts (PPs) per kidney stone subtype, which are used by the DL model to generate an output classification. Using PPs in the classification task enables case-based reasoning explanations for such output, thus making the model interpretable. In addition, we modify global visual characteristics to describe their relevance to the PPs and the sensitivity of our model's performance. With this, we provide explanations with additional information at the sample, class and model levels in contrast to previous works. Although our implementation's average accuracy is lower than state-of-the-art (SOTA) non-interpretable DL models by 1.5 %, our models perform 2.8% better on perturbed images with a lower standard deviation, without adversarial training. Thus, Learning PPs has the potential to create more robust DL models.

- **Summary**: Acquiring and annotating sufficient labeled data is crucial in developing accurate and robust learning-based models, but obtaining such data can be challenging in many medical image segmentation tasks. One promising solution is to synthesize realistic data with ground-truth mask annotations. However, no prior studies have explored generating complete 3D volumetric images with masks. In this paper, we present MedGen3D, a deep generative framework that can generate paired 3D medical images and masks. First, we represent the 3D medical data as 2D sequences and propose the Multi-Condition Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MC-DPM) to generate multi-label mask sequences adhering to anatomical geometry. Then, we use an image sequence generator and semantic diffusion refiner conditioned on the generated mask sequences to produce realistic 3D medical images that align with the generated masks. Our proposed framework guarantees accurate alignment between synthetic images and segmentation maps. Experiments on 3D thoracic CT and brain MRI datasets show that our synthetic data is both diverse and faithful to the original data, and demonstrate the benefits for downstream segmentation tasks. We anticipate that MedGen3D's ability to synthesize paired 3D medical images and masks will prove valuable in training deep learning models for medical imaging tasks.

- **Summary**: This work presents a study on label noise in medical image segmentation by considering a noise model based on Gaussian field deformations. Such noise is of interest because it yields realistic looking segmentations and because it is unbiased in the sense that the expected deformation is the identity mapping. Efficient methods for sampling and closed form solutions for the marginal probabilities are provided. Moreover, theoretically optimal solutions to the loss functions cross-entropy and soft-Dice are studied and it is shown how they diverge as the level of noise increases. Based on recent work on loss function characterization, it is shown that optimal solutions to soft-Dice can be recovered by thresholding solutions to cross-entropy with a particular a priori unknown threshold that efficiently can be computed. This raises the question whether the decrease in performance seen when using cross-entropy as compared to soft-Dice is caused by using the wrong threshold. The hypothesis is validated in 5-fold studies on three organ segmentation problems from the TotalSegmentor data set, using 4 different strengths of noise. The results show that changing the threshold leads the performance of cross-entropy to go from systematically worse than soft-Dice to similar or better results than soft-Dice.

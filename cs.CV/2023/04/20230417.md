- **Summary**: Generative models have enabled the creation of contents that are indistinguishable from those taken from nature. Open-source development of such models raised concerns about the risks of their misuse for malicious purposes. One potential risk mitigation strategy is to attribute generative models via fingerprinting. Current fingerprinting methods exhibit a significant tradeoff between robust attribution accuracy and generation quality while lacking design principles to improve this tradeoff. This paper investigates the use of latent semantic dimensions as fingerprints, from where we can analyze the effects of design variables, including the choice of fingerprinting dimensions, strength, and capacity, on the accuracy-quality tradeoff. Compared with previous SOTA, our method requires minimum computation and is more applicable to large-scale models. We use StyleGAN2 and the latent diffusion model to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

- **Summary**: In video-based emotion recognition (ER), it is important to effectively leverage the complementary relationship among audio (A) and visual (V) modalities, while retaining the intra-modal characteristics of individual modalities. In this paper, a recursive joint attention model is proposed along with long short-term memory (LSTM) modules for the fusion of vocal and facial expressions in regression-based ER. Specifically, we investigated the possibility of exploiting the complementary nature of A and V modalities using a joint cross-attention model in a recursive fashion with LSTMs to capture the intra-modal temporal dependencies within the same modalities as well as among the A-V feature representations. By integrating LSTMs with recursive joint cross-attention, our model can efficiently leverage both intra- and inter-modal relationships for the fusion of A and V modalities. The results of extensive experiments performed on the challenging Affwild2 and Fatigue (private) datasets indicate that the proposed A-V fusion model can significantly outperform state-of-art-methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, omnidirectional images (ODIs) have become increasingly popular; however, their angular resolution tends to be lower than that of perspective images.This leads to degraded structural details such as edges, causing difficulty in learning 3D scene understanding tasks, especially monocular depth estimation. Existing methods typically leverage high-resolution (HR) ODI as the input, so as to recover the structural details via fully-supervised learning. However, the HR depth ground truth (GT) maps may be arduous or expensive to be collected due to resource-constrained devices in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we explore for the first time to estimate the HR omnidirectional depth directly from a low-resolution (LR) ODI, when no HR depth GT map is available. Our key idea is to transfer the scene structural knowledge from the readily available HR image modality and the corresponding LR depth maps to achieve the goal of HR depth estimation without extra inference cost. Specifically, we introduce ODI super-resolution (SR) as an auxiliary task and train both tasks collaboratively in a weakly supervised manner to boost the performance of HR depth estimation. The ODI SR task takes an LR ODI as the input to predict an HR image, enabling us to extract the scene structural knowledge via uncertainty estimation. Buttressed by this, a scene structural knowledge transfer (SSKT) module is proposed with two key components. First, we employ a cylindrical implicit interpolation function (CIIF) to learn cylindrical neural interpolation weights for feature up-sampling and share the parameters of CIIFs between the two tasks. Then, we propose a feature distillation (FD) loss that provides extra structural regularization to help the HR depth estimation task learn more scene structural knowledge.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a promptable segmentation model recently introduced by Meta AI that has demonstrated its prowess across various fields beyond just image segmentation. SAM can accurately segment images across diverse fields, and generating various masks. We discovered that this ability of SAM can be leveraged to pretrain models for specific fields. Accordingly, we have proposed a framework that utilizes SAM to generate pseudo labels for pretraining thermal infrared image segmentation tasks. Our proposed framework can effectively improve the accuracy of segmentation results of specific categories beyond the SOTA ImageNet pretrained model. Our framework presents a novel approach to collaborate with models trained with large data like SAM to address problems in special fields. Also, we generated a large scale thermal infrared segmentation dataset used for pretaining, which contains over 100,000 images with pixel-annotation labels. This approach offers an effective solution for working with large models in special fields where label annotation is challenging. Our code is available at https://github.com/chenjzBUAA/SATIR

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated impressive results in many computer vision tasks. However, the increasing size of these networks raises concerns about the information overload resulting from the large number of network parameters. In this paper, we propose Frequency Regularization to restrict the non-zero elements of the network parameters in the frequency domain. The proposed approach operates at the tensor level, and can be applied to almost all network architectures. Specifically, the tensors of parameters are maintained in the frequency domain, where high frequency components can be eliminated by zigzag setting tensor elements to zero. Then, the inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) is used to reconstruct the spatial tensors for matrix operations during network training. Since high frequency components of images are known to be less critical, a large proportion of these parameters can be set to zero when networks are trained with the proposed frequency regularization. Comprehensive evaluations on various state-of-the-art network architectures, including LeNet, Alexnet, VGG, Resnet, ViT, UNet, GAN, and VAE, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frequency regularization. For a very small accuracy decrease (less than 2\%), a LeNet5 with 0.4M parameters can be represented by only 776 float16 numbers (over 1100$\times$ reduction), and a UNet with 34M parameters can be represented by only 759 float16 numbers (over 80000$\times$ reduction). In particular, the original size of the UNet model is 366MB, we reduce it to 4.5kb.

- **Summary**: The task of weakly supervised temporal action localization targets at generating temporal boundaries for actions of interest, meanwhile the action category should also be classified. Pseudo-label-based methods, which serve as an effective solution, have been widely studied recently. However, existing methods generate pseudo labels during training and make predictions during testing under different pipelines or settings, resulting in a gap between training and testing. In this paper, we propose to generate high-quality pseudo labels from the predicted action boundaries. Nevertheless, we note that existing post-processing, like NMS, would lead to information loss, which is insufficient to generate high-quality action boundaries. More importantly, transforming action boundaries into pseudo labels is quite challenging, since the predicted action instances are generally overlapped and have different confidence scores. Besides, the generated pseudo-labels can be fluctuating and inaccurate at the early stage of training. It might repeatedly strengthen the false predictions if there is no mechanism to conduct self-correction. To tackle these issues, we come up with an effective pipeline for learning better pseudo labels. Firstly, we propose a Gaussian weighted fusion module to preserve information of action instances and obtain high-quality action boundaries. Second, we formulate the pseudo-label generation as an optimization problem under the constraints in terms of the confidence scores of action instances. Finally, we introduce the idea of $\Delta$ pseudo labels, which enables the model with the ability of self-correction. Our method achieves superior performance to existing methods on two benchmarks, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3, achieving gains of 1.9\% on THUMOS14 and 3.7\% on ActivityNet1.3 in terms of average mAP.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a novel visual re-localization method based on direct matching between the implicit 3D descriptors and the 2D image with transformer. A conditional neural radiance field(NeRF) is chosen as the 3D scene representation in our pipeline, which supports continuous 3D descriptors generation and neural rendering. By unifying the feature matching and the scene coordinate regression to the same framework, our model learns both generalizable knowledge and scene prior respectively during two training stages. Furthermore, to improve the localization robustness when domain gap exists between training and testing phases, we propose an appearance adaptation layer to explicitly align styles between the 3D model and the query image. Experiments show that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than other learning-based approaches on multiple benchmarks.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of microscopic cell images using deep learning is an important technique, however, it requires a large number of images and ground truth labels for training. To address the above problem, we consider an efficient learning framework with as little data as possible, and we propose two types of learning strategies: One-shot segmentation which can learn with only one training sample, and Partially-supervised segmentation which assigns annotations to only a part of images. Furthermore, we introduce novel segmentation methods using the small prompt images inspired by prompt learning in recent studies. Our proposed methods use a pre-trained model based on only cell images and teach the information of the prompt pairs to the target image to be segmented by the attention mechanism, which allows for efficient learning while reducing the burden of annotation costs. Through experiments conducted on three types of microscopic cell image datasets, we confirmed that the proposed method improved the Dice score coefficient (DSC) in comparison with the conventional methods.

- **Summary**: The recent advances of AI technology, particularly in AI-Generated Content (AIGC), have enabled everyone to easily generate beautiful paintings with simple text description. With the stunning quality of AI paintings, it is widely questioned whether there still exists difference between human and AI paintings and whether human artists will be replaced by AI. To answer these questions, we develop a computational framework combining neural latent space and aesthetics features with visual analytics to investigate the difference between human and AI paintings. First, with categorical comparison of human and AI painting collections, we find that AI artworks show distributional difference from human artworks in both latent space and some aesthetic features like strokes and sharpness, while in other aesthetic features like color and composition there is less difference. Second, with individual artist analysis of Picasso, we show human artists' strength in evolving new styles compared to AI. Our findings provide concrete evidence for the existing discrepancies between human and AI paintings and further suggest improvements of AI art with more consideration of aesthetics and human artists' involvement.

- **Summary**: Lung nodule malignancy prediction has been enhanced by advanced deep-learning techniques and effective tricks. Nevertheless, current methods are mainly trained with cross-entropy loss using one-hot categorical labels, which results in difficulty in distinguishing those nodules with closer progression labels. Interestingly, we observe that clinical text information annotated by radiologists provides us with discriminative knowledge to identify challenging samples. Drawing on the capability of the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model to learn generalized visual representations from text annotations, in this paper, we propose CLIP-Lung, a textual knowledge-guided framework for lung nodule malignancy prediction. First, CLIP-Lung introduces both class and attribute annotations into the training of the lung nodule classifier without any additional overheads in inference. Second, we designed a channel-wise conditional prompt (CCP) module to establish consistent relationships between learnable context prompts and specific feature maps. Third, we align image features with both class and attribute features via contrastive learning, rectifying false positives and false negatives in latent space. The experimental results on the benchmark LIDC-IDRI dataset have demonstrated the superiority of CLIP-Lung, both in classification performance and interpretability of attention maps.



### Self-Supervised Learning from Non-Object Centric Images with a Geometric Transformation Sensitive Architecture

- **Summary**: Most invariance-based self-supervised methods rely on single object-centric images (e.g., ImageNet images) for pretraining, learning features that invariant to geometric transformation. However, when images are not object-centric, the semantics of the image can be significantly altered due to cropping. Furthermore, as the model becomes insensitive to geometric transformations, it may struggle to capture location information. For this reason, we propose a Geometric Transformation Sensitive Architecture designed to be sensitive to geometric transformations, specifically focusing on four-fold rotation, random crop, and multi-crop. Our method encourages the student to be sensitive by predicting rotation and using targets that vary with those transformations through pooling and rotating the teacher feature map. Additionally, we use patch correspondence loss to encourage correspondence between patches with similar features. This approach allows us to capture long-term dependencies in a more appropriate way than capturing long-term dependencies by encouraging local-to-global correspondence, which occurs when learning to be insensitive to multi-crop. Our approach demonstrates improved performance when using non-object-centric images as pretraining data compared to other methods that train the model to be insensitive to geometric transformation. We surpass DINO[Caron et al.[2021b]] baseline in tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, detection, and instance segmentation with improvements of 4.9 $Top-1 Acc$, 3.3 $mIoU$, 3.4 $AP^b$, and 2.7 $AP^m$.

- **Summary**: The label-free model evaluation aims to predict the model performance on various test sets without relying on ground truths. The main challenge of this task is the absence of labels in the test data, unlike in classical supervised model evaluation. This paper presents our solutions for the 1st DataCV Challenge of the Visual Dataset Understanding workshop at CVPR 2023. Firstly, we propose a novel method called K-means Clustering Based Feature Consistency Alignment (KCFCA), which is tailored to handle the distribution shifts of various datasets. KCFCA utilizes the K-means algorithm to cluster labeled training sets and unlabeled test sets, and then aligns the cluster centers with feature consistency. Secondly, we develop a dynamic regression model to capture the relationship between the shifts in distribution and model accuracy. Thirdly, we design an algorithm to discover the outlier model factors, eliminate the outlier models, and combine the strengths of multiple autoeval models. On the DataCV Challenge leaderboard, our approach secured 2nd place with an RMSE of 6.8526. Our method significantly improved over the best baseline method by 36\% (6.8526 vs. 10.7378). Furthermore, our method achieves a relatively more robust and optimal single model performance on the validation dataset.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Surgical scene understanding plays a critical role in the technology stack of tomorrow's intervention-assisting systems in endoscopic surgeries. For this, tracking the endoscope pose is a key component, but remains challenging due to illumination conditions, deforming tissues and the breathing motion of organs. Method: We propose a solution for stereo endoscopes that estimates depth and optical flow to minimize two geometric losses for camera pose estimation. Most importantly, we introduce two learned adaptive per-pixel weight mappings that balance contributions according to the input image content. To do so, we train a Deep Declarative Network to take advantage of the expressiveness of deep-learning and the robustness of a novel geometric-based optimization approach. We validate our approach on the publicly available SCARED dataset and introduce a new in-vivo dataset, StereoMIS, which includes a wider spectrum of typically observed surgical settings. Results: Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average and more importantly, in difficult scenarios where tissue deformations and breathing motion are visible. We observed that our proposed weight mappings attenuate the contribution of pixels on ambiguous regions of the images, such as deforming tissues. Conclusion: We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution to robustly estimate the camera pose in challenging endoscopic surgical scenes. Our contributions can be used to improve related tasks like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or 3D reconstruction, therefore advancing surgical scene understanding in minimally-invasive surgery.

- **Summary**: We study learning object segmentation from unlabeled videos. Humans can easily segment moving objects without knowing what they are. The Gestalt law of common fate, i.e., what move at the same speed belong together, has inspired unsupervised object discovery based on motion segmentation. However, common fate is not a reliable indicator of objectness: Parts of an articulated / deformable object may not move at the same speed, whereas shadows / reflections of an object always move with it but are not part of it.   Our insight is to bootstrap objectness by first learning image features from relaxed common fate and then refining them based on visual appearance grouping within the image itself and across images statistically. Specifically, we learn an image segmenter first in the loop of approximating optical flow with constant segment flow plus small within-segment residual flow, and then by refining it for more coherent appearance and statistical figure-ground relevance.   On unsupervised video object segmentation, using only ResNet and convolutional heads, our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by absolute gains of 7/9/5% on DAVIS16 / STv2 / FBMS59 respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our ideas. Our code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the intelligence of various parts of the home has become one of the essential features of any modern home. One of these parts is the intelligence lighting system that personalizes the light for each person. This paper proposes an intelligent system based on machine learning that personalizes lighting in the instant future location of a recognized user, inferred by trajectory prediction. Our proposed system consists of the following modules: (I) human detection to detect and localize the person in each given video frame, (II) face recognition to identify the detected person, (III) human tracking to track the person in the sequence of video frames and (IV) trajectory prediction to forecast the future location of the user in the environment using Inverse Reinforcement Learning. The proposed method provides a unique profile for each person, including specifications, face images, and custom lighting settings. This profile is used in the lighting adjustment process. Unlike other methods that consider constant lighting for every person, our system can apply each 'person's desired lighting in terms of color and light intensity without direct user intervention. Therefore, the lighting is adjusted with higher speed and better efficiency. In addition, the predicted trajectory path makes the proposed system apply the desired lighting, creating more pleasant and comfortable conditions for the home residents. In the experimental results, the system applied the desired lighting in an average time of 1.4 seconds from the moment of entry, as well as a performance of 22.1mAp in human detection, 95.12% accuracy in face recognition, 93.3% MDP in human tracking, and 10.80 MinADE20, 18.55 MinFDE20, 15.8 MinADE5 and 30.50 MinFDE5 in trajectory prediction.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning has shown great potentials in numerous scenes and attracts increasing interest recently. However, it often encounters the problem of missing modality data and thus suffers severe performance degradation in practice. To this end, we propose a general framework called MMANet to assist incomplete multimodal learning. It consists of three components: the deployment network used for inference, the teacher network transferring comprehensive multimodal information to the deployment network, and the regularization network guiding the deployment network to balance weak modality combinations. Specifically, we propose a novel margin-aware distillation (MAD) to assist the information transfer by weighing the sample contribution with the classification uncertainty. This encourages the deployment network to focus on the samples near decision boundaries and acquire the refined inter-class margin. Besides, we design a modality-aware regularization (MAR) algorithm to mine the weak modality combinations and guide the regularization network to calculate prediction loss for them. This forces the deployment network to improve its representation ability for the weak modality combinations adaptively. Finally, extensive experiments on multimodal classification and segmentation tasks demonstrate that our MMANet outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly.

- **Summary**: We present three multi-scale similarity learning architectures, or DeepSim networks. These models learn pixel-level matching with a contrastive loss and are agnostic to the geometry of the considered scene. We establish a middle ground between hybrid and end-to-end approaches by learning to densely allocate all corresponding pixels of an epipolar pair at once. Our features are learnt on large image tiles to be expressive and capture the scene's wider context. We also demonstrate that curated sample mining can enhance the overall robustness of the predicted similarities and improve the performance on radiometrically homogeneous areas. We run experiments on aerial and satellite datasets. Our DeepSim-Nets outperform the baseline hybrid approaches and generalize better to unseen scene geometries than end-to-end methods. Our flexible architecture can be readily adopted in standard multi-resolution image matching pipelines.

- **Summary**: Recently, end-to-end transformer-based detectors~(DETRs) have achieved remarkable performance. However, the issue of the high computational cost of DETRs has not been effectively addressed, limiting their practical application and preventing them from fully exploiting the benefits of no post-processing, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). In this paper, we first analyze the influence of NMS in modern real-time object detectors on inference speed, and establish an end-to-end speed benchmark. To avoid the inference delay caused by NMS, we propose a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge. Specifically, we design an efficient hybrid encoder to efficiently process multi-scale features by decoupling the intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion, and propose IoU-aware query selection to improve the initialization of object queries. In addition, our proposed detector supports flexibly adjustment of the inference speed by using different decoder layers without the need for retraining, which facilitates the practical application of real-time object detectors. Our RT-DETR-L achieves 53.0% AP on COCO val2017 and 114 FPS on T4 GPU, while RT-DETR-X achieves 54.8% AP and 74 FPS, outperforming all YOLO detectors of the same scale in both speed and accuracy. Furthermore, our RT-DETR-R50 achieves 53.1% AP and 108 FPS, outperforming DINO-Deformable-DETR-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and by about 21 times in FPS. ource code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR.

- **Summary**: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal different patterns of human tissue and is crucial for clinical diagnosis. However, limited by cost, noise and manual labeling, obtaining diverse and reliable multimodal MR images remains a challenge. For the same lesion, different MRI manifestations have great differences in background information, coarse positioning and fine structure. In order to obtain better generation and segmentation performance, a coordination-spatial attention generation adversarial network (CASP-GAN) based on the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is proposed. The performance of the generator is optimized by introducing the Coordinate Attention (CA) module and the Spatial Attention (SA) module. The two modules can make full use of the captured location information, accurately locating the interested region, and enhancing the generator model network structure. The ability to extract the structure information and the detailed information of the original medical image can help generate the desired image with higher quality. There exist some problems in the original CycleGAN that the training time is long, the parameter amount is too large, and it is difficult to converge. In response to this problem, we introduce the Coordinate Attention (CA) module to replace the Res Block to reduce the number of parameters, and cooperate with the spatial information extraction network above to strengthen the information extraction ability. On the basis of CASP-GAN, an attentional generative cross-modality segmentation (AGCMS) method is further proposed. This method inputs the modalities generated by CASP-GAN and the real modalities into the segmentation network for brain tumor segmentation. Experimental results show that CASP-GAN outperforms CycleGAN and some state-of-the-art methods in PSNR, SSMI and RMSE in most tasks.

- **Summary**: Detecting maliciously falsified facial images and videos has attracted extensive attention from digital-forensics and computer-vision communities. An important topic in manipulation detection is the localization of the fake regions. Previous work related to forgery detection mostly focuses on the entire faces. However, recent forgery methods have developed to edit important facial components while maintaining others unchanged. This drives us to not only focus on the forgery detection but also fine-grained falsified region segmentation. In this paper, we propose a collaborative feature learning approach to simultaneously detect manipulation and segment the falsified components. With the collaborative manner, detection and segmentation can boost each other efficiently. To enable our study of forgery detection and segmentation, we build a facial forgery dataset consisting of both entire and partial face forgeries with their pixel-level manipulation ground-truth. Experiment results have justified the mutual promotion between forgery detection and manipulated region segmentation. The overall performance of the proposed approach is better than the state-of-the-art detection or segmentation approaches. The visualization results have shown that our proposed model always captures the artifacts on facial regions, which is more reasonable.

- **Summary**: Existing visual question reasoning methods usually fail to explicitly discover the inherent causal mechanism and ignore the complex event-level understanding that requires jointly modeling cross-modal event temporality and causality. In this paper, we propose an event-level visual question reasoning framework named Cross-Modal Question Reasoning (CMQR), to explicitly discover temporal causal structure and mitigate visual spurious correlation by causal intervention. To explicitly discover visual causal structure, the Visual Causality Discovery (VCD) architecture is proposed to find question-critical scene temporally and disentangle the visual spurious correlations by attention-based front-door causal intervention module named Local-Global Causal Attention Module (LGCAM). To align the fine-grained interactions between linguistic semantics and spatial-temporal representations, we build an Interactive Visual-Linguistic Transformer (IVLT) that builds the multi-modal co-occurrence interactions between visual and linguistic content. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMQR for discovering visual causal structures and achieving robust question reasoning.

- **Summary**: Suggesting complementary clothing items to compose an outfit is a process of emerging interest, yet it involves a fine understanding of fashion trends and visual aesthetics. Previous works have mainly focused on recommendation by scoring visual appeal and representing garments as ordered sequences or as collections of pairwise-compatible items. This limits the full usage of relations among clothes. We attempt to bridge the gap between outfit recommendation and generation by leveraging a graph-based representation of items in a collection. The work carried out in this paper, tries to build a bridge between outfit recommendation and generation, by discovering new appealing outfits starting from a collection of pre-existing ones. We propose a transformer-based architecture, named TGNN, which exploits multi-headed self attention to capture relations between clothing items in a graph as a message passing step in Convolutional Graph Neural Networks. Specifically, starting from a seed, i.e.~one or more garments, outfit generation is performed by iteratively choosing the garment that is most compatible with the previously chosen ones. Extensive experimentations are conducted with two different datasets, demonstrating the capability of the model to perform seeded outfit generation as well as obtaining state of the art results on compatibility estimation tasks.

- **Summary**: Lack of texture often causes ambiguity in matching, and handling this issue is an important challenge in optical flow estimation. Some methods insert stacked transformer modules that allow the network to use global information of cost volume for estimation. But the global information aggregation often incurs serious memory and time costs during training and inference, which hinders model deployment. We draw inspiration from the traditional local region constraint and design the local similarity aggregation (LSA) and the shifted local similarity aggregation (SLSA). The aggregation for cost volume is implemented with lightweight modules that act on the feature maps. Experiments on the final pass of Sintel show the lower cost required for our approach while maintaining competitive performance.

- **Summary**: With nearly one million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020, head \& neck cancer is a deadly and common malignity. There are challenges to decision making and treatment of such cancer, due to lesions in multiple locations and outcome variability between patients. Therefore, automated segmentation and prognosis estimation approaches can help ensure each patient gets the most effective treatment. This paper presents a framework to perform these functions on arbitrary field of view (FoV) PET and CT registered scans, thus approaching tasks 1 and 2 of the HECKTOR 2022 challenge as team \texttt{VokCow}. The method consists of three stages: localization, segmentation and survival prediction. First, the scans with arbitrary FoV are cropped to the head and neck region and a u-shaped convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to segment the region of interest. Then, using the obtained regions, another CNN is combined with a support vector machine classifier to obtain the semantic segmentation of the tumours, which results in an aggregated Dice score of 0.57 in task 1. Finally, survival prediction is approached with an ensemble of Weibull accelerated failure times model and deep learning methods. In addition to patient health record data, we explore whether processing graphs of image patches centred at the tumours via graph convolutions can improve the prognostic predictions. A concordance index of 0.64 was achieved in the test set, ranking 6th in the challenge leaderboard for this task.

- **Summary**: Clothing segmentation and fine-grained attribute recognition are challenging tasks at the crossing of computer vision and fashion, which segment the entire ensemble clothing instances as well as recognize detailed attributes of the clothing products from any input human images. Many new models have been developed for the tasks in recent years, nevertheless the segmentation accuracy is less than satisfactory in case of layered clothing or fashion products in different scales. In this paper, a new DEtection TRansformer (DETR) based method is proposed to segment and recognize fine-grained attributes of ensemble clothing instances with high accuracy. In this model, we propose a \textbf{multi-layered attention module} by aggregating features of different scales, determining the various scale components of a single instance, and merging them together. We train our model on the Fashionpedia dataset and demonstrate our method surpasses SOTA models in tasks of layered clothing segmentation and fine-grained attribute recognition.

- **Summary**: Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are essential components of electronic devices, and ensuring their quality is crucial in their production. However, the vast variety of components and PCBs manufactured by different companies makes it challenging to adapt to production lines with speed demands. To address this challenge, we present a multi-view object detection framework that offers a fast and precise solution. We introduce a novel multi-view dataset with semi-automatic ground-truth data, which results in significant labeling resource savings. Labeling PCB boards for object detection is a challenging task due to the high density of components and the small size of the objects, which makes it difficult to identify and label them accurately. By training an object detector model with multi-view data, we achieve improved performance over single-view images. To further enhance the accuracy, we develop a multi-view inference method that aggregates results from different viewpoints. Our experiments demonstrate a 15% improvement in mAP for detecting components that range in size from 0.5 to 27.0 mm.

- **Summary**: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, which localizes and infers relationships between human and objects, plays an important role in scene understanding. Although two-stage HOI detectors have advantages of high efficiency in training and inference, they suffer from lower performance than one-stage methods due to the old backbone networks and the lack of considerations for the HOI perception process of humans in the interaction classifiers. In this paper, we propose Vision Transformer based Pose-Conditioned Self-Loop Graph (ViPLO) to resolve these problems. First, we propose a novel feature extraction method suitable for the Vision Transformer backbone, called masking with overlapped area (MOA) module. The MOA module utilizes the overlapped area between each patch and the given region in the attention function, which addresses the quantization problem when using the Vision Transformer backbone. In addition, we design a graph with a pose-conditioned self-loop structure, which updates the human node encoding with local features of human joints. This allows the classifier to focus on specific human joints to effectively identify the type of interaction, which is motivated by the human perception process for HOI. As a result, ViPLO achieves the state-of-the-art results on two public benchmarks, especially obtaining a +2.07 mAP performance gain on the HICO-DET dataset.

- **Summary**: Large deep learning models are impressive, but they struggle when real-time data is not available. Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) poses a significant challenge for deep neural networks to learn new tasks from just a few labeled samples without forgetting the previously learned ones. This setup easily leads to catastrophic forgetting and overfitting problems, severely affecting model performance. Studying FSCIL helps overcome deep learning model limitations on data volume and acquisition time, while improving practicality and adaptability of machine learning models. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on FSCIL. Unlike previous surveys, we aim to synthesize few-shot learning and incremental learning, focusing on introducing FSCIL from two perspectives, while reviewing over 30 theoretical research studies and more than 20 applied research studies. From the theoretical perspective, we provide a novel categorization approach that divides the field into five subcategories, including traditional machine learning methods, meta-learning based methods, feature and feature space-based methods, replay-based methods, and dynamic network structure-based methods. We also evaluate the performance of recent theoretical research on benchmark datasets of FSCIL. From the application perspective, FSCIL has achieved impressive achievements in various fields of computer vision such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, as well as in natural language processing and graph. We summarize the important applications. Finally, we point out potential future research directions, including applications, problem setups, and theory development. Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the latest advances in FSCIL from a methodological, performance, and application perspective.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, face recognition systems surpass human performance on several datasets. However, there are still edge cases that the machine can't correctly classify. This paper investigates the effect of a combination of machine and human operators in the face verification task. First, we look closer at the edge cases for several state-of-the-art models to discover common datasets' challenging settings. Then, we conduct a study with 60 participants on these selected tasks with humans and provide an extensive analysis. Finally, we demonstrate that combining machine and human decisions can further improve the performance of state-of-the-art face verification systems on various benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation (HPE) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for indoor monitoring is one of the major challenges in computer vision. In contrast to HPE in perspective views, an indoor monitoring system can consist of an omnidirectional camera with a field of view of 180{\deg} to detect the pose of a person with only one sensor per room. To recognize human pose, the detection of keypoints is an essential upstream step. In our work we propose a new dataset for training and evaluation of CNNs for the task of keypoint detection in omnidirectional images. The training dataset, THEODORE+, consists of 50,000 images and is created by a 3D rendering engine, where humans are randomly walking through an indoor environment. In a dynamically created 3D scene, persons move randomly with simultaneously moving omnidirectional camera to generate synthetic RGB images and 2D and 3D ground truth. For evaluation purposes, the real-world PoseFES dataset with two scenarios and 701 frames with up to eight persons per scene was captured and annotated. We propose four training paradigms to finetune or re-train two top-down models in MMPose and two bottom-up models in CenterNet on THEODORE+. Beside a qualitative evaluation we report quantitative results. Compared to a COCO pretrained baseline, we achieve significant improvements especially for top-view scenes on the PoseFES dataset.

- **Summary**: A large field-of-view fisheye camera allows for capturing a large area with minimal numbers of cameras when they are mounted on a high position facing downwards. This top-view omnidirectional setup greatly reduces the work and cost for deployment compared to traditional solutions with multiple perspective cameras. In recent years, deep learning has been widely employed for vision related tasks, including for such omnidirectional settings. In this survey, we look at the application of deep learning in combination with omnidirectional top-view cameras, including the available datasets, human and object detection, human pose estimation, activity recognition and other miscellaneous applications.

- **Summary**: Understanding geometric concepts, such as distance and shape, is essential for understanding the real world and also for many vision tasks. To incorporate such information into a visual representation of a scene, we propose learning to represent the scene by sketching, inspired by human behavior. Our method, coined Learning by Sketching (LBS), learns to convert an image into a set of colored strokes that explicitly incorporate the geometric information of the scene in a single inference step without requiring a sketch dataset. A sketch is then generated from the strokes where CLIP-based perceptual loss maintains a semantic similarity between the sketch and the image. We show theoretically that sketching is equivariant with respect to arbitrary affine transformations and thus provably preserves geometric information. Experimental results show that LBS substantially improves the performance of object attribute classification on the unlabeled CLEVR dataset, domain transfer between CLEVR and STL-10 datasets, and for diverse downstream tasks, confirming that LBS provides rich geometric information.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of collaborative robots (cobots), human-robot collaboration in industrial manufacturing is coming into focus. For a cobot to act autonomously and as an assistant, it must understand human actions during assembly. To effectively train models for this task, a dataset containing suitable assembly actions in a realistic setting is crucial. For this purpose, we present the ATTACH dataset, which contains 51.6 hours of assembly with 95.2k annotated fine-grained actions monitored by three cameras, which represent potential viewpoints of a cobot. Since in an assembly context workers tend to perform different actions simultaneously with their two hands, we annotated the performed actions for each hand separately. Therefore, in the ATTACH dataset, more than 68% of annotations overlap with other annotations, which is many times more than in related datasets, typically featuring more simplistic assembly tasks. For better generalization with respect to the background of the working area, we did not only record color and depth images, but also used the Azure Kinect body tracking SDK for estimating 3D skeletons of the worker. To create a first baseline, we report the performance of state-of-the-art methods for action recognition as well as action detection on video and skeleton-sequence inputs. The dataset is available at https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/neurob/data-sets-code/attach-dataset .

- **Summary**: Unified panoptic segmentation methods are achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets. To achieve these results on high-resolution datasets, these methods apply crop-based training. In this work, we find that, although crop-based training is advantageous in general, it also has a harmful side-effect. Specifically, it limits the ability of unified networks to discriminate between large object instances, causing them to make predictions that are confused between multiple instances. To solve this, we propose Intra-Batch Supervision (IBS), which improves a network's ability to discriminate between instances by introducing additional supervision using multiple images from the same batch. We show that, with our IBS, we successfully address the confusion problem and consistently improve the performance of unified networks. For the high-resolution Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas datasets, we achieve improvements of up to +2.5 on the Panoptic Quality for thing classes, and even more considerable gains of up to +5.8 on both the pixel accuracy and pixel precision, which we identify as better metrics to capture the confusion problem.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a growing trend of using data-driven methods in industrial settings. These kinds of methods often process video images or parts, therefore the integrity of such images is crucial. Sometimes datasets, e.g. consisting of images, can be sophisticated for various reasons. It becomes critical to understand how the manipulation of video and images can impact the effectiveness of a machine learning method. Our case study aims precisely to analyze the Linemod dataset, considered the state of the art in 6D pose estimation context. That dataset presents images accompanied by ArUco markers; it is evident that such markers will not be available in real-world contexts. We analyze how the presence of the markers affects the pose estimation accuracy, and how this bias may be mitigated through data augmentation and other methods. Our work aims to show how the presence of these markers goes to modify, in the testing phase, the effectiveness of the deep learning method used. In particular, we will demonstrate, through the tool of saliency maps, how the focus of the neural network is captured in part by these ArUco markers. Finally, a new dataset, obtained by applying geometric tools to Linemod, will be proposed in order to demonstrate our hypothesis and uncovering the bias. Our results demonstrate the potential for bias in 6DOF pose estimation networks, and suggest methods for reducing this bias when training with markers.

- **Summary**: Effective oil spill segmentation in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is critical for marine oil pollution cleanup, and proper image representation is helpful for accurate image segmentation. In this paper, we propose an effective oil spill image segmentation network named SRCNet by leveraging SAR image representation and the training for oil spill segmentation simultaneously. Specifically, our proposed segmentation network is constructed with a pair of deep neural nets with the collaboration of the seminal representation that describes SAR images, where one deep neural net is the generative net which strives to produce oil spill segmentation maps, and the other is the discriminative net which trys its best to distinguish between the produced and the true segmentations, and they thus built a two-player game. Particularly, the seminal representation exploited in our proposed SRCNet originates from SAR imagery, modelling with the internal characteristics of SAR images. Thus, in the training process, the collaborated seminal representation empowers the mapped generative net to produce accurate oil spill segmentation maps efficiently with small amount of training data, promoting the discriminative net reaching its optimal solution at a fast speed. Therefore, our proposed SRCNet operates effective oil spill segmentation in an economical and efficient manner. Additionally, to increase the segmentation capability of the proposed segmentation network in terms of accurately delineating oil spill details in SAR images, a regularisation term that penalises the segmentation loss is devised. This encourages our proposed SRCNet for accurately segmenting oil spill areas from SAR images. Empirical experimental evaluations from different metrics validate the effectiveness of our proposed SRCNet for oil spill image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Machine-learning methods rely on sufficiently large dataset to learn data distributions. They are widely used in research in X-Ray Computed Tomography, from low-dose scan denoising to optimisation of the reconstruction process. The lack of datasets prevents the scalability of these methods to realistic 3D problems. We develop a 3D procedural dataset in order to produce samples for data-driven algorithms. It is made of a meshed model of a left hand and a script to randomly change its anatomic properties and pose whilst conserving realistic features. This open-source solution relies on the freeware Blender and its Python core. Blender handles the modelling, the mesh and the generation of the hand's pose, whilst Python processes file format conversion from obj file to matrix and functions to scale and center the volume for further processing. Dataset availability and quality drives research in machine-learning. We design a dataset that weighs few megabytes, provides truthful samples and proposes continuous enhancements using version control. We anticipate this work to be a starting point for anatomically accurate procedural datasets. For instance, by adding more internal features and fine tuning their X-Ray attenuation properties.

- **Summary**: While remarkable success has been achieved in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL), current frameworks are not capable of locating objects of novel categories in open-world settings. To address this issue, we are the first to introduce a new weakly-supervised object localization task called OWSOL (Open-World Weakly-Supervised Object Localization). During training, all labeled data comes from known categories and, both known and novel categories exist in the unlabeled data. To handle such data, we propose a novel paradigm of contrastive representation co-learning using both labeled and unlabeled data to generate a complete G-CAM (Generalized Class Activation Map) for object localization, without the requirement of bounding box annotation. As no class label is available for the unlabelled data, we conduct clustering over the full training set and design a novel multiple semantic centroids-driven contrastive loss for representation learning. We re-organize two widely used datasets, i.e., ImageNet-1K and iNatLoc500, and propose OpenImages150 to serve as evaluation benchmarks for OWSOL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can surpass all baselines by a large margin. We believe that this work can shift the close-set localization towards the open-world setting and serve as a foundation for subsequent works. Code will be released at https://github.com/ryylcc/OWSOL.

- **Summary**: Forecasting players in sports has grown in popularity due to the potential for a tactical advantage and the applicability of such research to multi-agent interaction systems. Team sports contain a significant social component that influences interactions between teammates and opponents. However, it still needs to be fully exploited. In this work, we hypothesize that each participant has a specific function in each action and that role-based interaction is critical for predicting players' future moves. We create RolFor, a novel end-to-end model for Role-based Forecasting. RolFor uses a new module we developed called Ordering Neural Networks (OrderNN) to permute the order of the players such that each player is assigned to a latent role. The latent role is then modeled with a RoleGCN. Thanks to its graph representation, it provides a fully learnable adjacency matrix that captures the relationships between roles and is subsequently used to forecast the players' future trajectories. Extensive experiments on a challenging NBA basketball dataset back up the importance of roles and justify our goal of modeling them using optimizable models. When an oracle provides roles, the proposed RolFor compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art (it ranks first in terms of ADE and second in terms of FDE errors). However, training the end-to-end RolFor incurs the issues of differentiability of permutation methods, which we experimentally review. Finally, this work restates differentiable ranking as a difficult open problem and its great potential in conjunction with graph-based interaction models.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the challenges of modeling deformable 3D objects from casual videos. With the popularity of neural radiance fields (NeRF), many works extend it to dynamic scenes with a canonical NeRF and a deformation model that achieves 3D point transformation between the observation space and the canonical space. Recent works rely on linear blend skinning (LBS) to achieve the canonical-observation transformation. However, the linearly weighted combination of rigid transformation matrices is not guaranteed to be rigid. As a matter of fact, unexpected scale and shear factors often appear. In practice, using LBS as the deformation model can always lead to skin-collapsing artifacts for bending or twisting motions. To solve this problem, we propose neural dual quaternion blend skinning (NeuDBS) to achieve 3D point deformation, which can perform rigid transformation without skin-collapsing artifacts. In the endeavor to register 2D pixels across different frames, we establish a correspondence between canonical feature embeddings that encodes 3D points within the canonical space, and 2D image features by solving an optimal transport problem. Besides, we introduce a texture filtering approach for texture rendering that effectively minimizes the impact of noisy colors outside target deformable objects. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that our approach can reconstruct 3D models for humans and animals with better qualitative and quantitative performance than state-of-the-art methods.



### Deep-Learning-based Vasculature Extraction for Single-Scan Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography

- **Summary**: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that extends the functionality of OCT by extracting moving red blood cell signals from surrounding static biological tissues. OCTA has emerged as a valuable tool for analyzing skin microvasculature, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Most existing OCTA extraction algorithms, such as speckle variance (SV)- and eigen-decomposition (ED)-OCTA, implement a larger number of repeated (NR) OCT scans at the same position to produce high-quality angiography images. However, a higher NR requires a longer data acquisition time, leading to more unpredictable motion artifacts. In this study, we propose a vasculature extraction pipeline that uses only one-repeated OCT scan to generate OCTA images. The pipeline is based on the proposed Vasculature Extraction Transformer (VET), which leverages convolutional projection to better learn the spatial relationships between image patches. In comparison to OCTA images obtained via the SV-OCTA (PSNR: 17.809) and ED-OCTA (PSNR: 18.049) using four-repeated OCT scans, OCTA images extracted by VET exhibit moderate quality (PSNR: 17.515) and higher image contrast while reducing the required data acquisition time from ~8 s to ~2 s. Based on visual observations, the proposed VET outperforms SV and ED algorithms when using neck and face OCTA data in areas that are challenging to scan. This study represents that the VET has the capacity to extract vascularture images from a fast one-repeated OCT scan, facilitating accurate diagnosis for patients.

- **Summary**: Auto-evaluation aims to automatically evaluate a trained model on any test dataset without human annotations. Most existing methods utilize global statistics of features extracted by the model as the representation of a dataset. This ignores the influence of the classification head and loses category-wise confusion information of the model. However, ratios of instances assigned to different categories together with their confidence scores reflect how many instances in which categories are difficult for the model to classify, which contain significant indicators for both overall and category-wise performances. In this paper, we propose a Confidence-based Category Relation-aware Regression ($C^2R^2$) method. $C^2R^2$ divides all instances in a meta-set into different categories according to their confidence scores and extracts the global representation from them. For each category, $C^2R^2$ encodes its local confusion relations to other categories into a local representation. The overall and category-wise performances are regressed from global and local representations, respectively. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: This work aims to improve the applicability of diffusion models in realistic image restoration. Specifically, we enhance the diffusion model in several aspects such as network architecture, noise level, denoising steps, training image size, and optimizer/scheduler. We show that tuning these hyperparameters allows us to achieve better performance on both distortion and perceptual scores. We also propose a U-Net based latent diffusion model which performs diffusion in a low-resolution latent space while preserving high-resolution information from the original input for the decoding process. Compared to the previous latent-diffusion model which trains a VAE-GAN to compress the image, our proposed U-Net compression strategy is significantly more stable and can recover highly accurate images without relying on adversarial optimization. Importantly, these modifications allow us to apply diffusion models to various image restoration tasks, including real-world shadow removal, HR non-homogeneous dehazing, stereo super-resolution, and bokeh effect transformation. By simply replacing the datasets and slightly changing the noise network, our model, named Refusion, is able to deal with large-size images (e.g., 6000 x 4000 x 3 in HR dehazing) and produces good results on all the above restoration problems. Our Refusion achieves the best perceptual performance in the NTIRE 2023 Image Shadow Removal Challenge and wins 2nd place overall.

- **Summary**: The automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to assist radiologists in the time-consuming task of report writing. Existing methods generate the full report from image-level features, failing to explicitly focus on anatomical regions in the image. We propose a simple yet effective region-guided report generation model that detects anatomical regions and then describes individual, salient regions to form the final report. While previous methods generate reports without the possibility of human intervention and with limited explainability, our method opens up novel clinical use cases through additional interactive capabilities and introduces a high degree of transparency and explainability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness in report generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models, and highlight its interactive capabilities. The code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/ttanida/rgrg .

- **Summary**: In the perception task of autonomous driving, multi-modal methods have become a trend due to the complementary characteristics of LiDAR point clouds and image data. However, the performance of previous methods is usually limited by the sparsity of the point cloud or the noise problem caused by the misalignment between LiDAR and the camera. To solve these two problems, we present a new concept, Voxel Region (VR), which is obtained by projecting the sparse local point clouds in each voxel dynamically. And we propose a novel fusion method, named Sparse-to-Dense Voxel Region Fusion (SDVRF). Specifically, more pixels of the image feature map inside the VR are gathered to supplement the voxel feature extracted from sparse points and achieve denser fusion. Meanwhile, different from prior methods, which project the size-fixed grids, our strategy of generating dynamic regions achieves better alignment and avoids introducing too much background noise. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale fusion framework to extract more contextual information and capture the features of objects of different sizes. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our method improves the performance of different baselines, especially on classes of small size, including Pedestrian and Cyclist.

- **Summary**: Subject movement during the magnetic resonance examination is inevitable and causes not only image artefacts but also deteriorates the homogeneity of the main magnetic field (B0), which is a prerequisite for high quality data. Thus, characterization of changes to B0, e.g. induced by patient movement, is important for MR applications that are prone to B0 inhomogeneities. We propose a deep learning based method to predict such changes within the brain from the change of the head position to facilitate retrospective or even real-time correction. A 3D U-net was trained on in vivo brain 7T MRI data. The input consisted of B0 maps and anatomical images at an initial position, and anatomical images at a different head position (obtained by applying a rigid-body transformation on the initial anatomical image). The output consisted of B0 maps at the new head positions. We further fine-tuned the network weights to each subject by measuring a limited number of head positions of the given subject, and trained the U-net with these data. Our approach was compared to established dynamic B0 field mapping via interleaved navigators, which suffer from limited spatial resolution and the need for undesirable sequence modifications. Qualitative and quantitative comparison showed similar performance between an interleaved navigator-equivalent method and proposed method. We therefore conclude that it is feasible to predict B0 maps from rigid subject movement and, when combined with external tracking hardware, this information could be used to improve the quality of magnetic resonance acquisitions without the use of navigators.

- **Summary**: Bayesian methods for solving inverse problems are a powerful alternative to classical methods since the Bayesian approach gives a probabilistic description of the problems and offers the ability to quantify the uncertainty in the solution. Meanwhile, solving inverse problems by data-driven techniques also proves to be successful, due to the increasing representation ability of data-based models. In this work, we try to incorporate the data-based models into a class of Langevin-based sampling algorithms in Bayesian inference. Loosely speaking, we introduce NF-ULA (Unadjusted Langevin algorithms by Normalizing Flows), which involves learning a normalizing flow as the prior. In particular, our algorithm only requires a pre-trained normalizing flow, which is independent of the considered inverse problem and the forward operator. We perform theoretical analysis by investigating the well-posedness of the Bayesian solution and the non-asymptotic convergence of the NF-ULA algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed NF-ULA algorithm is demonstrated in various imaging problems, including image deblurring, image inpainting, and limited-angle X-ray computed tomography (CT) reconstruction.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a Vision-Audio-Language Omni-peRception pretraining model (VALOR) for multi-modal understanding and generation. Different from widely-studied vision-language pretraining models, VALOR jointly models relationships of vision, audio and language in an end-to-end manner. It contains three separate encoders for single modality representations, and a decoder for multimodal conditional text generation. We design two pretext tasks to pretrain VALOR model, including Multimodal Grouping Alignment (MGA) and Multimodal Grouping Captioning (MGC). MGA projects vision, language and audio to the same common space, building vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language alignment simultaneously. MGC learns how to generate text tokens in conditions of vision, audio or their both. To promote vision-audio-language pretraining research, we construct a large-scale high-quality tri-modality dataset named VALOR-1M, which contains 1M audiable videos with human annotated audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments show that VALOR can learn strong multimodal correlations and be generalized to various downstream tasks (e.g., retrieval, captioning and question answering), with different input modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language). VALOR achieves new state-of-the-art performances on series of public cross-modality benchmarks. Code and data are available at project page https://casia-iva-group.github.io/projects/VALOR.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel deep-learning framework for super-resolution ultrasound images and videos in terms of spatial resolution and line reconstruction. We up-sample the acquired low-resolution image through a vision-based interpolation method; then, we train a learning-based model to improve the quality of the up-sampling. We qualitatively and quantitatively test our model on different anatomical districts (e.g., cardiac, obstetric) images and with different up-sampling resolutions (i.e., 2X, 4X). Our method improves the PSNR median value with respect to SOTA methods of $1.7\%$ on obstetric 2X raw images, $6.1\%$ on cardiac 2X raw images, and $4.4\%$ on abdominal raw 4X images; it also improves the number of pixels with a low prediction error of $9.0\%$ on obstetric 4X raw images, $5.2\%$ on cardiac 4X raw images, and $6.2\%$ on abdominal 4X raw images.   The proposed method is then applied to the spatial super-resolution of 2D videos, by optimising the sampling of lines acquired by the probe in terms of the acquisition frequency. Our method specialises trained networks to predict the high-resolution target through the design of the network architecture and the loss function, taking into account the anatomical district and the up-sampling factor and exploiting a large ultrasound data set. The use of deep learning on large data sets overcomes the limitations of vision-based algorithms that are general and do not encode the characteristics of the data. Furthermore, the data set can be enriched with images selected by medical experts to further specialise the individual networks. Through learning and high-performance computing, our super-resolution is specialised to different anatomical districts by training multiple networks. Furthermore, the computational demand is shifted to centralised hardware resources with a real-time execution of the network's prediction on local devices.

- **Summary**: Knee OsteoArthritis (KOA) is a widespread musculoskeletal disorder that can severely impact the mobility of older individuals. Insufficient medical data presents a significant obstacle for effectively training models due to the high cost associated with data labelling. Currently, deep learning-based models extensively utilize data augmentation techniques to improve their generalization ability and alleviate overfitting. However, conventional data augmentation techniques are primarily based on the original data and fail to introduce substantial diversity to the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model with original Selective Shuffled Position Embedding (SSPE) and key-patch exchange strategies to obtain different input sequences as a method of data augmentation for early detection of KOA (KL-0 vs KL-2). More specifically, we fix and shuffle the position embedding of key and non-key patches, respectively. Then, for the target image, we randomly select other candidate images from the training set to exchange their key patches and thus obtain different input sequences. Finally, a hybrid loss function is developed by incorporating multiple loss functions for different types of the sequences. According to the experimental results, the generated data are considered valid as they lead to a notable improvement in the model's classification performance.

- **Summary**: Autism diagnosis presents a major challenge due to the vast heterogeneity of the condition and the elusive nature of early detection. Atypical gait and gesture patterns are dominant behavioral characteristics of autism and can provide crucial insights for diagnosis. Furthermore, these data can be collected efficiently in a non-intrusive way, facilitating early intervention to optimize positive outcomes. Existing research mainly focuses on associating facial and eye-gaze features with autism. However, very few studies have investigated movement and gesture patterns which can reveal subtle variations and characteristics that are specific to autism. To address this gap, we present an analysis of gesture and gait activity in videos to identify children with autism and quantify the severity of their condition by regressing autism diagnostic observation schedule scores. Our proposed architecture addresses two key factors: (1) an effective feature representation to manifest irregular gesture patterns and (2) a two-stream co-learning framework to enable a comprehensive understanding of its relation to autism from diverse perspectives without explicitly using additional data modality. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing gesture and gait-activity videos for autism analysis.

- **Summary**: Though achieving excellent performance in some cases, current unsupervised learning methods for single image denoising usually have constraints in applications. In this paper, we propose a new approach which is more general and applicable to complicated noise models. Utilizing the property of score function, the gradient of logarithmic probability, we define a solving system for denoising. Once the score function of noisy images has been estimated, the denoised result can be obtained through the solving system. Our approach can be applied to multiple noise models, such as the mixture of multiplicative and additive noise combined with structured correlation. Experimental results show that our method is comparable when the noise model is simple, and has good performance in complicated cases where other methods are not applicable or perform poorly.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning has been designed as an alternative to fine-tuning for adapting Vision-language (V-L) models to the downstream tasks. Previous works mainly focus on text prompt while visual prompt works are limited for V-L models. The existing visual prompt methods endure either mediocre performance or unstable training process, indicating the difficulty of visual prompt learning. In this paper, we propose a new Progressive Visual Prompt (ProVP) structure to strengthen the interactions among prompts of different layers. More importantly, our ProVP could effectively propagate the image embeddings to deep layers and behave partially similar to an instance adaptive prompt method. To alleviate generalization deterioration, we further propose a new contrastive feature re-formation, which prevents the serious deviation of the prompted visual feature from the fixed CLIP visual feature distribution. Combining both, our method (ProVP-Ref) is evaluated on 11 image benchmark datasets and achieves 7/11 state-of-theart results on both few-shot and base-to-novel settings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the superior performance of visual prompts in V-L models to previous prompt-based methods in downstream tasks. Meanwhile, it implies that our ProVP-Ref shows the best capability to adapt and to generalize.

- **Summary**: Learning to segmentation without large-scale samples is an inherent capability of human. Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) performs the significant zero-shot image segmentation, attracting considerable attention from the computer vision community. Here, we investigate the capability of SAM for medical image analysis, especially for multi-phase liver tumor segmentation (MPLiTS), in terms of prompts, data resolution, phases. Experimental results demonstrate that there might be a large gap between SAM and expected performance. Fortunately, the qualitative results show that SAM is a powerful annotation tool for the community of interactive medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: With the rise of short video platforms as prominent channels for news dissemination, major platforms in China have gradually evolved into fertile grounds for the proliferation of fake news. However, distinguishing short video rumors poses a significant challenge due to the substantial amount of information and shared features among videos, resulting in homogeneity. To address the dissemination of short video rumors effectively, our research group proposes a methodology encompassing multimodal feature fusion and the integration of external knowledge, considering the merits and drawbacks of each algorithm. The proposed detection approach entails the following steps: (1) creation of a comprehensive dataset comprising multiple features extracted from short videos; (2) development of a multimodal rumor detection model: first, we employ the Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) video coding model to extract video features, followed by the utilization of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to extract textual features. Subsequently, the BERT model is employed to fuse textual and video features; (3) distinction is achieved through contrast learning: we acquire external knowledge by crawling relevant sources and leverage a vector database to incorporate this knowledge into the classification output. Our research process is driven by practical considerations, and the knowledge derived from this study will hold significant value in practical scenarios, such as short video rumor identification and the management of social opinions.

- **Summary**: The ability to recognize, localize and track dynamic objects in a scene is fundamental to many real-world applications, such as self-driving and robotic systems. Yet, traditional multiple object tracking (MOT) benchmarks rely only on a few object categories that hardly represent the multitude of possible objects that are encountered in the real world. This leaves contemporary MOT methods limited to a small set of pre-defined object categories. In this paper, we address this limitation by tackling a novel task, open-vocabulary MOT, that aims to evaluate tracking beyond pre-defined training categories. We further develop OVTrack, an open-vocabulary tracker that is capable of tracking arbitrary object classes. Its design is based on two key ingredients: First, leveraging vision-language models for both classification and association via knowledge distillation; second, a data hallucination strategy for robust appearance feature learning from denoising diffusion probabilistic models. The result is an extremely data-efficient open-vocabulary tracker that sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale, large-vocabulary TAO benchmark, while being trained solely on static images.

- **Summary**: Modeling a 3D volumetric shape as an assembly of decomposed shape parts is much more challenging, but semantically more valuable than direct reconstruction from a full shape representation. The neural network needs to implicitly learn part relations coherently, which is typically performed by dedicated network layers that can generate transformation matrices for each part. In this paper, we propose a VoxAttention network architecture for attention-based part assembly. We further propose a variant of using channel-wise part attention and show the advantages of this approach. Experimental results show that our method outperforms most state-of-the-art methods for the part relation-aware 3D shape modeling task.

- **Summary**: The lack of reliable biomarkers makes predicting the conversion from intermediate to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (iAMD, nAMD) a challenging task. We develop a Deep Learning (DL) model to predict the future risk of conversion of an eye from iAMD to nAMD from its current OCT scan. Although eye clinics generate vast amounts of longitudinal OCT scans to monitor AMD progression, only a small subset can be manually labeled for supervised DL. To address this issue, we propose Morph-SSL, a novel Self-supervised Learning (SSL) method for longitudinal data. It uses pairs of unlabelled OCT scans from different visits and involves morphing the scan from the previous visit to the next. The Decoder predicts the transformation for morphing and ensures a smooth feature manifold that can generate intermediate scans between visits through linear interpolation. Next, the Morph-SSL trained features are input to a Classifier which is trained in a supervised manner to model the cumulative probability distribution of the time to conversion with a sigmoidal function. Morph-SSL was trained on unlabelled scans of 399 eyes (3570 visits). The Classifier was evaluated with a five-fold cross-validation on 2418 scans from 343 eyes with clinical labels of the conversion date. The Morph-SSL features achieved an AUC of 0.766 in predicting the conversion to nAMD within the next 6 months, outperforming the same network when trained end-to-end from scratch or pre-trained with popular SSL methods. Automated prediction of the future risk of nAMD onset can enable timely treatment and individualized AMD management.

- **Summary**: The presence of non-homogeneous haze can cause scene blurring, color distortion, low contrast, and other degradations that obscure texture details. Existing homogeneous dehazing methods struggle to handle the non-uniform distribution of haze in a robust manner. The crucial challenge of non-homogeneous dehazing is to effectively extract the non-uniform distribution features and reconstruct the details of hazy areas with high quality. In this paper, we propose a novel self-paced semi-curricular attention network, called SCANet, for non-homogeneous image dehazing that focuses on enhancing haze-occluded regions. Our approach consists of an attention generator network and a scene reconstruction network. We use the luminance differences of images to restrict the attention map and introduce a self-paced semi-curricular learning strategy to reduce learning ambiguity in the early stages of training. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our SCANet outperforms many state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/gy65896/SCANet.

- **Summary**: The performance of perception systems developed for autonomous driving vehicles has seen significant improvements over the last few years. This improvement was associated with the increasing use of LiDAR sensors and point cloud data to facilitate the task of object detection and recognition in autonomous driving. However, LiDAR and camera systems show deteriorating performances when used in unfavorable conditions like dusty and rainy weather. Radars on the other hand operate on relatively longer wavelengths which allows for much more robust measurements in these conditions. Despite that, radar-centric data sets do not get a lot of attention in the development of deep learning techniques for radar perception. In this work, we consider the radar object detection problem, in which the radar frequency data is the only input into the detection framework. We further investigate the challenges of using radar-only data in deep learning models. We propose a transformers-based model, named RadarFormer, that utilizes state-of-the-art developments in vision deep learning. Our model also introduces a channel-chirp-time merging module that reduces the size and complexity of our models by more than 10 times without compromising accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on the CRUW radar dataset demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. Our RadarFormer performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods while being 2x faster during inference and requiring only one-tenth of their model parameters.

- **Summary**: Streaming video clips with large-scale video tokens impede vision transformers (ViTs) for efficient recognition, especially in video action detection where sufficient spatiotemporal representations are required for precise actor identification. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for efficient video action detection (EVAD) based on vanilla ViTs. Our EVAD consists of two specialized designs for video action detection. First, we propose a spatiotemporal token dropout from a keyframe-centric perspective. In a video clip, we maintain all tokens from its keyframe, preserve tokens relevant to actor motions from other frames, and drop out the remaining tokens in this clip. Second, we refine scene context by leveraging remaining tokens for better recognizing actor identities. The region of interest (RoI) in our action detector is expanded into temporal domain. The captured spatiotemporal actor identity representations are refined via scene context in a decoder with the attention mechanism. These two designs make our EVAD efficient while maintaining accuracy, which is validated on three benchmark datasets (i.e., AVA, UCF101-24, JHMDB). Compared to the vanilla ViT backbone, our EVAD reduces the overall GFLOPs by 43% and improves real-time inference speed by 40% with no performance degradation. Moreover, even at similar computational costs, our EVAD can improve the performance by 1.1 mAP with higher resolution inputs. Code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/EVAD.

- **Summary**: We introduce a method for novel view synthesis given only a single wide-baseline stereo image pair. In this challenging regime, 3D scene points are regularly observed only once, requiring prior-based reconstruction of scene geometry and appearance. We find that existing approaches to novel view synthesis from sparse observations fail due to recovering incorrect 3D geometry and due to the high cost of differentiable rendering that precludes their scaling to large-scale training. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by formulating a multi-view transformer encoder, proposing an efficient, image-space epipolar line sampling scheme to assemble image features for a target ray, and a lightweight cross-attention-based renderer. Our contributions enable training of our method on a large-scale real-world dataset of indoor and outdoor scenes. We demonstrate that our method learns powerful multi-view geometry priors while reducing the rendering time. We conduct extensive comparisons on held-out test scenes across two real-world datasets, significantly outperforming prior work on novel view synthesis from sparse image observations and achieving multi-view-consistent novel view synthesis.

- **Summary**: Despite the success in large-scale text-to-image generation and text-conditioned image editing, existing methods still struggle to produce consistent generation and editing results. For example, generation approaches usually fail to synthesize multiple images of the same objects/characters but with different views or poses. Meanwhile, existing editing methods either fail to achieve effective complex non-rigid editing while maintaining the overall textures and identity, or require time-consuming fine-tuning to capture the image-specific appearance. In this paper, we develop MasaCtrl, a tuning-free method to achieve consistent image generation and complex non-rigid image editing simultaneously. Specifically, MasaCtrl converts existing self-attention in diffusion models into mutual self-attention, so that it can query correlated local contents and textures from source images for consistency. To further alleviate the query confusion between foreground and background, we propose a mask-guided mutual self-attention strategy, where the mask can be easily extracted from the cross-attention maps. Extensive experiments show that the proposed MasaCtrl can produce impressive results in both consistent image generation and complex non-rigid real image editing.

- **Summary**: Deep generative models are becoming increasingly powerful, now generating diverse high fidelity photo-realistic samples given text prompts. Have they reached the point where models of natural images can be used for generative data augmentation, helping to improve challenging discriminative tasks? We show that large-scale text-to image diffusion models can be fine-tuned to produce class conditional models with SOTA FID (1.76 at 256x256 resolution) and Inception Score (239 at 256x256). The model also yields a new SOTA in Classification Accuracy Scores (64.96 for 256x256 generative samples, improving to 69.24 for 1024x1024 samples). Augmenting the ImageNet training set with samples from the resulting models yields significant improvements in ImageNet classification accuracy over strong ResNet and Vision Transformer baselines.

- **Summary**: We propose Latent-Shift -- an efficient text-to-video generation method based on a pretrained text-to-image generation model that consists of an autoencoder and a U-Net diffusion model. Learning a video diffusion model in the latent space is much more efficient than in the pixel space. The latter is often limited to first generating a low-resolution video followed by a sequence of frame interpolation and super-resolution models, which makes the entire pipeline very complex and computationally expensive. To extend a U-Net from image generation to video generation, prior work proposes to add additional modules like 1D temporal convolution and/or temporal attention layers. In contrast, we propose a parameter-free temporal shift module that can leverage the spatial U-Net as is for video generation. We achieve this by shifting two portions of the feature map channels forward and backward along the temporal dimension. The shifted features of the current frame thus receive the features from the previous and the subsequent frames, enabling motion learning without additional parameters. We show that Latent-Shift achieves comparable or better results while being significantly more efficient. Moreover, Latent-Shift can generate images despite being finetuned for T2V generation.

- **Summary**: With the advent of vision-language models (VLMs) that can perform in-context and prompt-based learning, how can we design prompting approaches that robustly generalize to distribution shift and can be used on novel classes outside the support set of the prompts? In this work, we first define two types of robustness to distribution shift on VLMs, namely, robustness on base classes (the classes included in the support set of prompts) and robustness on novel classes. Then, we study the robustness of existing in-context learning and prompt learning approaches, where we find that prompt learning performs robustly on test images from base classes, while it does not generalize well on images from novel classes. We propose robust prompt learning by integrating multiple-scale image features into the prompt, which improves both types of robustness. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to study the defined robustness on six benchmarks and show the effectiveness of our proposal.

- **Summary**: We propose DisCo-CLIP, a distributed memory-efficient CLIP training approach, to reduce the memory consumption of contrastive loss when training contrastive learning models. Our approach decomposes the contrastive loss and its gradient computation into two parts, one to calculate the intra-GPU gradients and the other to compute the inter-GPU gradients. According to our decomposition, only the intra-GPU gradients are computed on the current GPU, while the inter-GPU gradients are collected via all_reduce from other GPUs instead of being repeatedly computed on every GPU. In this way, we can reduce the GPU memory consumption of contrastive loss computation from $\bigO(B^2)$ to $\bigO(\frac{B^2}{N})$, where $B$ and $N$ are the batch size and the number of GPUs used for training. Such a distributed solution is mathematically equivalent to the original non-distributed contrastive loss computation, without sacrificing any computation accuracy. It is particularly efficient for large-batch CLIP training. For instance, DisCo-CLIP can enable contrastive training of a ViT-B/32 model with a batch size of 32K or 196K using 8 or 64 A100 40GB GPUs, compared with the original CLIP solution which requires 128 A100 40GB GPUs to train a ViT-B/32 model with a batch size of 32K.

- **Summary**: High-definition (HD) semantic maps are crucial in enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate urban environments. The traditional method of creating offline HD maps involves labor-intensive manual annotation processes, which are not only costly but also insufficient for timely updates. Recent studies have proposed an alternative approach that generates local maps using online sensor observations. However, this approach is limited by the sensor's perception range and its susceptibility to occlusions. In this study, we propose Neural Map Prior (NMP), a neural representation of global maps. This representation automatically updates itself and improves the performance of local map inference. Specifically, we utilize two approaches to achieve this. Firstly, to integrate a strong map prior into local map inference, we apply cross-attention, a mechanism that dynamically identifies correlations between current and prior features. Secondly, to update the global neural map prior, we utilize a learning-based fusion module that guides the network in fusing features from previous traversals. Our experimental results, based on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that our framework is highly compatible with various map segmentation and detection architectures. It significantly improves map prediction performance, even in challenging weather conditions and situations with a longer perception range. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based system for creating a global map prior.

- **Summary**: Text-driven content creation has evolved to be a transformative technique that revolutionizes creativity. Here we study the task of text-driven human video generation, where a video sequence is synthesized from texts describing the appearance and motions of a target performer. Compared to general text-driven video generation, human-centric video generation requires maintaining the appearance of synthesized human while performing complex motions. In this work, we present Text2Performer to generate vivid human videos with articulated motions from texts. Text2Performer has two novel designs: 1) decomposed human representation and 2) diffusion-based motion sampler. First, we decompose the VQVAE latent space into human appearance and pose representation in an unsupervised manner by utilizing the nature of human videos. In this way, the appearance is well maintained along the generated frames. Then, we propose continuous VQ-diffuser to sample a sequence of pose embeddings. Unlike existing VQ-based methods that operate in the discrete space, continuous VQ-diffuser directly outputs the continuous pose embeddings for better motion modeling. Finally, motion-aware masking strategy is designed to mask the pose embeddings spatial-temporally to enhance the temporal coherence. Moreover, to facilitate the task of text-driven human video generation, we contribute a Fashion-Text2Video dataset with manually annotated action labels and text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Text2Performer generates high-quality human videos (up to 512x256 resolution) with diverse appearances and flexible motions.

- **Summary**: Instruction tuning large language models (LLMs) using machine-generated instruction-following data has improved zero-shot capabilities on new tasks, but the idea is less explored in the multimodal field. In this paper, we present the first attempt to use language-only GPT-4 to generate multimodal language-image instruction-following data. By instruction tuning on such generated data, we introduce LLaVA: Large Language and Vision Assistant, an end-to-end trained large multimodal model that connects a vision encoder and LLM for general-purpose visual and language understanding.Our early experiments show that LLaVA demonstrates impressive multimodel chat abilities, sometimes exhibiting the behaviors of multimodal GPT-4 on unseen images/instructions, and yields a 85.1% relative score compared with GPT-4 on a synthetic multimodal instruction-following dataset. When fine-tuned on Science QA, the synergy of LLaVA and GPT-4 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.53%. We make GPT-4 generated visual instruction tuning data, our model and code base publicly available.

- **Summary**: Medical data poses a daunting challenge for AI algorithms: it exists in many different modalities, experiences frequent distribution shifts, and suffers from a scarcity of examples and labels. Recent advances, including transformers and self-supervised learning, promise a more universal approach that can be applied flexibly across these diverse conditions. To measure and drive progress in this direction, we present BenchMD: a benchmark that tests how well unified, modality-agnostic methods, including architectures and training techniques (e.g. self-supervised learning, ImageNet pretraining),perform on a diverse array of clinically-relevant medical tasks. BenchMD combines 19 publicly available datasets for 7 medical modalities, including 1D sensor data, 2D images, and 3D volumetric scans. Our benchmark reflects real-world data constraints by evaluating methods across a range of dataset sizes, including challenging few-shot settings that incentivize the use of pretraining. Finally, we evaluate performance on out-of-distribution data collected at different hospitals than the training data, representing naturally-occurring distribution shifts that frequently degrade the performance of medical AI models. Our baseline results demonstrate that no unified learning technique achieves strong performance across all modalities, leaving ample room for improvement on the benchmark.

- **Summary**: Decision Transformers (DT) have demonstrated strong performances in offline reinforcement learning settings, but quickly adapting to unseen novel tasks remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework, called Hyper-Decision Transformer (HDT), that can generalize to novel tasks from a handful of demonstrations in a data- and parameter-efficient manner. To achieve such a goal, we propose to augment the base DT with an adaptation module, whose parameters are initialized by a hyper-network. When encountering unseen tasks, the hyper-network takes a handful of demonstrations as inputs and initializes the adaptation module accordingly. This initialization enables HDT to efficiently adapt to novel tasks by only fine-tuning the adaptation module. We validate HDT's generalization capability on object manipulation tasks. We find that with a single expert demonstration and fine-tuning only 0.5% of DT parameters, HDT adapts faster to unseen tasks than fine-tuning the whole DT model. Finally, we explore a more challenging setting where expert actions are not available, and we show that HDT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task success rates by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Building a robot that can understand and learn to interact by watching humans has inspired several vision problems. However, despite some successful results on static datasets, it remains unclear how current models can be used on a robot directly. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging videos of human interactions in an environment centric manner. Utilizing internet videos of human behavior, we train a visual affordance model that estimates where and how in the scene a human is likely to interact. The structure of these behavioral affordances directly enables the robot to perform many complex tasks. We show how to seamlessly integrate our affordance model with four robot learning paradigms including offline imitation learning, exploration, goal-conditioned learning, and action parameterization for reinforcement learning. We show the efficacy of our approach, which we call VRB, across 4 real world environments, over 10 different tasks, and 2 robotic platforms operating in the wild.

- **Summary**: The sound effects that designers add to videos are designed to convey a particular artistic effect and, thus, may be quite different from a scene's true sound. Inspired by the challenges of creating a soundtrack for a video that differs from its true sound, but that nonetheless matches the actions occurring on screen, we propose the problem of conditional Foley. We present the following contributions to address this problem. First, we propose a pretext task for training our model to predict sound for an input video clip using a conditional audio-visual clip sampled from another time within the same source video. Second, we propose a model for generating a soundtrack for a silent input video, given a user-supplied example that specifies what the video should "sound like". We show through human studies and automated evaluation metrics that our model successfully generates sound from video, while varying its output according to the content of a supplied example.

- **Summary**: Thanks to the impressive progress of large-scale vision-language pretraining, recent recognition models can classify arbitrary objects in a zero-shot and open-set manner, with a surprisingly high accuracy. However, translating this success to semantic segmentation is not trivial, because this dense prediction task requires not only accurate semantic understanding but also fine shape delineation and existing vision-language models are trained with image-level language descriptions. To bridge this gap, we pursue \textbf{shape-aware} zero-shot semantic segmentation in this study. Inspired by classical spectral methods in the image segmentation literature, we propose to leverage the eigen vectors of Laplacian matrices constructed with self-supervised pixel-wise features to promote shape-awareness. Despite that this simple and effective technique does not make use of the masks of seen classes at all, we demonstrate that it out-performs a state-of-the-art shape-aware formulation that aligns ground truth and predicted edges during training. We also delve into the performance gains achieved on different datasets using different backbones and draw several interesting and conclusive observations: the benefits of promoting shape-awareness highly relates to mask compactness and language embedding locality. Finally, our method sets new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot semantic segmentation on both Pascal and COCO, with significant margins.

- **Summary**: With significant annotation savings, point supervision has been proven effective for numerous 2D and 3D scene understanding problems. This success is primarily attributed to the structured output space; i.e., samples with high spatial affinity tend to share the same labels. Sharing this spirit, we study affordance segmentation with point supervision, wherein the setting inherits an unexplored dual affinity-spatial affinity and label affinity. By label affinity, we refer to affordance segmentation as a multi-label prediction problem: A plate can be both holdable and containable. By spatial affinity, we refer to a universal prior that nearby pixels with similar visual features should share the same point annotation. To tackle label affinity, we devise a dense prediction network that enhances label relations by effectively densifying labels in a new domain (i.e., label co-occurrence). To address spatial affinity, we exploit a Transformer backbone for global patch interaction and a regularization loss. In experiments, we benchmark our method on the challenging CAD120 dataset, showing significant performance gains over prior methods.

- **Summary**: In our pursuit of advancing multi-modal AI assistants capable of guiding users to achieve complex multi-step goals, we propose the task of "Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA)". Given a succinct natural language goal, e.g., "make a shelf", and a video of the user's progress so far, the aim of VPA is to devise a plan, i.e., a sequence of actions such as "sand shelf", "paint shelf", etc. to realize the specified goal. This requires assessing the user's progress from the (untrimmed) video, and relating it to the requirements of natural language goal, i.e., which actions to select and in what order? Consequently, this requires handling long video history and arbitrarily complex action dependencies. To address these challenges, we decompose VPA into video action segmentation and forecasting. Importantly, we experiment by formulating the forecasting step as a multi-modal sequence modeling problem, allowing us to leverage the strength of pre-trained LMs (as the sequence model). This novel approach, which we call Visual Language Model based Planner (VLaMP), outperforms baselines across a suite of metrics that gauge the quality of the generated plans. Furthermore, through comprehensive ablations, we also isolate the value of each component--language pre-training, visual observations, and goal information. We have open-sourced all the data, model checkpoints, and training code.

- **Summary**: With the recent surge in popularity of AR/VR applications, realistic and accurate control of 3D full-body avatars has become a highly demanded feature. A particular challenge is that only a sparse tracking signal is available from standalone HMDs (Head Mounted Devices), often limited to tracking the user's head and wrists. While this signal is resourceful for reconstructing the upper body motion, the lower body is not tracked and must be synthesized from the limited information provided by the upper body joints. In this paper, we present AGRoL, a novel conditional diffusion model specifically designed to track full bodies given sparse upper-body tracking signals. Our model is based on a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture and a novel conditioning scheme for motion data. It can predict accurate and smooth full-body motion, particularly the challenging lower body movement. Unlike common diffusion architectures, our compact architecture can run in real-time, making it suitable for online body-tracking applications. We train and evaluate our model on AMASS motion capture dataset, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generated motion accuracy and smoothness. We further justify our design choices through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

- **Summary**: While the existing deep learning-based room layout estimation techniques demonstrate good overall accuracy, they are less effective for distant floor-wall boundary. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided approach for layout boundary estimation introducing new two-stage CNN architecture termed U2RLE. The initial stage predicts both floor-wall boundary and its uncertainty and is followed by the refinement of boundaries with high positional uncertainty using a different, distance-aware loss. Finally, outputs from the two stages are merged to produce the room layout. Experiments using ZInD and Structure3D datasets show that U2RLE improves over current state-of-the-art, being able to handle both near and far walls better. In particular, U2RLE outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques for the most distant walls.

- **Summary**: Modern Augmented reality applications require performing multiple tasks on each input frame simultaneously. Multi-task learning (MTL) represents an effective approach where multiple tasks share an encoder to extract representative features from the input frame, followed by task-specific decoders to generate predictions for each task. Generally, the shared encoder in MTL models needs to have a large representational capacity in order to generalize well to various tasks and input data, which has a negative effect on the inference latency. In this paper, we argue that due to the large variations in the complexity of the input frames, some computations might be unnecessary for the output. Therefore, we introduce AdaMTL, an adaptive framework that learns task-aware inference policies for the MTL models in an input-dependent manner. Specifically, we attach a task-aware lightweight policy network to the shared encoder and co-train it alongside the MTL model to recognize unnecessary computations. During runtime, our task-aware policy network decides which parts of the model to activate depending on the input frame and the target computational complexity. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL dataset demonstrate that AdaMTL reduces the computational complexity by 43% while improving the accuracy by 1.32% compared to single-task models. Combined with SOTA MTL methodologies, AdaMTL boosts the accuracy by 7.8% while improving the efficiency by 3.1X. When deployed on Vuzix M4000 smart glasses, AdaMTL reduces the inference latency and the energy consumption by up to 21.8% and 37.5%, respectively, compared to the static MTL model. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/scale-lab/AdaMTL.git.

- **Summary**: Human drivers naturally reason about interactions between road users to understand and safely navigate through traffic. Thus, developing autonomous vehicles necessitates the ability to mimic such knowledge and model interactions between road users to understand and navigate unpredictable, dynamic environments. However, since real-world scenarios often differ from training datasets, effectively modeling the behavior of various road users in an environment remains a significant research challenge. This reality necessitates models that generalize to a broad range of domains and explicitly model interactions between road users and the environment to improve scenario understanding. Graph learning methods address this problem by modeling interactions using graph representations of scenarios. However, existing methods cannot effectively transfer knowledge gained from the training domain to real-world scenarios. This constraint is caused by the domain-specific rules used for graph extraction that can vary in effectiveness across domains, limiting generalization ability. To address these limitations, we propose RoadScene2Graph (RS2G): a data-driven graph extraction and modeling approach that learns to extract the best graph representation of a road scene for solving autonomous scene understanding tasks. We show that RS2G enables better performance at subjective risk assessment than rule-based graph extraction methods and deep-learning-based models. RS2G also improves generalization and Sim2Real transfer learning, which denotes the ability to transfer knowledge gained from simulation datasets to unseen real-world scenarios. We also present ablation studies showing how RS2G produces a more useful graph representation for downstream classifiers. Finally, we show how RS2G can identify the relative importance of rule-based graph edges and enables intelligent graph sparsity tuning.

- **Summary**: Enhancing the robustness of vision algorithms in real-world scenarios is challenging. One reason is that existing robustness benchmarks are limited, as they either rely on synthetic data or ignore the effects of individual nuisance factors. We introduce OOD-CV-v2, a benchmark dataset that includes out-of-distribution examples of 10 object categories in terms of pose, shape, texture, context and the weather conditions, and enables benchmarking of models for image classification, object detection, and 3D pose estimation. In addition to this novel dataset, we contribute extensive experiments using popular baseline methods, which reveal that: 1) Some nuisance factors have a much stronger negative effect on the performance compared to others, also depending on the vision task. 2) Current approaches to enhance robustness have only marginal effects, and can even reduce robustness. 3) We do not observe significant differences between convolutional and transformer architectures. We believe our dataset provides a rich test bed to study robustness and will help push forward research in this area.   Our dataset can be accessed from https://bzhao.me/OOD-CV/

- **Summary**: Backpropagation, the cornerstone of deep learning, is limited to computing gradients solely for continuous variables. This limitation hinders various research on problems involving discrete latent variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for approximating the gradient of parameters involved in generating discrete latent variables. First, we examine the widely used Straight-Through (ST) heuristic and demonstrate that it works as a first-order approximation of the gradient. Guided by our findings, we propose a novel method called ReinMax, which integrates Heun's Method, a second-order numerical method for solving ODEs, to approximate the gradient. Our method achieves second-order accuracy without requiring Hessian or other second-order derivatives. We conduct experiments on structured output prediction and unsupervised generative modeling tasks. Our results show that \ours brings consistent improvements over the state of the art, including ST and Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax. Implementations are released at https://github.com/microsoft/ReinMax.

- **Summary**: The issue of demographic disparities in face recognition accuracy has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Various face image datasets have been proposed as 'fair' or 'balanced' to assess the accuracy of face recognition algorithms across demographics. These datasets typically balance the number of identities and images across demographics. It is important to note that the number of identities and images in an evaluation dataset are {\em not} driving factors for 1-to-1 face matching accuracy. Moreover, balancing the number of identities and images does not ensure balance in other factors known to impact accuracy, such as head pose, brightness, and image quality. We demonstrate these issues using several recently proposed datasets. To improve the ability to perform less biased evaluations, we propose a bias-aware toolkit that facilitates creation of cross-demographic evaluation datasets balanced on factors mentioned in this paper.

- **Summary**: We introduce ProPanDL, a family of networks capable of uncertainty-aware panoptic segmentation. Unlike existing segmentation methods, ProPanDL is capable of estimating full probability distributions for both the semantic and spatial aspects of panoptic segmentation. We implement and evaluate ProPanDL variants capable of estimating both parametric (Variance Network) and parameter-free (SampleNet) distributions quantifying pixel-wise spatial uncertainty. We couple these approaches with two methods (Temperature Scaling and Evidential Deep Learning) for semantic uncertainty estimation. To evaluate the uncertainty-aware panoptic segmentation task, we address limitations with existing approaches by proposing new metrics that enable separate evaluation of spatial and semantic uncertainty. We additionally propose the use of the energy score, a proper scoring rule, for more robust evaluation of spatial output distributions. Using these metrics, we conduct an extensive evaluation of ProPanDL variants. Our results demonstrate that ProPanDL is capable of estimating well-calibrated and meaningful output distributions while still retaining strong performance on the base panoptic segmentation task.

- **Summary**: The positive therapeutic effect of viewing pet images online has been well-studied. However, it is difficult to obtain large-scale production of such content since it relies on pet owners to capture photographs and upload them. I use a Generative Adversarial Network-based framework for the creation of fake pet images at scale. These images are uploaded on an Instagram account where they drive user engagement at levels comparable to those seen with images from accounts with traditional pet photographs, underlining the applicability of the framework to be used for pet-therapy social media content.

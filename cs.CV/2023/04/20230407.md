- **Summary**: In this paper, we present an end-to-end unsupervised anomaly detection framework for 3D point clouds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the anomaly detection task on a general object represented by a 3D point cloud. We propose a deep variational autoencoder-based unsupervised anomaly detection network adapted to the 3D point cloud and an anomaly score specifically for 3D point clouds. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we conducted extensive experiments on the ShapeNet dataset. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline method.

- **Summary**: Small object detection requires the detection head to scan a large number of positions on image feature maps, which is extremely hard for computation- and energy-efficient lightweight generic detectors. To accurately detect small objects with limited computation, we propose a two-stage lightweight detection framework with extremely low computation complexity, termed as TinyDet. It enables high-resolution feature maps for dense anchoring to better cover small objects, proposes a sparsely-connected convolution for computation reduction, enhances the early stage features in the backbone, and addresses the feature misalignment problem for accurate small object detection. On the COCO benchmark, our TinyDet-M achieves 30.3 AP and 13.5 AP^s with only 991 MFLOPs, which is the first detector that has an AP over 30 with less than 1 GFLOPs; besides, TinyDet-S and TinyDet-L achieve promising performance under different computation limitation.

- **Summary**: Sequence generation models have recently made significant progress in unifying various vision tasks. Although some auto-regressive models have demonstrated promising results in end-to-end text spotting, they use specific detection formats while ignoring various text shapes and are limited in the maximum number of text instances that can be detected. To overcome these limitations, we propose a UNIfied scene Text Spotter, called UNITS. Our model unifies various detection formats, including quadrilaterals and polygons, allowing it to detect text in arbitrary shapes. Additionally, we apply starting-point prompting to enable the model to extract texts from an arbitrary starting point, thereby extracting more texts beyond the number of instances it was trained on. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis shows that UNITS can extract a larger number of texts than it was trained on. We provide the code for our method at https://github.com/clovaai/units.

- **Summary**: Linear probing (LP) (and $k$-NN) on the upstream dataset with labels (e.g., ImageNet) and transfer learning (TL) to various downstream datasets are commonly employed to evaluate the quality of visual representations learned via self-supervised learning (SSL). Although existing SSL methods have shown good performances under those evaluation protocols, we observe that the performances are very sensitive to the hyperparameters involved in LP and TL. We argue that this is an undesirable behavior since truly generic representations should be easily adapted to any other visual recognition task, i.e., the learned representations should be robust to the settings of LP and TL hyperparameters. In this work, we try to figure out the cause of performance sensitivity by conducting extensive experiments with state-of-the-art SSL methods. First, we find that input normalization for LP is crucial to eliminate performance variations according to the hyperparameters. Specifically, batch normalization before feeding inputs to a linear classifier considerably improves the stability of evaluation, and also resolves inconsistency of $k$-NN and LP metrics. Second, for TL, we demonstrate that a weight decay parameter in SSL significantly affects the transferability of learned representations, which cannot be identified by LP or $k$-NN evaluations on the upstream dataset. We believe that the findings of this study will be beneficial for the community by drawing attention to the shortcomings in the current SSL evaluation schemes and underscoring the need to reconsider them.

- **Summary**: Many applications require grouping instances contained in diverse document datasets into classes. Most widely used methods do not employ deep learning and do not exploit the inherently multimodal nature of documents. Notably, record linkage is typically conceptualized as a string-matching problem. This study develops CLIPPINGS, (Contrastively Linking Pooled Pre-trained Embeddings), a multimodal framework for record linkage. CLIPPINGS employs end-to-end training of symmetric vision and language bi-encoders, aligned through contrastive language-image pre-training, to learn a metric space where the pooled image-text representation for a given instance is close to representations in the same class and distant from representations in different classes. At inference time, instances can be linked by retrieving their nearest neighbor from an offline exemplar embedding index or by clustering their representations. The study examines two challenging applications: constructing comprehensive supply chains for mid-20th century Japan through linking firm level financial records - with each firm name represented by its crop in the document image and the corresponding OCR - and detecting which image-caption pairs in a massive corpus of historical U.S. newspapers came from the same underlying photo wire source. CLIPPINGS outperforms widely used string matching methods by a wide margin and also outperforms unimodal methods. Moreover, a purely self-supervised model trained on only image-OCR pairs also outperforms popular string-matching methods without requiring any labels.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown great potential for various visual tasks due to its ability to model long-range dependency. However, ViT requires a large amount of computing resource to compute the global self-attention. In this work, we propose a ladder self-attention block with multiple branches and a progressive shift mechanism to develop a light-weight transformer backbone that requires less computing resources (e.g. a relatively small number of parameters and FLOPs), termed Progressive Shift Ladder Transformer (PSLT). First, the ladder self-attention block reduces the computational cost by modelling local self-attention in each branch. In the meanwhile, the progressive shift mechanism is proposed to enlarge the receptive field in the ladder self-attention block by modelling diverse local self-attention for each branch and interacting among these branches. Second, the input feature of the ladder self-attention block is split equally along the channel dimension for each branch, which considerably reduces the computational cost in the ladder self-attention block (with nearly 1/3 the amount of parameters and FLOPs), and the outputs of these branches are then collaborated by a pixel-adaptive fusion. Therefore, the ladder self-attention block with a relatively small number of parameters and FLOPs is capable of modelling long-range interactions. Based on the ladder self-attention block, PSLT performs well on several vision tasks, including image classification, objection detection and person re-identification. On the ImageNet-1k dataset, PSLT achieves a top-1 accuracy of 79.9% with 9.2M parameters and 1.9G FLOPs, which is comparable to several existing models with more than 20M parameters and 4G FLOPs.

- **Summary**: Dynamic imaging addresses the recovery of a time-varying 2D or 3D object at each time instant using its undersampled measurements. In particular, in the case of dynamic tomography, only a single projection at a single view angle may be available at a time, making the problem severely ill-posed. In this work, we propose an approach, RED-PSM, which combines for the first time two powerful techniques to address this challenging imaging problem. The first, are partially separable models, which have been used to efficiently introduce a low-rank prior for the spatio-temporal object. The second is the recent Regularization by Denoising (RED), which provides a flexible framework to exploit the impressive performance of state-of-the-art image denoising algorithms, for various inverse problems. We propose a partially separable objective with RED and a computationally efficient and scalable optimization scheme with variable splitting and ADMM. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of our objective to a value corresponding to a stationary point satisfying the first-order optimality conditions. Convergence is accelerated by a particular projection-domain-based initialization. We demonstrate the performance and computational improvements of our proposed RED-PSM with a learned image denoiser by comparing it to a recent deep-prior-based method known as TD-DIP. Although the main focus is on dynamic tomography, we also show the performance advantages of RED-PSM in a cardiac dynamic MRI setting.

- **Summary**: In deep learning, mini-batch training is commonly used to optimize network parameters. However, the traditional mini-batch method may not learn the under-represented samples and complex patterns in the data, leading to a longer time for generalization. To address this problem, a variant of the traditional algorithm has been proposed, which trains the network focusing on mini-batches with high loss. The study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed training using various deep neural networks trained on three benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10). The deep neural networks used in the study are ResNet-18, ResNet-50, Efficient Net B4, EfficientNetV2-S, and MobilenetV3-S. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can significantly improve the test accuracy and speed up the convergence compared to the traditional mini-batch training method. Furthermore, we introduce a hyper-parameter delta ({\delta}) that decides how many mini-batches are considered for training. Experiments on various values of {\delta} found that the performance of the proposed method for smaller {\delta} values generally results in similar test accuracy and faster generalization. We show that the proposed method generalizes in 26.47% less number of epochs than the traditional mini-batch method in EfficientNet-B4 on STL-10. The proposed method also improves the test top-1 accuracy by 7.26% in ResNet-18 on CIFAR-100.

- **Summary**: While recent AI-based draping networks have significantly advanced the ability to simulate the appearance of clothes worn by 3D human models, the handling of multi-layered garments remains a challenging task. This paper presents a model for draping multi-layered garments that are unseen during the training process. Our proposed framework consists of three stages: garment embedding, single-layered garment draping, and untangling. The model represents a garment independent to its topological structure by mapping it onto the $UV$ map of a human body model, allowing for the ability to handle previously unseen garments. In the single-layered garment draping phase, the model sequentially drapes all garments in each layer on the body without considering interactions between them. The untangling phase utilizes a GNN-based network to model the interaction between the garments of different layers, enabling the simulation of complex multi-layered clothing. The proposed model demonstrates strong performance on both unseen synthetic and real garment reconstruction data on a diverse range of human body shapes and poses.

- **Summary**: The universal model emerges as a promising trend for medical image segmentation, paving up the way to build medical imaging large model (MILM). One popular strategy to build universal models is to encode each task as a one-hot vector and generate dynamic convolutional layers at the end of the decoder to extract the interested target. Although successful, it ignores the correlations among tasks and meanwhile is too late to make the model 'aware' of the ongoing task. To address both issues, we propose a prompt-driven Universal Segmentation model (UniSeg) for multi-task medical image segmentation using diverse modalities and domains. We first devise a learnable universal prompt to describe the correlations among all tasks and then convert this prompt and image features into a task-specific prompt, which is fed to the decoder as a part of its input. Thus, we make the model 'aware' of the ongoing task early and boost the task-specific training of the whole decoder. Our results indicate that the proposed UniSeg outperforms other universal models and single-task models on 11 upstream tasks. Moreover, UniSeg also beats other pre-trained models on two downstream datasets, providing the community with a high-quality pre-trained model for 3D medical image segmentation. Code and model are available at https://github.com/yeerwen/UniSeg.

- **Summary**: Scene graph generation aims to construct a semantic graph structure from an image such that its nodes and edges respectively represent objects and their relationships. One of the major challenges for the task lies in the presence of distracting objects and relationships in images; contextual reasoning is strongly distracted by irrelevant objects or backgrounds and, more importantly, a vast number of irrelevant candidate relations. To tackle the issue, we propose the Selective Quad Attention Network (SQUAT) that learns to select relevant object pairs and disambiguate them via diverse contextual interactions. SQUAT consists of two main components: edge selection and quad attention. The edge selection module selects relevant object pairs, i.e., edges in the scene graph, which helps contextual reasoning, and the quad attention module then updates the edge features using both edge-to-node and edge-to-edge cross-attentions to capture contextual information between objects and object pairs. Experiments demonstrate the strong performance and robustness of SQUAT, achieving the state of the art on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Flower breed detection and giving details of that breed with the suggestion of cultivation processes and the way of taking care is important for flower cultivation, breed invention, and the flower business. Among all the local flowers in Bangladesh, the rose is one of the most popular and demanded flowers. Roses are the most desirable flower not only in Bangladesh but also throughout the world. Roses can be used for many other purposes apart from decoration. As roses have a great demand in the flower business so rose breed detection will be very essential. However, there is no remarkable work for breed detection of a particular flower unlike the classification of different flowers. In this research, we have proposed a model to detect rose breeds from images using transfer learning techniques. For such work in flowers, resources are not enough in image processing and classification, so we needed a large dataset of the massive number of images to train our model. we have used 1939 raw images of five different breeds and we have generated 9306 images for the training dataset and 388 images for the testing dataset to validate the model using augmentation. We have applied four transfer learning models in this research, which are Inception V3, ResNet50, Xception, and VGG16. Among these four models, VGG16 achieved the highest accuracy of 99%, which is an excellent outcome. Breed detection of a rose by using transfer learning methods is the first work on breed detection of a particular flower that is publicly available according to the study.

- **Summary**: Face morphing attack detection is emerging as an increasingly challenging problem owing to advancements in high-quality and realistic morphing attack generation. Reliable detection of morphing attacks is essential because these attacks are targeted for border control applications. This paper presents a multispectral framework for differential morphing-attack detection (D-MAD). The D-MAD methods are based on using two facial images that are captured from the ePassport (also called the reference image) and the trusted device (for example, Automatic Border Control (ABC) gates) to detect whether the face image presented in ePassport is morphed. The proposed multispectral D-MAD framework introduce a multispectral image captured as a trusted capture to capture seven different spectral bands to detect morphing attacks. Extensive experiments were conducted on the newly created datasets with 143 unique data subjects that were captured using both visible and multispectral cameras in multiple sessions. The results indicate the superior performance of the proposed multispectral framework compared to visible images.

- **Summary**: Carrot is a famous nutritional vegetable and developed all over the world. Different diseases of Carrot has become a massive issue in the carrot production circle which leads to a tremendous effect on the economic growth in the agricultural sector. An automatic carrot disease detection system can help to identify malicious carrots and can provide a guide to cure carrot disease in an earlier stage, resulting in a less economical loss in the carrot production system. The proposed research study has developed a web application Carrot Cure based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which can identify a defective carrot and provide a proper curative solution. Images of carrots affected by cavity spot and leaf bright as well as healthy images were collected. Further, this research work has employed Convolutional Neural Network to include birth neural purposes and a Fully Convolutional Neural Network model (FCNN) for infection order. Different avenues regarding different convolutional models with colorful layers are explored and the proposed Convolutional model has achieved the perfection of 99.8%, which will be useful for the drovers to distinguish carrot illness and boost their advantage.

- **Summary**: This work explores the use of 3D generative models to synthesize training data for 3D vision tasks. The key requirements of the generative models are that the generated data should be photorealistic to match the real-world scenarios, and the corresponding 3D attributes should be aligned with given sampling labels. However, we find that the recent NeRF-based 3D GANs hardly meet the above requirements due to their designed generation pipeline and the lack of explicit 3D supervision. In this work, we propose Lift3D, an inverted 2D-to-3D generation framework to achieve the data generation objectives. Lift3D has several merits compared to prior methods: (1) Unlike previous 3D GANs that the output resolution is fixed after training, Lift3D can generalize to any camera intrinsic with higher resolution and photorealistic output. (2) By lifting well-disentangled 2D GAN to 3D object NeRF, Lift3D provides explicit 3D information of generated objects, thus offering accurate 3D annotations for downstream tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework by augmenting autonomous driving datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our data generation framework can effectively improve the performance of 3D object detectors. Project page: https://len-li.github.io/lift3d-web.



### Graph-Guided MLP-Mixer for Skeleton-Based Human Motion Prediction

- **Summary**: In recent years, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely used in human motion prediction, but their performance remains unsatisfactory. Recently, MLP-Mixer, initially developed for vision tasks, has been leveraged into human motion prediction as a promising alternative to GCNs, which achieves both better performance and better efficiency than GCNs. Unlike GCNs, which can explicitly capture human skeleton's bone-joint structure by representing it as a graph with edges and nodes, MLP-Mixer relies on fully connected layers and thus cannot explicitly model such graph-like structure of human's. To break this limitation of MLP-Mixer's, we propose \textit{Graph-Guided Mixer}, a novel approach that equips the original MLP-Mixer architecture with the capability to model graph structure. By incorporating graph guidance, our \textit{Graph-Guided Mixer} can effectively capture and utilize the specific connectivity patterns within human skeleton's graph representation. In this paper, first we uncover a theoretical connection between MLP-Mixer and GCN that is unexplored in existing research. Building on this theoretical connection, next we present our proposed \textit{Graph-Guided Mixer}, explaining how the original MLP-Mixer architecture is reinvented to incorporate guidance from graph structure. Then we conduct an extensive evaluation on the Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW datasets, which shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models can help in diagnosing COVID-19 from lung CT scans and X-ray images; however, these models require large amounts of data for training and validation. Many researchers studied Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for producing synthetic lung CT scans and X-Ray images to improve the performance of AI-based models. It is not well explored how good GAN-based methods performed to generate reliable synthetic data. This work analyzes 43 published studies that reported GANs for synthetic data generation. Many of these studies suffered data bias, lack of reproducibility, and lack of feedback from the radiologists or other domain experts. A common issue in these studies is the unavailability of the source code, hindering reproducibility. The included studies reported rescaling of the input images to train the existing GANs architecture without providing clinical insights on how the rescaling was motivated. Finally, even though GAN-based methods have the potential for data augmentation and improving the training of AI-based models, these methods fall short in terms of their use in clinical practice. This paper highlights research hotspots in countering the data scarcity problem, identifies various issues as well as potentials, and provides recommendations to guide future research. These recommendations might be useful to improve acceptability for the GAN-based approaches for data augmentation as GANs for data augmentation are increasingly becoming popular in the AI and medical imaging research community.

- **Summary**: Pathological image analysis is an important process for detecting abnormalities such as cancer from cell images. However, since the image size is generally very large, the cost of providing detailed annotations is high, which makes it difficult to apply machine learning techniques. One way to improve the performance of identifying abnormalities while keeping the annotation cost low is to use only labels for each slide, or to use information from another dataset that has already been labeled. However, such weak supervisory information often does not provide sufficient performance. In this paper, we proposed a new task setting to improve the classification performance of the target dataset without increasing annotation costs. And to solve this problem, we propose a pipeline that uses multiple instance learning (MIL) and domain adaptation (DA) methods. Furthermore, in order to combine the supervisory information of both methods effectively, we propose a method to create pseudo-labels with high confidence. We conducted experiments on the pathological image dataset we created for this study and showed that the proposed method significantly improves the classification performance compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Most of the existing blind image Super-Resolution (SR) methods assume that the blur kernels are space-invariant. However, the blur involved in real applications are usually space-variant due to object motion, out-of-focus, etc., resulting in severe performance drop of the advanced SR methods. To address this problem, we firstly introduce two new datasets with out-of-focus blur, i.e., NYUv2-BSR and Cityscapes-BSR, to support further researches of blind SR with space-variant blur. Based on the datasets, we design a novel Cross-MOdal fuSion network (CMOS) that estimate both blur and semantics simultaneously, which leads to improved SR results. It involves a feature Grouping Interactive Attention (GIA) module to make the two modalities interact more effectively and avoid inconsistency. GIA can also be used for the interaction of other features because of the universality of its structure. Qualitative and quantitative experiments compared with state-of-the-art methods on above datasets and real-world images demonstrate the superiority of our method, e.g., obtaining PSNR/SSIM by +1.91/+0.0048 on NYUv2-BSR than MANet.

- **Summary**: In this study, a novel active solubility sensing device using computer vision is proposed to improve separation purification performance and prevent malfunctions of separation equipment such as preparative liquid chromatographers and evaporators. The proposed device actively measures the solubility by transmitting a solution using a background image. The proposed system is a combination of a device that uses a background image and a method for estimating the dissolution and particle presence by changing the background image. The proposed device consists of four parts: camera, display, adjustment, and server units. The camera unit is made up of a rear image sensor on a mobile phone. The display unit is comprised of a tablet screen. The adjustment unit is composed of rotating and height-adjustment jigs. Finally, the server unit consists of a socket server for communication between the units and a PC, including an automated solubility analysis system implemented in Python. The dissolution status of the solution was divided into four categories and a case study was conducted. The algorithms were trained based on these results. Six organic materials and four organic solvents were combined with 202 tests to train the developed algorithm. As a result, the evaluation rate for the dissolution state exhibited an accuracy of 95 %. In addition, the device and method must develop a feedback function that can add a solvent or solute after dissolution detection using solubility results for use in autonomous systems, such as a synthetic automation system. Finally, the diversification of the sensing method is expected to extend not only to the solution but also to the solubility and homogeneity analysis of the film.

- **Summary**: Due to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging characteristics, SAR vehicle recognition faces the problem of extracting discriminative and robust target features from a small dataset. Deep learning has shown impressive performance on the MSTAR dataset. However, data bias in a small dataset, such as background correlation, impairs the causality of these methods, i.e., discriminative features contain target and background differences. Moreover, different operating conditions of SAR lead to target signatures and background clutter variations in imaging results. However, many deep learning-based methods only verify robustness to target or background variations in the current experimental setting. In this paper, we propose a novel domain alignment framework named Hierarchical Disentanglement-Alignment Network (HDANet) to enhance features' causality and robustness. Concisely, HDANet consists of three parts: The first part uses data augmentation to generate signature variations for domain alignment. The second part disentangles the target features through a multitask-assisted mask to prevent non-causal clutter from interfering with subsequent alignment and recognition. Thirdly, a contrastive loss is employed for domain alignment to extract robust target features, and the SimSiam structure is applied to mitigate conflicts between contrastive loss and feature discrimination. Finally, the proposed method shows high robustness across MSTAR's multiple target, sensor, and environment variants. Noteworthy, we add a new scene variant to verify the robustness to target and background variations. Moreover, the saliency map and Shapley value qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate causality. Our code is available in \url{https://github.com/waterdisappear/SAR-ATR-HDANet}.

- **Summary**: Dental template and parametric dental models are important tools for various applications in digital dentistry. However, constructing an unbiased dental template and accurate parametric dental models remains a challenging task due to the complex anatomical and morphological dental structures and also low volume ratio of the teeth. In this study, we develop an unbiased dental template by constructing an accurate dental atlas from CBCT images with guidance of teeth segmentation. First, to address the challenges, we propose to enhance the CBCT images and their segmentation images, including image cropping, image masking and segmentation intensity reassigning. Then, we further use the segmentation images to perform co-registration with the CBCT images to generate an accurate dental atlas, from which an unbiased dental template can be generated. By leveraging the unbiased dental template, we construct parametric dental models by estimating point-to-point correspondences between the dental models and employing Principal Component Analysis to determine shape subspaces of the parametric dental models. A total of 159 CBCT images of real subjects are collected to perform the constructions. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed method in constructing unbiased dental template and parametric dental model. The developed dental template and parametric dental models are available at https://github.com/Marvin0724/Teeth_template.



### DualRefine: Self-Supervised Depth and Pose Estimation Through Iterative Epipolar Sampling and Refinement Toward Equilibrium

- **Summary**: Self-supervised multi-frame depth estimation achieves high accuracy by computing matching costs of pixel correspondences between adjacent frames, injecting geometric information into the network. These pixel-correspondence candidates are computed based on the relative pose estimates between the frames. Accurate pose predictions are essential for precise matching cost computation as they influence the epipolar geometry. Furthermore, improved depth estimates can, in turn, be used to align pose estimates.   Inspired by traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) principles, we propose the DualRefine model, which tightly couples depth and pose estimation through a feedback loop. Our novel update pipeline uses a deep equilibrium model framework to iteratively refine depth estimates and a hidden state of feature maps by computing local matching costs based on epipolar geometry. Importantly, we used the refined depth estimates and feature maps to compute pose updates at each step. This update in the pose estimates slowly alters the epipolar geometry during the refinement process. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate competitive depth prediction and odometry prediction performance surpassing published self-supervised baselines.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in the field of imaging and vision. Supervised deep learning for segmentation has achieved unparalleled success when sufficient training data with annotated labels are available. However, annotation is known to be expensive to obtain, especially for histopathology images where the target regions are usually with high morphology variations and irregular shapes. Thus, weakly supervised learning with sparse annotations of points is promising to reduce the annotation workload. In this work, we propose a contrast-based variational model to generate segmentation results, which serve as reliable complementary supervision to train a deep segmentation model for histopathology images. The proposed method considers the common characteristics of target regions in histopathology images and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. It can generate more regionally consistent and smoother boundary segmentation, and is more robust to unlabeled `novel' regions. Experiments on two different histology datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to previous models.

- **Summary**: Pretraining on large-scale datasets can boost the performance of object detectors while the annotated datasets for object detection are hard to scale up due to the high labor cost. What we possess are numerous isolated filed-specific datasets, thus, it is appealing to jointly pretrain models across aggregation of datasets to enhance data volume and diversity. In this paper, we propose a strong framework for utilizing Multiple datasets to pretrain DETR-like detectors, termed METR, without the need for manual label spaces integration. It converts the typical multi-classification in object detection into binary classification by introducing a pre-trained language model. Specifically, we design a category extraction module for extracting potential categories involved in an image and assign these categories into different queries by language embeddings. Each query is only responsible for predicting a class-specific object. Besides, to adapt our novel detection paradigm, we propose a group bipartite matching strategy that limits the ground truths to match queries assigned to the same category. Extensive experiments demonstrate that METR achieves extraordinary results on either multi-task joint training or the pretrain & finetune paradigm. Notably, our pre-trained models have high flexible transferability and increase the performance upon various DETR-like detectors on COCO val2017 benchmark. Codes will be available after this paper is published.

- **Summary**: Exploring the expected quantizing scheme with suitable mixed-precision policy is the key point to compress deep neural networks (DNNs) in high efficiency and accuracy. This exploration implies heavy workloads for domain experts, and an automatic compression method is needed. However, the huge search space of the automatic method introduces plenty of computing budgets that make the automatic process challenging to be applied in real scenarios. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework named AutoQNN, for automatically quantizing different layers utilizing different schemes and bitwidths without any human labor. AutoQNN can seek desirable quantizing schemes and mixed-precision policies for mainstream DNN models efficiently by involving three techniques: quantizing scheme search (QSS), quantizing precision learning (QPL), and quantized architecture generation (QAG). QSS introduces five quantizing schemes and defines three new schemes as a candidate set for scheme search, and then uses the differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) algorithm to seek the layer- or model-desired scheme from the set. QPL is the first method to learn mixed-precision policies by reparameterizing the bitwidths of quantizing schemes, to the best of our knowledge. QPL optimizes both classification loss and precision loss of DNNs efficiently and obtains the relatively optimal mixed-precision model within limited model size and memory footprint. QAG is designed to convert arbitrary architectures into corresponding quantized ones without manual intervention, to facilitate end-to-end neural network quantization. We have implemented AutoQNN and integrated it into Keras. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoQNN can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantization.

Using synthetic data has been proven in prior research to be a viable means of training neural networks and saves hours of manual labour due to the reduced need for manual image annotation. Machine vision for pallet detection can benefit from synthetic data as the industry increases the development of autonomous warehousing technologies. As per our methodology, we developed a tool capable of automatically generating large amounts of annotated training data from 3D models at pixel-perfect accuracy and a much faster rate than manual approaches. Regarding image segmentation, a Mask R-CNN pipeline was used, which achieved an AP50 of 86% for individual pallets.

- **Summary**: Image keypoints and descriptors play a crucial role in many visual measurement tasks. In recent years, deep neural networks have been widely used to improve the performance of keypoint and descriptor extraction. However, the conventional convolution operations do not provide the geometric invariance required for the descriptor. To address this issue, we propose the Sparse Deformable Descriptor Head (SDDH), which learns the deformable positions of supporting features for each keypoint and constructs deformable descriptors. Furthermore, SDDH extracts descriptors at sparse keypoints instead of a dense descriptor map, which enables efficient extraction of descriptors with strong expressiveness. In addition, we relax the neural reprojection error (NRE) loss from dense to sparse to train the extracted sparse descriptors. Experimental results show that the proposed network is both efficient and powerful in various visual measurement tasks, including image matching, 3D reconstruction, and visual relocalization.

- **Summary**: Smart farming is a growing field as technology advances. Plant characteristics are crucial indicators for monitoring plant growth. Research has been done to estimate characteristics like leaf area index, leaf disease, and plant height. However, few methods have been applied to non-destructive measurements of leaf size. In this paper, an automated non-destructive imaged-based measuring system is presented, which uses 2D and 3D data obtained using a Zivid 3D camera, creating 3D virtual representations (digital twins) of the tomato plants. Leaves are detected from corresponding 2D RGB images and mapped to their 3D point cloud using the detected leaf masks, which then pass the leaf point cloud to the plane fitting algorithm to extract the leaf size to provide data for growth monitoring. The performance of the measurement platform has been measured through a comprehensive trial on real-world tomato plants with quantified performance metrics compared to ground truth measurements. Three tomato leaf and height datasets (including 50+ 3D point cloud files of tomato plants) were collected and open-sourced in this project. The proposed leaf size estimation method demonstrates an RMSE value of 4.47mm and an R^2 value of 0.87. The overall measurement system (leaf detection and size estimation algorithms combine) delivers an RMSE value of 8.13mm and an R^2 value of 0.899.

- **Summary**: Active Object Tracking (AOT) aims to maintain a specific relation between the tracker and object(s) by autonomously controlling the motion system of a tracker given observations. AOT has wide-ranging applications, such as in mobile robots and autonomous driving. However, building a generalizable active tracker that works robustly across different scenarios remains a challenge, especially in unstructured environments with cluttered obstacles and diverse layouts. We argue that constructing a state representation capable of modeling the geometry structure of the surroundings and the dynamics of the target is crucial for achieving this goal. To address this challenge, we present RSPT, a framework that forms a structure-aware motion representation by Reconstructing the Surroundings and Predicting the target Trajectory. Additionally, we enhance the generalization of the policy network by training in an asymmetric dueling mechanism. We evaluate RSPT on various simulated scenarios and show that it outperforms existing methods in unseen environments, particularly those with complex obstacles and layouts. We also demonstrate the successful transfer of RSPT to real-world settings. Project Website: https://sites.google.com/view/aot-rspt.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have captured worldwide attention. Tools such as Dalle-2 and ChatGPT suggest that tasks previously thought to be beyond the capabilities of AI may now augment the productivity of creative media in various new ways, including through the generation of synthetic video. This research paper explores the utility of using AI-generated synthetic video to create viable educational content for online educational settings. To date, there is limited research investigating the real-world educational value of AI-generated synthetic media. To address this gap, we examined the impact of using AI-generated synthetic video in an online learning platform on both learners content acquisition and learning experience. We took a mixed-method approach, randomly assigning adult learners (n=83) into one of two micro-learning conditions, collecting pre- and post-learning assessments, and surveying participants on their learning experience. The control condition included a traditionally produced instructor video, while the experimental condition included a synthetic video with a realistic AI-generated character. The results show that learners in both conditions demonstrated significant improvement from pre- to post-learning (p<.001), with no significant differences in gains between the two conditions (p=.80). In addition, no differences were observed in how learners perceived the traditional and synthetic videos. These findings suggest that AI-generated synthetic learning videos have the potential to be a viable substitute for videos produced via traditional methods in online educational settings, making high quality educational content more accessible across the globe.

- **Summary**: The standard class-incremental continual learning setting assumes a set of tasks seen one after the other in a fixed and predefined order. This is not very realistic in federated learning environments where each client works independently in an asynchronous manner getting data for the different tasks in time-frames and orders totally uncorrelated with the other ones. We introduce a novel federated learning setting (AFCL) where the continual learning of multiple tasks happens at each client with different orderings and in asynchronous time slots. We tackle this novel task using prototype-based learning, a representation loss, fractal pre-training, and a modified aggregation policy. Our approach, called FedSpace, effectively tackles this task as shown by the results on the CIFAR-100 dataset using 3 different federated splits with 50, 100, and 500 clients, respectively. The code and federated splits are available at https://github.com/LTTM/FedSpace.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: 3D interacting hand pose estimation from a single RGB image is a challenging task, due to serious self-occlusion and inter-occlusion towards hands, confusing similar appearance patterns between 2 hands, ill-posed joint position mapping from 2D to 3D, etc.. To address these, we propose to extend A2J-the state-of-the-art depth-based 3D single hand pose estimation method-to RGB domain under interacting hand condition. Our key idea is to equip A2J with strong local-global aware ability to well capture interacting hands' local fine details and global articulated clues among joints jointly. To this end, A2J is evolved under Transformer's non-local encoding-decoding framework to build A2J-Transformer. It holds 3 main advantages over A2J. First, self-attention across local anchor points is built to make them global spatial context aware to better capture joints' articulation clues for resisting occlusion. Secondly, each anchor point is regarded as learnable query with adaptive feature learning for facilitating pattern fitting capacity, instead of having the same local representation with the others. Last but not least, anchor point locates in 3D space instead of 2D as in A2J, to leverage 3D pose prediction. Experiments on challenging InterHand 2.6M demonstrate that, A2J-Transformer can achieve state-of-the-art model-free performance (3.38mm MPJPE advancement in 2-hand case) and can also be applied to depth domain with strong generalization.

- **Summary**: As bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation is simple-to-visualize and easy-to-handle, it has been applied in autonomous driving to provide the surrounding information to downstream tasks. Inferring BEV semantic segmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images is a popular scheme in the community as cheap devices and real-time processing. The recent work implemented this task by learning the content and position relationship via the vision Transformer (ViT). However, the quadratic complexity of ViT confines the relationship learning only in the latent layer, leaving the scale gap to impede the representation of fine-grained objects. And their plain fusion method of multi-view features does not conform to the information absorption intention in representing BEV features. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel cross-scale hierarchical Transformer with correspondence-augmented attention for semantic segmentation inferring. Specifically, we devise a hierarchical framework to refine the BEV feature representation, where the last size is only half of the final segmentation. To save the computation increase caused by this hierarchical framework, we exploit the cross-scale Transformer to learn feature relationships in a reversed-aligning way, and leverage the residual connection of BEV features to facilitate information transmission between scales. We propose correspondence-augmented attention to distinguish conducive and inconducive correspondences. It is implemented in a simple yet effective way, amplifying attention scores before the Softmax operation, so that the position-view-related and the position-view-disrelated attention scores are highlighted and suppressed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has state-of-the-art performance in inferring BEV semantic segmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images.

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework for probing and improving relational, compositional and contextual understanding of large visual-language models (V+L). While large V+L models have achieved success in various downstream tasks, it is not clear if they have a conceptual grasp of the content. We propose a novel benchmarking dataset for probing three aspects of content understanding. Our probes are grounded in cognitive science and help determine if a V+L model can, for example, determine if snow garnished with a man is implausible, or if it can identify beach furniture by knowing it is located on a beach. We have experimented with 5 well known models, such as CLIP and ViLT, and found that they mostly fail to demonstrate a conceptual understanding. That said, we find interesting insights such as cross-attention helps learning conceptual understanding. We use these insights to propose a new finetuning technique that rewards the three conceptual understanding measures we proposed. We hope that the presented benchmarks will help the community assess and improve the conceptual understanding capabilities of large V+L models.

- **Summary**: Product Retrieval (PR) and Grounding (PG), aiming to seek image and object-level products respectively according to a textual query, have attracted great interest recently for better shopping experience. Owing to the lack of relevant datasets, we collect two large-scale benchmark datasets from Taobao Mall and Live domains with about 474k and 101k image-query pairs for PR, and manually annotate the object bounding boxes in each image for PG. As annotating boxes is expensive and time-consuming, we attempt to transfer knowledge from annotated domain to unannotated for PG to achieve un-supervised Domain Adaptation (PG-DA). We propose a {\bf D}omain {\bf A}daptive Produc{\bf t} S{\bf e}eker ({\bf DATE}) framework, regarding PR and PG as Product Seeking problem at different levels, to assist the query {\bf date} the product. Concretely, we first design a semantics-aggregated feature extractor for each modality to obtain concentrated and comprehensive features for following efficient retrieval and fine-grained grounding tasks. Then, we present two cooperative seekers to simultaneously search the image for PR and localize the product for PG. Besides, we devise a domain aligner for PG-DA to alleviate uni-modal marginal and multi-modal conditional distribution shift between source and target domains, and design a pseudo box generator to dynamically select reliable instances and generate bounding boxes for further knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments show that our DATE achieves satisfactory performance in fully-supervised PR, PG and un-supervised PG-DA. Our desensitized datasets will be publicly available here\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Taobao-live/Product-Seeking}}.

- **Summary**: Generative modelling over continuous-time geometric constructs, a.k.a such as handwriting, sketches, drawings etc., have been accomplished through autoregressive distributions. Such strictly-ordered discrete factorization however falls short of capturing key properties of chirographic data -- it fails to build holistic understanding of the temporal concept due to one-way visibility (causality). Consequently, temporal data has been modelled as discrete token sequences of fixed sampling rate instead of capturing the true underlying concept. In this paper, we introduce a powerful model-class namely "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" or DDPMs for chirographic data that specifically addresses these flaws. Our model named "ChiroDiff", being non-autoregressive, learns to capture holistic concepts and therefore remains resilient to higher temporal sampling rate up to a good extent. Moreover, we show that many important downstream utilities (e.g. conditional sampling, creative mixing) can be flexibly implemented using ChiroDiff. We further show some unique use-cases like stochastic vectorization, de-noising/healing, abstraction are also possible with this model-class. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our framework on relevant datasets and found it to be better or on par with competing approaches.

- **Summary**: Image captioning models are known to perpetuate and amplify harmful societal bias in the training set. In this work, we aim to mitigate such gender bias in image captioning models. While prior work has addressed this problem by forcing models to focus on people to reduce gender misclassification, it conversely generates gender-stereotypical words at the expense of predicting the correct gender. From this observation, we hypothesize that there are two types of gender bias affecting image captioning models: 1) bias that exploits context to predict gender, and 2) bias in the probability of generating certain (often stereotypical) words because of gender. To mitigate both types of gender biases, we propose a framework, called LIBRA, that learns from synthetically biased samples to decrease both types of biases, correcting gender misclassification and changing gender-stereotypical words to more neutral ones.

- **Summary**: Our work focuses on the Multi-Object Navigation (MultiON) task, where an agent needs to navigate to multiple objects in a given sequence. We systematically investigate the inherent modularity of this task by dividing our approach to contain four modules: (a) an object detection module trained to identify objects from RGB images, (b) a map building module to build a semantic map of the observed objects, (c) an exploration module enabling the agent to explore its surroundings, and finally (d) a navigation module to move to identified target objects. We focus on the navigation and the exploration modules in this work. We show that we can effectively leverage a PointGoal navigation model in the MultiON task instead of learning to navigate from scratch. Our experiments show that a PointGoal agent-based navigation module outperforms analytical path planning on the MultiON task. We also compare exploration strategies and surprisingly find that a random exploration strategy significantly outperforms more advanced exploration methods. We additionally create MultiON 2.0, a new large-scale dataset as a test-bed for our approach.

- **Summary**: The rapid evolvement of deepfake creation technologies is seriously threating media information trustworthiness. The consequences impacting targeted individuals and institutions can be dire. In this work, we study the evolutions of deep learning architectures, particularly CNNs and Transformers. We identified eight promising deep learning architectures, designed and developed our deepfake detection models and conducted experiments over well-established deepfake datasets. These datasets included the latest second and third generation deepfake datasets. We evaluated the effectiveness of our developed single model detectors in deepfake detection and cross datasets evaluations. We achieved 88.74%, 99.53%, 97.68%, 99.73% and 92.02% accuracy and 99.95%, 100%, 99.88%, 99.99% and 97.61% AUC, in the detection of FF++ 2020, Google DFD, Celeb-DF, Deeper Forensics and DFDC deepfakes, respectively. We also identified and showed the unique strengths of CNNs and Transformers models and analysed the observed relationships among the different deepfake datasets, to aid future developments in this area.

- **Summary**: Efficient automatic segmentation of multi-level (i.e. main and branch) pulmonary arteries (PA) in CTPA images plays a significant role in clinical applications. However, most existing methods concentrate only on main PA or branch PA segmentation separately and ignore segmentation efficiency. Besides, there is no public large-scale dataset focused on PA segmentation, which makes it highly challenging to compare the different methods. To benchmark multi-level PA segmentation algorithms, we organized the first \textbf{P}ulmonary \textbf{AR}tery \textbf{SE}gmentation (PARSE) challenge. On the one hand, we focus on both the main PA and the branch PA segmentation. On the other hand, for better clinical application, we assign the same score weight to segmentation efficiency (mainly running time and GPU memory consumption during inference) while ensuring PA segmentation accuracy. We present a summary of the top algorithms and offer some suggestions for efficient and accurate multi-level PA automatic segmentation. We provide the PARSE challenge as open-access for the community to benchmark future algorithm developments at \url{https://parse2022.grand-challenge.org/Parse2022/}.

- **Summary**: Single domain generalization aims to learn a model from a single training domain (source domain) and apply it to multiple unseen test domains (target domains). Existing methods focus on expanding the distribution of the training domain to cover the target domains, but without estimating the domain shift between the source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a new learning paradigm, namely simulate-analyze-reduce, which first simulates the domain shift by building an auxiliary domain as the target domain, then learns to analyze the causes of domain shift, and finally learns to reduce the domain shift for model adaptation. Under this paradigm, we propose a meta-causal learning method to learn meta-knowledge, that is, how to infer the causes of domain shift between the auxiliary and source domains during training. We use the meta-knowledge to analyze the shift between the target and source domains during testing. Specifically, we perform multiple transformations on source data to generate the auxiliary domain, perform counterfactual inference to learn to discover the causal factors of the shift between the auxiliary and source domains, and incorporate the inferred causality into factor-aware domain alignments. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks of image classification show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: When a camera travels across a 3D world, only a fraction of pixel value changes; an event-based camera observes the change as sparse events. How can we utilize sparse events for efficient recovery of the camera pose? We show that we can recover the camera pose by minimizing the error between sparse events and the temporal gradient of the scene represented as a neural radiance field (NeRF). To enable the computation of the temporal gradient of the scene, we augment NeRF's camera pose as a time function. When the input pose to the NeRF coincides with the actual pose, the output of the temporal gradient of NeRF equals the observed intensity changes on the event's points. Using this principle, we propose an event-based camera pose tracking framework called TeGRA which realizes the pose update by using the sparse event's observation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first camera pose estimation algorithm using the scene's implicit representation and the sparse intensity change from events.

- **Summary**: Recently, contrastive learning approaches (e.g., CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)) have received huge success in multimodal learning, where the model tries to minimize the distance between the representations of different views (e.g., image and its caption) of the same data point while keeping the representations of different data points away from each other. However, from a theoretical perspective, it is unclear how contrastive learning can learn the representations from different views efficiently, especially when the data is not isotropic. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of a simple multimodal contrastive learning model and show that contrastive pairs are important for the model to efficiently balance the learned representations. In particular, we show that the positive pairs will drive the model to align the representations at the cost of increasing the condition number, while the negative pairs will reduce the condition number, keeping the learned representations balanced.

- **Summary**: Structural health monitoring (SHM) tasks like damage detection are crucial for decision-making regarding maintenance and deterioration. For example, crack detection in SHM is crucial for bridge maintenance as crack progression can lead to structural instability. However, most AI/ML models in the literature have low latency and late inference time issues while performing in real-time environments. This study aims to explore the integration of edge-AI in the SHM domain for real-time bridge inspections. Based on edge-AI literature, its capabilities will be valuable integration for a real-time decision support system in SHM tasks such that real-time inferences can be performed on physical sites. This study will utilize commercial edge-AI platforms, such as Google Coral Dev Board or Kneron KL520, to develop and analyze the effectiveness of edge-AI devices. Thus, this study proposes an edge AI framework for the structural health monitoring domain. An edge-AI-compatible deep learning model is developed to validate the framework to perform real-time crack classification. The effectiveness of this model will be evaluated based on its accuracy, the confusion matrix generated, and the inference time observed in a real-time setting.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in detecting arbitrary objects in the real world are trained and evaluated on object detection datasets with a relatively restricted vocabulary. To facilitate the development of more general visual object detection, we propose V3Det, a vast vocabulary visual detection dataset with precisely annotated bounding boxes on massive images. V3Det has several appealing properties: 1) Vast Vocabulary: It contains bounding boxes of objects from 13,029 categories on real-world images, which is 10 times larger than the existing large vocabulary object detection dataset, e.g., LVIS. 2) Hierarchical Category Organization: The vast vocabulary of V3Det is organized by a hierarchical category tree which annotates the inclusion relationship among categories, encouraging the exploration of category relationships in vast and open vocabulary object detection. 3) Rich Annotations: V3Det comprises precisely annotated objects in 245k images and professional descriptions of each category written by human experts and a powerful chatbot. By offering a vast exploration space, V3Det enables extensive benchmarks on both vast and open vocabulary object detection, leading to new observations, practices, and insights for future research. It has the potential to serve as a cornerstone dataset for developing more general visual perception systems.

- **Summary**: Causal Video Question Answering (CVidQA) queries not only association or temporal relations but also causal relations in a video. Existing question synthesis methods pre-trained question generation (QG) systems on reading comprehension datasets with text descriptions as inputs. However, QG models only learn to ask association questions (e.g., ``what is someone doing...'') and result in inferior performance due to the poor transfer of association knowledge to CVidQA, which focuses on causal questions like ``why is someone doing ...''. Observing this, we proposed to exploit causal knowledge to generate question-answer pairs, and proposed a novel framework, Causal Knowledge Extraction from Language Models (CaKE-LM), leveraging causal commonsense knowledge from language models to tackle CVidQA. To extract knowledge from LMs, CaKE-LM generates causal questions containing two events with one triggering another (e.g., ``score a goal'' triggers ``soccer player kicking ball'') by prompting LM with the action (soccer player kicking ball) to retrieve the intention (to score a goal). CaKE-LM significantly outperforms conventional methods by 4% to 6% of zero-shot CVidQA accuracy on NExT-QA and Causal-VidQA datasets. We also conduct comprehensive analyses and provide key findings for future research.

- **Summary**: Anatomically consistent field-of-view (FOV) completion to recover truncated body sections has important applications in quantitative analyses of computed tomography (CT) with limited FOV. Existing solution based on conditional generative models relies on the fidelity of synthetic truncation patterns at training phase, which poses limitations for the generalizability of the method to potential unknown types of truncation. In this study, we evaluate a zero-shot method based on a pretrained unconditional generative diffusion prior, where truncation pattern with arbitrary forms can be specified at inference phase. In evaluation on simulated chest CT slices with synthetic FOV truncation, the method is capable of recovering anatomically consistent body sections and subcutaneous adipose tissue measurement error caused by FOV truncation. However, the correction accuracy is inferior to the conditionally trained counterpart.

- **Summary**: Removing clutter from scenes is essential in many applications, ranging from privacy-concerned content filtering to data augmentation. In this work, we present an automatic system that removes clutter from 3D scenes and inpaints with coherent geometry and texture. We propose techniques for its two key components: 3D segmentation from shared properties and 3D inpainting, both of which are important porblems. The definition of 3D scene clutter (frequently-moving objects) is not well captured by commonly-studied object categories in computer vision. To tackle the lack of well-defined clutter annotations, we group noisy fine-grained labels, leverage virtual rendering, and impose an instance-level area-sensitive loss. Once clutter is removed, we inpaint geometry and texture in the resulting holes by merging inpainted RGB-D images. This requires novel voting and pruning strategies that guarantee multi-view consistency across individually inpainted images for mesh reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNet and Matterport dataset show that our method outperforms baselines for clutter segmentation and 3D inpainting, both visually and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the well-known image quality assessment problem but in contrast from existing approaches that predict image quality independently for every images, we propose to jointly model different images depicting the same content to improve the precision of quality estimation. This proposal is motivated by the idea that multiple distorted images can provide information to disambiguate image features related to content and quality. To this aim, we combine the feature representations from the different images to estimate a pseudo-reference that we use to enhance score prediction. Our experiments show that at test-time, our method successfully combines the features from multiple images depicting the same new content, improving estimation quality.

- **Summary**: Humans, even at a very early age, can learn visual concepts and understand geometry and layout through active interaction with the environment, and generalize their compositions to complete tasks described by natural languages in novel scenes. To mimic such capability, we propose Embodied Concept Learner (ECL) in an interactive 3D environment. Specifically, a robot agent can ground visual concepts, build semantic maps and plan actions to complete tasks by learning purely from human demonstrations and language instructions, without access to ground-truth semantic and depth supervisions from simulations. ECL consists of: (i) an instruction parser that translates the natural languages into executable programs; (ii) an embodied concept learner that grounds visual concepts based on language descriptions; (iii) a map constructor that estimates depth and constructs semantic maps by leveraging the learned concepts; and (iv) a program executor with deterministic policies to execute each program. ECL has several appealing benefits thanks to its modularized design. Firstly, it enables the robotic agent to learn semantics and depth unsupervisedly acting like babies, e.g., ground concepts through active interaction and perceive depth by disparities when moving forward. Secondly, ECL is fully transparent and step-by-step interpretable in long-term planning. Thirdly, ECL could be beneficial for the embodied instruction following (EIF), outperforming previous works on the ALFRED benchmark when the semantic label is not provided. Also, the learned concept can be reused for other downstream tasks, such as reasoning of object states. Project page: http://ecl.csail.mit.edu/

- **Summary**: Human visual recognition is a sparse process, where only a few salient visual cues are attended to rather than traversing every detail uniformly. However, most current vision networks follow a dense paradigm, processing every single visual unit (e.g,, pixel or patch) in a uniform manner. In this paper, we challenge this dense paradigm and present a new method, coined SparseFormer, to imitate human's sparse visual recognition in an end-to-end manner. SparseFormer learns to represent images using a highly limited number of tokens (down to 49) in the latent space with sparse feature sampling procedure instead of processing dense units in the original pixel space. Therefore, SparseFormer circumvents most of dense operations on the image space and has much lower computational costs. Experiments on the ImageNet classification benchmark dataset show that SparseFormer achieves performance on par with canonical or well-established models while offering better accuracy-throughput tradeoff. Moreover, the design of our network can be easily extended to the video classification with promising performance at lower computational costs. We hope that our work can provide an alternative way for visual modeling and inspire further research on sparse neural architectures. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/showlab/sparseformer

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a practical solution to implement privacy-preserving CNN training based on mere Homomorphic Encryption (HE) technique. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt successfully to crack this nut and no work ever before has achieved this goal. Several techniques combine to accomplish the task:: (1) with transfer learning, privacy-preserving CNN training can be reduced to homomorphic neural network training, or even multiclass logistic regression (MLR) training; (2) via a faster gradient variant called $\texttt{Quadratic Gradient}$, an enhanced gradient method for MLR with a state-of-the-art performance in convergence speed is applied in this work to achieve high performance; (3) we employ the thought of transformation in mathematics to transform approximating Softmax function in the encryption domain to the approximation of the Sigmoid function. A new type of loss function termed $\texttt{Squared Likelihood Error}$ has been developed alongside to align with this change.; and (4) we use a simple but flexible matrix-encoding method named $\texttt{Volley Revolver}$ to manage the data flow in the ciphertexts, which is the key factor to complete the whole homomorphic CNN training. The complete, runnable C++ code to implement our work can be found at: \href{https://github.com/petitioner/HE.CNNtraining}{$\texttt{https://github.com/petitioner/HE.CNNtraining}$}. We select $\texttt{REGNET\_X\_400MF}$ as our pre-trained model for transfer learning. We use the first 128 MNIST training images as training data and the whole MNIST testing dataset as the testing data. The client only needs to upload 6 ciphertexts to the cloud and it takes $\sim 21$ mins to perform 2 iterations on a cloud with 64 vCPUs, resulting in a precision of $21.49\%$.

- **Summary**: Accurate and reliable optical remote sensing image-based small-ship detection is crucial for maritime surveillance systems, but existing methods often struggle with balancing detection performance and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight framework called \textit{HSI-ShipDetectionNet} that is based on high-order spatial interactions and is suitable for deployment on resource-limited platforms, such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. HSI-ShipDetectionNet includes a prediction branch specifically for tiny ships and a lightweight hybrid attention block for reduced complexity. Additionally, the use of a high-order spatial interactions module improves advanced feature understanding and modeling ability. Our model is evaluated using the public Kaggle marine ship detection dataset and compared with multiple state-of-the-art models including small object detection models, lightweight detection models, and ship detection models. The results show that HSI-ShipDetectionNet outperforms the other models in terms of recall, and mean average precision (mAP) while being lightweight and suitable for deployment on resource-limited platforms.

- **Summary**: Widely adopted motion forecasting datasets substitute the observed sensory inputs with higher-level abstractions such as 3D boxes and polylines. These sparse shapes are inferred through annotating the original scenes with perception systems' predictions. Such intermediate representations tie the quality of the motion forecasting models to the performance of computer vision models. Moreover, the human-designed explicit interfaces between perception and motion forecasting typically pass only a subset of the semantic information present in the original sensory input. To study the effect of these modular approaches, design new paradigms that mitigate these limitations, and accelerate the development of end-to-end motion forecasting models, we augment the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with large-scale, high-quality, diverse LiDAR data for the motion forecasting task.   The new augmented dataset WOMD-LiDAR consists of over 100,000 scenes that each spans 20 seconds, consisting of well-synchronized and calibrated high quality LiDAR point clouds captured across a range of urban and suburban geographies (https://waymo.com/open/data/motion/). Compared to Waymo Open Dataset (WOD), WOMD-LiDAR dataset contains 100x more scenes. Furthermore, we integrate the LiDAR data into the motion forecasting model training and provide a strong baseline. Experiments show that the LiDAR data brings improvement in the motion forecasting task. We hope that WOMD-LiDAR will provide new opportunities for boosting end-to-end motion forecasting models.

- **Summary**: Despite the success of deep-learning models in many tasks, there have been concerns about such models learning shortcuts, and their lack of robustness to irrelevant confounders. When it comes to models directly trained on human faces, a sensitive confounder is that of human identities. Many face-related tasks should ideally be identity-independent, and perform uniformly across different individuals (i.e. be fair). One way to measure and enforce such robustness and performance uniformity is through enforcing it during training, assuming identity-related information is available at scale. However, due to privacy concerns and also the cost of collecting such information, this is often not the case, and most face datasets simply contain input images and their corresponding task-related labels. Thus, improving identity-related robustness without the need for such annotations is of great importance. Here, we explore using face-recognition embedding vectors, as proxies for identities, to enforce such robustness. We propose to use the structure in the face-recognition embedding space, to implicitly emphasize rare samples within each class. We do so by weighting samples according to their conditional inverse density (CID) in the proxy embedding space. Our experiments suggest that such a simple sample weighting scheme, not only improves the training robustness, it often improves the overall performance as a result of such robustness. We also show that employing such constraints during training results in models that are significantly less sensitive to different levels of bias in the dataset.

- **Summary**: Aiming at answering questions based on the content of remotely sensed images, visual question answering for remote sensing data (RSVQA) has attracted much attention nowadays. However, previous works in RSVQA have focused little on the robustness of RSVQA. As we aim to enhance the reliability of RSVQA models, how to learn robust representations against new words and different question templates with the same meaning is the key challenge. With the proposed augmented dataset, we are able to obtain more questions in addition to the original ones with the same meaning. To make better use of this information, in this study, we propose a contrastive learning strategy for training robust RSVQA models against diverse question templates and words. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed augmented dataset is effective in improving the robustness of the RSVQA model. In addition, the contrastive learning strategy performs well on the low resolution (LR) dataset.

- **Summary**: Chen et al. [Chen2022] recently published the article 'Fast and scalable search of whole-slide images via self-supervised deep learning' in Nature Biomedical Engineering. The authors call their method 'self-supervised image search for histology', short SISH. We express our concerns that SISH is an incremental modification of Yottixel, has used MinMax binarization but does not cite the original works, and is based on a misnomer 'self-supervised image search'. As well, we point to several other concerns regarding experiments and comparisons performed by Chen et al.

- **Summary**: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms work well in constrained environments with little or no occlusion of the face. However, real-world face occlusion is prevalent, most notably with the need to use a face mask in the current Covid-19 scenario. While there are works on the problem of occlusion in FER, little has been done before on the particular face mask scenario. Moreover, the few works in this area largely use synthetically created masked FER datasets. Motivated by these challenges posed by the pandemic to FER, we present a novel dataset, the Masked Student Dataset of Expressions or MSD-E, consisting of 1,960 real-world non-masked and masked facial expression images collected from 142 individuals. Along with the issue of obfuscated facial features, we illustrate how other subtler issues in masked FER are represented in our dataset. We then provide baseline results using ResNet-18, finding that its performance dips in the non-masked case when trained for FER in the presence of masks. To tackle this, we test two training paradigms: contrastive learning and knowledge distillation, and find that they increase the model's performance in the masked scenario while maintaining its non-masked performance. We further visualise our results using t-SNE plots and Grad-CAM, demonstrating that these paradigms capitalise on the limited features available in the masked scenario. Finally, we benchmark SOTA methods on MSD-E.



### Harnessing the Spatial-Temporal Attention of Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity Text-to-Image Synthesis

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on text-to-image synthesis tasks. However, one critical limitation of these models is the low fidelity of generated images with respect to the text description, such as missing objects, mismatched attributes, and mislocated objects. One key reason for such inconsistencies is the inaccurate cross-attention to text in both the spatial dimension, which controls at what pixel region an object should appear, and the temporal dimension, which controls how different levels of details are added through the denoising steps. In this paper, we propose a new text-to-image algorithm that adds explicit control over spatial-temporal cross-attention in diffusion models. We first utilize a layout predictor to predict the pixel regions for objects mentioned in the text. We then impose spatial attention control by combining the attention over the entire text description and that over the local description of the particular object in the corresponding pixel region of that object. The temporal attention control is further added by allowing the combination weights to change at each denoising step, and the combination weights are optimized to ensure high fidelity between the image and the text. Experiments show that our method generates images with higher fidelity compared to diffusion-model-based baselines without fine-tuning the diffusion model.

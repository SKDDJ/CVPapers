- **Summary**: The main objective of image segmentation is to divide an image into homogeneous regions for further analysis. This is a significant and crucial task in many applications such as medical imaging. Deep learning (DL) methods have been proposed and widely used for image segmentation. However, these methods usually require a large amount of manually segmented data as training data and suffer from poor interpretability (known as the black box problem). The classical Mumford-Shah (MS) model is effective for segmentation and provides a piece-wise smooth approximation of the original image. In this paper, we replace the hand-crafted regularity term in the MS model with a data adaptive generalized learnable regularity term and use a multi-grid framework to unroll the MS model and obtain a variational model-based segmentation network with better generalizability and interpretability. This approach allows for the incorporation of learnable prior information into the network structure design. Moreover, the multi-grid framework enables multi-scale feature extraction and offers a mathematical explanation for the effectiveness of the U-shaped network structure in producing good image segmentation results. Due to the proposed network originates from a variational model, it can also handle small training sizes. Our experiments on the REFUGE dataset, the White Blood Cell image dataset, and 3D thigh muscle magnetic resonance (MR) images demonstrate that even with smaller training datasets, our method yields better segmentation results compared to related state of the art segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) involves identifying the same vehicle captured by other cameras, given a vehicle image. It plays a crucial role in the development of safe cities and smart cities. With the rapid growth and implementation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology, vehicle Re-ID in UAV aerial photography scenes has garnered significant attention from researchers. However, due to the high altitude of UAVs, the shooting angle of vehicle images sometimes approximates vertical, resulting in fewer local features for Re-ID. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel dual-pooling attention (DpA) module, which achieves the extraction and enhancement of locally important information about vehicles from both channel and spatial dimensions by constructing two branches of channel-pooling attention (CpA) and spatial-pooling attention (SpA), and employing multiple pooling operations to enhance the attention to fine-grained information of vehicles. Specifically, the CpA module operates between the channels of the feature map and splices features by combining four pooling operations so that vehicle regions containing discriminative information are given greater attention. The SpA module uses the same pooling operations strategy to identify discriminative representations and merge vehicle features in image regions in a weighted manner. The feature information of both dimensions is finally fused and trained jointly using label smoothing cross-entropy loss and hard mining triplet loss, thus solving the problem of missing detail information due to the high height of UAV shots. The proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on the UAV-based vehicle datasets VeRi-UAV and VRU.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep learning technology has been maturely applied in the field of object detection, and most algorithms tend to be supervised learning. However, a large amount of labeled data requires high costs of human resources, which brings about low efficiency and limitations. Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has been paid more and more attentions due to its high research value and practicability. It is designed to learn information by using small amounts of labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on the SSOD approaches from five aspects. We first briefly introduce several ways of data augmentation. Then, we dive the mainstream semi-supervised strategies into pseudo labels, consistent regularization, graph based and transfer learning based methods, and introduce some methods in challenging settings. We further present widely-used loss functions, and then we outline the common benchmark datasets and compare the accuracy among different representative approaches. Finally, we conclude this paper and present some promising research directions for the future. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the field as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches developed over the past few years.

- **Summary**: Recently, the bio-inspired spike camera with continuous motion recording capability has attracted tremendous attention due to its ultra high temporal resolution imaging characteristic. Such imaging feature results in huge data storage and transmission burden compared to that of traditional camera, raising severe challenge and imminent necessity in compression for spike camera captured content. Existing lossy data compression methods could not be applied for compressing spike streams efficiently due to integrate-and-fire characteristic and binarized data structure. Considering the imaging principle and information fidelity of spike cameras, we introduce an effective and robust representation of spike streams. Based on this representation, we propose a novel learned spike compression framework using scene recovery, variational auto-encoder plus spike simulator. To our knowledge, it is the first data-trained model for efficient and robust spike stream compression. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the conventional and learning-based codecs, contributing a strong baseline for learned spike data compression.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has revolutionized the way of segmentation. However, SAM's performance may decline when applied to tasks involving domains that differ from natural images. Nonetheless, by employing fine-tuning techniques, SAM exhibits promising capabilities in specific domains, such as medicine and planetary science. Notably, there is a lack of research on the application of SAM to sonar imaging. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation of SAM's performance on sonar images. Specifically, we evaluate SAM using various settings on sonar images. Additionally, we fine-tune SAM using effective methods both with prompts and for semantic segmentation, thereby expanding its applicability to tasks requiring automated segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the performance of the fine-tuned SAM.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models often require large amounts of data for training, leading to increased costs. It is particularly challenging in medical imaging, i.e., gathering distributed data for centralized training, and meanwhile, obtaining quality labels remains a tedious job. Many methods have been proposed to address this issue in various training paradigms, e.g., continual learning, active learning, and federated learning, which indeed demonstrate certain forms of the data valuation process. However, existing methods are either overly intuitive or limited to common clean/toy datasets in the experiments. In this work, we present two data valuation metrics based on Synaptic Intelligence and gradient norms, respectively, to study the redundancy in real-world image data. Novel online and offline data selection algorithms are then proposed via clustering and grouping based on the examined data values. Our online approach effectively evaluates data utilizing layerwise model parameter updates and gradients in each epoch and can accelerate model training with fewer epochs and a subset (e.g., 19%-59%) of data while maintaining equivalent levels of accuracy in a variety of datasets. It also extends to the offline coreset construction, producing subsets of only 18%-30% of the original. The codes for the proposed adaptive data selection and coreset computation are available (https://github.com/ZhenyuTANG2023/data_selection).

- **Summary**: The Vision Challenge Track 1 for Data-Effificient Defect Detection requires competitors to instance segment 14 industrial inspection datasets in a data-defificient setting. This report introduces the technical details of the team Aoi-overfifitting-Team for this challenge. Our method focuses on the key problem of segmentation quality of defect masks in scenarios with limited training samples. Based on the Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) instance segmentation algorithm, we connect the transformer backbone (Swin-B) through composite connections inspired by CBNetv2 to enhance the baseline results. Additionally, we propose two model ensemble methods to further enhance the segmentation effect: one incorporates semantic segmentation into instance segmentation, while the other employs multi-instance segmentation fusion algorithms. Finally, using multi-scale training and test-time augmentation (TTA), we achieve an average mAP@0.50:0.95 of more than 48.49% and an average mAR@0.50:0.95 of 66.71% on the test set of the Data Effificient Defect Detection Challenge.

- **Summary**: The rapid identification and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer, known as the killer of women, have become greatly significant for those patients. Numerous breast cancer histopathological image classification methods have been proposed. But they still suffer from two problems. (1) These methods can only hand high-resolution (HR) images. However, the low-resolution (LR) images are often collected by the digital slide scanner with limited hardware conditions. Compared with HR images, LR images often lose some key features like texture, which deeply affects the accuracy of diagnosis. (2) The existing methods have fixed receptive fields, so they can not extract and fuse multi-scale features well for images with different magnification factors. To fill these gaps, we present a \textbf{S}ingle \textbf{H}istopathological \textbf{I}mage \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution \textbf{C}lassification network (SHISRCNet), which consists of two modules: Super-Resolution (SR) and Classification (CF) modules. SR module reconstructs LR images into SR ones. CF module extracts and fuses the multi-scale features of SR images for classification. In the training stage, we introduce HR images into the CF module to enhance SHISRCNet's performance. Finally, through the joint training of these two modules, super-resolution and classified of LR images are integrated into our model. The experimental results demonstrate that the effects of our method are close to the SOTA methods with taking HR images as inputs.

- **Summary**: Artificial objects usually have very stable shape features, which are stable, persistent properties in geometry. They can provide evidence for object recognition. Shape features are more stable and more distinguishing than appearance features, color features, grayscale features, or gradient features. The difficulty with object recognition based on shape features is that objects may differ in color, lighting, size, position, pose, and background interference, and it is not currently possible to predict all possible conditions. The variety of objects and conditions renders object recognition based on geometric features very challenging. This paper provides a method based on shape templates, which involves the selection, collection, and combination discrimination of geometric evidence of the edge segments of images, to find out the target object accurately from background, and it is able to identify the semantic attributes of each line segment of the target object. In essence, the method involves solving a global optimal combinatorial optimization problem. Although the complexity of the global optimal combinatorial optimization problem seems to be very high, there is no need to define the complex feature vector and no need for any expensive training process. It has very good generalization ability and environmental adaptability, and more solid basis for cognitive psychology than other methods. The process of collecting geometric evidence, which is simple and universal, shows considerable prospects for practical use. The experimental results prove that the method has great advantages in response to changes in the environment, invariant recognition, pinpointing the geometry of objects, search efficiency, and efficient calculation. This attempt contributes to understanding of some types of universal processing during the process of object recognition.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) and Multimodal Relation Extraction (MRE) necessitate the fundamental reasoning capacity for intricate linguistic and multimodal comprehension. In this study, we explore distilling the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) into a more compact student model by generating a \textit{chain of thought} (CoT) -- a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps. Specifically, we commence by exemplifying the elicitation of such reasoning ability from LLMs through CoT prompts covering multi-grain (noun, sentence, multimodality) and data-augmentation (style, entity, image) dimensions. Subsequently, we present a novel conditional prompt distillation method to assimilate the commonsense reasoning ability from LLMs, thereby enhancing the utility of the student model in addressing text-only inputs without the requisite addition of image and CoT knowledge. Extensive experiments reveal that our approach attains state-of-the-art accuracy and manifests a plethora of advantages concerning interpretability, data efficiency, and cross-domain generalization on MNER and MRE datasets.

- **Summary**: Karyotyping is of importance for detecting chromosomal aberrations in human disease. However, chromosomes easily appear curved in microscopic images, which prevents cytogeneticists from analyzing chromosome types. To address this issue, we propose a framework for chromosome straightening, which comprises a preliminary processing algorithm and a generative model called masked conditional variational autoencoders (MC-VAE). The processing method utilizes patch rearrangement to address the difficulty in erasing low degrees of curvature, providing reasonable preliminary results for the MC-VAE. The MC-VAE further straightens the results by leveraging chromosome patches conditioned on their curvatures to learn the mapping between banding patterns and conditions. During model training, we apply a masking strategy with a high masking ratio to train the MC-VAE with eliminated redundancy. This yields a non-trivial reconstruction task, allowing the model to effectively preserve chromosome banding patterns and structure details in the reconstructed results. Extensive experiments on three public datasets with two stain styles show that our framework surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in retaining banding patterns and structure details. Compared to using real-world bent chromosomes, the use of high-quality straightened chromosomes generated by our proposed method can improve the performance of various deep learning models for chromosome classification by a large margin. Such a straightening approach has the potential to be combined with other karyotyping systems to assist cytogeneticists in chromosome analysis.

- **Summary**: Nuclei segmentation and classification is a significant process in pathology image analysis. Deep learning-based approaches have greatly contributed to the higher accuracy of this task. However, those approaches suffer from the imbalanced nuclei data composition, which shows lower classification performance on the rare nuclei class. In this paper, we propose a realistic data synthesis method using a diffusion model. We generate two types of virtual patches to enlarge the training data distribution, which is for balancing the nuclei class variance and for enlarging the chance to look at various nuclei. After that, we use a semantic-label-conditioned diffusion model to generate realistic and high-quality image samples. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by experiment results on two imbalanced nuclei datasets, improving the state-of-the-art networks. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method improves the classification performance of the rare type nuclei classification, while showing superior segmentation and classification performance in imbalanced pathology nuclei datasets.

- **Summary**: With the advancements in deep learning, video colorization by propagating color information from a colorized reference frame to a monochrome video sequence has been well explored. However, the existing approaches often suffer from overfitting the training dataset and sequentially lead to suboptimal performance on colorizing testing samples. To address this issue, we propose an effective method, which aims to enhance video colorization through test-time tuning. By exploiting the reference to construct additional training samples during testing, our approach achieves a performance boost of 1~3 dB in PSNR on average compared to the baseline.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art supervised deep learning-based segmentation approaches have demonstrated superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. However, such supervised approaches require fully annotated pixel-level ground-truth labels, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently, Scribble2Label (S2L) demonstrated that using only a handful of scribbles with self-supervised learning can generate accurate segmentation results without full annotation. However, owing to the relatively small size of scribbles, the model is prone to overfit and the results may be biased to the selection of scribbles. In this work, we address this issue by employing a novel multiscale contrastive regularization term for S2L. The main idea is to extract features from intermediate layers of the neural network for contrastive loss so that structures at various scales can be effectively separated. To verify the efficacy of our method, we conducted ablation studies on well-known datasets, such as Data Science Bowl 2018 and MoNuSeg. The results show that the proposed multiscale contrastive loss is effective in improving the performance of S2L, which is comparable to that of the supervised learning segmentation method.

- **Summary**: Underwater object detection (UOD) plays a significant role in aquaculture and marine environmental protection. Considering the challenges posed by low contrast and low-light conditions in underwater environments, several underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have been proposed to improve the quality of underwater images. However, only using the enhanced images does not improve the performance of UOD, since it may unavoidably remove or alter critical patterns and details of underwater objects. In contrast, we believe that exploring the complementary information from the two domains is beneficial for UOD. The raw image preserves the natural characteristics of the scene and texture information of the objects, while the enhanced image improves the visibility of underwater objects. Based on this perspective, we propose a Gated Cross-domain Collaborative Network (GCC-Net) to address the challenges of poor visibility and low contrast in underwater environments, which comprises three dedicated components. Firstly, a real-time UIE method is employed to generate enhanced images, which can improve the visibility of objects in low-contrast areas. Secondly, a cross-domain feature interaction module is introduced to facilitate the interaction and mine complementary information between raw and enhanced image features. Thirdly, to prevent the contamination of unreliable generated results, a gated feature fusion module is proposed to adaptively control the fusion ratio of cross-domain information. Our method presents a new UOD paradigm from the perspective of cross-domain information interaction and fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GCC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on four underwater datasets.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have been proven capable of synthesizing high-quality images with remarkable diversity when trained on large amounts of data. Typical diffusion models and modern large-scale conditional generative models like text-to-image generative models are vulnerable to overfitting when fine-tuned on extremely limited data. Existing works have explored subject-driven generation using a reference set containing a few images. However, few prior works explore DDPM-based domain-driven generation, which aims to learn the common features of target domains while maintaining diversity. This paper proposes a novel DomainStudio approach to adapt DDPMs pre-trained on large-scale source datasets to target domains using limited data. It is designed to keep the diversity of subjects provided by source domains and get high-quality and diverse adapted samples in target domains. We propose to keep the relative distances between adapted samples to achieve considerable generation diversity. In addition, we further enhance the learning of high-frequency details for better generation quality. Our approach is compatible with both unconditional and conditional diffusion models. This work makes the first attempt to realize unconditional few-shot image generation with diffusion models, achieving better quality and greater diversity than current state-of-the-art GAN-based approaches. Moreover, this work also significantly relieves overfitting for conditional generation and realizes high-quality domain-driven generation, further expanding the applicable scenarios of modern large-scale text-to-image models.

- **Summary**: Predicting future trajectories of surrounding agents is essential for safety-critical autonomous driving. Most existing work focuses on predicting marginal trajectories for each agent independently. However, it has rarely been explored in predicting joint trajectories for interactive agents. In this work, we propose Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF) to explicitly capture future interactions between interactive agents. Concretely, BiFF fuses the high-level future intentions followed by low-level future behaviors. Then the polyline-based coordinate is specifically designed for multi-agent prediction to ensure data efficiency, frame robustness, and prediction accuracy. Experiments show that BiFF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the interactive prediction benchmark of Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

- **Summary**: The recent 'Mpox' outbreak, formerly known as 'Monkeypox', has become a significant public health concern and has spread to over 110 countries globally. The challenge of clinically diagnosing mpox early on is due, in part, to its similarity to other types of rashes. Computer-aided screening tools have been proven valuable in cases where Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based diagnosis is not immediately available. Deep learning methods are powerful in learning complex data representations, but their efficacy largely depends on adequate training data. To address this challenge, we present the "Mpox Skin Lesion Dataset Version 2.0 (MSLD v2.0)" as a follow-up to the previously released openly accessible dataset, one of the first datasets containing mpox lesion images. This dataset contains images of patients with mpox and five other non-mpox classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox, and healthy). We benchmark the performance of several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB3, InceptionV3, and Xception, to classify mpox and other infectious skin diseases. In order to reduce the impact of racial bias, we utilize a color space data augmentation method to increase skin color variability during training. Additionally, by leveraging transfer learning implemented with pre-trained weights generated from the HAM10000 dataset, an extensive collection of pigmented skin lesion images, we achieved the best overall accuracy of $83.59\pm2.11\%$. Finally, the developed models are incorporated within a prototype web application to analyze uploaded skin images by a user and determine whether a subject is a suspected mpox patient.

- **Summary**: Scene information plays a crucial role in trajectory forecasting systems for autonomous driving by providing semantic clues and constraints on potential future paths of traffic agents. Prevalent trajectory prediction techniques often take high-definition maps (HD maps) as part of the inputs to provide scene knowledge. Although HD maps offer accurate road information, they may suffer from the high cost of annotation or restrictions of law that limits their widespread use. Therefore, those methods are still expected to generate reliable prediction results in mapless scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the problem of improving the consistency of multi-modal prediction trajectories and the real road topology when map information is unavailable during the test phase. Specifically, we achieve this by training a map-based prediction teacher network on the annotated samples and transferring the knowledge to a student mapless prediction network using a two-fold knowledge distillation framework. Our solution is generalizable for common trajectory prediction networks and does not bring extra computation burden. Experimental results show that our method stably improves prediction performance in mapless mode on many widely used state-of-the-art trajectory prediction baselines, compensating for the gaps caused by the absence of HD maps. Qualitative visualization results demonstrate that our approach helps infer unseen map information.

- **Summary**: The ability to model intra-modal and inter-modal interactions is fundamental in multimodal machine learning. The current state-of-the-art models usually adopt deep learning models with fixed structures. They can achieve exceptional performances on specific tasks, but face a particularly challenging problem of modality mismatch because of diversity of input modalities and their fixed structures. In this paper, we present \textbf{Switch-BERT} for joint vision and language representation learning to address this problem. Switch-BERT extends BERT architecture by introducing learnable layer-wise and cross-layer interactions. It learns to optimize attention from a set of attention modes representing these interactions. One specific property of the model is that it learns to attend outputs from various depths, therefore mitigates the modality mismatch problem. We present extensive experiments on visual question answering, image-text retrieval and referring expression comprehension experiments. Results confirm that, whereas alternative architectures including ViLBERT and UNITER may excel in particular tasks, Switch-BERT can consistently achieve better or comparable performances than the current state-of-the-art models in these tasks. Ablation studies indicate that the proposed model achieves superior performances due to its ability in learning task-specific multimodal interactions.

- **Summary**: The unprecedented success of image reconstruction approaches based on deep neural networks has revolutionised both the processing and the analysis paradigms in several applied disciplines. In the field of digital humanities, the task of digital reconstruction of ancient frescoes is particularly challenging due to the scarce amount of available training data caused by ageing, wear, tear and retouching over time. To overcome these difficulties, we consider the Deep Image Prior (DIP) inpainting approach which computes appropriate reconstructions by relying on the progressive updating of an untrained convolutional neural network so as to match the reliable piece of information in the image at hand while promoting regularisation elsewhere. In comparison with state-of-the-art approaches (based on variational/PDEs and patch-based methods), DIP-based inpainting reduces artefacts and better adapts to contextual/non-local information, thus providing a valuable and effective tool for art historians. As a case study, we apply such approach to reconstruct missing image contents in a dataset of highly damaged digital images of medieval paintings located into several chapels in the Mediterranean Alpine Arc and provide a detailed description on how visible and invisible (e.g., infrared) information can be integrated for identifying and reconstructing damaged image regions.

- **Summary**: Achieving robustness against adversarial input perturbation is an important and intriguing problem in machine learning. In the area of semantic image segmentation, a number of adversarial training approaches have been proposed as a defense against adversarial perturbation, but the methodology of evaluating the robustness of the models is still lacking, compared to image classification. Here, we demonstrate that, just like in image classification, it is important to evaluate the models over several different and hard attacks. We propose a set of gradient based iterative attacks and show that it is essential to perform a large number of iterations. We include attacks against the internal representations of the models as well. We apply two types of attacks: maximizing the error with a bounded perturbation, and minimizing the perturbation for a given level of error. Using this set of attacks, we show for the first time that a number of models in previous work that are claimed to be robust are in fact not robust at all. We then evaluate simple adversarial training algorithms that produce reasonably robust models even under our set of strong attacks. Our results indicate that a key design decision to achieve any robustness is to use only adversarial examples during training. However, this introduces a trade-off between robustness and accuracy.

- **Summary**: Due to the point cloud's irregular and unordered geometry structure, conventional knowledge distillation technology lost a lot of information when directly used on point cloud tasks. In this paper, we propose Feature Adversarial Distillation (FAD) method, a generic adversarial loss function in point cloud distillation, to reduce loss during knowledge transfer. In the feature extraction stage, the features extracted by the teacher are used as the discriminator, and the students continuously generate new features in the training stage. The feature of the student is obtained by attacking the feedback from the teacher and getting a score to judge whether the student has learned the knowledge well or not. In experiments on standard point cloud classification on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets, our method reduced the information loss of knowledge transfer in distillation in 40x model compression while maintaining competitive performance.

- **Summary**: Space-based visible camera is an important sensor for space situation awareness during proximity operations. However, visible camera can be easily affected by the low illumination in the space environment. Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved remarkable success in image enhancement of natural images datasets, but seldom applied in space due to the data bottleneck. In this article, we propose a data-driven method for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) of spin targets in space environment based on diffusion model. Firstly, a dataset collection scheme is devised. To reduce the domain gap and improve the diversity and quality of the dataset, we collect the data with the camera on a ground-test system imitating the low lighting conditions and relative attitude change of satellite in space. The satellite motion is controlled by a 6-DoF robot. To generate different poses, a advanced sampling method is combined with collision detection in physical simulation. The entire process is automated. Based on our dataset, a novel diffusion model is proposed. The diffusion and denoising process are directly conducted on the grayscale channel to save computational resources. To take advantage of the inner information of RGB channels, we rescale the RGB feature maps and insert them into the downsampling layers to help feature extraction. The enhanced results with our method have been verified to be better in image light enhancement and competitive in image quality compared with previous methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of LLIE using diffusion model.

- **Summary**: One of the most significant challenges in the field of deep learning and medical image segmentation is to determine an appropriate threshold for classifying each pixel. This threshold is a value above which the model's output is considered to belong to a specific class. Manual thresholding based on personal experience is error-prone and time-consuming, particularly for complex problems such as medical images. Traditional methods for thresholding are not effective for determining the threshold value for such problems.   To tackle this challenge, automatic thresholding methods using deep learning have been proposed. However, the main issue with these methods is that they often determine the threshold value statically without considering changes in input data. Since input data can be dynamic and may change over time, threshold determination should be adaptive and consider input data and environmental conditions.

- **Summary**: Manually inspecting polyps from a colonoscopy for colorectal cancer or performing a biopsy on skin lesions for skin cancer are time-consuming, laborious, and complex procedures. Automatic medical image segmentation aims to expedite this diagnosis process. However, numerous challenges exist due to significant variations in the appearance and sizes of objects with no distinct boundaries. This paper proposes an attention-based residual Double U-Net architecture (AttResDU-Net) that improves on the existing medical image segmentation networks. Inspired by the Double U-Net, this architecture incorporates attention gates on the skip connections and residual connections in the convolutional blocks. The attention gates allow the model to retain more relevant spatial information by suppressing irrelevant feature representation from the down-sampling path for which the model learns to focus on target regions of varying shapes and sizes. Moreover, the residual connections help to train deeper models by ensuring better gradient flow. We conducted experiments on three datasets: CVC Clinic-DB, ISIC 2018, and the 2018 Data Science Bowl datasets and achieved Dice Coefficient scores of 94.35%, 91.68% and 92.45% respectively. Our results suggest that AttResDU-Net can be facilitated as a reliable method for automatic medical image segmentation in practice.

- **Summary**: Distinctive Image Captioning (DIC) -- generating distinctive captions that describe the unique details of a target image -- has received considerable attention over the last few years. A recent DIC method proposes to generate distinctive captions by comparing the target image with a set of semantic-similar reference images, i.e., reference-based DIC (Ref-DIC). It aims to force the generated captions to distinguish between the target image and the reference image. To ensure Ref-DIC models really perceive the unique objects (or attributes) in target images, we propose two new Ref-DIC benchmarks and develop a Transformer-based Ref-DIC baseline TransDIC. The model only extracts visual features from the target image, but also encodes the differences between objects in the target and reference images. Taking one step further, we propose a stronger TransDIC++, which consists of an extra contrastive learning module to make full use of the reference images. This new module is model-agnostic, which can be easily incorporated into various Ref-DIC architectures. Finally, for more trustworthy benchmarking, we propose a new evaluation metric named DisCIDEr for Ref-DIC, which evaluates both the accuracy and distinctiveness of the generated captions. Experimental results demonstrate that our TransDIC++ can generate distinctive captions. Besides, it outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the two new benchmarks over different metrics.

- **Summary**: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection for capturing relationships between humans and objects is an important task in the semantic understanding of images. When processing human and object keypoints extracted from an image using a graph convolutional network (GCN) to detect HOI, it is crucial to extract appropriate object keypoints regardless of the object type and to design a GCN that accurately captures the spatial relationships between keypoints. This paper presents the human and object keypoint-based extension module (HOKEM) as an easy-to-use extension module to improve the accuracy of the conventional detection models. The proposed object keypoint extraction method is simple yet accurately represents the shapes of various objects. Moreover, the proposed human-object adaptive GCN (HO-AGCN), which introduces adaptive graph optimization and attention mechanism, accurately captures the spatial relationships between keypoints. Experiments using the HOI dataset, V-COCO, showed that HOKEM boosted the accuracy of an appearance-based model by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are incredibly vulnerable to crafted, imperceptible adversarial perturbations. While adversarial training (AT) has proven to be an effective defense approach, the AT mechanism for robustness improvement is not fully understood. This work investigates AT from a spectral perspective, adding new insights to the design of effective defenses. In particular, we show that AT induces the deep model to focus more on the low-frequency region, which retains the shape-biased representations, to gain robustness. Further, we find that the spectrum of a white-box attack is primarily distributed in regions the model focuses on, and the perturbation attacks the spectral bands where the model is vulnerable. Based on this observation, to train a model tolerant to frequency-varying perturbation, we propose a spectral alignment regularization (SAR) such that the spectral output inferred by an attacked adversarial input stays as close as possible to its natural input counterpart. Experiments demonstrate that SAR and its weight averaging (WA) extension could significantly improve the robust accuracy by 1.14% ~ 3.87% relative to the standard AT, across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet), and various attacks (PGD, C&W and Autoattack), without any extra data.

- **Summary**: In this research, we deal with the problem of visual question answering (VQA) in remote sensing. While remotely sensed images contain information significant for the task of identification and object detection, they pose a great challenge in their processing because of high dimensionality, volume and redundancy. Furthermore, processing image information jointly with language features adds additional constraints, such as mapping the corresponding image and language features. To handle this problem, we propose a cross attention based approach combined with information maximization. The CNN-LSTM based cross-attention highlights the information in the image and language modalities and establishes a connection between the two, while information maximization learns a low dimensional bottleneck layer, that has all the relevant information required to carry out the VQA task. We evaluate our method on two VQA remote sensing datasets of different resolutions. For the high resolution dataset, we achieve an overall accuracy of 79.11% and 73.87% for the two test sets while for the low resolution dataset, we achieve an overall accuracy of 85.98%.

- **Summary**: Local motion blur commonly occurs in real-world photography due to the mixing between moving objects and stationary backgrounds during exposure. Existing image deblurring methods predominantly focus on global deblurring, inadvertently affecting the sharpness of backgrounds in locally blurred images and wasting unnecessary computation on sharp pixels, especially for high-resolution images. This paper aims to adaptively and efficiently restore high-resolution locally blurred images. We propose a local motion deblurring vision Transformer (LMD-ViT) built on adaptive window pruning Transformer blocks (AdaWPT). To focus deblurring on local regions and reduce computation, AdaWPT prunes unnecessary windows, only allowing the active windows to be involved in the deblurring processes. The pruning operation relies on the blurriness confidence predicted by a confidence predictor that is trained end-to-end using a reconstruction loss with Gumbel-Softmax re-parameterization and a pruning loss guided by annotated blur masks. Our method removes local motion blur effectively without distorting sharp regions, demonstrated by its exceptional perceptual and quantitative improvements (+0.24dB) compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our approach substantially reduces FLOPs by 66% and achieves more than a twofold increase in inference speed compared to Transformer-based deblurring methods. We will make our code and annotated blur masks publicly available.

- **Summary**: A large number of annotated training images is crucial for training successful scene text recognition models. However, collecting sufficient datasets can be a labor-intensive and costly process, particularly for low-resource languages. To address this challenge, auto-generating text data has shown promise in alleviating the problem. Unfortunately, existing scene text generation methods typically rely on a large amount of paired data, which is difficult to obtain for low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised scene text generation method that leverages a few recognition-level labels as weak supervision. The proposed method is able to generate a large amount of scene text images with diverse backgrounds and font styles through cross-language generation. Our method disentangles the content and style features of scene text images, with the former representing textual information and the latter representing characteristics such as font, alignment, and background. To preserve the complete content structure of generated images, we introduce an integrated attention module. Furthermore, to bridge the style gap in the style of different languages, we incorporate a pre-trained font classifier. We evaluate our method using state-of-the-art scene text recognition models. Experiments demonstrate that our generated scene text significantly improves the scene text recognition accuracy and help achieve higher accuracy when complemented with other generative methods.

- **Summary**: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) has been adopted as an important technique for speeding up data acquisition and decreasing radiation dose. However, due to the lack of sufficient projection data, the reconstructed CT images often present severe artifacts, which will be further amplified when patients carry metallic implants. For this joint sparse-view reconstruction and metal artifact reduction task, most of the existing methods are generally confronted with two main limitations: 1) They are almost built based on common network modules without fully embedding the physical imaging geometry constraint of this specific task into the dual-domain learning; 2) Some important prior knowledge is not deeply explored and sufficiently utilized. Against these issues, we specifically construct a dual-domain reconstruction model and propose a model-driven equivariant proximal network, called MEPNet. The main characteristics of MEPNet are: 1) It is optimization-inspired and has a clear working mechanism; 2) The involved proximal operator is modeled via a rotation equivariant convolutional neural network, which finely represents the inherent rotational prior underlying the CT scanning that the same organ can be imaged at different angles. Extensive experiments conducted on several datasets comprehensively substantiate that compared with the conventional convolution-based proximal network, such a rotation equivariance mechanism enables our proposed method to achieve better reconstruction performance with fewer network parameters. We will release the code at \url{https://github.com/hongwang01/MEPNet}.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce Efficient Contextformer (eContextformer) for context modeling in lossy learned image compression, which is built upon our previous work, Contextformer. The eContextformer combines the recent advancements in efficient transformers and fast context models with the spatio-channel attention mechanism. The proposed model enables content-adaptive exploitation of the spatial and channel-wise latent dependencies for a high performance and efficient entropy modeling. By incorporating several innovations, the eContextformer features improved decoding speed, model complexity and rate-distortion performance over previous work. For instance, compared to Contextformer, the eContextformer requires 145x less model complexity, 210x less decoding speed and achieves higher average bit savings on the Kodak, CLIC2020 and Tecnick datasets. Compared to the standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Test Model (VTM) 16.2, the proposed model provides up to 17.1% bitrate savings and surpasses various learning-based models.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has attracted significant attention due to its impressive zero-shot transfer performance and high versatility for numerous vision applications (like image editing with fine-grained control). Many of such applications need to be run on resource-constraint edge devices, like mobile phones. In this work, we aim to make SAM mobile-friendly by replacing the heavyweight image encoder with a lightweight one. A naive way to train such a new SAM as in the original SAM paper leads to unsatisfactory performance, especially when limited training sources are available. We find that this is mainly caused by the coupled optimization of the image encoder and mask decoder, motivated by which we propose decoupled distillation. Concretely, we distill the knowledge from the heavy image encoder (ViT-H in the original SAM) to a lightweight image encoder, which can be automatically compatible with the mask decoder in the original SAM. The training can be completed on a single GPU within less than one day, and the resulting lightweight SAM is termed MobileSAM which is more than 60 times smaller yet performs on par with the original SAM. For inference speed, With a single GPU, MobileSAM runs around 10ms per image: 8ms on the image encoder and 4ms on the mask decoder. With superior performance, our MobileSAM is around 5 times faster than the concurrent FastSAM and 7 times smaller, making it more suitable for mobile applications. Moreover, we show that MobileSAM can run relatively smoothly on CPU. The code for our project is provided at \href{https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM}{\textcolor{red}{MobileSAM}}), with a demo showing that MobileSAM can run relatively smoothly on CPU.

- **Summary**: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging and realistic task that extends beyond the scope of standard Object Detection task. It involves detecting both known and unknown objects while integrating learned knowledge for future tasks. However, the level of 'unknownness' varies significantly depending on the context. For example, a tree is typically considered part of the background in a self-driving scene, but it may be significant in a household context. We argue that this external or contextual information should already be embedded within the known classes. In other words, there should be a semantic or latent structure relationship between the known and unknown items to be discovered. Motivated by this observation, we propose Hyp-OW, a method that learns and models hierarchical representation of known items through a SuperClass Regularizer. Leveraging this learned representation allows us to effectively detect unknown objects using a Similarity Distance-based Relabeling module. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Hyp-OW achieving improvement in both known and unknown detection (up to 6 points). These findings are particularly pronounced in our newly designed benchmark, where a strong hierarchical structure exists between known and unknown objects.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated great potential in medical image segmentation by utilizing knowledge from unlabeled data. However, most existing approaches do not explicitly capture high-level semantic relations between distant regions, which limits their performance. In this paper, we focus on representation learning for semi-supervised learning, by developing a novel Multi-Scale Cross Supervised Contrastive Learning (MCSC) framework, to segment structures in medical images. We jointly train CNN and Transformer models, regularising their features to be semantically consistent across different scales. Our approach contrasts multi-scale features based on ground-truth and cross-predicted labels, in order to extract robust feature representations that reflect intra- and inter-slice relationships across the whole dataset. To tackle class imbalance, we take into account the prevalence of each class to guide contrastive learning and ensure that features adequately capture infrequent classes. Extensive experiments on two multi-structure medical segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MCSC. It not only outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods by more than 3.0% in Dice, but also greatly reduces the performance gap with fully supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that presents significant challenges in social interaction, communication, and behavior. Early intervention plays a pivotal role in enhancing cognitive abilities and reducing autistic symptoms in children with ASD. Numerous clinical studies have highlighted distinctive facial characteristics that distinguish ASD children from typically developing (TD) children. In this study, we propose a practical solution for ASD screening using facial images using YoloV8 model. By employing YoloV8, a deep learning technique, on a dataset of Kaggle, we achieved exceptional results. Our model achieved a remarkable 89.64% accuracy in classification and an F1-score of 0.89. Our findings provide support for the clinical observations regarding facial feature discrepancies between children with ASD. The high F1-score obtained demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in screening children with ASD. We conclude that the newest version of YoloV8 which is usually used for object detection can be used for classification problem of Austistic and Non-autistic images.

- **Summary**: Robustness and compactness are two essential components of deep learning models that are deployed in the real world. The seemingly conflicting aims of (i) generalization across domains as in robustness, and (ii) specificity to one domain as in compression, are why the overall design goal of achieving robust compact models, despite being highly important, is still a challenging open problem. We introduce Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Pruning, or AdaSAP, a method that yields robust sparse networks. The central tenet of our approach is to optimize the loss landscape so that the model is primed for pruning via adaptive weight perturbation, and is also consistently regularized toward flatter regions for improved robustness. This unifies both goals through the lens of network sharpness. AdaSAP achieves strong performance in a comprehensive set of experiments. For classification on ImageNet and object detection on Pascal VOC datasets, AdaSAP improves the robust accuracy of pruned models by +6% on ImageNet C, +4% on ImageNet V2, and +4% on corrupted VOC datasets, over a wide range of compression ratios, saliency criteria, and network architectures, outperforming recent pruning art by large margins.

- **Summary**: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is indispensable for a face recognition system. Many texture-driven countermeasures were developed against presentation attacks (PAs), but the performance against unseen domains or unseen spoofing types is still unsatisfactory. Instead of exhaustively collecting all the spoofing variations and making binary decisions of live/spoof, we offer a new perspective on the FAS task to distinguish between normal and abnormal movements of live and spoof presentations. We propose Geometry-Aware Interaction Network (GAIN), which exploits dense facial landmarks with spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) to establish a more interpretable and modularized FAS model. Additionally, with our cross-attention feature interaction mechanism, GAIN can be easily integrated with other existing methods to significantly boost performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the standard intra- and cross-dataset evaluations. Moreover, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the cross-dataset cross-type protocol on CASIA-SURF 3DMask (+10.26% higher AUC score), exhibiting strong robustness against domain shifts and unseen spoofing types.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has shown the capability to substantially accelerate MRI reconstruction while acquiring fewer measurements. Recently, diffusion models have gained burgeoning interests as a novel group of deep learning-based generative methods. These methods seek to sample data points that belong to a target distribution from a Gaussian distribution, which has been successfully extended to MRI reconstruction. In this work, we proposed a Cold Diffusion-based MRI reconstruction method called CDiffMR. Different from conventional diffusion models, the degradation operation of our CDiffMR is based on \textit{k}-space undersampling instead of adding Gaussian noise, and the restoration network is trained to harness a de-aliaseing function. We also design starting point and data consistency conditioning strategies to guide and accelerate the reverse process. More intriguingly, the pre-trained CDiffMR model can be reused for reconstruction tasks with different undersampling rates. We demonstrated, through extensive numerical and visual experiments, that the proposed CDiffMR can achieve comparable or even superior reconstruction results than state-of-the-art models. Compared to the diffusion model-based counterpart, CDiffMR reaches readily competing results using only $1.6 \sim 3.4\%$ for inference time.

### A differentiable Gaussian Prototype Layer for explainable Segmentation

- **Summary**: We introduce a Gaussian Prototype Layer for gradient-based prototype learning and demonstrate two novel network architectures for explainable segmentation one of which relies on region proposals. Both models are evaluated on agricultural datasets. While Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) have been used to model latent distributions of neural networks before, they are typically fitted using the EM algorithm. Instead, the proposed prototype layer relies on gradient-based optimization and hence allows for end-to-end training. This facilitates development and allows to use the full potential of a trainable deep feature extractor. We show that it can be used as a novel building block for explainable neural networks. We employ our Gaussian Prototype Layer in (1) a model where prototypes are detected in the latent grid and (2) a model inspired by Fast-RCNN with SLIC superpixels as region proposals. The earlier achieves a similar performance as compared to the state-of-the art while the latter has the benefit of a more precise prototype localization that comes at the cost of slightly lower accuracies. By introducing a gradient-based GMM layer we combine the benefits of end-to-end training with the simplicity and theoretical foundation of GMMs which will allow to adapt existing semi-supervised learning strategies for prototypical part models in future.

- **Summary**: Image-text retrieval is a central problem for understanding the semantic relationship between vision and language, and serves as the basis for various visual and language tasks. Most previous works either simply learn coarse-grained representations of the overall image and text, or elaborately establish the correspondence between image regions or pixels and text words. However, the close relations between coarse- and fine-grained representations for each modality are important for image-text retrieval but almost neglected. As a result, such previous works inevitably suffer from low retrieval accuracy or heavy computational cost. In this work, we address image-text retrieval from a novel perspective by combining coarse- and fine-grained representation learning into a unified framework. This framework is consistent with human cognition, as humans simultaneously pay attention to the entire sample and regional elements to understand the semantic content. To this end, a Token-Guided Dual Transformer (TGDT) architecture which consists of two homogeneous branches for image and text modalities, respectively, is proposed for image-text retrieval. The TGDT incorporates both coarse- and fine-grained retrievals into a unified framework and beneficially leverages the advantages of both retrieval approaches. A novel training objective called Consistent Multimodal Contrastive (CMC) loss is proposed accordingly to ensure the intra- and inter-modal semantic consistencies between images and texts in the common embedding space. Equipped with a two-stage inference method based on the mixed global and local cross-modal similarity, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performances with extremely low inference time when compared with representative recent approaches.

- **Summary**: Visual retrieval tasks such as image retrieval and person re-identification (Re-ID) aim at effectively and thoroughly searching images with similar content or the same identity. After obtaining retrieved examples, re-ranking is a widely adopted post-processing step to reorder and improve the initial retrieval results by making use of the contextual information from semantically neighboring samples. Prevailing re-ranking approaches update distance metrics and mostly rely on inefficient crosscheck set comparison operations while computing expanded neighbors based distances. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method which refines initial retrieval results by updating features. Specifically, we reformulate re-ranking based on Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) and propose a novel Graph Convolution based Re-ranking (GCR) for visual retrieval tasks via feature propagation. To accelerate computation for large-scale retrieval, a decentralized and synchronous feature propagation algorithm which supports parallel or distributed computing is introduced. In particular, the plain GCR is extended for cross-camera retrieval and an improved feature propagation formulation is presented to leverage affinity relationships across different cameras. It is also extended for video-based retrieval, and Graph Convolution based Re-ranking for Video (GCRV) is proposed by mathematically deriving a novel profile vector generation method for the tracklet. Without bells and whistles, the proposed approaches achieve state-of-the-art performances on seven benchmark datasets from three different tasks, i.e., image retrieval, person Re-ID and video-based person Re-ID.

- **Summary**: Determining the drivable area, or free space segmentation, is critical for mobile robots to navigate indoor environments safely. However, the lack of coherent markings and structures (e.g., lanes, curbs, etc.) in indoor spaces places the burden of traversability estimation heavily on the mobile robot. This paper explores the use of a self-supervised one-shot texture segmentation framework and an RGB-D camera to achieve robust drivable area segmentation. With a fast inference speed and compact size, the developed model, MOSTS is ideal for real-time robot navigation and various embedded applications. A benchmark study was conducted to compare MOSTS's performance with existing one-shot texture segmentation models to evaluate its performance. Additionally, a validation dataset was built to assess MOSTS's ability to perform texture segmentation in the wild, where it effectively identified small low-lying objects that were previously undetectable by depth measurements. Further, the study also compared MOSTS's performance with two State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) indoor semantic segmentation models, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results showed that MOSTS offers comparable accuracy with up to eight times faster inference speed in indoor drivable area segmentation.

- **Summary**: As the saying goes, "seeing is believing". However, with the development of digital face editing tools, we can no longer trust what we can see. Although face forgery detection has made promising progress, most current methods are designed manually by human experts, which is labor-consuming. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end framework based on neural architecture search (NAS) for deepfake detection, which can automatically design network architectures without human intervention. First, a forgery-oriented search space is created to choose appropriate operations for this task. Second, we propose a novel performance estimation metric, which guides the search process to select more general models. The cross-dataset search is also considered to develop more general architectures. Eventually, we connect the cells in a cascaded pyramid way for final forgery classification. Compared with state-of-the-art networks artificially designed, our method achieves competitive performance in both in-dataset and cross-dataset scenarios.

- **Summary**: Current Vision and Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong performance across various vision-language tasks, yet they struggle with fine-grained understanding. This issue stems from weak image-caption alignment in pretraining datasets and a simplified contrastive objective that fails to distinguish nuanced grounding elements such as relations, actions, and attributes. As a result, the models tend to learn bag-of-words representations. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce an intra-modal contrastive loss and a unique cross-modal rank loss with an adaptive threshold that serves as curriculum learning, utilizing our automatically generated hard negatives to augment the model's capacity. Our strategy, which does not necessitate additional annotations or parameters, can be incorporated into any VLM trained with an image-text contrastive loss. Upon application to CLIP, our method leads to significant improvements on four fine-grained benchmarks, and it also enhances the performance of X-VLM, which is the state-of-art moodel on fine-grained reasoning.

- **Summary**: Digital humanities research has flourished due to the diverse artifacts available in cultural heritage databases. However, over-reliance on a single artifact type can result in poor contextualization and a constrained understanding of historical context. We collaborated with art historians to examine handscrolls, a form of traditional Chinese painting which offers a wealth of data for historical analysis and provides a unique opportunity for understanding history through artwork. We propose ScrollTimes, a visual analysis system for tracing handscroll historic context by linking multiple data sources. Specifically, a unique layout is developed for efficiently viewing long handscrolls. Using image processing techniques and language models, we extract, verify, and supplement elements in handscrolls with different cultural heritage databases. Furthermore, interactive biographies are constructed for handscrolls to uncover their historical narratives, provenance trajectories, and artistic legacies. Validated through case studies and expert interviews, our approach offers a window into history, fostering a holistic understanding of handscroll provenance and historical significance.

- **Summary**: The high-dimensional nature of the 4-D light field (LF) poses great challenges in efficient and effective feature embedding that severely impact the performance of downstream tasks. To tackle this crucial issue, in contrast to existing methods with empirically-designed architectures, we propose probabilistic-based feature embedding (PFE), which learns a feature embedding architecture by assembling various low-dimensional convolution patterns in a probability space for fully capturing spatial-angular information. Building upon the proposed PFE, we then leverage the intrinsic linear imaging model of the coded aperture camera to construct a cycle-consistent 4-D LF reconstruction network from coded measurements. Moreover, we incorporate PFE into an iterative optimization framework for 4-D LF denoising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our methods on both real-world and synthetic 4-D LF images, both quantitatively and qualitatively, when compared with state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/lyuxianqiang/LFCA-CR-NET.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios we often need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is an adequate method to do so, but usually requires datasets labeled for all tasks. We propose a method that can leverage datasets labeled for only some of the tasks in the MTL framework. Our work, Knowledge Assembly (KA), learns multiple tasks from disjoint datasets by leveraging the unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner, using model augmentation for pseudo-supervision. Whilst KA can be implemented on any existing MTL networks, we test our method on jointly learning person re-identification (reID) and pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR). We surpass the single task fully-supervised performance by $4.2\%$ points for reID and $0.9\%$ points for PAR.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a tremendous surge in capabilities thanks to the use of foundation models trained on internet-scale data. On the flip side, the uncurated nature of internet-scale data also poses significant privacy and legal risks, as they often contain personal information or copyrighted material that should not be trained on without permission. In this work, we propose as a mitigation measure a recipe to train foundation vision models with differential privacy (DP) guarantee. We identify masked autoencoders as a suitable learning algorithm that aligns well with DP-SGD, and train ViP -- a Vision transformer with differential Privacy -- under a strict privacy budget of $\epsilon=8$ on the LAION400M dataset. We evaluate the quality of representation learned by ViP using standard downstream vision tasks; in particular, ViP achieves a (non-private) linear probing accuracy of $55.7\%$ on ImageNet, comparable to that of end-to-end trained AlexNet (trained and evaluated on ImageNet). Our result suggests that scaling to internet-scale data can be practical for private learning. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/ViP-MAE}.

- **Summary**: Automatic surgical phase recognition is one of the key technologies to support Video-Based Assessment (VBA) systems for surgical education. Utilizing temporal information is crucial for surgical phase recognition, hence various recent approaches extract frame-level features to conduct full video temporal modeling. For better temporal modeling, we propose SlowFast Temporal Modeling Network (SF-TMN) for surgical phase recognition that can not only achieve frame-level full video temporal modeling but also achieve segment-level full video temporal modeling. We employ a feature extraction network, pre-trained on the target dataset, to extract features from video frames as the training data for SF-TMN. The Slow Path in SF-TMN utilizes all frame features for frame temporal modeling. The Fast Path in SF-TMN utilizes segment-level features summarized from frame features for segment temporal modeling. The proposed paradigm is flexible regarding the choice of temporal modeling networks. We explore MS-TCN and ASFormer models as temporal modeling networks and experiment with multiple combination strategies for Slow and Fast Paths. We evaluate SF-TMN on Cholec80 surgical phase recognition task and demonstrate that SF-TMN can achieve state-of-the-art results on all considered metrics. SF-TMN with ASFormer backbone outperforms the state-of-the-art Not End-to-End(TCN) method by 2.6% in accuracy and 7.4% in the Jaccard score. We also evaluate SF-TMN on action segmentation datasets including 50salads, GTEA, and Breakfast, and achieve state-of-the-art results. The improvement in the results shows that combining temporal information from both frame level and segment level by refining outputs with temporal refinement stages is beneficial for the temporal modeling of surgical phases.

We claim the challenges in motion style transfer and encourage future work in this domain by releasing the proposed motion dataset both to the public and the market. We conduct a comprehensive study on motion style transfer in the experiment using the state-of-the-art method, and the results show the proposed dataset's validity for the motion style transfer task.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Autonomous driving presents many challenges due to the large number of scenarios the autonomous vehicle (AV) may encounter. End-to-end deep learning models are comparatively simplistic models that can handle a broad set of scenarios. However, end-to-end models require large amounts of diverse data to perform well. This paper presents a novel deep neural network that performs image-to-steering path navigation that helps with the data problem by adding one-shot learning to the system. Presented with a previously unseen path, the vehicle can drive the path autonomously after being shown the path once and without model retraining. In fact, the full path is not needed and images of the road junctions is sufficient. In-vehicle testing and offline testing are used to verify the performance of the proposed navigation and to compare different candidate architectures.

  https://github.com/RoyiRa/Syntax-Guided-Generation
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Text-conditioned image generation models often generate incorrect associations between entities and their visual attributes. This reflects an impaired mapping between linguistic binding of entities and modifiers in the prompt and visual binding of the corresponding elements in the generated image. As one notable example, a query like ``a pink sunflower and a yellow flamingo'' may incorrectly produce an image of a yellow sunflower and a pink flamingo. To remedy this issue, we propose SynGen, an approach which first syntactically analyses the prompt to identify entities and their modifiers, and then uses a novel loss function that encourages the cross-attention maps to agree with the linguistic binding reflected by the syntax. Specifically, we encourage large overlap between attention maps of entities and their modifiers, and small overlap with other entities and modifier words. The loss is optimized during inference, without retraining or fine-tuning the model. Human evaluation on three datasets, including one new and challenging set, demonstrate significant improvements of SynGen compared with current state of the art methods. This work highlights how making use of sentence structure during inference can efficiently and substantially improve the faithfulness of text-to-image generation.

- **Summary**: Occlusion problem remains a key challenge in Optical Flow Estimation (OFE) despite the recent significant progress brought by deep learning in the field. Most existing deep learning OFE methods, especially those based on two frames, cannot properly handle occlusions, in part because there is no significant feature similarity in occluded regions. The multi-frame settings have the potential to mitigate the occlusion issue in OFE. However, the problem of Multi-frame OFE (MOFE) remains underexplored, and the limited works are specially designed for pyramid backbones and obtain the aligned temporal information by time-consuming backward flow calculation or non-differentiable forward warping transformation. To address these shortcomings, we propose an efficient MOFE framework named SplatFlow, which is realized by introducing the differentiable splatting transformation to align the temporal information, designing a One-to-Many embedding method to densely guide the current frame's estimation, and further remodelling the existing two-frame backbones. The proposed SplatFlow is very efficient yet more accurate as it is able to handle occlusions properly. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our SplatFlow substantially outperforms all published methods on KITTI2015 and Sintel benchmarks. Especially on Sintel benchmark, SplatFlow achieves errors of 1.12 (clean pass) and 2.07 (final pass), with surprisingly significant 19.4% and 16.2% error reductions from the previous best results submitted, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/wwsource/SplatFlow.



### Revealing the Illusion of Joint Multimodal Understanding in VideoQA Models

- **Summary**: While VideoQA Transformer models demonstrate competitive performance on standard benchmarks, the reasons behind their success remain unclear. Do these models jointly capture and leverage the rich multimodal structures and dynamics from video and text? Or are they merely exploiting shortcuts to achieve high scores? We analyze this with $\textit{QUAG}$ (QUadrant AveraGe), a lightweight and non-parametric probe that systematically ablates the model's coupled multimodal understanding during inference. Surprisingly, QUAG reveals that the models manage to maintain high performance even when injected with multimodal sub-optimality. Additionally, even after replacing self-attention in multimodal fusion blocks with "QUAG-attention", a simplistic and less-expressive variant of self-attention, the models maintain high performance. This means that current VideoQA benchmarks and their metrics do not penalize shortcuts that discount joint multimodal understanding. Motivated by this, we propose the $\textit{CLAVI}$ (Counterfactual in LAnguage and VIdeo) benchmark, a diagnostic dataset for benchmarking coupled multimodal understanding in VideoQA through counterfactuals. CLAVI consists of temporal questions and videos that are augmented to curate balanced counterfactuals in language and video domains. Hence, it incentivizes, and identifies the reliability of learnt multimodal representations. We evaluate CLAVI and find that models achieve high performance on multimodal shortcut instances, but have very poor performance on the counterfactuals. Hence, we position CLAVI as a litmus test to identify, diagnose and improve the sub-optimality of learnt multimodal VideoQA representations which the current benchmarks are unable to assess.

- **Summary**: With the continuous growth of internet users and media content, it is very hard to track down hateful speech in audio and video. Converting video or audio into text does not detect hate speech accurately as human sometimes uses hateful words as humorous or pleasant in sense and also uses different voice tones or show different action in the video. The state-ofthe-art hate speech detection models were mostly developed on a single modality. In this research, a combined approach of multimodal system has been proposed to detect hate speech from video contents by extracting feature images, feature values extracted from the audio, text and used machine learning and Natural language processing.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their exceptional performance on downstream vision applications, particularly in the few- and zero-shot settings. However, selecting the best-performing VLM for some downstream applications is non-trivial, as it is dataset and task-dependent. Meanwhile, the exhaustive evaluation of all available VLMs on a novel application is not only time and computationally demanding but also necessitates the collection of a labeled dataset for evaluation. As the number of open-source VLM variants increases, there is a need for an efficient model selection strategy that does not require access to a curated evaluation dataset. This paper proposes a novel task and benchmark for efficiently evaluating VLMs' zero-shot performance on downstream applications without access to the downstream task dataset. Specifically, we introduce a new task LOVM: Language-Only Vision Model Selection, where methods are expected to perform both model selection and performance prediction based solely on a text description of the desired downstream application. We then introduced an extensive LOVM benchmark consisting of ground-truth evaluations of 35 pre-trained VLMs and 23 datasets, where methods are expected to rank the pre-trained VLMs and predict their zero-shot performance.

- **Summary**: Faithfully reconstructing 3D geometry and generating novel views of scenes are critical tasks in 3D computer vision. Despite the widespread use of image augmentations across computer vision applications, their potential remains underexplored when learning neural rendering methods (NRMs) for 3D scenes. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the use of image augmentations in NRMs, where we explore different augmentation strategies. We found that introducing image augmentations during training presents challenges such as geometric and photometric inconsistencies for learning NRMs from images. Specifically, geometric inconsistencies arise from alterations in shapes, positions, and orientations from the augmentations, disrupting spatial cues necessary for accurate 3D reconstruction. On the other hand, photometric inconsistencies arise from changes in pixel intensities introduced by the augmentations, affecting the ability to capture the underlying 3D structures of the scene. We alleviate these issues by focusing on color manipulations and introducing learnable appearance embeddings that allow NRMs to explain away photometric variations. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of incorporating augmentations when learning NRMs, including improved photometric quality and surface reconstruction, as well as enhanced robustness against data quality issues, such as reduced training data and image degradations.

- **Summary**: Masked autoencoder (MAE) is a promising self-supervised pre-training technique that can improve the representation learning of a neural network without human intervention. However, applying MAE directly to volumetric medical images poses two challenges: (i) a lack of global information that is crucial for understanding the clinical context of the holistic data, (ii) no guarantee of stabilizing the representations learned from randomly masked inputs. To address these limitations, we propose the \textbf{G}lobal-\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{M}asked \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (GL-MAE), a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training strategy. In addition to reconstructing masked local views, as in previous methods, GL-MAE incorporates global context learning by reconstructing masked global views. Furthermore, a complete global view is integrated as an anchor to guide the reconstruction and stabilize the learning process through global-to-global consistency learning and global-to-local consistency learning. Finetuning results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms, highlighting its effectiveness on versatile volumetric medical image segmentation tasks, even when annotations are scarce. Our codes and models will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Due to the light absorption and scattering induced by the water medium, underwater images usually suffer from some degradation problems, such as low contrast, color distortion, and blurring details, which aggravate the difficulty of downstream underwater understanding tasks. Therefore, how to obtain clear and visually pleasant images has become a common concern of people, and the task of underwater image enhancement (UIE) has also emerged as the times require. Among existing UIE methods, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based methods perform well in visual aesthetics, while the physical model-based methods have better scene adaptability. Inheriting the advantages of the above two types of models, we propose a physical model-guided GAN model for UIE in this paper, referred to as PUGAN. The entire network is under the GAN architecture. On the one hand, we design a Parameters Estimation subnetwork (Par-subnet) to learn the parameters for physical model inversion, and use the generated color enhancement image as auxiliary information for the Two-Stream Interaction Enhancement sub-network (TSIE-subnet). Meanwhile, we design a Degradation Quantization (DQ) module in TSIE-subnet to quantize scene degradation, thereby achieving reinforcing enhancement of key regions. On the other hand, we design the Dual-Discriminators for the style-content adversarial constraint, promoting the authenticity and visual aesthetics of the results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PUGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

- **Summary**: Change detection using earth observation data plays a vital role in quantifying the impact of disasters in affected areas. While data sources like Sentinel-2 provide rich optical information, they are often hindered by cloud cover, limiting their usage in disaster scenarios. However, leveraging pre-disaster optical data can offer valuable contextual information about the area such as landcover type, vegetation cover, soil types, enabling a better understanding of the disaster's impact. In this study, we develop a model to assess the contribution of pre-disaster Sentinel-2 data in change detection tasks, focusing on disaster-affected areas. The proposed Context-Aware Change Detection Network (CACDN) utilizes a combination of pre-disaster Sentinel-2 data, pre and post-disaster Sentinel-1 data and ancillary Digital Elevation Models (DEM) data. The model is validated on flood and landslide detection and evaluated using three metrics: Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Intersection over Union (IoU), and mean IoU. The preliminary results show significant improvement (4\%, AUPRC, 3-7\% IoU, 3-6\% mean IoU) in model's change detection capabilities when incorporated with pre-disaster optical data reflecting the effectiveness of using contextual information for accurate flood and landslide detection.

- **Summary**: Humans possess the ability to identify and generalize relevant features of natural objects, which aids them in various situations. To investigate this phenomenon and determine the most effective representations for predicting human behavior, we conducted two experiments involving category learning and reward learning. Our experiments used realistic images as stimuli, and participants were tasked with making accurate decisions based on novel stimuli for all trials, thereby necessitating generalization. In both tasks, the underlying rules were generated as simple linear functions using stimulus dimensions extracted from human similarity judgments. Notably, participants successfully identified the relevant stimulus features within a few trials, demonstrating effective generalization. We performed an extensive model comparison, evaluating the trial-by-trial predictive accuracy of diverse deep learning models' representations of human choices. Intriguingly, representations from models trained on both text and image data consistently outperformed models trained solely on images, even surpassing models using the features that generated the task itself. These findings suggest that language-aligned visual representations possess sufficient richness to describe human generalization in naturalistic settings and emphasize the role of language in shaping human cognition.

- **Summary**: UAV distance estimation plays an important role for path planning of swarm UAVs and collision avoidance. However, the lack of annotated data seriously hinder the related studies. In this paper, we build and present a UAVDE dataset for UAV distance estimation, in which distance between two UAVs is obtained by UWB sensors. During experiments, we surprisingly observe that the commonly used stereo triangulation can not stand for UAV scenes. The core reason is the position deviation issue of UAVs due to long shooting distance and camera vibration, which is common in UAV scenes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel position correction module (PCM), which can directly predict the offset between the image positions and the actual ones of UAVs and perform calculation compensation in stereo triangulation. Besides, to further boost performance on hard samples, we propose a dynamic iterative correction mechanism, which is composed of multiple stacked PCMs and a gating mechanism to adaptively determine whether further correction is required according to the difficulty of data samples. Consequently, the position deviation issue can be effectively alleviated. We conduct extensive experiments on UAVDE, and our proposed method can achieve a 38.84% performance improvement, which demonstrates its effectiveness and superiority. The code and dataset would be released.



### Exploring Resolution Fields for Scalable Image Compression with Uncertainty Guidance

- **Summary**: Recently, there are significant advancements in learning-based image compression methods surpassing traditional coding standards. Most of them prioritize achieving the best rate-distortion performance for a particular compression rate, which limits their flexibility and adaptability in various applications with complex and varying constraints. In this work, we explore the potential of resolution fields in scalable image compression and propose the reciprocal pyramid network (RPN) that fulfills the need for more adaptable and versatile compression. Specifically, RPN first builds a compression pyramid and generates the resolution fields at different levels in a top-down manner. The key design lies in the cross-resolution context mining module between adjacent levels, which performs feature enriching and distillation to mine meaningful contextualized information and remove unnecessary redundancy, producing informative resolution fields as residual priors. The scalability is achieved by progressive bitstream reusing and resolution field incorporation varying at different levels. Furthermore, between adjacent compression levels, we explicitly quantify the aleatoric uncertainty from the bottom decoded representations and develop an uncertainty-guided loss to update the upper-level compression parameters, forming a reverse pyramid process that enforces the network to focus on the textured pixels with high variance for more reliable and accurate reconstruction. Combining resolution field exploration and uncertainty guidance in a pyramid manner, RPN can effectively achieve spatial and quality scalable image compression. Experiments show the superiority of RPN against existing classical and deep learning-based scalable codecs. Code will be available at https://github.com/JGIroro/RPNSIC.

- **Summary**: Deep learning is the state-of-the-art for medical imaging tasks, but requires large, labeled datasets. For risk prediction, large datasets are rare since they require both imaging and follow-up (e.g., diagnosis codes). However, the release of publicly available imaging data with diagnostic labels presents an opportunity for self and semi-supervised approaches to improve label efficiency for risk prediction. Though several studies have compared self-supervised approaches in natural image classification, object detection, and medical image interpretation, there is limited data on which approaches learn robust representations for risk prediction. We present a comparison of semi- and self-supervised learning to predict mortality risk using chest x-ray images. We find that a semi-supervised autoencoder outperforms contrastive and transfer learning in internal and external validation.

- **Summary**: The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) has recently emerged as a foundation model for addressing image segmentation. Owing to the intrinsic complexity of medical images and the high annotation cost, the medical image segmentation (MIS) community has been encouraged to investigate SAM's zero-shot capabilities to facilitate automatic annotation. Inspired by the extraordinary accomplishments of interactive medical image segmentation (IMIS) paradigm, this paper focuses on assessing the potential of SAM's zero-shot capabilities within the IMIS paradigm to amplify its benefits in the MIS domain. Regrettably, we observe that SAM's vulnerability to prompt forms (e.g., points, bounding boxes) becomes notably pronounced in IMIS. This leads us to develop a framework that adaptively offers suitable prompt forms for human experts. We refer to the framework above as temporally-extended prompts optimization (TEPO) and model it as a Markov decision process, solvable through reinforcement learning. Numerical experiments on the standardized benchmark BraTS2020 demonstrate that the learned TEPO agent can further enhance SAM's zero-shot capability in the MIS context.

- **Summary**: Quantization and pruning are known to be two effective Deep Neural Networks model compression methods. In this paper, we propose Automatic Prune Binarization (APB), a novel compression technique combining quantization with pruning. APB enhances the representational capability of binary networks using a few full-precision weights. Our technique jointly maximizes the accuracy of the network while minimizing its memory impact by deciding whether each weight should be binarized or kept in full precision. We show how to efficiently perform a forward pass through layers compressed using APB by decomposing it into a binary and a sparse-dense matrix multiplication. Moreover, we design two novel efficient algorithms for extremely quantized matrix multiplication on CPU, leveraging highly efficient bitwise operations. The proposed algorithms are 6.9x and 1.5x faster than available state-of-the-art solutions. We perform an extensive evaluation of APB on two widely adopted model compression datasets, namely CIFAR10 and ImageNet. APB shows to deliver better accuracy/memory trade-off compared to state-of-the-art methods based on i) quantization, ii) pruning, and iii) combination of pruning and quantization. APB outperforms quantization also in the accuracy/efficiency trade-off, being up to 2x faster than the 2-bits quantized model with no loss in accuracy.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Advances in surgical phase recognition are generally led by training deeper networks. Rather than going further with a more complex solution, we believe that current models can be exploited better. We propose a self-knowledge distillation framework that can be integrated into current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models without requiring any extra complexity to the models or annotations.   Methods: Knowledge distillation is a framework for network regularization where knowledge is distilled from a teacher network to a student network. In self-knowledge distillation, the student model becomes the teacher such that the network learns from itself. Most phase recognition models follow an encoder-decoder framework. Our framework utilizes self-knowledge distillation in both stages. The teacher model guides the training process of the student model to extract enhanced feature representations from the encoder and build a more robust temporal decoder to tackle the over-segmentation problem.   Results: We validate our proposed framework on the public dataset Cholec80. Our framework is embedded on top of four popular SOTA approaches and consistently improves their performance. Specifically, our best GRU model boosts performance by +3.33% accuracy and +3.95% F1-score over the same baseline model.   Conclusion: We embed a self-knowledge distillation framework for the first time in the surgical phase recognition training pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that our simple yet powerful framework can improve performance of existing phase recognition models. Moreover, our extensive experiments show that even with 75% of the training set we still achieve performance on par with the same baseline model trained on the full set.

Our solution involves an efficient multi-stage framework that restores a high-quality image from distorted frames. Specifically, a frame selection algorithm based on sharpness is first utilized to select the sharpest set of distorted frames. Next, each frame in the selected frames is aligned to suppress geometric distortion through optical-flow-based image registration. Then, a region-based image fusion method with DT-CWT is utilized to mitigate the blur caused by the turbulence. Finally, a learning-based deartifacts method is applied to remove the artifacts in the fused image, generating a high-quality outuput. Our framework can handle both hot-air text dataset and turbulence text dataset provided in the final testing phase and achieved 1st place in text recognition accuracy.

- **Summary**: Learning effective spectral-spatial features is important for the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification task, but the majority of existing HSI classification methods still suffer from modeling complex spectral-spatial relations and characterizing low-level details and high-level semantics comprehensively. As a new class of record-breaking generative models, diffusion models are capable of modeling complex relations for understanding inputs well as learning both high-level and low-level visual features. Meanwhile, diffusion models can capture more abundant features by taking advantage of the extra and unique dimension of timestep t. In view of these, we propose an unsupervised spectral-spatial feature learning framework based on the diffusion model for HSI classification for the first time, named Diff-HSI. Specifically, we first pretrain the diffusion model with unlabeled HSI patches for unsupervised feature learning, and then exploit intermediate hierarchical features from different timesteps for classification. For better using the abundant timestep-wise features, we design a timestep-wise feature bank and a dynamic feature fusion module to construct timestep-wise features, adaptively learning informative multi-timestep representations. Finally, an ensemble of linear classifiers is applied to perform HSI classification. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public HSI datasets, and our results demonstrate that Diff-HSI outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods for HSI classification.

- **Summary**: Contemporary news reporting increasingly features multimedia content, motivating research on multimedia event extraction. However, the task lacks annotated multimodal training data and artificially generated training data suffer from distribution shift from real-world data. In this paper, we propose Cross-modality Augmented Multimedia Event Learning (CAMEL), which successfully utilizes artificially generated multimodal training data and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We start with two labeled unimodal datasets in text and image respectively, and generate the missing modality using off-the-shelf image generators like Stable Diffusion and image captioners like BLIP. After that, we train the network on the resultant multimodal datasets. In order to learn robust features that are effective across domains, we devise an iterative and gradual training strategy. Substantial experiments show that CAMEL surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on the M2E2 benchmark. On multimedia events in particular, we outperform the prior SOTA by 4.2% F1 on event mention identification and by 9.8% F1 on argument identification, which indicates that CAMEL learns synergistic representations from the two modalities. Our work demonstrates a recipe to unleash the power of synthetic training data in structured prediction.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of privacy leaks in federated learning, secure aggregation protocols that mainly adopt either homomorphic encryption or threshold secret sharing have been widely developed for federated learning to protect the privacy of the local training data of each client. However, these existing protocols suffer from many shortcomings, such as the dependence on a trusted third party, the vulnerability to clients being corrupted, low efficiency, the trade-off between security and fault tolerance, etc. To solve these disadvantages, we propose an efficient and multi-private key secure aggregation scheme for federated learning. Specifically, we skillfully modify the variant ElGamal encryption technique to achieve homomorphic addition operation, which has two important advantages: 1) The server and each client can freely select public and private keys without introducing a trust third party and 2) Compared to the variant ElGamal encryption, the plaintext space is relatively large, which is more suitable for the deep model. Besides, for the high dimensional deep model parameter, we introduce a super-increasing sequence to compress multi-dimensional data into 1-D, which can greatly reduce encryption and decryption times as well as communication for ciphertext transmission. Detailed security analyses show that our proposed scheme achieves the semantic security of both individual local gradients and the aggregated result while achieving optimal robustness in tolerating both client collusion and dropped clients. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the accuracy of our scheme is almost the same as the non-private approach, while the efficiency of our scheme is much better than the state-of-the-art homomorphic encryption-based secure aggregation schemes. More importantly, the efficiency advantages of our scheme will become increasingly prominent as the number of model parameters increases.

- **Summary**: In this technical report, we briefly introduce the solution of our team VIELab-HUST for coded target restoration through atmospheric turbulence in CVPR 2023 UG$^2$+ Track 2.2. In this task, we propose an efficient multi-stage framework to restore a high quality image from distorted frames. Specifically, each distorted frame is initially aligned using image registration to suppress geometric distortion. We subsequently select the sharpest set of registered frames by employing a frame selection approach based on image sharpness, and average them to produce an image that is largely free of geometric distortion, albeit with blurriness. A learning-based deblurring method is then applied to remove the residual blur in the averaged image. Finally, post-processing techniques are utilized to further enhance the quality of the output image. Our framework is capable of handling different kinds of coded target dataset provided in the final testing phase, and ranked 1st on the final leaderboard. Our code will be available at https://github.com/xsqhust/Turbulence_Removal.

- **Summary**: Robustly and accurately localizing objects in real-world environments can be challenging due to noisy data, hardware limitations, and the inherent randomness of physical systems. To account for these factors, existing works estimate the aleatoric uncertainty of object detectors by modeling their localization output as a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\,\sigma^{2})\,$, and training with loss attenuation. We identify three aspects that are unaddressed in the state of the art, but warrant further exploration: (1) the efficient and mathematically sound propagation of $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\,\sigma^{2})\,$ through non-linear post-processing, (2) the calibration of the predicted uncertainty, and (3) its interpretation. We overcome these limitations by: (1) implementing loss attenuation in EfficientDet, and proposing two deterministic methods for the exact and fast propagation of the output distribution, (2) demonstrating on the KITTI and BDD100K datasets that the predicted uncertainty is miscalibrated, and adapting two calibration methods to the localization task, and (3) investigating the correlation between aleatoric uncertainty and task-relevant error sources. Our contributions are: (1) up to five times faster propagation while increasing localization performance by up to 1\%, (2) up to fifteen times smaller expected calibration error, and (3) the predicted uncertainty is found to correlate with occlusion, object distance, detection accuracy, and image quality.

- **Summary**: We propose a new generative hierarchical clustering model that learns a flexible tree-based posterior distribution over latent variables. The proposed Tree Variational Autoencoder (TreeVAE) hierarchically divides samples according to their intrinsic characteristics, shedding light on hidden structure in the data. It adapts its architecture to discover the optimal tree for encoding dependencies between latent variables. The proposed tree-based generative architecture permits lightweight conditional inference and improves generative performance by utilizing specialized leaf decoders. We show that TreeVAE uncovers underlying clusters in the data and finds meaningful hierarchical relations between the different groups on a variety of datasets, including real-world imaging data. We present empirically that TreeVAE provides a more competitive log-likelihood lower bound than the sequential counterparts. Finally, due to its generative nature, TreeVAE is able to generate new samples from the discovered clusters via conditional sampling.

- **Summary**: To be widely adopted, 3D facial avatars need to be animated easily, realistically, and directly, from speech signals. While the best recent methods generate 3D animations that are synchronized with the input audio, they largely ignore the impact of emotions on facial expressions. Instead, their focus is on modeling the correlations between speech and facial motion, resulting in animations that are unemotional or do not match the input emotion. We observe that there are two contributing factors resulting in facial animation - the speech and the emotion. We exploit these insights in EMOTE (Expressive Model Optimized for Talking with Emotion), which generates 3D talking head avatars that maintain lip sync while enabling explicit control over the expression of emotion. Due to the absence of high-quality aligned emotional 3D face datasets with speech, EMOTE is trained from an emotional video dataset (i.e., MEAD). To achieve this, we match speech-content between generated sequences and target videos differently from emotion content. Specifically, we train EMOTE with additional supervision in the form of a lip-reading objective to preserve the speech-dependent content (spatially local and high temporal frequency), while utilizing emotion supervision on a sequence-level (spatially global and low frequency). Furthermore, we employ a content-emotion exchange mechanism in order to supervise different emotion on the same audio, while maintaining the lip motion synchronized with the speech. To employ deep perceptual losses without getting undesirable artifacts, we devise a motion prior in form of a temporal VAE. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and perceptual evaluations demonstrate that EMOTE produces state-of-the-art speech-driven facial animations, with lip sync on par with the best methods while offering additional, high-quality emotional control.

- **Summary**: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the EPIC-SOUNDS Audio-Based Interaction Recognition Challenge 2023, by Team "AcieLee" (username: Yuqi\_Li). The task is to classify the audio caused by interactions between objects, or from events of the camera wearer. We conducted exhaustive experiments and found learning rate step decay, backbone frozen, label smoothing and focal loss contribute most to the performance improvement. After training, we combined multiple models from different stages and integrated them into a single model by assigning fusion weights. This proposed method allowed us to achieve 3rd place in the CVPR 2023 workshop of EPIC-SOUNDS Audio-Based Interaction Recognition Challenge.

- **Summary**: Momentum has become a crucial component in deep learning optimizers, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of when and why it accelerates stochastic gradient descent (SGD). To address the question of ''when'', we establish a meaningful comparison framework that examines the performance of SGD with Momentum (SGDM) under the \emph{effective learning rates} $\eta_{ef}$, a notion unifying the influence of momentum coefficient $\mu$ and batch size $b$ over learning rate $\eta$. In the comparison of SGDM and SGD with the same effective learning rate and the same batch size, we observe a consistent pattern: when $\eta_{ef}$ is small, SGDM and SGD experience almost the same empirical training losses; when $\eta_{ef}$ surpasses a certain threshold, SGDM begins to perform better than SGD. Furthermore, we observe that the advantage of SGDM over SGD becomes more pronounced with a larger batch size. For the question of ``why'', we find that the momentum acceleration is closely related to \emph{abrupt sharpening} which is to describe a sudden jump of the directional Hessian along the update direction. Specifically, the misalignment between SGD and SGDM happens at the same moment that SGD experiences abrupt sharpening and converges slower. Momentum improves the performance of SGDM by preventing or deferring the occurrence of abrupt sharpening. Together, this study unveils the interplay between momentum, learning rates, and batch sizes, thus improving our understanding of momentum acceleration.

- **Summary**: Semantic scene completion (SSC) is crucial for holistic 3D scene understanding by jointly estimating semantics and geometry from sparse observations. However, progress in SSC, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios, is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To overcome this challenge, we introduce SSCBench, a comprehensive benchmark that integrates scenes from widely-used automotive datasets (e.g., KITTI-360, nuScenes, and Waymo). SSCBench follows an established setup and format in the community, facilitating the easy exploration of the camera- and LiDAR-based SSC across various real-world scenarios. We present quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art algorithms on SSCBench and commit to continuously incorporating novel automotive datasets and SSC algorithms to drive further advancements in this field.

- **Summary**: A major challenge in the segmentation of medical images is the large inter- and intra-observer variability in annotations provided by multiple experts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for multi-expert prediction using diffusion models. Our method leverages the diffusion-based approach to incorporate information from multiple annotations and fuse it into a unified segmentation map that reflects the consensus of multiple experts. We evaluate the performance of our method on several datasets of medical segmentation annotated by multiple experts and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tomeramit/Annotator-Consensus-Prediction.

- **Summary**: By default neural networks are not robust to changes in data distribution. This has been demonstrated with simple image corruptions, such as blurring or adding noise, degrading image classification performance. Many methods have been proposed to mitigate these issues but for the most part models are evaluated on single corruptions. In reality, visual space is compositional in nature, that is, that as well as robustness to elemental corruptions, robustness to compositions of corruptions is also needed. In this work we develop a compositional image classification task where, given a few elemental corruptions, models are asked to generalize to compositions of these corruptions. That is, to achieve compositional robustness. We experimentally compare empirical risk minimization with an invariance building pairwise contrastive loss and, counter to common intuitions in domain generalization, achieve only marginal improvements in compositional robustness by encouraging invariance. To move beyond invariance, following previously proposed inductive biases that model architectures should reflect data structure, we introduce a modular architecture whose structure replicates the compositional nature of the task. We then show that this modular approach consistently achieves better compositional robustness than non-modular approaches. We additionally find empirical evidence that the degree of invariance between representations of 'in-distribution' elemental corruptions fails to correlate with robustness to 'out-of-distribution' compositions of corruptions.

- **Summary**: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow and haze) is a fundamental computer vision problem and has important indications for various downstream applications. Different from early methods that are specially designed for specific type of weather, most recent works tend to remove various adverse weather effects simultaneously through either spatial feature representation learning or semantic information embedding. Inspired by the various successful applications of large-scale pre-trained models (e.g, CLIP), in this paper, we explore the potential benefits of them for this task through both spatial feature representation learning and semantic information embedding aspects: 1) for spatial feature representation learning, we design a Spatially-Adaptive Residual (\textbf{SAR}) Encoder to extract degraded areas adaptively. To facilitate its training, we propose a Soft Residual Distillation (\textbf{CLIP-SRD}) strategy to transfer the spatial knowledge from CLIP between clean and adverse weather images; 2) for semantic information embedding, we propose a CLIP Weather Prior (\textbf{CWP}) embedding module to make the network handle different weather conditions adaptively. This module integrates the sample specific weather prior extracted by CLIP image encoder together with the distribution specific information learned by a set of parameters, and embeds them through a cross attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different and challenging adverse weather conditions. Code will be made available.

- **Summary**: We propose a method for annotating videos of complex multi-object scenes with a globally-consistent 3D representation of the objects. We annotate each object with a CAD model from a database, and place it in the 3D coordinate frame of the scene with a 9-DoF pose transformation. Our method is semi-automatic and works on commonly-available RGB videos, without requiring a depth sensor. Many steps are performed automatically, and the tasks performed by humans are simple, well-specified, and require only limited reasoning in 3D. This makes them feasible for crowd-sourcing and has allowed us to construct a large-scale dataset by annotating real-estate videos from YouTube. Our dataset CAD-Estate offers 101k instances of 12k unique CAD models placed in the 3D representations of 20k videos. In comparison to Scan2CAD, the largest existing dataset with CAD model annotations on real scenes, CAD-Estate has 7x more instances and 4x more unique CAD models. We showcase the benefits of pre-training a Mask2CAD model on CAD-Estate for the task of automatic 3D object reconstruction and pose estimation, demonstrating that it leads to performance improvements on the popular Scan2CAD benchmark. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-research/cad-estate.

- **Summary**: Large-scale visual localization systems continue to rely on 3D point clouds built from image collections using structure-from-motion. While the 3D points in these models are represented using local image features, directly matching a query image's local features against the point cloud is challenging due to the scale of the nearest-neighbor search problem. Many recent approaches to visual localization have thus proposed a hybrid method, where first a global (per image) embedding is used to retrieve a small subset of database images, and local features of the query are matched only against those. It seems to have become common belief that global embeddings are critical for said image-retrieval in visual localization, despite the significant downside of having to compute two feature types for each query image. In this paper, we take a step back from this assumption and propose Constrained Approximate Nearest Neighbors (CANN), a joint solution of k-nearest-neighbors across both the geometry and appearance space using only local features. We first derive the theoretical foundation for k-nearest-neighbor retrieval across multiple metrics and then showcase how CANN improves visual localization. Our experiments on public localization benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art global feature-based retrieval and approaches using local feature aggregation schemes. Moreover, it is an order of magnitude faster in both index and query time than feature aggregation schemes for these datasets. Code will be released.

- **Summary**: The major goal of this paper is to use image enhancement techniques for enhancing and extracting data in FANET applications to improve the efficiency of surveillance. The proposed conceptual system design can improve the likelihood of FANET operations in oil pipeline surveillance, and sports and media coverage with the ultimate goal of providing efficient services to those who are interested. The system architecture model is based on current scientific principles and developing technologies. A FANET, which is capable of gathering image data from video-enabled drones, and an image processing system that permits data collection and analysis are the two primary components of the system. Based on the image processing technique, a proof of concept for efficient data extraction and enhancement in FANET situations and possible services is illustrated.

- **Summary**: Explainable AI aims to render model behavior understandable by humans, which can be seen as an intermediate step in extracting causal relations from correlative patterns. Due to the high risk of possible fatal decisions in image-based clinical diagnostics, it is necessary to integrate explainable AI into these safety-critical systems. Current explanatory methods typically assign attribution scores to pixel regions in the input image, indicating their importance for a model's decision. However, they fall short when explaining why a visual feature is used. We propose a framework that utilizes interpretable disentangled representations for downstream-task prediction. Through visualizing the disentangled representations, we enable experts to investigate possible causation effects by leveraging their domain knowledge. Additionally, we deploy a multi-path attribution mapping for enriching and validating explanations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a synthetic benchmark suite and two medical datasets. We show that the framework not only acts as a catalyst for causal relation extraction but also enhances model robustness by enabling shortcut detection without the need for testing under distribution shifts.

- **Summary**: This technical report introduces the winning solution of the team \textit{Segment Any Anomaly} for the CVPR2023 Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) challenge. Going beyond uni-modal prompt, \textit{e.g.}, language prompt, we present a novel framework, \textit{i.e.}, Segment Any Anomaly + (SAA$+$), for zero-shot anomaly segmentation with multi-modal prompts for the regularization of cascaded modern foundation models. Inspired by the great zero-shot generalization ability of foundation models like Segment Anything, we first explore their assembly (SAA) to leverage diverse multi-modal prior knowledge for anomaly localization. Subsequently, we further introduce multimodal prompts (SAA$+$) derived from domain expert knowledge and target image context to enable the non-parameter adaptation of foundation models to anomaly segmentation. The proposed SAA$+$ model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several anomaly segmentation benchmarks, including VisA and MVTec-AD, in the zero-shot setting. We will release the code of our winning solution for the CVPR2023 VAND challenge at \href{Segment-Any-Anomaly}{https://github.com/caoyunkang/Segment-Any-Anomaly} \footnote{The extended-version paper with more details is available at ~\cite{cao2023segment}.}

- **Summary**: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) presents itself as a highly debilitating disorder. The disorder has common associations with the prefrontal cortex and the glutamate receptor known as Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 (mGluR5). This receptor has been observed to demonstrate higher levels of signaling from positron emission tomography scans measured by its distribution volume ratios in mice. Despite this evidence, studies are unable to fully verify the involvement of mGluR5 as more empirical data is needed. Computational modeling methods were used as a means of validation for previous hypotheses involving mGluR5. The inadequacies in relation to the causal factor of OCD were answered by utilizing T1 resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (TRS-MRI) scans of patients suffering from schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Because comorbid cases often occur within these disorders, cross-comparative abilities become necessary to find distinctive characteristics. Two-dimensional convolutional neural networks alongside ResNet50 and MobileNet models were constructed and evaluated for efficiency. Activation heatmaps of TRS-MRI scans were outputted, allowing for transcriptomics analysis. Though, a lack of ability to predict OCD cases prevented gene expression analysis. Across all models, there was an 88.75% validation accuracy for MDD, and 82.08% validation accuracy for SZD under the framework of ResNet50 as well as novel computation. OCD yielded an accuracy rate of around 54.4%. These results provided further evidence for the p-factor theory regarding mental disorders. Future work involves the application of alternate transfer learning networks than those used in this paper to bolster accuracy rates.

- **Summary**: Indoor rooms are among the most common use cases in 3D scene understanding. Current state-of-the-art methods for this task are driven by large annotated datasets. Room layouts are especially important, consisting of structural elements in 3D, such as wall, floor, and ceiling. However, they are difficult to annotate, especially on pure RGB video. We propose a novel method to produce generic 3D room layouts just from 2D segmentation masks, which are easy to annotate for humans. Based on these 2D annotations, we automatically reconstruct 3D plane equations for the structural elements and their spatial extent in the scene, and connect adjacent elements at the appropriate contact edges. We annotate and publicly release 2266 3D room layouts on the RealEstate10k dataset, containing YouTube videos. We demonstrate the high quality of these 3D layouts annotations with extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: Event cameras triggered a paradigm shift in the computer vision community delineated by their asynchronous nature, low latency, and high dynamic range. Calibration of event cameras is always essential to account for the sensor intrinsic parameters and for 3D perception. However, conventional image-based calibration techniques are not applicable due to the asynchronous, binary output of the sensor. The current standard for calibrating event cameras relies on either blinking patterns or event-based image reconstruction algorithms. These approaches are difficult to deploy in factory settings and are affected by noise and artifacts degrading the calibration performance. To bridge these limitations, we present E-Calib, a novel, fast, robust, and accurate calibration toolbox for event cameras utilizing the asymmetric circle grid, for its robustness to out-of-focus scenes. The proposed method is tested in a variety of rigorous experiments for different event camera models, on circle grids with different geometric properties, and under challenging illumination conditions. The results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in detection success rate, reprojection error, and estimation accuracy of extrinsic parameters.

- **Summary**: Due to the limited scale and quality of video-text training corpus, most vision-language foundation models employ image-text datasets for pretraining and primarily focus on modeling visually semantic representations while disregarding temporal semantic representations and correlations. To address this issue, we propose COSA, a COncatenated SAmple pretrained vision-language foundation model. COSA jointly models visual contents and event-level temporal cues using only image-text corpora. We achieve this by sequentially concatenating multiple image-text pairs as inputs for pretraining. This transformation effectively converts existing image-text corpora into a pseudo long-form video-paragraph corpus, enabling richer scene transformations and explicit event-description correspondence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COSA consistently improves performance across a broad range of downstream tasks, including long-form/short-form video-text tasks and image-text tasks such as retrieval, captioning, and question answering. Notably, COSA achieves state-of-the-art results on various competitive benchmarks. Code and model are released at https://github.com/TXH-mercury/COSA.

- **Summary**: Poster layout is a crucial aspect of poster design. Prior methods primarily focus on the correlation between visual content and graphic elements. However, a pleasant layout should also consider the relationship between visual and textual contents and the relationship between elements. In this study, we introduce a relation-aware diffusion model for poster layout generation that incorporates these two relationships in the generation process. Firstly, we devise a visual-textual relation-aware module that aligns the visual and textual representations across modalities, thereby enhancing the layout's efficacy in conveying textual information. Subsequently, we propose a geometry relation-aware module that learns the geometry relationship between elements by comprehensively considering contextual information. Additionally, the proposed method can generate diverse layouts based on user constraints. To advance research in this field, we have constructed a poster layout dataset named CGL-Dataset V2. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CGL-Dataset V2. The data and code will be available at https://github.com/liuan0803/RADM.

- **Summary**: Although instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various NLP tasks, their effectiveness on other data modalities beyond text has not been fully studied. In this work, we propose Macaw-LLM, a novel multi-modal LLM that seamlessly integrates visual, audio, and textual information. Macaw-LLM consists of three main components: a modality module for encoding multi-modal data, a cognitive module for harnessing pretrained LLMs, and an alignment module for harmonizing diverse representations. Our novel alignment module seamlessly bridges multi-modal features to textual features, simplifying the adaptation process from the modality modules to the cognitive module. In addition, we construct a large-scale multi-modal instruction dataset in terms of multi-turn dialogue, including 69K image instances and 50K video instances. We have made our data, code and model publicly available, which we hope can pave the way for future research in multi-modal LLMs and expand the capabilities of LLMs to handle diverse data modalities and address complex real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: To overcome the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets, unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been proposed for semantic segmentation. Majority of the previous approaches have attempted to reduce the gap either at the pixel or feature level, disregarding the fact that the two components interact positively. To address this, we present CONtrastive FEaTure and pIxel alignment (CONFETI) for bridging the domain gap at both the pixel and feature levels using a unique contrastive formulation. We introduce well-estimated prototypes by including category-wise cross-domain information to link the two alignments: the pixel-level alignment is achieved using the jointly trained style transfer module with the prototypical semantic consistency, while the feature-level alignment is enforced to cross-domain features with the \textbf{pixel-to-prototype contrast}. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods using DeepLabV2. Our code is available at https://github.com/cxa9264/CONFETI

- **Summary**: Recent advances in neural reconstruction enable high-quality 3D object reconstruction from casually captured image collections. Current techniques mostly analyze their progress on relatively simple image collections where Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques can provide ground-truth (GT) camera poses. We note that SfM techniques tend to fail on in-the-wild image collections such as image search results with varying backgrounds and illuminations. To enable systematic research progress on 3D reconstruction from casual image captures, we propose NAVI: a new dataset of category-agnostic image collections of objects with high-quality 3D scans along with per-image 2D-3D alignments providing near-perfect GT camera parameters. These 2D-3D alignments allow us to extract accurate derivative annotations such as dense pixel correspondences, depth and segmentation maps. We demonstrate the use of NAVI image collections on different problem settings and show that NAVI enables more thorough evaluations that were not possible with existing datasets. We believe NAVI is beneficial for systematic research progress on 3D reconstruction and correspondence estimation. Project page: https://navidataset.github.io

- **Summary**: Intrathoracic airway segmentation in computed tomography (CT) is a prerequisite for various respiratory disease analyses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and lung cancer. Unlike other organs with simpler shapes or topology, the airway's complex tree structure imposes an unbearable burden to generate the "ground truth" label (up to 7 or 3 hours of manual or semi-automatic annotation on each case). Most of the existing airway datasets are incompletely labeled/annotated, thus limiting the completeness of computer-segmented airway. In this paper, we propose a new anatomy-aware multi-class airway segmentation method enhanced by topology-guided iterative self-learning. Based on the natural airway anatomy, we formulate a simple yet highly effective anatomy-aware multi-class segmentation task to intuitively handle the severe intra-class imbalance of the airway. To solve the incomplete labeling issue, we propose a tailored self-iterative learning scheme to segment toward the complete airway tree. For generating pseudo-labels to achieve higher sensitivity , we introduce a novel breakage attention map and design a topology-guided pseudo-label refinement method by iteratively connecting breaking branches commonly existed from initial pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four datasets including two public challenges. The proposed method ranked 1st in both EXACT'09 challenge using average score and ATM'22 challenge on weighted average score. In a public BAS dataset and a private lung cancer dataset, our method significantly improves previous leading approaches by extracting at least (absolute) 7.5% more detected tree length and 4.0% more tree branches, while maintaining similar precision.

- **Summary**: In this technical report, we present our solution, named UniOCC, for the Vision-Centric 3D occupancy prediction track in the nuScenes Open Dataset Challenge at CVPR 2023. Existing methods for occupancy prediction primarily focus on optimizing projected features on 3D volume space using 3D occupancy labels. However, the generation process of these labels is complex and expensive (relying on 3D semantic annotations), and limited by voxel resolution, they cannot provide fine-grained spatial semantics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Unifying Occupancy (UniOcc) prediction method, explicitly imposing spatial geometry constraint and complementing fine-grained semantic supervision through volume ray rendering. Our method significantly enhances model performance and demonstrates promising potential in reducing human annotation costs. Given the laborious nature of annotating 3D occupancy, we further introduce a Depth-aware Teacher Student (DTS) framework to enhance prediction accuracy using unlabeled data. Our solution achieves 51.27\% mIoU on the official leaderboard with single model, placing 3rd in this challenge.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks in the physical world, particularly patch attacks, pose significant threats to the robustness and reliability of deep learning models. Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks is crucial for real-world applications, yet current research in this area is severely lacking. In this paper, we propose DIFFender, a novel defense method that leverages the pre-trained diffusion model to perform both localization and defense against potential adversarial patch attacks. DIFFender is designed as a pipeline consisting of two main stages: patch localization and restoration. In the localization stage, we exploit the intriguing properties of a diffusion model to effectively identify the locations of adversarial patches. In the restoration stage, we employ a text-guided diffusion model to eliminate adversarial regions in the image while preserving the integrity of the visual content. Additionally, we design a few-shot prompt-tuning algorithm to facilitate simple and efficient tuning, enabling the learned representations to easily transfer to downstream tasks, which optimize two stages jointly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification and face recognition to demonstrate that DIFFender exhibits superior robustness under strong adaptive attacks and generalizes well across various scenarios, diverse classifiers, and multiple attack methods.

- **Summary**: While direction of arrival (DOA) of sound events is generally estimated from multichannel audio data recorded in a microphone array, sound events usually derive from visually perceptible source objects, e.g., sounds of footsteps come from the feet of a walker. This paper proposes an audio-visual sound event localization and detection (SELD) task, which uses multichannel audio and video information to estimate the temporal activation and DOA of target sound events. Audio-visual SELD systems can detect and localize sound events using signals from a microphone array and audio-visual correspondence. We also introduce an audio-visual dataset, Sony-TAu Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2023 (STARSS23), which consists of multichannel audio data recorded with a microphone array, video data, and spatiotemporal annotation of sound events. Sound scenes in STARSS23 are recorded with instructions, which guide recording participants to ensure adequate activity and occurrences of sound events. STARSS23 also serves human-annotated temporal activation labels and human-confirmed DOA labels, which are based on tracking results of a motion capture system. Our benchmark results show that the audio-visual SELD system achieves lower localization error than the audio-only system. The data is available at https://zenodo.org/record/7880637.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel loss function for imbalanced classification. LDAM loss, which minimizes a margin-based generalization bound, is widely utilized for class-imbalanced image classification. Although, by using LDAM loss, it is possible to obtain large margins for the minority classes and small margins for the majority classes, the relevance to a large margin, which is included in the original softmax cross entropy loss, is not be clarified yet. In this study, we reconvert the formula of LDAM loss using the concept of the large margin softmax cross entropy loss based on the softplus function and confirm that LDAM loss includes a wider large margin than softmax cross entropy loss. Furthermore, we propose a novel Enlarged Large Margin (ELM) loss, which can further widen the large margin of LDAM loss. ELM loss utilizes the large margin for the maximum logit of the incorrect class in addition to the basic margin used in LDAM loss. Through experiments conducted on imbalanced CIFAR datasets and large-scale datasets with long-tailed distribution, we confirmed that classification accuracy was much improved compared with LDAM loss and conventional losses for imbalanced classification.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel object detector called DEYOv2, an improved version of the first-generation DEYO (DETR with YOLO) model. DEYOv2, similar to its predecessor, DEYOv2 employs a progressive reasoning approach to accelerate model training and enhance performance. The study delves into the limitations of one-to-one matching in optimization and proposes solutions to effectively address the issue, such as Rank Feature and Greedy Matching. This approach enables the third stage of DEYOv2 to maximize information acquisition from the first and second stages without needing NMS, achieving end-to-end optimization. By combining dense queries, sparse queries, one-to-many matching, and one-to-one matching, DEYOv2 leverages the advantages of each method. It outperforms all existing query-based end-to-end detectors under the same settings. When using ResNet-50 as the backbone and multi-scale features on the COCO dataset, DEYOv2 achieves 51.1 AP and 51.8 AP in 12 and 24 epochs, respectively. Compared to the end-to-end model DINO, DEYOv2 provides significant performance gains of 2.1 AP and 1.4 AP in the two epoch settings. To the best of our knowledge, DEYOv2 is the first fully end-to-end object detector that combines the respective strengths of classical detectors and query-based detectors.

- **Summary**: Humans navigate in their environment by learning a mental model of the world through passive observation and active interaction. Their world model allows them to anticipate what might happen next and act accordingly with respect to an underlying objective. Such world models hold strong promises for planning in complex environments like in autonomous driving. A human driver, or a self-driving system, perceives their surroundings with their eyes or their cameras. They infer an internal representation of the world which should: (i) have spatial memory (e.g. occlusions), (ii) fill partially observable or noisy inputs (e.g. when blinded by sunlight), and (iii) be able to reason about unobservable events probabilistically (e.g. predict different possible futures). They are embodied intelligent agents that can predict, plan, and act in the physical world through their world model. In this thesis we present a general framework to train a world model and a policy, parameterised by deep neural networks, from camera observations and expert demonstrations. We leverage important computer vision concepts such as geometry, semantics, and motion to scale world models to complex urban driving scenes.   First, we propose a model that predicts important quantities in computer vision: depth, semantic segmentation, and optical flow. We then use 3D geometry as an inductive bias to operate in the bird's-eye view space. We present for the first time a model that can predict probabilistic future trajectories of dynamic agents in bird's-eye view from 360{\deg} surround monocular cameras only. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of learning a world model in closed-loop driving. Our model can jointly predict static scene, dynamic scene, and ego-behaviour in an urban driving environment.

- **Summary**: Score-matching and diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models for both conditional and unconditional generation. Classifier-guided diffusion models are created by training a classifier on samples obtained from the forward-diffusion process (i.e., from data to noise). In this paper, we propose denoising-assisted (DA) classifiers wherein the diffusion classifier is trained using both noisy and denoised examples as simultaneous inputs to the model. We differentiate between denoising-assisted (DA) classifiers and noisy classifiers, which are diffusion classifiers that are only trained on noisy examples. Our experiments on Cifar10 and Imagenet show that DA-classifiers improve over noisy classifiers both quantitatively in terms of generalization to test data and qualitatively in terms of perceptually-aligned classifier-gradients and generative modeling metrics. Finally, we describe a semi-supervised framework for training diffusion classifiers and our experiments, that also include positive-unlabeled settings, demonstrate improved generalization of DA-classifiers over noisy classifiers.

- **Summary**: Cracks provide an essential indicator of infrastructure performance degradation, and achieving high-precision pixel-level crack segmentation is an issue of concern. Unlike the common research paradigms that adopt novel artificial intelligence (AI) methods directly, this paper examines the inherent characteristics of cracks so as to introduce boundary features into crack identification and then builds a boundary guidance crack segmentation model (BGCrack) with targeted structures and modules, including a high frequency module, global information modeling module, joint optimization module, etc. Extensive experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed designs and the effectiveness of the edge information in improving segmentation results. In addition, considering that notable open-source datasets mainly consist of asphalt pavement cracks because of ease of access, there is no standard and widely recognized dataset yet for steel structures, one of the primary structural forms in civil infrastructure. This paper provides a steel crack dataset that establishes a unified and fair benchmark for the identification of steel cracks.

- **Summary**: Food image segmentation is an important task that has ubiquitous applications, such as estimating the nutritional value of a plate of food. Although machine learning models have been used for segmentation in this domain, food images pose several challenges. One challenge is that food items can overlap and mix, making them difficult to distinguish. Another challenge is the degree of inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, which is caused by the varying preparation methods and dishes a food item may be served in. Additionally, class imbalance is an inevitable issue in food datasets. To address these issues, two models are trained and compared, one based on convolutional neural networks and the other on Bidirectional Encoder representation for Image Transformers (BEiT). The models are trained and valuated using the FoodSeg103 dataset, which is identified as a robust benchmark for food image segmentation. The BEiT model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by achieving a mean intersection over union of 49.4 on FoodSeg103. This study provides insights into transfering knowledge using convolution and Transformer-based approaches in the food image domain.

- **Summary**: We propose Encyclopedic-VQA, a large scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset featuring visual questions about detailed properties of fine-grained categories and instances. It contains 221k unique question+answer pairs each matched with (up to) 5 images, resulting in a total of 1M VQA samples. Moreover, our dataset comes with a controlled knowledge base derived from Wikipedia, marking the evidence to support each answer. Empirically, we show that our dataset poses a hard challenge for large vision+language models as they perform poorly on our dataset: PaLI [14] is state-of-the-art on OK-VQA [37], yet it only achieves 13.0% accuracy on our dataset. Moreover, we experimentally show that progress on answering our encyclopedic questions can be achieved by augmenting large models with a mechanism that retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base. An oracle experiment with perfect retrieval achieves 87.0% accuracy on the single-hop portion of our dataset, and an automatic retrieval-augmented prototype yields 48.8%. We believe that our dataset enables future research on retrieval-augmented vision+language models.

- **Summary**: High-content cellular imaging, transcriptomics, and proteomics data provide rich and complementary views on the molecular layers of biology that influence cellular states and function. However, the biological determinants through which changes in multi-omics measurements influence cellular morphology have not yet been systematically explored, and the degree to which cell imaging could potentially enable the prediction of multi-omics directly from cell imaging data is therefore currently unclear. Here, we address the question of whether it is possible to predict bulk multi-omics measurements directly from cell images using Image2Omics -- a deep learning approach that predicts multi-omics in a cell population directly from high-content images stained with multiplexed fluorescent dyes. We perform an experimental evaluation in gene-edited macrophages derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) under multiple stimulation conditions and demonstrate that Image2Omics achieves significantly better performance in predicting transcriptomics and proteomics measurements directly from cell images than predictors based on the mean observed training set abundance. We observed significant predictability of abundances for 5903 (22.43%; 95% CI: 8.77%, 38.88%) and 5819 (22.11%; 95% CI: 10.40%, 38.08%) transcripts out of 26137 in M1 and M2-stimulated macrophages respectively and for 1933 (38.77%; 95% CI: 36.94%, 39.85%) and 2055 (41.22%; 95% CI: 39.31%, 42.42%) proteins out of 4986 in M1 and M2-stimulated macrophages respectively. Our results show that some transcript and protein abundances are predictable from cell imaging and that cell imaging may potentially, in some settings and depending on the mechanisms of interest and desired performance threshold, even be a scalable and resource-efficient substitute for multi-omics measurements.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel text promptable surgical instrument segmentation approach to overcome challenges associated with diversity and differentiation of surgical instruments in minimally invasive surgeries. We redefine the task as text promptable, thereby enabling a more nuanced comprehension of surgical instruments and adaptability to new instrument types. Inspired by recent advancements in vision-language models, we leverage pretrained image and text encoders as our model backbone and design a text promptable mask decoder consisting of attention- and convolution-based prompting schemes for surgical instrument segmentation prediction. Our model leverages multiple text prompts for each surgical instrument through a new mixture of prompts mechanism, resulting in enhanced segmentation performance. Additionally, we introduce a hard instrument area reinforcement module to improve image feature comprehension and segmentation precision. Extensive experiments on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance and promising generalization capability. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a promptable approach to surgical instrument segmentation, offering significant potential for practical application in the field of robotic-assisted surgery.

- **Summary**: Fairness (also known as equity interchangeably) in machine learning is important for societal well-being, but limited public datasets hinder its progress. Currently, no dedicated public medical datasets with imaging data for fairness learning are available, though minority groups suffer from more health issues. To address this gap, we introduce Harvard Glaucoma Fairness (Harvard-GF), a retinal nerve disease dataset with both 2D and 3D imaging data and balanced racial groups for glaucoma detection. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally with Blacks having doubled glaucoma prevalence than other races. We also propose a fair identity normalization (FIN) approach to equalize the feature importance between different identity groups. Our FIN approach is compared with various the-state-of-the-art fairness learning methods with superior performance in the racial, gender, and ethnicity fairness tasks with 2D and 3D imaging data, which demonstrate the utilities of our dataset Harvard-GF for fairness learning. To facilitate fairness comparisons between different models, we propose an equity-scaled performance measure, which can be flexibly used to compare all kinds of performance metrics in the context of fairness. The dataset and code are publicly accessible via \url{https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/datasets/harvard-glaucoma-fairness-3300-samples/}.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently played a dominant role in multimodal vision-language learning. Despite the great success, it lacks a holistic evaluation of their efficacy. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of publicly available large multimodal models by building a LVLM evaluation Hub (LVLM-eHub). Our LVLM-eHub consists of $8$ representative LVLMs such as InstructBLIP and MiniGPT-4, which are thoroughly evaluated by a quantitative capability evaluation and an online arena platform. The former evaluates $6$ categories of multimodal capabilities of LVLMs such as visual question answering and embodied artificial intelligence on $47$ standard text-related visual benchmarks, while the latter provides the user-level evaluation of LVLMs in an open-world question-answering scenario. The study reveals several innovative findings. First, instruction-tuned LVLM with massive in-domain data such as InstructBLIP heavily overfits many existing tasks, generalizing poorly in the open-world scenario. Second, instruction-tuned LVLM with moderate instruction-following data may result in object hallucination issues (i.e., generate objects that are inconsistent with target images in the descriptions). It either makes the current evaluation metric such as CIDEr for image captioning ineffective or generates wrong answers. Third, employing a multi-turn reasoning evaluation framework can mitigate the issue of object hallucination, shedding light on developing an effective pipeline for LVLM evaluation. The findings provide a foundational framework for the conception and assessment of innovative strategies aimed at enhancing zero-shot multimodal techniques. Our LVLM-eHub will be available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Multi-Modality-Arena

- **Summary**: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) allow a drastic expansion of the visibility range and decrease occlusions for autonomous driving. To obtain accurate detections, detailed labeled sensor data for training is required. Unfortunately, high-quality 3D labels of LiDAR point clouds from the infrastructure perspective of an intersection are still rare. Therefore, we provide the A9 Intersection Dataset, which consists of labeled LiDAR point clouds and synchronized camera images. Here, we recorded the sensor output from two roadside cameras and LiDARs mounted on intersection gantry bridges. The point clouds were labeled in 3D by experienced annotators. Furthermore, we provide calibration data between all sensors, which allow the projection of the 3D labels into the camera images and an accurate data fusion. Our dataset consists of 4.8k images and point clouds with more than 57.4k manually labeled 3D boxes. With ten object classes, it has a high diversity of road users in complex driving maneuvers, such as left and right turns, overtaking, and U-turns. In experiments, we provided multiple baselines for the perception tasks. Overall, our dataset is a valuable contribution to the scientific community to perform complex 3D camera-LiDAR roadside perception tasks.

- **Summary**: This technical report outlines our submission to the zero-shot track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 2023 Challenge. Building on the performance of the WINCLIP framework, we aim to enhance the system's localization capabilities by integrating zero-shot segmentation models. In addition, we perform foreground instance segmentation which enables the model to focus on the relevant parts of the image, thus allowing the models to better identify small or subtle deviations. Our pipeline requires no external data or information, allowing for it to be directly applied to new datasets. Our team (Variance Vigilance Vanguard) ranked third in the zero-shot track of the VAND challenge, and achieve an average F1-max score of 81.5/24.2 at a sample/pixel level on the VisA dataset.

- **Summary**: The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advancements in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot access substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly in relation to decision-making algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the Deep Q-Learning algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and Q-values. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluate our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully recovering all information from the data across all 120 room layouts.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel free-hand sketch synthesis approach addressing explicit abstraction control in class-conditional and photo-to-sketch synthesis. Abstraction is a vital aspect of sketches, as it defines the fundamental distinction between a sketch and an image. Previous works relied on implicit control to achieve different levels of abstraction, leading to inaccurate control and synthesized sketches deviating from human sketches. To resolve this challenge, we propose two novel abstraction control mechanisms, state embeddings and the stroke token, integrated into a transformer-based latent diffusion model (LDM). These mechanisms explicitly provide the required amount of points or strokes to the model, enabling accurate point-level and stroke-level control in synthesized sketches while preserving recognizability. Outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, our method effectively generates diverse, non-rigid and human-like sketches. The proposed approach enables coherent sketch synthesis and excels in representing human habits with desired abstraction levels, highlighting the potential of sketch synthesis for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Due to the increase in computational resources and accessibility of data, an increase in large, deep learning models trained on copious amounts of data using self-supervised or semi-supervised learning have emerged. These "foundation" models are often adapted to a variety of downstream tasks like classification, object detection, and segmentation with little-to-no training on the target dataset. In this work, we perform a robustness analysis of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for segmentation tasks and compare them to supervised models of smaller scale. We focus on robustness against real-world distribution shift perturbations.We benchmark four state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 2 different datasets, COCO and ADE20K, with 17 different perturbations with 5 severity levels each. We find interesting insights that include (1) VFMs are not robust to compression-based corruptions, (2) while the selected VFMs do not significantly outperform or exhibit more robustness compared to non-VFM models, they remain competitively robust in zero-shot evaluations, particularly when non-VFM are under supervision and (3) selected VFMs demonstrate greater resilience to specific categories of objects, likely due to their open-vocabulary training paradigm, a feature that non-VFM models typically lack. We posit that the suggested robustness evaluation introduces new requirements for foundational models, thus sparking further research to enhance their performance.

- **Summary**: Motion forecasting plays a critical role in enabling robots to anticipate future trajectories of surrounding agents and plan accordingly. However, existing forecasting methods often rely on curated datasets that are not faithful to what real-world perception pipelines can provide. In reality, upstream modules that are responsible for detecting and tracking agents, and those that gather road information to build the map, can introduce various errors, including misdetections, tracking errors, and difficulties in being accurate for distant agents and road elements. This paper aims to uncover the challenges of bringing motion forecasting models to this more realistic setting where inputs are provided by perception modules. In particular, we quantify the impacts of the domain gap through extensive evaluation. Furthermore, we design synthetic perturbations to better characterize their consequences, thus providing insights into areas that require improvement in upstream perception modules and guidance toward the development of more robust forecasting methods.

- **Summary**: In few-shot recognition, a classifier that has been trained on one set of classes is required to rapidly adapt and generalize to a disjoint, novel set of classes. To that end, recent studies have shown the efficacy of fine-tuning with carefully crafted adaptation architectures. However this raises the question of: How can one design the optimal adaptation strategy? In this paper, we study this question through the lens of neural architecture search (NAS). Given a pre-trained neural network, our algorithm discovers the optimal arrangement of adapters, which layers to keep frozen and which to fine-tune. We demonstrate the generality of our NAS method by applying it to both residual networks and vision transformers and report state-of-the-art performance on Meta-Dataset and Meta-Album.

- **Summary**: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable operation of open-world intelligent systems. Despite the emergence of an increasing number of OOD detection methods, the evaluation inconsistencies present challenges for tracking the progress in this field. OpenOOD v1 initiated the unification of the OOD detection evaluation but faced limitations in scalability and usability. In response, this paper presents OpenOOD v1.5, a significant improvement from its predecessor that ensures accurate, standardized, and user-friendly evaluation of OOD detection methodologies. Notably, OpenOOD v1.5 extends its evaluation capabilities to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, investigates full-spectrum OOD detection which is important yet underexplored, and introduces new features including an online leaderboard and an easy-to-use evaluator. This work also contributes in-depth analysis and insights derived from comprehensive experimental results, thereby enriching the knowledge pool of OOD detection methodologies. With these enhancements, OpenOOD v1.5 aims to drive advancements and offer a more robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmark for OOD detection research.

- **Summary**: Radar is a key component of the suite of perception sensors used for safe and reliable navigation of autonomous vehicles. Its unique capabilities include high-resolution velocity imaging, detection of agents in occlusion and over long ranges, and robust performance in adverse weather conditions. However, the usage of radar data presents some challenges: it is characterized by low resolution, sparsity, clutter, high uncertainty, and lack of good datasets. These challenges have limited radar deep learning research. As a result, current radar models are often influenced by lidar and vision models, which are focused on optical features that are relatively weak in radar data, thus resulting in under-utilization of radar's capabilities and diminishing its contribution to autonomous perception. This review seeks to encourage further deep learning research on autonomous radar data by 1) identifying key research themes, and 2) offering a comprehensive overview of current opportunities and challenges in the field. Topics covered include early and late fusion, occupancy flow estimation, uncertainty modeling, and multipath detection. The paper also discusses radar fundamentals and data representation, presents a curated list of recent radar datasets, and reviews state-of-the-art lidar and vision models relevant for radar research.

- **Summary**: We propose an efficient approach to train large diffusion models with masked transformers. While masked transformers have been extensively explored for representation learning, their application to generative learning is less explored in the vision domain. Our work is the first to exploit masked training to reduce the training cost of diffusion models significantly. Specifically, we randomly mask out a high proportion (\emph{e.g.}, 50\%) of patches in diffused input images during training. For masked training, we introduce an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture consisting of a transformer encoder that operates only on unmasked patches and a lightweight transformer decoder on full patches. To promote a long-range understanding of full patches, we add an auxiliary task of reconstructing masked patches to the denoising score matching objective that learns the score of unmasked patches. Experiments on ImageNet-256$\times$256 show that our approach achieves the same performance as the state-of-the-art Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model, using only 31\% of its original training time. Thus, our method allows for efficient training of diffusion models without sacrificing the generative performance.

- **Summary**: We introduce Infinigen, a procedural generator of photorealistic 3D scenes of the natural world. Infinigen is entirely procedural: every asset, from shape to texture, is generated from scratch via randomized mathematical rules, using no external source and allowing infinite variation and composition. Infinigen offers broad coverage of objects and scenes in the natural world including plants, animals, terrains, and natural phenomena such as fire, cloud, rain, and snow. Infinigen can be used to generate unlimited, diverse training data for a wide range of computer vision tasks including object detection, semantic segmentation, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction. We expect Infinigen to be a useful resource for computer vision research and beyond. Please visit https://infinigen.org for videos, code and pre-generated data.

- **Summary**: The variety of objects in the real world is nearly unlimited and is thus impossible to capture using models trained on a fixed set of categories. As a result, in recent years, open-vocabulary methods have attracted the interest of the community. This paper proposes a new method for zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. Prior work largely relies on contrastive training using image-text pairs, leveraging grouping mechanisms to learn image features that are both aligned with language and well-localised. This however can introduce ambiguity as the visual appearance of images with similar captions often varies. Instead, we leverage the generative properties of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to sample a set of support images for a given textual category. This provides a distribution of appearances for a given text circumventing the ambiguity problem. We further propose a mechanism that considers the contextual background of the sampled images to better localise objects and segment the background directly. We show that our method can be used to ground several existing pre-trained self-supervised feature extractors in natural language and provide explainable predictions by mapping back to regions in the support set. Our proposal is training-free, relying on pre-trained components only, yet, shows strong performance on a range of open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks, obtaining a lead of more than 10% on the Pascal VOC benchmark.

- **Summary**: Hybrid volumetric medical image segmentation models, combining the advantages of local convolution and global attention, have recently received considerable attention. While mainly focusing on architectural modifications, most existing hybrid approaches still use conventional data-independent weight initialization schemes which restrict their performance due to ignoring the inherent volumetric nature of the medical data. To address this issue, we propose a learnable weight initialization approach that utilizes the available medical training data to effectively learn the contextual and structural cues via the proposed self-supervised objectives. Our approach is easy to integrate into any hybrid model and requires no external training data. Experiments on multi-organ and lung cancer segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our proposed data-dependent initialization approach performs favorably as compared to the Swin-UNETR model pretrained using large-scale datasets on multi-organ segmentation task. Our source code and models are available at: https://github.com/ShahinaKK/LWI-VMS.

- **Summary**: In this study, we address local photo enhancement to improve the aesthetic quality of an input image by applying different effects to different regions. Existing photo enhancement methods are either not content-aware or not local; therefore, we propose a crowd-powered local enhancement method for content-aware local enhancement, which is achieved by asking crowd workers to locally optimize parameters for image editing functions. To make it easier to locally optimize the parameters, we propose an active learning based local filter. The parameters need to be determined at only a few key pixels selected by an active learning method, and the parameters at the other pixels are automatically predicted using a regression model. The parameters at the selected key pixels are independently optimized, breaking down the optimization problem into a sequence of single-slider adjustments. Our experiments show that the proposed filter outperforms existing filters, and our enhanced results are more visually pleasing than the results by the existing enhancement methods.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing and relighting objects and scenes under varying lighting conditions is challenging: existing neural rendering methods often cannot handle the complex interactions between materials and light. Incorporating pre-computed radiance transfer techniques enables global illumination, but still struggles with materials with subsurface scattering effects. We propose a novel framework for learning the radiance transfer field via volume rendering and utilizing various appearance cues to refine geometry end-to-end. This framework extends relighting and reconstruction capabilities to handle a wider range of materials in a data-driven fashion. The resulting models produce plausible rendering results in existing and novel conditions. We will release our code and a novel light stage dataset of objects with subsurface scattering effects publicly available.

- **Summary**: Visual Query Localization on long-form egocentric videos requires spatio-temporal search and localization of visually specified objects and is vital to build episodic memory systems. Prior work develops complex multi-stage pipelines that leverage well-established object detection and tracking methods to perform VQL. However, each stage is independently trained and the complexity of the pipeline results in slow inference speeds. We propose VQLoC, a novel single-stage VQL framework that is end-to-end trainable. Our key idea is to first build a holistic understanding of the query-video relationship and then perform spatio-temporal localization in a single shot manner. Specifically, we establish the query-video relationship by jointly considering query-to-frame correspondences between the query and each video frame and frame-to-frame correspondences between nearby video frames. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior VQL methods by 20% accuracy while obtaining a 10x improvement in inference speed. VQLoC is also the top entry on the Ego4D VQ2D challenge leaderboard. Project page: https://hwjiang1510.github.io/VQLoC/

- **Summary**: We propose a method to recommend music for an input video while allowing a user to guide music selection with free-form natural language. A key challenge of this problem setting is that existing music video datasets provide the needed (video, music) training pairs, but lack text descriptions of the music. This work addresses this challenge with the following three contributions. First, we propose a text-synthesis approach that relies on an analogy-based prompting procedure to generate natural language music descriptions from a large-scale language model (BLOOM-176B) given pre-trained music tagger outputs and a small number of human text descriptions. Second, we use these synthesized music descriptions to train a new trimodal model, which fuses text and video input representations to query music samples. For training, we introduce a text dropout regularization mechanism which we show is critical to model performance. Our model design allows for the retrieved music audio to agree with the two input modalities by matching visual style depicted in the video and musical genre, mood, or instrumentation described in the natural language query. Third, to evaluate our approach, we collect a testing dataset for our problem by annotating a subset of 4k clips from the YT8M-MusicVideo dataset with natural language music descriptions which we make publicly available. We show that our approach can match or exceed the performance of prior methods on video-to-music retrieval while significantly improving retrieval accuracy when using text guidance.

- **Summary**: Machine learning models often learn latent embedding representations that capture the domain semantics of their training data. These embedding representations are valuable for interpreting trained models, building new models, and analyzing new datasets. However, interpreting and using embeddings can be challenging due to their opaqueness, high dimensionality, and the large size of modern datasets. To tackle these challenges, we present WizMap, an interactive visualization tool to help researchers and practitioners easily explore large embeddings. With a novel multi-resolution embedding summarization method and a familiar map-like interaction design, WizMap enables users to navigate and interpret embedding spaces with ease. Leveraging modern web technologies such as WebGL and Web Workers, WizMap scales to millions of embedding points directly in users' web browsers and computational notebooks without the need for dedicated backend servers. WizMap is open-source and available at the following public demo link: https://poloclub.github.io/wizmap.

- **Summary**: We present DreamHuman, a method to generate realistic animatable 3D human avatar models solely from textual descriptions. Recent text-to-3D methods have made considerable strides in generation, but are still lacking in important aspects. Control and often spatial resolution remain limited, existing methods produce fixed rather than animated 3D human models, and anthropometric consistency for complex structures like people remains a challenge. DreamHuman connects large text-to-image synthesis models, neural radiance fields, and statistical human body models in a novel modeling and optimization framework. This makes it possible to generate dynamic 3D human avatars with high-quality textures and learned, instance-specific, surface deformations. We demonstrate that our method is capable to generate a wide variety of animatable, realistic 3D human models from text. Our 3D models have diverse appearance, clothing, skin tones and body shapes, and significantly outperform both generic text-to-3D approaches and previous text-based 3D avatar generators in visual fidelity.

- **Summary**: Arbitrary Style Transfer (AST) aims to transform images by adopting the style from any selected artwork. Nonetheless, the need to accommodate diverse and subjective user preferences poses a significant challenge. While some users wish to preserve distinct content structures, others might favor a more pronounced stylization. Despite advances in feed-forward AST methods, their limited customizability hinders their practical application. We propose a new approach, ArtFusion, which provides a flexible balance between content and style. In contrast to traditional methods reliant on biased similarity losses, ArtFusion utilizes our innovative Dual Conditional Latent Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Dual-cLDM). This approach mitigates repetitive patterns and enhances subtle artistic aspects like brush strokes and genre-specific features. Despite the promising results of conditional diffusion probabilistic models (cDM) in various generative tasks, their introduction to style transfer is challenging due to the requirement for paired training data. ArtFusion successfully navigates this issue, offering more practical and controllable stylization. A key element of our approach involves using a single image for both content and style during model training, all the while maintaining effective stylization during inference. ArtFusion outperforms existing approaches on outstanding controllability and faithful presentation of artistic details, providing evidence of its superior style transfer capabilities. Furthermore, the Dual-cLDM utilized in ArtFusion carries the potential for a variety of complex multi-condition generative tasks, thus greatly broadening the impact of our research.



### Seeing the Pose in the Pixels: Learning Pose-Aware Representations in Vision Transformers

- **Summary**: Human perception of surroundings is often guided by the various poses present within the environment. Many computer vision tasks, such as human action recognition and robot imitation learning, rely on pose-based entities like human skeletons or robotic arms. However, conventional Vision Transformer (ViT) models uniformly process all patches, neglecting valuable pose priors in input videos. We argue that incorporating poses into RGB data is advantageous for learning fine-grained and viewpoint-agnostic representations. Consequently, we introduce two strategies for learning pose-aware representations in ViTs. The first method, called Pose-aware Attention Block (PAAB), is a plug-and-play ViT block that performs localized attention on pose regions within videos. The second method, dubbed Pose-Aware Auxiliary Task (PAAT), presents an auxiliary pose prediction task optimized jointly with the primary ViT task. Although their functionalities differ, both methods succeed in learning pose-aware representations, enhancing performance in multiple diverse downstream tasks. Our experiments, conducted across seven datasets, reveal the efficacy of both pose-aware methods on three video analysis tasks, with PAAT holding a slight edge over PAAB. Both PAAT and PAAB surpass their respective backbone Transformers by up to 9.8% in real-world action recognition and 21.8% in multi-view robotic video alignment.

- **Summary**: We address personalized image enhancement in this study, where we enhance input images for each user based on the user's preferred images. Previous methods apply the same preferred style to all input images (i.e., only one style for each user); in contrast to these methods, we aim to achieve content-aware personalization by applying different styles to each image considering the contents. For content-aware personalization, we make two contributions. First, we propose a method named masked style modeling, which can predict a style for an input image considering the contents by using the framework of masked language modeling. Second, to allow this model to consider the contents of images, we propose a novel training scheme where we download images from Flickr and create pseudo input and retouched image pairs using a degrading model. We conduct quantitative evaluations and a user study, and our method trained using our training scheme successfully achieves content-aware personalization; moreover, our method outperforms other previous methods in this field.

- **Summary**: Standard conformal prediction methods provide a marginal coverage guarantee, which means that for a random test point, the conformal prediction set contains the true label with a user-chosen probability. In many classification problems, we would like to obtain a stronger guarantee -- that for test points of a specific class, the prediction set contains the true label with the same user-chosen probability. Existing conformal prediction methods do not work well when there is a limited amount of labeled data per class, as is often the case in real applications where the number of classes is large. We propose a method called clustered conformal prediction, which clusters together classes that have "similar" conformal scores and then performs conformal prediction at the cluster level. Based on empirical evaluation across four image data sets with many (up to 1000) classes, we find that clustered conformal typically outperforms existing methods in terms of class-conditional coverage and set size metrics.

- **Summary**: Social interaction is a fundamental aspect of human behavior and communication. The way individuals position themselves in relation to others, also known as proxemics, conveys social cues and affects the dynamics of social interaction. We present a novel approach that learns a 3D proxemics prior of two people in close social interaction. Since collecting a large 3D dataset of interacting people is a challenge, we rely on 2D image collections where social interactions are abundant. We achieve this by reconstructing pseudo-ground truth 3D meshes of interacting people from images with an optimization approach using existing ground-truth contact maps. We then model the proxemics using a novel denoising diffusion model called BUDDI that learns the joint distribution of two people in close social interaction directly in the SMPL-X parameter space. Sampling from our generative proxemics model produces realistic 3D human interactions, which we validate through a user study. Additionally, we introduce a new optimization method that uses the diffusion prior to reconstruct two people in close proximity from a single image without any contact annotation. Our approach recovers more accurate and plausible 3D social interactions from noisy initial estimates and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This article provides a comprehensive understanding of optimization in deep learning, with a primary focus on the challenges of gradient vanishing and gradient exploding, which normally lead to diminished model representational ability and training instability, respectively. We analyze these two challenges through several strategic measures, including the improvement of gradient flow and the imposition of constraints on a network's Lipschitz constant. To help understand the current optimization methodologies, we categorize them into two classes: explicit optimization and implicit optimization. Explicit optimization methods involve direct manipulation of optimizer parameters, including weight, gradient, learning rate, and weight decay. Implicit optimization methods, by contrast, focus on improving the overall landscape of a network by enhancing its modules, such as residual shortcuts, normalization methods, attention mechanisms, and activations. In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of these two optimization classes and undertake a thorough examination of the Jacobian matrices and the Lipschitz constants of many widely used deep learning modules, highlighting existing issues as well as potential improvements. Moreover, we also conduct a series of analytical experiments to substantiate our theoretical discussions. This article does not aim to propose a new optimizer or network. Rather, our intention is to present a comprehensive understanding of optimization in deep learning. We hope that this article will assist readers in gaining a deeper insight in this field and encourages the development of more robust, efficient, and high-performing models.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image generative models can generate high-fidelity images from text inputs, but the quality of these generated images cannot be accurately evaluated by existing evaluation metrics. To address this issue, we introduce Human Preference Dataset v2 (HPD v2), a large-scale dataset that captures human preferences on images from a wide range of sources. HPD v2 comprises 798,090 human preference choices on 430,060 pairs of images, making it the largest dataset of its kind. The text prompts and images are deliberately collected to eliminate potential bias, which is a common issue in previous datasets. By fine-tuning CLIP on HPD v2, we obtain Human Preference Score v2 (HPS v2), a scoring model that can more accurately predict text-generated images' human preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that HPS v2 generalizes better than previous metrics across various image distributions and is responsive to algorithmic improvements of text-to-image generative models, making it a preferable evaluation metric for these models. We also investigate the design of the evaluation prompts for text-to-image generative models, to make the evaluation stable, fair and easy-to-use. Finally, we establish a benchmark for text-to-image generative models using HPS v2, which includes a set of recent text-to-image models from the academia, community and industry. The code and dataset is / will be available at https://github.com/tgxs002/HPSv2.

- **Summary**: The growing size of datasets and deep learning models has made faster and memory-efficient training crucial. Reversible transformers have recently been introduced as an exciting new method for extremely memory-efficient training, but they come with an additional computation overhead of activation re-computation in the backpropagation phase. We present PaReprop, a fast Parallelized Reversible Backpropagation algorithm that parallelizes the additional activation re-computation overhead in reversible training with the gradient computation itself in backpropagation phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PaReprop algorithm through extensive benchmarking across model families (ViT, MViT, Swin and RoBERTa), data modalities (Vision & NLP), model sizes (from small to giant), and training batch sizes. Our empirical results show that PaReprop achieves up to 20% higher training throughput than vanilla reversible training, largely mitigating the theoretical overhead of 25% lower throughput from activation recomputation in reversible training.

- **Summary**: Current perceptual similarity metrics operate at the level of pixels and patches. These metrics compare images in terms of their low-level colors and textures, but fail to capture mid-level similarities and differences in image layout, object pose, and semantic content. In this paper, we develop a perceptual metric that assesses images holistically. Our first step is to collect a new dataset of human similarity judgments over image pairs that are alike in diverse ways. Critical to this dataset is that judgments are nearly automatic and shared by all observers. To achieve this we use recent text-to-image models to create synthetic pairs that are perturbed along various dimensions. We observe that popular perceptual metrics fall short of explaining our new data, and we introduce a new metric, DreamSim, tuned to better align with human perception. We analyze how our metric is affected by different visual attributes, and find that it focuses heavily on foreground objects and semantic content while also being sensitive to color and layout. Notably, despite being trained on synthetic data, our metric generalizes to real images, giving strong results on retrieval and reconstruction tasks. Furthermore, our metric outperforms both prior learned metrics and recent large vision models on these tasks.

- **Summary**: While large text-to-image models are able to synthesize "novel" images, these images are necessarily a reflection of the training data. The problem of data attribution in such models -- which of the images in the training set are most responsible for the appearance of a given generated image -- is a difficult yet important one. As an initial step toward this problem, we evaluate attribution through "customization" methods, which tune an existing large-scale model toward a given exemplar object or style. Our key insight is that this allows us to efficiently create synthetic images that are computationally influenced by the exemplar by construction. With our new dataset of such exemplar-influenced images, we are able to evaluate various data attribution algorithms and different possible feature spaces. Furthermore, by training on our dataset, we can tune standard models, such as DINO, CLIP, and ViT, toward the attribution problem. Even though the procedure is tuned towards small exemplar sets, we show generalization to larger sets. Finally, by taking into account the inherent uncertainty of the problem, we can assign soft attribution scores over a set of training images.

- **Summary**: Do different neural networks, trained for various vision tasks, share some common representations? In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of common features we call "Rosetta Neurons" across a range of models with different architectures, different tasks (generative and discriminative), and different types of supervision (class-supervised, text-supervised, self-supervised). We present an algorithm for mining a dictionary of Rosetta Neurons across several popular vision models: Class Supervised-ResNet50, DINO-ResNet50, DINO-ViT, MAE, CLIP-ResNet50, BigGAN, StyleGAN-2, StyleGAN-XL. Our findings suggest that certain visual concepts and structures are inherently embedded in the natural world and can be learned by different models regardless of the specific task or architecture, and without the use of semantic labels. We can visualize shared concepts directly due to generative models included in our analysis. The Rosetta Neurons facilitate model-to-model translation enabling various inversion-based manipulations, including cross-class alignments, shifting, zooming, and more, without the need for specialized training.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in vision foundation models (VFMs) have opened up new possibilities for versatile and efficient visual perception. In this work, we introduce Seal, a novel framework that harnesses VFMs for segmenting diverse automotive point cloud sequences. Seal exhibits three appealing properties: i) Scalability: VFMs are directly distilled into point clouds, eliminating the need for annotations in either 2D or 3D during pretraining. ii) Consistency: Spatial and temporal relationships are enforced at both the camera-to-LiDAR and point-to-segment stages, facilitating cross-modal representation learning. iii) Generalizability: Seal enables knowledge transfer in an off-the-shelf manner to downstream tasks involving diverse point clouds, including those from real/synthetic, low/high-resolution, large/small-scale, and clean/corrupted datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on eleven different point cloud datasets showcase the effectiveness and superiority of Seal. Notably, Seal achieves a remarkable 45.0% mIoU on nuScenes after linear probing, surpassing random initialization by 36.9% mIoU and outperforming prior arts by 6.1% mIoU. Moreover, Seal demonstrates significant performance gains over existing methods across 20 different few-shot fine-tuning tasks on all eleven tested point cloud datasets.

- **Summary**: The reflective nature of the human eye is an underappreciated source of information about what the world around us looks like. By imaging the eyes of a moving person, we can collect multiple views of a scene outside the camera's direct line of sight through the reflections in the eyes. In this paper, we reconstruct a 3D scene beyond the camera's line of sight using portrait images containing eye reflections. This task is challenging due to 1) the difficulty of accurately estimating eye poses and 2) the entangled appearance of the eye iris and the scene reflections. Our method jointly refines the cornea poses, the radiance field depicting the scene, and the observer's eye iris texture. We further propose a simple regularization prior on the iris texture pattern to improve reconstruction quality. Through various experiments on synthetic and real-world captures featuring people with varied eye colors, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to recover 3D scenes using eye reflections.

- **Summary**: We show how to build a model that allows realistic, free-viewpoint renderings of a scene under novel lighting conditions from video. Our method -- UrbanIR: Urban Scene Inverse Rendering -- computes an inverse graphics representation from the video. UrbanIR jointly infers shape, albedo, visibility, and sun and sky illumination from a single video of unbounded outdoor scenes with unknown lighting. UrbanIR uses videos from cameras mounted on cars (in contrast to many views of the same points in typical NeRF-style estimation). As a result, standard methods produce poor geometry estimates (for example, roofs), and there are numerous ''floaters''. Errors in inverse graphics inference can result in strong rendering artifacts. UrbanIR uses novel losses to control these and other sources of error. UrbanIR uses a novel loss to make very good estimates of shadow volumes in the original scene. The resulting representations facilitate controllable editing, delivering photorealistic free-viewpoint renderings of relit scenes and inserted objects. Qualitative evaluation demonstrates strong improvements over the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: With read-aloud speech synthesis achieving high naturalness scores, there is a growing research interest in synthesising spontaneous speech. However, human spontaneous face-to-face conversation has both spoken and non-verbal aspects (here, co-speech gestures). Only recently has research begun to explore the benefits of jointly synthesising these two modalities in a single system. The previous state of the art used non-probabilistic methods, which fail to capture the variability of human speech and motion, and risk producing oversmoothing artefacts and sub-optimal synthesis quality. We present the first diffusion-based probabilistic model, called Diff-TTSG, that jointly learns to synthesise speech and gestures together. Our method can be trained on small datasets from scratch. Furthermore, we describe a set of careful uni- and multi-modal subjective tests for evaluating integrated speech and gesture synthesis systems, and use them to validate our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-destructive and contactless technology that provides valuable information about the structure and composition of an object. It can capture detailed information about the chemical and physical properties of agricultural crops. Due to its wide spectral range, compared with multispectral- or RGB-based imaging methods, HSI can be a more effective tool for monitoring crop health and productivity. With the advent of this imaging tool in agrotechnology, researchers can more accurately address issues related to the detection of diseased and defective crops in the agriculture industry. This allows to implement the most suitable and accurate farming solutions, such as irrigation and fertilization before crops enter a damaged and difficult-to-recover phase of growth in the field. While HSI provides valuable insights into the object under investigation, the limited number of HSI datasets for crop evaluation presently poses a bottleneck. Dealing with the curse of dimensionality presents another challenge due to the abundance of spectral and spatial information in each hyperspectral cube. State-of-the-art methods based on 1D- and 2D-CNNs struggle to efficiently extract spectral and spatial information. On the other hand, 3D-CNN-based models have shown significant promise in achieving better classification and detection results by leveraging spectral and spatial features simultaneously. Despite the apparent benefits of 3D-CNN-based models, their usage for classification purposes in this area of research has remained limited. This paper seeks to address this gap by reviewing 3D-CNN-based architectures and the typical deep learning pipeline, including preprocessing and visualization of results, for the classification of hyperspectral images of diseased and defective crops. Furthermore, we discuss open research areas and challenges when utilizing 3D-CNNs with HSI data.

- **Summary**: The Landsat program is the longest-running Earth observation program in history, with 50+ years of data acquisition by 8 satellites. The multispectral imagery captured by sensors onboard these satellites is critical for a wide range of scientific fields. Despite the increasing popularity of deep learning and remote sensing, the majority of researchers still use decision trees and random forests for Landsat image analysis due to the prevalence of small labeled datasets and lack of foundation models. In this paper, we introduce SSL4EO-L, the first ever dataset designed for Self-Supervised Learning for Earth Observation for the Landsat family of satellites (including 3 sensors and 2 product levels) and the largest Landsat dataset in history (5M image patches). Additionally, we modernize and re-release the L7 Irish and L8 Biome cloud detection datasets, and introduce the first ML benchmark datasets for Landsats 4-5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ SR. Finally, we pre-train the first foundation models for Landsat imagery using SSL4EO-L and evaluate their performance on multiple semantic segmentation tasks. All datasets and model weights are available via the TorchGeo (https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo) library, making reproducibility and experimentation easy, and enabling scientific advancements in the burgeoning field of remote sensing for a myriad of downstream applications.

- **Summary**: Despite several solutions and experiments have been conducted recently addressing image super-resolution (SR), boosted by deep learning (DL) techniques, they do not usually design evaluations with high scaling factors, capping it at 2x or 4x. Moreover, the datasets are generally benchmarks which do not truly encompass significant diversity of domains to proper evaluate the techniques. It is also interesting to remark that blind SR is attractive for real-world scenarios since it is based on the idea that the degradation process is unknown, and hence techniques in this context rely basically on low-resolution (LR) images. In this article, we present a high-scale (8x) controlled experiment which evaluates five recent DL techniques tailored for blind image SR: Adaptive Pseudo Augmentation (APA), Blind Image SR with Spatially Variant Degradations (BlindSR), Deep Alternating Network (DAN), FastGAN, and Mixture of Experts Super-Resolution (MoESR). We consider 14 small datasets from five different broader domains which are: aerial, fauna, flora, medical, and satellite. Another distinctive characteristic of our evaluation is that some of the DL approaches were designed for single-image SR but others not. Two no-reference metrics were selected, being the classical natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) and the recent transformer-based multi-dimension attention network for no-reference image quality assessment (MANIQA) score, to assess the techniques. Overall, MoESR can be regarded as the best solution although the perceptual quality of the created HR images of all the techniques still needs to improve.

- **Summary**: The ability to monitor and interpret of hardware system events and behaviors are crucial to improving the robustness and reliability of these systems, especially in a supercomputing facility. The growing complexity and scale of these systems demand an increase in monitoring data collected at multiple fidelity levels and varying temporal resolutions. In this work, we aim to build a holistic analytical system that helps make sense of such massive data, mainly the hardware logs, job logs, and environment logs collected from disparate subsystems and components of a supercomputer system. This end-to-end log analysis system, coupled with visual analytics support, allows users to glean and promptly extract supercomputer usage and error patterns at varying temporal and spatial resolutions. We use multiresolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD), a technique that depicts high-dimensional data as correlated spatial-temporal variations patterns or modes, to extract variation patterns isolated at specified frequencies. Our improvements to the mrDMD algorithm help promptly reveal useful information in the massive environment log dataset, which is then associated with the processed hardware and job log datasets using our visual analytics system. Furthermore, our system can identify the usage and error patterns filtered at user, project, and subcomponent levels. We exemplify the effectiveness of our approach with two use scenarios with the Cray XC40 supercomputer.

- **Summary**: Real-world deployment of computer vision systems, including in the discovery processes of biomedical research, requires causal representations that are invariant to contextual nuisances and generalize to new data. Leveraging the internal replicate structure of two novel single-cell fluorescent microscopy datasets, we propose generally applicable tests to assess the extent to which models learn causal representations across increasingly challenging levels of OOD-generalization. We show that despite seemingly strong performance, as assessed by other established metrics, both naive and contemporary baselines designed to ward against confounding, collapse on these tests. We introduce a new method, Interventional Style Transfer (IST), that substantially improves OOD generalization by generating interventional training distributions in which spurious correlations between biological causes and nuisances are mitigated. We publish our code and datasets.

- **Summary**: Despite the advances made in visual object recognition, state-of-the-art deep learning models struggle to effectively recognize novel objects in a few-shot setting where only a limited number of examples are provided. Unlike humans who excel at such tasks, these models often fail to leverage known relationships between entities in order to draw conclusions about such objects. In this work, we show that incorporating a symbolic knowledge graph into a state-of-the-art recognition model enables a new approach for effective few-shot classification. In our proposed neuro-symbolic architecture and training methodology, the knowledge graph is augmented with additional relationships extracted from a small set of examples, improving its ability to recognize novel objects by considering the presence of interconnected entities. Unlike existing few-shot classifiers, we show that this enables our model to incorporate not only objects but also abstract concepts and affordances. The existence of the knowledge graph also makes this approach amenable to interpretability through analysis of the relationships contained within it. We empirically show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art few-shot multi-label classification methods on the COCO dataset and evaluate the addition of abstract concepts and affordances on the Visual Genome dataset.



### R2-Diff: Denoising by diffusion as a refinement of retrieved motion for image-based motion prediction

- **Summary**: Image-based motion prediction is one of the essential techniques for robot manipulation. Among the various prediction models, we focus on diffusion models because they have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications. In image-based motion prediction, diffusion models stochastically predict contextually appropriate motion by gradually denoising random Gaussian noise based on the image context. While diffusion models are able to predict various motions by changing the random noise, they sometimes fail to predict a contextually appropriate motion based on the image because the random noise is sampled independently of the image context. To solve this problem, we propose R2-Diff. In R2-Diff, a motion retrieved from a dataset based on image similarity is fed into a diffusion model instead of random noise. Then, the retrieved motion is refined through the denoising process of the diffusion model. Since the retrieved motion is almost appropriate to the context, it becomes easier to predict contextually appropriate motion. However, traditional diffusion models are not optimized to refine the retrieved motion. Therefore, we propose the method of tuning the hyperparameters based on the distance of the nearest neighbor motion among the dataset to optimize the diffusion model for refinement. Furthermore, we propose an image-based retrieval method to retrieve the nearest neighbor motion in inference. Our proposed retrieval efficiently computes the similarity based on the image features along the motion trajectory. We demonstrate that R2-Diff accurately predicts appropriate motions and achieves high task success rates compared to recent state-of-the-art models in robot manipulation.

- **Summary**: This work introduces a dataset, benchmark, and challenge for the problem of video copy detection and localization. The problem comprises two distinct but related tasks: determining whether a query video shares content with a reference video ("detection"), and additionally temporally localizing the shared content within each video ("localization"). The benchmark is designed to evaluate methods on these two tasks, and simulates a realistic needle-in-haystack setting, where the majority of both query and reference videos are "distractors" containing no copied content. We propose a metric that reflects both detection and localization accuracy. The associated challenge consists of two corresponding tracks, each with restrictions that reflect real-world settings. We provide implementation code for evaluation and baselines. We also analyze the results and methods of the top submissions to the challenge. The dataset, baseline methods and evaluation code is publicly available and will be discussed at a dedicated CVPR'23 workshop.

- **Summary**: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has been significantly advanced from the scaling of recent Large Language Models (LLMs). The key idea is to convert the visual information into the language feature space so that the capacity of LLMs can be fully exploited. Existing VideoQA methods typically take two paradigms: (1) learning cross-modal alignment, and (2) using an off-the-shelf captioning model to describe the visual data. However, the first design needs costly training on many extra multi-modal data, whilst the second is further limited by limited domain generalization. To address these limitations, a simple yet effective Retrieving-to-Answer (R2A) framework is proposed.Given an input video, R2A first retrieves a set of semantically similar texts from a generic text corpus using a pre-trained multi-modal model (e.g., CLIP). With both the question and the retrieved texts, a LLM (e.g., DeBERTa) can be directly used to yield a desired answer. Without the need for cross-modal fine-tuning, R2A allows for all the key components (e.g., LLM, retrieval model, and text corpus) to plug-and-play. Extensive experiments on several VideoQA benchmarks show that despite with 1.3B parameters and no fine-tuning, our R2A can outperform the 61 times larger Flamingo-80B model even additionally trained on nearly 2.1B multi-modal data.

- **Summary**: The following paper investigates the effectiveness of incorporating human salience into the task of calorie prediction from images of food. We observe a 32.2% relative improvement when incorporating saliency maps on the images of food highlighting the most calorie regions. We also attempt to further improve the accuracy by starting the best models using pre-trained weights on similar tasks of mass estimation and food classification. However, we observe no improvement. Surprisingly, we also find that our best model was not able to surpass the original performance published alongside the test dataset, Nutrition5k. We use ResNet50 and Xception as the base models for our experiment.

- **Summary**: Exercise-based rehabilitation programs have been shown to enhance quality of life and reduce mortality and rehospitalizations. AI-driven virtual rehabilitation programs enable patients to complete exercises independently at home while AI algorithms can analyze exercise data to provide feedback to patients and report their progress to clinicians. This paper introduces a novel approach to assessing the quality of rehabilitation exercises using RGB video. Sequences of skeletal body joints are extracted from consecutive RGB video frames and analyzed by many-to-one sequential neural networks to evaluate exercise quality. Existing datasets for exercise rehabilitation lack adequate samples for training deep sequential neural networks to generalize effectively. A cross-modal data augmentation approach is proposed to resolve this problem. Visual augmentation techniques are applied to video data, and body joints extracted from the resulting augmented videos are used for training sequential neural networks. Extensive experiments conducted on the KInematic assessment of MOvement and clinical scores for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation (KIMORE) dataset, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over previous baseline approaches. The ablation study highlights a significant enhancement in exercise quality assessment following cross-modal augmentation.

- **Summary**: Recent research has demonstrated that the combination of pretrained diffusion models with neural radiance fields (NeRFs) has emerged as a promising approach for text-to-3D generation. Simply coupling NeRF with diffusion models will result in cross-view inconsistency and degradation of stylized view syntheses. To address this challenge, we propose the Edit-DiffNeRF framework, which is composed of a frozen diffusion model, a proposed delta module to edit the latent semantic space of the diffusion model, and a NeRF. Instead of training the entire diffusion for each scene, our method focuses on editing the latent semantic space in frozen pretrained diffusion models by the delta module. This fundamental change to the standard diffusion framework enables us to make fine-grained modifications to the rendered views and effectively consolidate these instructions in a 3D scene via NeRF training. As a result, we are able to produce an edited 3D scene that faithfully aligns to input text instructions. Furthermore, to ensure semantic consistency across different viewpoints, we propose a novel multi-view semantic consistency loss that extracts a latent semantic embedding from the input view as a prior, and aim to reconstruct it in different views. Our proposed method has been shown to effectively edit real-world 3D scenes, resulting in 25% improvement in the alignment of the performed 3D edits with text instructions compared to prior work.

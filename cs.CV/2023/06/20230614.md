- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art methods for text-to-shape generation either require supervised training using a labeled dataset of pre-defined 3D shapes, or perform expensive inference-time optimization of implicit neural representations. In this work, we present ZeroForge, an approach for zero-shot text-to-shape generation that avoids both pitfalls. To achieve open-vocabulary shape generation, we require careful architectural adaptation of existing feed-forward approaches, as well as a combination of data-free CLIP-loss and contrastive losses to avoid mode collapse. Using these techniques, we are able to considerably expand the generative ability of existing feed-forward text-to-shape models such as CLIP-Forge. We support our method via extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations

- **Summary**: Encoding whole slide images (WSI) as graphs is well motivated since it makes it possible for the gigapixel resolution WSI to be represented in its entirety for the purpose of graph learning. To this end, WSIs can be broken into smaller patches that represent the nodes of the graph. Then, graph-based learning methods can be utilized for the grading and classification of cancer. Message passing among neighboring nodes is the foundation of graph-based learning methods. However, they do not take into consideration any positional information for any of the patches, and if two patches are found in topologically isomorphic neighborhoods, their embeddings are nearly similar to one another. In this work, classification of cancer from WSIs is performed with positional embedding and graph attention. In order to represent the positional embedding of the nodes in graph classification, the proposed method makes use of spline convolutional neural networks (CNN). The algorithm is then tested with the WSI dataset for grading prostate cancer and kidney cancer. A comparison of the proposed method with leading approaches in cancer diagnosis and grading verify improved performance. The identification of cancerous regions in WSIs is another critical task in cancer diagnosis. In this work, the explainability of the proposed model is also addressed. A gradient-based explainbility approach is used to generate the saliency mapping for the WSIs. This can be used to look into regions of WSI that are responsible for cancer diagnosis thus rendering the proposed model explainable.

- **Summary**: Continual learning (CL) has attracted increasing attention in the recent past. It aims to mimic the human ability to learn new concepts without catastrophic forgetting. While existing CL methods accomplish this to some extent, they are still prone to semantic drift of the learned feature space. Foundation models, which are endowed with a robust feature representation, learned from very large datasets, provide an interesting substrate for the solution of the CL problem. Recent work has also shown that they can be adapted to specific tasks by prompt tuning techniques that leave the generality of the representation mostly unscathed. An open question is, however, how to learn both prompts that are task specific and prompts that are global, i.e. capture cross-task information. In this work, we propose the Prompt Of Prompts (POP) model, which addresses this goal by progressively learning a group of task-specified prompts and a group of global prompts, denoted as POP, to integrate information from the former. We show that a foundation model equipped with POP learning is able to outperform classic CL methods by a significant margin. Moreover, as prompt tuning only requires a small set of training samples, POP is able to perform CL in the few-shot setting, while still outperforming competing methods trained on the entire dataset.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation based on deep learning often fails when deployed on images from a different domain. The domain adaptation methods aim to solve domain-shift challenges, but still face some problems. The transfer learning methods require annotation on the target domain, and the generative unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) models ignore domain-specific representations, whose generated quality highly restricts segmentation performance. In this study, we propose a novel Structure-Modal Constrained (SMC) UDA framework based on a discriminative paradigm and introduce edge structure as a bridge between domains. The proposed multi-modal learning backbone distills structure information from image texture to distinguish domain-invariant edge structure. With the structure-constrained self-learning and progressive ROI, our methods segment the kidney by locating the 3D spatial structure of the edge. We evaluated SMC-UDA on public renal segmentation datasets, adapting from the labeled source domain (CT) to the unlabeled target domain (CT/MRI). The experiments show that our proposed SMC-UDA has a strong generalization and outperforms generative UDA methods.

- **Summary**: This paper presents CLIPXPlore, a new framework that leverages a vision-language model to guide the exploration of the 3D shape space. Many recent methods have been developed to encode 3D shapes into a learned latent shape space to enable generative design and modeling. Yet, existing methods lack effective exploration mechanisms, despite the rich information. To this end, we propose to leverage CLIP, a powerful pre-trained vision-language model, to aid the shape-space exploration. Our idea is threefold. First, we couple the CLIP and shape spaces by generating paired CLIP and shape codes through sketch images and training a mapper network to connect the two spaces. Second, to explore the space around a given shape, we formulate a co-optimization strategy to search for the CLIP code that better matches the geometry of the shape. Third, we design three exploration modes, binary-attribute-guided, text-guided, and sketch-guided, to locate suitable exploration trajectories in shape space and induce meaningful changes to the shape. We perform a series of experiments to quantitatively and visually compare CLIPXPlore with different baselines in each of the three exploration modes, showing that CLIPXPlore can produce many meaningful exploration results that cannot be achieved by the existing solutions.

- **Summary**: With the widespread application of optimal transport (OT), its calculation becomes essential, and various algorithms have emerged. However, the existing methods either have low efficiency or cannot represent discontinuous maps. A novel reusable neural OT solver OT-Net is thus presented, which first learns Brenier's height representation via the neural network to obtain its potential, and then gained the OT map by computing the gradient of the potential. The algorithm has two merits, 1) it can easily represent discontinuous maps, which allows it to match any target distribution with discontinuous supports and achieve sharp boundaries. This can well eliminate mode collapse in the generated models. 2) The OT map can be calculated straightly by the proposed algorithm when new target samples are added, which greatly improves the efficiency and reusability of the map. Moreover, the theoretical error bound of the algorithm is analyzed, and we have demonstrated the empirical success of our approach in image generation, color transfer, and domain adaptation.

- **Summary**: Cell recognition is a fundamental task in digital histopathology image analysis. Point-based cell recognition (PCR) methods normally require a vast number of annotations, which is extremely costly, time-consuming and labor-intensive. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can provide a shortcut to make full use of cell information in gigapixel whole slide images without exhaustive labeling. However, research into semi-supervised point-based cell recognition (SSPCR) remains largely overlooked. Previous SSPCR works are all built on density map-based PCR models, which suffer from unsatisfactory accuracy, slow inference speed and high sensitivity to hyper-parameters. To address these issues, end-to-end PCR models are proposed recently. In this paper, we develop a SSPCR framework suitable for the end-to-end PCR models for the first time. Overall, we use the current models to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled images, which are in turn utilized to supervise the models training. Besides, we introduce a co-teaching strategy to overcome the confirmation bias problem that generally exists in self-training. A distribution alignment technique is also incorporated to produce high-quality, unbiased pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Experimental results on four histopathology datasets concerning different types of staining styles show the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by significant social communication impairments and difficulties perceiving and presenting communication cues. Machine learning techniques have been broadly adopted to facilitate autism studies and assessments. However, computational models are primarily concentrated on specific analysis and validated on private datasets in the autism community, which limits comparisons across models due to privacy-preserving data sharing complications. This work presents a novel privacy-preserving open-source dataset, MMASD as a MultiModal ASD benchmark dataset, collected from play therapy interventions of children with Autism. MMASD includes data from 32 children with ASD, and 1,315 data samples segmented from over 100 hours of intervention recordings. To promote public access, each data sample consists of four privacy-preserving modalities of data: (1) optical flow, (2) 2D skeleton, (3) 3D skeleton, and (4) clinician ASD evaluation scores of children, e.g., ADOS scores. MMASD aims to assist researchers and therapists in understanding children's cognitive status, monitoring their progress during therapy, and customizing the treatment plan accordingly. It also has inspiration for downstream tasks such as action quality assessment and interpersonal synchrony estimation. MMASD dataset can be easily accessed at https://github.com/Li-Jicheng/MMASD-A-Multimodal-Dataset-for-Autism-Intervention-Analysis.



### Diffusion in Diffusion: Cyclic One-Way Diffusion for Text-Vision-Conditioned Generation

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation with diffusion models allows users to control the semantic content in the synthesized images given text conditions. As a further step toward a more customized image creation application, we introduce a new multi-modality generation setting that synthesizes images based on not only the semantic-level textual input but also on the pixel-level visual conditions. Existing literature first converts the given visual information to semantic-level representation by connecting it to languages, and then incorporates it into the original denoising process. Seemingly intuitive, such methodological design loses the pixel values during the semantic transition, thus failing to fulfill the task scenario where the preservation of low-level vision is desired (e.g., ID of a given face image). To this end, we propose Cyclic One-Way Diffusion (COW), a training-free framework for creating customized images with respect to semantic text and pixel-visual conditioning. Notably, we observe that sub-regions of an image impose mutual interference, just like physical diffusion, to achieve ultimate harmony along the denoising trajectory. Thus we propose to repetitively utilize the given visual condition in a cyclic way, by planting the visual condition as a high-concentration "seed" at the initialization step of the denoising process, and "diffuse" it into a harmonious picture by controlling a one-way information flow from the visual condition. We repeat the destroy-and-construct process multiple times to gradually but steadily impose the internal diffusion process within the image. Experiments on the challenging one-shot face and text-conditioned image synthesis task demonstrate our superiority in terms of speed, image quality, and conditional fidelity compared to learning-based text-vision conditional methods.

- **Summary**: Masked autoencoder (MAE) has attracted unprecedented attention and achieves remarkable performance in many vision tasks. It reconstructs random masked image patches (known as proxy task) during pretraining and learns meaningful semantic representations that can be transferred to downstream tasks. However, MAE has not been thoroughly explored in ultrasound imaging. In this work, we investigate the potential of MAE for ultrasound image recognition. Motivated by the unique property of ultrasound imaging in high noise-to-signal ratio, we propose a novel deblurring MAE approach that incorporates deblurring into the proxy task during pretraining. The addition of deblurring facilitates the pretraining to better recover the subtle details presented in the ultrasound images, thus improving the performance of the downstream classification task. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our deblurring MAE, achieving state-of-the-art performance in ultrasound image classification. Overall, our work highlights the potential of MAE for ultrasound image recognition and presents a novel approach that incorporates deblurring to further improve its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: The bokeh effect is an artistic technique that blurs out-of-focus areas in a photograph and has gained interest due to recent developments in text-to-image synthesis and the ubiquity of smart-phone cameras and photo-sharing apps. Prior work on rendering bokeh effects have focused on post hoc image manipulation to produce similar blurring effects in existing photographs using classical computer graphics or neural rendering techniques, but have either depth discontinuity artifacts or are restricted to reproducing bokeh effects that are present in the training data. More recent diffusion based models can synthesize images with an artistic style, but either require the generation of high-dimensional masks, expensive fine-tuning, or affect global image characteristics. In this paper, we present GBSD, the first generative text-to-image model that synthesizes photorealistic images with a bokeh style. Motivated by how image synthesis occurs progressively in diffusion models, our approach combines latent diffusion models with a 2-stage conditioning algorithm to render bokeh effects on semantically defined objects. Since we can focus the effect on objects, this semantic bokeh effect is more versatile than classical rendering techniques. We evaluate GBSD both quantitatively and qualitatively and demonstrate its ability to be applied in both text-to-image and image-to-image settings.

- **Summary**: Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of generative tasks, such as image synthesis and image editing. However, the robustness of latent diffusion models is not well studied. Previous works only focus on the adversarial attacks against the encoder or the output image under white-box settings, regardless of the denoising process. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to analyze the robustness of latent diffusion models more thoroughly. We first study the influence of the components inside latent diffusion models on their white-box robustness. In addition to white-box scenarios, we evaluate the black-box robustness of latent diffusion models via transfer attacks, where we consider both prompt-transfer and model-transfer settings and possible defense mechanisms. However, all these explorations need a comprehensive benchmark dataset, which is missing in the literature. Therefore, to facilitate the research of the robustness of latent diffusion models, we propose two automatic dataset construction pipelines for two kinds of image editing models and release the whole dataset. Our code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/jpzhang1810/LDM-Robustness}.



### Multiclass Confidence and Localization Calibration for Object Detection

- **Summary**: Albeit achieving high predictive accuracy across many challenging computer vision problems, recent studies suggest that deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to make overconfident predictions, rendering them poorly calibrated. Most of the existing attempts for improving DNN calibration are limited to classification tasks and restricted to calibrating in-domain predictions. Surprisingly, very little to no attempts have been made in studying the calibration of object detection methods, which occupy a pivotal space in vision-based security-sensitive, and safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a new train-time technique for calibrating modern object detection methods. It is capable of jointly calibrating multiclass confidence and box localization by leveraging their predictive uncertainties. We perform extensive experiments on several in-domain and out-of-domain detection benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our proposed train-time calibration method consistently outperforms several baselines in reducing calibration error for both in-domain and out-of-domain predictions. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/bimsarapathiraja/MCCL.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods, which can leverage a large amount of unlabeled data for improved performance, has attracted increasing attention recently. In this paper, we introduce a novel Context-aware Conditional Cross Pseudo Supervision method (referred as C$^3$PS) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Unlike previously published Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) works, this paper introduces a novel Conditional Cross Pseudo Supervision (CCPS) mechanism where the cross pseudo supervision is conditioned on a given class label. Context-awareness is further introduced in the CCPS to improve the quality of pseudo-labels for cross pseudo supervision. The proposed method has the additional advantage that in the later training stage, it can focus on the learning of hard organs. Validated on two typical yet challenging medical image segmentation tasks, our method demonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Given two images depicting a person and a garment worn by another person, our goal is to generate a visualization of how the garment might look on the input person. A key challenge is to synthesize a photorealistic detail-preserving visualization of the garment, while warping the garment to accommodate a significant body pose and shape change across the subjects. Previous methods either focus on garment detail preservation without effective pose and shape variation, or allow try-on with the desired shape and pose but lack garment details. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based architecture that unifies two UNets (referred to as Parallel-UNet), which allows us to preserve garment details and warp the garment for significant pose and body change in a single network. The key ideas behind Parallel-UNet include: 1) garment is warped implicitly via a cross attention mechanism, 2) garment warp and person blend happen as part of a unified process as opposed to a sequence of two separate tasks. Experimental results indicate that TryOnDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Parallax and Time-of-Flight (ToF) are often regarded as complementary in robotic vision where various light and weather conditions remain challenges for advanced camera-based 3-Dimensional (3-D) reconstruction. To this end, this paper establishes Parallax among Corresponding Echoes (PaCE) to triangulate acoustic ToF pulses from arbitrary sensor positions in 3-D space for the first time. This is achieved through a novel round-trip reflection model that pinpoints targets at the intersection of ellipsoids, which are spanned by sensor locations and detected arrival times. Inter-channel echo association becomes a crucial prerequisite for target detection and is learned from feature similarity obtained by a stack of Siamese Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). The PaCE algorithm enables phase-invariant 3-D object localization from only 1 isotropic emitter and at least 3 ToF receivers with relaxed sensor position constraints. Experiments are conducted with airborne ultrasound sensor hardware and back this hypothesis with quantitative results.

- **Summary**: As a hot topic in recent years, the ability of pedestrians identification based on radar micro-Doppler signatures is limited by the lack of adequate training data. In this paper, we propose a data-enhanced multi-characteristic learning (DEMCL) model with data enhancement (DE) module and multi-characteristic learning (MCL) module to learn more complementary pedestrian micro-Doppler (m-D) signatures. In DE module, a range-Doppler generative adversarial network (RDGAN) is proposed to enhance free walking datasets, and MCL module with multi-scale convolution neural network (MCNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is trained to learn m-D signatures extracted from enhanced datasets. Experimental results show that our model is 3.33% to 10.24% more accurate than other studies and has a short run time of 0.9324 seconds on a 25-minute walking dataset.

- **Summary**: Traditional halftoning usually drops colors when dithering images with binary dots, which makes it difficult to recover the original color information. We proposed a novel halftoning technique that converts a color image into a binary halftone with full restorability to its original version. Our novel base halftoning technique consists of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to produce the reversible halftone patterns, and a noise incentive block (NIB) to mitigate the flatness degradation issue of CNNs. Furthermore, to tackle the conflicts between the blue-noise quality and restoration accuracy in our novel base method, we proposed a predictor-embedded approach to offload predictable information from the network, which in our case is the luminance information resembling from the halftone pattern. Such an approach allows the network to gain more flexibility to produce halftones with better blue-noise quality without compromising the restoration quality. Detailed studies on the multiple-stage training method and loss weightings have been conducted. We have compared our predictor-embedded method and our novel method regarding spectrum analysis on halftone, halftone accuracy, restoration accuracy, and the data embedding studies. Our entropy evaluation evidences our halftone contains less encoding information than our novel base method. The experiments show our predictor-embedded method gains more flexibility to improve the blue-noise quality of halftones and maintains a comparable restoration quality with a higher tolerance for disturbances.

- **Summary**: Poisoning efficiency is a crucial factor in poisoning-based backdoor attacks. Attackers prefer to use as few poisoned samples as possible to achieve the same level of attack strength, in order to remain undetected. Efficient triggers have significantly improved poisoning efficiency, but there is still room for improvement. Recently, selecting efficient samples has shown promise, but it requires a proxy backdoor injection task to find an efficient poisoned sample set, which can lead to performance degradation if the proxy attack settings are different from the actual settings used by the victims. In this paper, we propose a novel Proxy-Free Strategy (PFS) that selects efficient poisoned samples based on individual similarity and set diversity, effectively addressing this issue. We evaluate the proposed strategy on several datasets, triggers, poisoning ratios, architectures, and training hyperparameters. Our experimental results demonstrate that PFS achieves higher backdoor attack strength while x500 faster than previous proxy-based selection approaches.

- **Summary**: Machine learning society has witnessed the emergence of a myriad of Out-of-Distribution (OoD) algorithms, which address the distribution shift between the training and the testing distribution by searching for a unified predictor or invariant feature representation. However, the task of directly mitigating the distribution shift in the unseen testing set is rarely investigated, due to the unavailability of the testing distribution during the training phase and thus the impossibility of training a distribution translator mapping between the training and testing distribution. In this paper, we explore how to bypass the requirement of testing distribution for distribution translator training and make the distribution translation useful for OoD prediction. We propose a portable Distribution Shift Inversion algorithm, in which, before being fed into the prediction model, the OoD testing samples are first linearly combined with additional Gaussian noise and then transferred back towards the training distribution using a diffusion model trained only on the source distribution. Theoretical analysis reveals the feasibility of our method. Experimental results, on both multiple-domain generalization datasets and single-domain generalization datasets, show that our method provides a general performance gain when plugged into a wide range of commonly used OoD algorithms.

- **Summary**: Survival prediction is a complicated ordinal regression task that aims to predict the ranking risk of death, which generally benefits from the integration of histology and genomic data. Despite the progress in joint learning from pathology and genomics, existing methods still suffer from challenging issues: 1) Due to the large size of pathological images, it is difficult to effectively represent the gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). 2) Interactions within tumor microenvironment (TME) in histology are essential for survival analysis. Although current approaches attempt to model these interactions via co-attention between histology and genomic data, they focus on only dense local similarity across modalities, which fails to capture global consistency between potential structures, i.e. TME-related interactions of histology and co-expression of genomic data. To address these challenges, we propose a Multimodal Optimal Transport-based Co-Attention Transformer framework with global structure consistency, in which optimal transport (OT) is applied to match patches of a WSI and genes embeddings for selecting informative patches to represent the gigapixel WSI. More importantly, OT-based co-attention provides a global awareness to effectively capture structural interactions within TME for survival prediction. To overcome high computational complexity of OT, we propose a robust and efficient implementation over micro-batch of WSI patches by approximating the original OT with unbalanced mini-batch OT. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method on five benchmark datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code is released.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved outstanding performance on image processing challenges. Actually, CNNs imitate the typically developed human brain structures at the micro-level (Artificial neurons). At the same time, they distance themselves from imitating natural visual perception in humans at the macro architectures (high-level cognition). Recently it has been investigated that CNNs are highly biased toward local features and fail to detect the global aspects of their input. Nevertheless, the literature offers limited clues on this problem. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective solution inspired by the unconscious behavior of the human pupil. We devise a simple module called Global Advantage Stream (GAS) to learn and capture the holistic features of input samples (i.e., the global features). Then, the GAS features were combined with a CNN network as a plug-and-play component called the Global/Local Processing (GLP) model. The experimental results confirm that this stream improves the accuracy with an insignificant additional computational/temporal load and makes the network more robust to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, investigating the interpretation of the model shows that it learns a more holistic representation similar to the perceptual system of healthy humans

- **Summary**: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a meaningful but challenging task, and many learning-based UIE methods have been proposed in recent years. Although much progress has been made, these methods still exist two issues: (1) There exists a significant region-wise quality difference in a single underwater image due to the underwater imaging process, especially in regions with different scene depths. However, existing methods neglect this internal characteristic of underwater images, resulting in inferior performance; (2) Due to the uniqueness of the acquisition approach, underwater image acquisition tools usually capture multiple images in the same or similar scenes. Thus, the underwater images to be enhanced in practical usage are highly correlated. However, when processing a single image, existing methods do not consider the rich external information provided by the related images. There is still room for improvement in their performance. Motivated by these two aspects, we propose a novel internal-external representation learning (UIERL) network to better perform UIE tasks with internal and external information, simultaneously. In the internal representation learning stage, a new depth-based region feature guidance network is designed, including a region segmentation based on scene depth to sense regions with different quality levels, followed by a region-wise space encoder module. With performing region-wise feature learning for regions with different quality separately, the network provides an effective guidance for global features and thus guides intra-image differentiated enhancement. In the external representation learning stage, we first propose an external information extraction network to mine the rich external information in the related images. Then, internal and external features interact with each other via the proposed external-assist-internal module and internal-assist-e

- **Summary**: Open-set fine-grained anomaly detection is a challenging task that requires learning discriminative fine-grained features to detect anomalies that were even unseen during training. As a cheap yet effective approach, data augmentation has been widely used to create pseudo anomalies for better training of such models. Recent wisdom of augmentation methods focuses on generating random pseudo instances that may lead to a mixture of augmented instances with seen anomalies, or out of the typical range of anomalies. To address this issue, we propose a novel saliency-guided data augmentation method, SaliencyCut, to produce pseudo but more common anomalies which tend to stay in the plausible range of anomalies. Furthermore, we deploy a two-head learning strategy consisting of normal and anomaly learning heads, to learn the anomaly score of each sample. Theoretical analyses show that this mechanism offers a more tractable and tighter lower bound of the data log-likelihood. We then design a novel patch-wise residual module in the anomaly learning head to extract and assess the fine-grained anomaly features from each sample, facilitating the learning of discriminative representations of anomaly instances. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world anomaly detection datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method to the baseline and other state-of-the-art methods under various settings.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and object detection techniques have gained significant attention due to their vital role in image content analysis, interpretation, and wider HSI applications. However, current hyperspectral object detection approaches predominantly emphasize either spectral or spatial information, overlooking the valuable complementary relationship between these two aspects. In this study, we present a novel \textbf{S}pectral-\textbf{S}patial \textbf{A}ggregation (S2ADet) object detector that effectively harnesses the rich spectral and spatial complementary information inherent in hyperspectral images. S2ADet comprises a hyperspectral information decoupling (HID) module, a two-stream feature extraction network, and a one-stage detection head. The HID module processes hyperspectral images by aggregating spectral and spatial information via band selection and principal components analysis, consequently reducing redundancy. Based on the acquired spatial and spectral aggregation information, we propose a feature aggregation two-stream network for interacting spectral-spatial features. Furthermore, to address the limitations of existing databases, we annotate an extensive dataset, designated as HOD3K, containing 3,242 hyperspectral images captured across diverse real-world scenes and encompassing three object classes. These images possess a resolution of 512x256 pixels and cover 16 bands ranging from 470 nm to 620 nm. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that S2ADet surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust and reliable results.

- **Summary**: Recent deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to rely on vast amounts of training data, providing an opportunity for malicious attackers to exploit and contaminate the data to carry out backdoor attacks. These attacks significantly undermine the reliability of DNNs. However, existing backdoor attack methods make unrealistic assumptions, assuming that all training data comes from a single source and that attackers have full access to the training data. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic attack scenario where victims collect data from multiple sources, and attackers cannot access the complete training data. We refer to this scenario as data-constrained backdoor attacks. In such cases, previous attack methods suffer from severe efficiency degradation due to the entanglement between benign and poisoning features during the backdoor injection process.   To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that leverages the pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model. We introduce three CLIP-based technologies from two distinct streams: Clean Feature Suppression, which aims to suppress the influence of clean features to enhance the prominence of poisoning features, and Poisoning Feature Augmentation, which focuses on augmenting the presence and impact of poisoning features to effectively manipulate the model's behavior.   To evaluate the effectiveness, harmlessness to benign accuracy, and stealthiness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 target models, 3 datasets, and over 15 different settings. The results demonstrate remarkable improvements, with some settings achieving over 100% improvement compared to existing attacks in data-constrained scenarios. Our research contributes to addressing the limitations of existing methods and provides a practical and effective solution for data-constrained backdoor attacks.

- **Summary**: Object detection models, which are widely used in various domains (such as retail), have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing methods for detecting adversarial attacks on object detectors have had difficulty detecting new real-life attacks. We present X-Detect, a novel adversarial patch detector that can: i) detect adversarial samples in real time, allowing the defender to take preventive action; ii) provide explanations for the alerts raised to support the defender's decision-making process, and iii) handle unfamiliar threats in the form of new attacks. Given a new scene, X-Detect uses an ensemble of explainable-by-design detectors that utilize object extraction, scene manipulation, and feature transformation techniques to determine whether an alert needs to be raised. X-Detect was evaluated in both the physical and digital space using five different attack scenarios (including adaptive attacks) and the COCO dataset and our new Superstore dataset. The physical evaluation was performed using a smart shopping cart setup in real-world settings and included 17 adversarial patch attacks recorded in 1,700 adversarial videos. The results showed that X-Detect outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in distinguishing between benign and adversarial scenes for all attack scenarios while maintaining a 0% FPR (no false alarms) and providing actionable explanations for the alerts raised. A demo is available.

- **Summary**: Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), which aims at automatically recognizing unseen objects, is a promising learning paradigm to understand new real-world knowledge for machines continuously. Recently, the Knowledge Graph (KG) has been proven as an effective scheme for handling the zero-shot task with large-scale and non-attribute data. Prior studies always embed relationships of seen and unseen objects into visual information from existing knowledge graphs to promote the cognitive ability of the unseen data. Actually, real-world knowledge is naturally formed by multimodal facts. Compared with ordinary structural knowledge from a graph perspective, multimodal KG can provide cognitive systems with fine-grained knowledge. For example, the text description and visual content can depict more critical details of a fact than only depending on knowledge triplets. Unfortunately, this multimodal fine-grained knowledge is largely unexploited due to the bottleneck of feature alignment between different modalities. To that end, we propose a multimodal intensive ZSL framework that matches regions of images with corresponding semantic embeddings via a designed dense attention module and self-calibration loss. It makes the semantic transfer process of our ZSL framework learns more differentiated knowledge between entities. Our model also gets rid of the performance limitation of only using rough global features. We conduct extensive experiments and evaluate our model on large-scale real-world data. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in standard zero-shot classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in computer vision and natural language processing have naturally led to active research in multi-modal tasks, including Referring Image Segmentation (RIS). Recent approaches have advanced the frontier of RIS by impressive margins, but they require an additional pretraining stage on external visual grounding datasets to achieve the state-of-the-art performances. We attempt to break free from this requirement by effectively adapting Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to RIS. We propose a novel framework that residually adapts frozen CLIP features to RIS with Fusion Adapters and Backbone Adapters. Freezing CLIP preserves the backbone's rich, general image-text alignment knowledge, whilst Fusion Adapters introduce multi-modal communication and Backbone Adapters inject new knowledge useful in solving RIS. Our method reaches a new state of the art on three major RIS benchmarks. We attain such performance without additional pretraining and thereby absolve the necessity of extra training and data preparation. Source code and model weights will be available upon publication.

- **Summary**: Recent camera-based 3D object detection methods have introduced sequential frames to improve the detection performance hoping that multiple frames would mitigate the large depth estimation error. Despite improved detection performance, prior works rely on naive fusion methods (e.g., concatenation) or are limited to static scenes (e.g., temporal stereo), neglecting the importance of the motion cue of objects. These approaches do not fully exploit the potential of sequential images and show limited performance improvements. To address this limitation, we propose a novel 3D object detection model, P2D (Predict to Detect), that integrates a prediction scheme into a detection framework to explicitly extract and leverage motion features. P2D predicts object information in the current frame using solely past frames to learn temporal motion features. We then introduce a novel temporal feature aggregation method that attentively exploits Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features based on predicted object information, resulting in accurate 3D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate that P2D improves mAP and NDS by 3.0% and 3.7% compared to the sequential image-based baseline, illustrating that incorporating a prediction scheme can significantly improve detection accuracy.

- **Summary**: End-to-end reinforcement learning on images showed significant progress in the recent years. Data-based approach leverage data augmentation and domain randomization while representation learning methods use auxiliary losses to learn task-relevant features. Yet, reinforcement still struggles in visually diverse environments full of distractions and spurious noise. In this work, we tackle the problem of robust visual control at its core and present VIBR (View-Invariant Bellman Residuals), a method that combines multi-view training and invariant prediction to reduce out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization gap for RL based visuomotor control. Our model-free approach improve baselines performances without the need of additional representation learning objectives and with limited additional computational cost. We show that VIBR outperforms existing methods on complex visuo-motor control environment with high visual perturbation. Our approach achieves state-of the-art results on the Distracting Control Suite benchmark, a challenging benchmark still not solved by current methods, where we evaluate the robustness to a number of visual perturbators, as well as OOD generalization and extrapolation capabilities.

- **Summary**: Recently, encoders like ViT (vision transformer) and ResNet have been trained on vast datasets and utilized as perceptual metrics for comparing sketches and images, as well as multi-domain encoders in a zero-shot setting. However, there has been limited effort to quantify the granularity of these encoders. Our work addresses this gap by focusing on multi-modal 2D projections of individual 3D instances. This task holds crucial implications for retrieval and sketch-based modeling. We show that in a zero-shot setting, the more abstract the sketch, the higher the likelihood of incorrect image matches. Even within the same sketch domain, sketches of the same object drawn in different styles, for example by distinct individuals, might not be accurately matched. One of the key findings of our research is that meticulous fine-tuning on one class of 3D shapes can lead to improved performance on other shape classes, reaching or surpassing the accuracy of supervised methods. We compare and discuss several fine-tuning strategies. Additionally, we delve deeply into how the scale of an object in a sketch influences the similarity of features at different network layers, helping us identify which network layers provide the most accurate matching. Significantly, we discover that ViT and ResNet perform best when dealing with similar object scales. We believe that our work will have a significant impact on research in the sketch domain, providing insights and guidance on how to adopt large pretrained models as perceptual losses.

- **Summary**: Automated face recognition is a widely adopted machine learning technology for contactless identification of people in various processes such as automated border control, secure login to electronic devices, community surveillance, tracking school attendance, workplace clock in and clock out. Using face masks have become crucial in our daily life with the recent world-wide COVID-19 pandemic. The use of face masks causes the performance of conventional face recognition technologies to degrade considerably. The effect of mask-wearing in face recognition is yet an understudied issue. In this paper, we address this issue by evaluating the performance of a number of face recognition models which are tested by identifying masked and unmasked face images. We use six conventional machine learning algorithms, which are SVC, KNN, LDA, DT, LR and NB, to find out the ones which perform best, besides the ones which poorly perform, in the presence of masked face images. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is utilized as the feature extraction operator. We generated and used synthesized masked face images. We prepared unmasked, masked, and half-masked training datasets and evaluated the face recognition performance against both masked and unmasked images to present a broad view of this crucial problem. We believe that our study is unique in elaborating the mask-aware facial recognition with almost all possible scenarios including half_masked-to-masked and half_masked-to-unmasked besides evaluating a larger number of conventional machine learning algorithms compared the other studies in the literature.

- **Summary**: Adversarial examples (AEs) with small adversarial perturbations can mislead deep neural networks (DNNs) into wrong predictions. The AEs created on one DNN can also fool another DNN. Over the last few years, the transferability of AEs has garnered significant attention as it is a crucial property for facilitating black-box attacks. Many approaches have been proposed to improve adversarial transferability. However, they are mainly verified across different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, which is not a reliable evaluation since all CNNs share some similar architectural biases. In this work, we re-evaluate 12 representative transferability-enhancing attack methods where we test on 18 popular models from 4 types of neural networks. Our reevaluation revealed that the adversarial transferability is often overestimated, and there is no single AE that can be transferred to all popular models. The transferability rank of previous attacking methods changes when under our comprehensive evaluation. Based on our analysis, we propose a reliable benchmark including three evaluation protocols. Adversarial transferability on our new benchmark is extremely low, which further confirms the overestimation of adversarial transferability. We release our benchmark at https://adv-trans-eval.github.io to facilitate future research, which includes code, model checkpoints, and evaluation protocols.

- **Summary**: The extraordinary ability of generative models to generate photographic images has intensified concerns about the spread of disinformation, thereby leading to the demand for detectors capable of distinguishing between AI-generated fake images and real images. However, the lack of large datasets containing images from the most advanced image generators poses an obstacle to the development of such detectors. In this paper, we introduce the GenImage dataset, which has the following advantages: 1) Plenty of Images, including over one million pairs of AI-generated fake images and collected real images. 2) Rich Image Content, encompassing a broad range of image classes. 3) State-of-the-art Generators, synthesizing images with advanced diffusion models and GANs. The aforementioned advantages allow the detectors trained on GenImage to undergo a thorough evaluation and demonstrate strong applicability to diverse images. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and propose two tasks for evaluating the detection method in resembling real-world scenarios. The cross-generator image classification task measures the performance of a detector trained on one generator when tested on the others. The degraded image classification task assesses the capability of the detectors in handling degraded images such as low-resolution, blurred, and compressed images. With the GenImage dataset, researchers can effectively expedite the development and evaluation of superior AI-generated image detectors in comparison to prevailing methodologies.

- **Summary**: Due to the publicly available thematic maps and crowd-sourced data, remote sensing (RS) image annotations can be gathered at zero cost for training deep neural networks (DNNs). However, such annotation sources may increase the risk of including noisy labels in training data, leading to inaccurate RS image representation learning (IRL). To address this issue, in this paper we propose a label noise robust IRL method that aims to prevent the interference of noisy labels on IRL, independently from the learning task being considered in RS. To this end, the proposed method combines a supervised variational autoencoder (SVAE) with any kind of DNN. This is achieved by defining variational generative process based on image features. This allows us to define the importance of each training sample for IRL based on the loss values acquired from the SVAE and the task head of the considered DNN. Then, the proposed method imposes lower importance to images with noisy labels, while giving higher importance to those with correct labels during IRL. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared to well-known label noise robust IRL methods applied to RS images. The code of the proposed method is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/RS-IRL-SVAE.

- **Summary**: Computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) is becoming a standard, integral part of any modern colonoscopy system. A typical colonoscopy CADe detects a polyp in a single frame and does not track it through the video sequence. Yet, many downstream tasks including polyp characterization (CADx), quality metrics, automatic reporting, require aggregating polyp data from multiple frames. In this work we propose a robust long term polyp tracking method based on re-identification by visual appearance. Our solution uses an attention-based self-supervised ML model, specifically designed to leverage the temporal nature of video input. We quantitatively evaluate method's performance and demonstrate its value for the CADx task.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework and a solution to tackle the continual learning (CL) problem with changing network architectures. Most CL methods focus on adapting a single architecture to a new task/class by modifying its weights. However, with rapid progress in architecture design, the problem of adapting existing solutions to novel architectures becomes relevant. To address this limitation, we propose Heterogeneous Continual Learning (HCL), where a wide range of evolving network architectures emerge continually together with novel data/tasks. As a solution, we build on top of the distillation family of techniques and modify it to a new setting where a weaker model takes the role of a teacher; meanwhile, a new stronger architecture acts as a student. Furthermore, we consider a setup of limited access to previous data and propose Quick Deep Inversion (QDI) to recover prior task visual features to support knowledge transfer. QDI significantly reduces computational costs compared to previous solutions and improves overall performance. In summary, we propose a new setup for CL with a modified knowledge distillation paradigm and design a quick data inversion method to enhance distillation. Our evaluation of various benchmarks shows a significant improvement on accuracy in comparison to state-of-the-art methods over various networks architectures.

- **Summary**: Polyp segmentation has recently garnered significant attention, and multiple methods have been formulated to achieve commendable outcomes. However, these techniques often confront difficulty when working with the complex polyp foreground and their surrounding regions because of the nature of convolution operation. Besides, most existing methods forget to exploit the potential information from multiple decoder stages. To address this challenge, we suggest combining MetaFormer, introduced as a baseline for integrating CNN and Transformer, with UNet framework and incorporating our Multi-scale Upsampling block (MU). This simple module makes it possible to combine multi-level information by exploring multiple receptive field paths of the shallow decoder stage and then adding with the higher stage to aggregate better feature representation, which is essential in medical image segmentation. Taken all together, we propose MetaFormer Multi-scale Upsampling Network (M$^2$UNet) for the polyp segmentation task. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieved competitive performance compared with several previous methods.

- **Summary**: Localizing desired objects from remote sensing images is of great use in practical applications. Referring image segmentation, which aims at segmenting out the objects to which a given expression refers, has been extensively studied in natural images. However, almost no research attention is given to this task of remote sensing imagery. Considering its potential for real-world applications, in this paper, we introduce referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) to fill in this gap and make some insightful explorations. Specifically, we create a new dataset, called RefSegRS, for this task, enabling us to evaluate different methods. Afterward, we benchmark referring image segmentation methods of natural images on the RefSegRS dataset and find that these models show limited efficacy in detecting small and scattered objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose a language-guided cross-scale enhancement (LGCE) module that utilizes linguistic features to adaptively enhance multi-scale visual features by integrating both deep and shallow features. The proposed dataset, benchmarking results, and the designed LGCE module provide insights into the design of a better RRSIS model. We will make our dataset and code publicly available.

- **Summary**: We present a novel method that integrates subspace modeling with an adaptive generative image prior for high-dimensional MR image reconstruction. The subspace model imposes an explicit low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional images, while the generative image prior serves as a spatial constraint on the "contrast-weighted" images or the spatial coefficients of the subspace model. A formulation was introduced to synergize these two components with complimentary regularization such as joint sparsity. A special pretraining plus subject-specific network adaptation strategy was proposed to construct an accurate generative-model-based representation for images with varying contrasts, validated by experimental data. An iterative algorithm was introduced to jointly update the subspace coefficients and the multiresolution latent space of the generative image model that leveraged a recently developed intermediate layer optimization technique for network inversion. We evaluated the utility of the proposed method in two high-dimensional imaging applications: accelerated MR parameter mapping and high-resolution MRSI. Improved performance over state-of-the-art subspace-based methods was demonstrated in both cases. Our work demonstrated the potential of integrating data-driven and adaptive generative models with low-dimensional representation for high-dimensional imaging problems.

- **Summary**: We present a novel model for Tracking Any Point (TAP) that effectively tracks any queried point on any physical surface throughout a video sequence. Our approach employs two stages: (1) a matching stage, which independently locates a suitable candidate point match for the query point on every other frame, and (2) a refinement stage, which updates both the trajectory and query features based on local correlations. The resulting model surpasses all baseline methods by a significant margin on the TAP-Vid benchmark, as demonstrated by an approximate 20% absolute average Jaccard (AJ) improvement on DAVIS. Our model facilitates fast inference on long and high-resolution video sequences. On a modern GPU, our implementation has the capacity to track points faster than real-time, and can be flexibly extended to higher-resolution videos. Given the high-quality trajectories extracted from a large dataset, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept diffusion model which generates trajectories from static images, enabling plausible animations. Visualizations, source code, and pretrained models can be found on our project webpage.

- **Summary**: Recent research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to remarkable advancements in general NLP AI assistants. Some studies have further explored the use of LLMs for planning and invoking models or APIs to address more general multi-modal user queries. Despite this progress, complex visual-based tasks still remain challenging due to the diverse nature of visual tasks. This diversity is reflected in two aspects: 1) Reasoning paths. For many real-life applications, it is hard to accurately decompose a query simply by examining the query itself. Planning based on the specific visual content and the results of each step is usually required. 2) Flexible inputs and intermediate results. Input forms could be flexible for in-the-wild cases, and involves not only a single image or video but a mixture of videos and images, e.g., a user-view image with some reference videos. Besides, a complex reasoning process will also generate diverse multimodal intermediate results, e.g., video narrations, segmented video clips, etc. To address such general cases, we propose a multi-modal AI assistant, AssistGPT, with an interleaved code and language reasoning approach called Plan, Execute, Inspect, and Learn (PEIL) to integrate LLMs with various tools. Specifically, the Planner is capable of using natural language to plan which tool in Executor should do next based on the current reasoning progress. Inspector is an efficient memory manager to assist the Planner to feed proper visual information into a specific tool. Finally, since the entire reasoning process is complex and flexible, a Learner is designed to enable the model to autonomously explore and discover the optimal solution. We conducted experiments on A-OKVQA and NExT-QA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Moreover, showcases demonstrate the ability of our system to handle questions far more complex than those found in the benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The AI community has been pursuing algorithms known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) that apply to any kind of real-world problem. Recently, chat systems powered by large language models (LLMs) emerge and rapidly become a promising direction to achieve AGI in natural language processing (NLP), but the path towards AGI in computer vision (CV) remains unclear. One may owe the dilemma to the fact that visual signals are more complex than language signals, yet we are interested in finding concrete reasons, as well as absorbing experiences from GPT and LLMs to solve the problem. In this paper, we start with a conceptual definition of AGI and briefly review how NLP solves a wide range of tasks via a chat system. The analysis inspires us that unification is the next important goal of CV. But, despite various efforts in this direction, CV is still far from a system like GPT that naturally integrates all tasks. We point out that the essential weakness of CV lies in lacking a paradigm to learn from environments, yet NLP has accomplished the task in the text world. We then imagine a pipeline that puts a CV algorithm (i.e., an agent) in world-scale, interactable environments, pre-trains it to predict future frames with respect to its action, and then fine-tunes it with instruction to accomplish various tasks. We expect substantial research and engineering efforts to push the idea forward and scale it up, for which we share our perspectives on future research directions.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently gained attention with state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image synthesis. Abiding by the tradition in deep learning, DMs are trained and evaluated on the images with fixed sizes. However, users are demanding for various images with specific sizes and various aspect ratio. This paper focuses on adapting text-to-image diffusion models to handle such variety while maintaining visual fidelity. First we observe that, during the synthesis, lower resolution images suffer from incomplete object portrayal, while higher resolution images exhibit repetitive presentation. Next, we establish a statistical relationship indicating that attention entropy changes with token quantity, suggesting that models aggregate spatial information in proportion to image resolution. The subsequent interpretation on our observations is that objects are incompletely depicted due to limited spatial information for low resolutions, while repetitive presentation arises from redundant spatial information for high resolutions. From this perspective, we propose a scaling factor to alleviate the change of attention entropy and mitigate the defective pattern observed. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed scaling factor, which enables the model to achieve better visual effects, image quality, and text alignment. Notably, these improvements are achieved without additional training or fine-tuning techniques.

- **Summary**: We present a real-time visual-inertial dense mapping method capable of performing incremental 3D mesh reconstruction with high quality using only sequential monocular images and inertial measurement unit (IMU) readings. 6-DoF camera poses are estimated by a robust feature-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO), which also generates noisy sparse 3D map points as a by-product. We propose a sparse point aided multi-view stereo neural network (SPA-MVSNet) that can effectively leverage the informative but noisy sparse points from the VIO system. The sparse depth from VIO is firstly completed by a single-view depth completion network. This dense depth map, although naturally limited in accuracy, is then used as a prior to guide our MVS network in the cost volume generation and regularization for accurate dense depth prediction. Predicted depth maps of keyframe images by the MVS network are incrementally fused into a global map using TSDF-Fusion. We extensively evaluate both the proposed SPA-MVSNet and the entire visual-inertial dense mapping system on several public datasets as well as our own dataset, demonstrating the system's impressive generalization capabilities and its ability to deliver high-quality 3D mesh reconstruction online. Our proposed dense mapping system achieves a 39.7% improvement in F-score over existing systems when evaluated on the challenging scenarios of the EuRoC dataset.

- **Summary**: Cognitive science and psychology suggest that object-centric representations of complex scenes are a promising step towards enabling efficient abstract reasoning from low-level perceptual features. Yet, most deep reinforcement learning approaches rely on only pixel-based representations that do not capture the compositional properties of natural scenes. For this, we need environments and datasets that allow us to work and evaluate object-centric approaches. We present OCAtari, a set of environment that provides object-centric state representations of Atari games, the most-used evaluation framework for deep RL approaches. OCAtari also allows for RAM state manipulations of the games to change and create specific or even novel situations. The code base for this work is available at github.com/k4ntz/OC_Atari.

- **Summary**: Automatic emotion recognition has recently gained significant attention due to the growing popularity of deep learning algorithms. One of the primary challenges in emotion recognition is effectively utilizing the various cues (modalities) available in the data. Another challenge is providing a proper explanation of the outcome of the learning.To address these challenges, we present Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Situational Knowledge (EMERSK), a generalized and modular system for human emotion recognition and explanation using visual information. Our system can handle multiple modalities, including facial expressions, posture, and gait, in a flexible and modular manner. The network consists of different modules that can be added or removed depending on the available data. We utilize a two-stream network architecture with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and encoder-decoder style attention mechanisms to extract deep features from face images. Similarly, CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) are employed to extract features from posture and gait data. We also incorporate deep features from the background as contextual information for the learning process. The deep features from each module are fused using an early fusion network. Furthermore, we leverage situational knowledge derived from the location type and adjective-noun pair (ANP) extracted from the scene, as well as the spatio-temporal average distribution of emotions, to generate explanations. Ablation studies demonstrate that each sub-network can independently perform emotion recognition, and combining them in a multimodal approach significantly improves overall recognition performance. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets, including GroupWalk, validate the superior performance of our approach compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-language (VL) models with separate encoders for each modality (e.g., CLIP) have become the go-to models for zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval. The bulk of the evaluation of these models is, however, performed with English text only: the costly creation of language-specific image-caption datasets has limited multilingual VL benchmarks to a handful of high-resource languages. In this work, we introduce Babel-ImageNet, a massively multilingual benchmark that offers (partial) translations of 1000 ImageNet labels to 92 languages, built without resorting to machine translation (MT) or requiring manual annotation. We instead automatically obtain reliable translations of ImageNext concepts by linking them -- via shared WordNet synsets -- to BabelNet, a massively multilingual lexico-semantic network. We evaluate 8 different publicly available multilingual CLIP models on zero-shot image classification (ZS-IC) for each of the 92 Babel-ImageNet languages, demonstrating a significant gap between English ImageNet performance and that of high-resource languages (e.g., German or Chinese), and an even bigger gap for low-resource languages (e.g., Sinhala or Lao). Crucially, we show that the models' ZS-IC performance on Babel-ImageNet highly correlates with their performance in image-text retrieval, validating that Babel-ImageNet is suitable for estimating the quality of the multilingual VL representation spaces for the vast majority of languages that lack gold image-text data. Finally, we show that the performance of multilingual CLIP for low-resource languages can be drastically improved via cheap, parameter-efficient language-specific training.

- **Summary**: With the rise of large-scale models trained on broad data, in-context learning has become a new learning paradigm that has demonstrated significant potential in natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Meanwhile, in-context learning is still largely unexplored in the 3D point cloud domain. Although masked modeling has been successfully applied for in-context learning in 2D vision, directly extending it to 3D point clouds remains a formidable challenge. In the case of point clouds, the tokens themselves are the point cloud positions (coordinates) that are masked during inference. Moreover, position embedding in previous works may inadvertently introduce information leakage. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, named Point-In-Context, designed especially for in-context learning in 3D point clouds, where both inputs and outputs are modeled as coordinates for each task. Additionally, we propose the Joint Sampling module, carefully designed to work in tandem with the general point sampling operator, effectively resolving the aforementioned technical issues. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the versatility and adaptability of our proposed methods in handling a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, with a more effective prompt selection strategy, our framework surpasses the results of individually trained models.

- **Summary**: We introduce a method that can learn to predict scene-level implicit functions for 3D reconstruction from posed RGBD data. At test time, our system maps a previously unseen RGB image to a 3D reconstruction of a scene via implicit functions. While implicit functions for 3D reconstruction have often been tied to meshes, we show that we can train one using only a set of posed RGBD images. This setting may help 3D reconstruction unlock the sea of accelerometer+RGBD data that is coming with new phones. Our system, D2-DRDF, can match and sometimes outperform current methods that use mesh supervision and shows better robustness to sparse data.

- **Summary**: The ability to connect language units to their referents in the physical world, referred to as grounding, is crucial to learning and understanding grounded meanings of words. While humans demonstrate fast mapping in new word learning, it remains unclear whether modern vision-language models can truly represent language with their grounded meanings and how grounding may further bootstrap new word learning. To this end, we introduce Grounded Open Vocabulary Acquisition (GOVA) to examine grounding and bootstrapping in open-world language learning. As an initial attempt, we propose object-oriented BERT (OctoBERT), a novel visually-grounded language model by pre-training on image-text pairs highlighting grounding as an objective. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that OctoBERT is a more coherent and fast grounded word learner, and that the grounding ability acquired during pre-training helps the model to learn unseen words more rapidly and robustly.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models show great potential in synthesizing a large variety of concepts in new compositions and scenarios. However, their latent seed space is still not well understood and has been shown to have an impact in generating new and rare concepts. Specifically, simple operations like interpolation and centroid finding work poorly with the standard Euclidean and spherical metrics in the latent space. This paper makes the observation that current training procedures make diffusion models biased toward inputs with a narrow range of norm values. This has strong implications for methods that rely on seed manipulation for image generation that can be further applied to few-shot and long-tail learning tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for interpolating between two seeds and demonstrate that it defines a new non-Euclidean metric that takes into account a norm-based prior on seeds. We describe a simple yet efficient algorithm for approximating this metric and use it to further define centroids in the latent seed space. We show that our new interpolation and centroid evaluation techniques significantly enhance the generation of rare concept images. This further leads to state-of-the-art performance on few-shot and long-tail benchmarks, improving prior approach in terms of generation speed, image quality, and semantic content.

- **Summary**: Distribution-to-Distribution (D2D) point cloud registration algorithms are fast, interpretable, and perform well in unstructured environments. Unfortunately, existing strategies for predicting solution error for these methods are overly optimistic, particularly in regions containing large or extended physical objects. In this paper we introduce the Iterative Closest Ellipsoidal Transform (ICET), a novel 3D LIDAR scan-matching algorithm that re-envisions NDT in order to provide robust accuracy prediction from first principles. Like NDT, ICET subdivides a LIDAR scan into voxels in order to analyze complex scenes by considering many smaller local point distributions, however, ICET assesses the voxel distribution to distinguish random noise from deterministic structure. ICET then uses a weighted least-squares formulation to incorporate this noise/structure distinction into computing a localization solution and predicting the solution-error covariance. In order to demonstrate the reasonableness of our accuracy predictions, we verify 3D ICET in three LIDAR tests involving real-world automotive data, high-fidelity simulated trajectories, and simulated corner-case scenes. For each test, ICET consistently performs scan matching with sub-centimeter accuracy. This level of accuracy, combined with the fact that the algorithm is fully interpretable, make it well suited for safety-critical transportation applications.

- **Summary**: Recently, diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success for image generation and edition. However, their use for video editing still faces important limitations. This paper introduces VidEdit, a novel method for zero-shot text-based video editing ensuring strong temporal and spatial consistency. Firstly, we propose to combine atlas-based and pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to provide a training-free and efficient editing method, which by design fulfills temporal smoothness. Secondly, we leverage off-the-shelf panoptic segmenters along with edge detectors and adapt their use for conditioned diffusion-based atlas editing. This ensures a fine spatial control on targeted regions while strictly preserving the structure of the original video. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that VidEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DAVIS dataset, regarding semantic faithfulness, image preservation, and temporal consistency metrics. With this framework, processing a single video only takes approximately one minute, and it can generate multiple compatible edits based on a unique text prompt.

- **Summary**: We propose and address a new generalisation problem: can a model trained for action recognition successfully classify actions when they are performed within a previously unseen scenario and in a previously unseen location? To answer this question, we introduce the Action Recognition Generalisation Over scenarios and locations dataset (ARGO1M), which contains 1.1M video clips from the large-scale Ego4D dataset, across 10 scenarios and 13 locations. We demonstrate recognition models struggle to generalise over 10 proposed test splits, each of an unseen scenario in an unseen location. We thus propose CIR, a method to represent each video as a Cross-Instance Reconstruction of videos from other domains. Reconstructions are paired with text narrations to guide the learning of a domain generalisable representation. We provide extensive analysis and ablations on ARGO1M that show CIR outperforms prior domain generalisation works on all test splits. Code and data: https://chiaraplizz.github.io/what-can-a-cook/.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a solution to the cross-domain adaptation problem for 2D surgical image segmentation, explicitly considering the privacy protection of distributed datasets belonging to different centers. Deep learning architectures in medical image analysis necessitate extensive training data for better generalization. However, obtaining sufficient diagnostic and surgical data is still challenging, mainly due to the inherent cost of data curation and the need of experts for data annotation. Moreover, increased privacy and legal compliance concerns can make data sharing across clinical sites or regions difficult. Another ubiquitous challenge the medical datasets face is inevitable domain shifts among the collected data at the different centers. To this end, we propose a Client-server deep federated architecture for cross-domain adaptation. A server hosts a set of immutable parameters common to both the source and target domains. The clients consist of the respective domain-specific parameters and make requests to the server while learning their parameters and inferencing. We evaluate our framework in two benchmark datasets, demonstrating applicability in computer-assisted interventions for endoscopic polyp segmentation and diagnostic skin lesion detection and analysis. Our extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to competitive baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Neural rendering is fuelling a unification of learning, 3D geometry and video understanding that has been waiting for more than two decades. Progress, however, is still hampered by a lack of suitable datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce EPIC Fields, an augmentation of EPIC-KITCHENS with 3D camera information. Like other datasets for neural rendering, EPIC Fields removes the complex and expensive step of reconstructing cameras using photogrammetry, and allows researchers to focus on modelling problems. We illustrate the challenge of photogrammetry in egocentric videos of dynamic actions and propose innovations to address them. Compared to other neural rendering datasets, EPIC Fields is better tailored to video understanding because it is paired with labelled action segments and the recent VISOR segment annotations. To further motivate the community, we also evaluate two benchmark tasks in neural rendering and segmenting dynamic objects, with strong baselines that showcase what is not possible today. We also highlight the advantage of geometry in semi-supervised video object segmentations on the VISOR annotations. EPIC Fields reconstructs 96% of videos in EPICKITCHENS, registering 19M frames in 99 hours recorded in 45 kitchens.

- **Journal**: AAAI Spring Symposium 2022
- **Summary**: Current works in human emotion recognition follow the traditional closed learning approach governed by rigid rules without any consideration of novelty. Classification models are trained on some collected datasets and expected to have the same data distribution in the real-world deployment. Due to the fluid and constantly changing nature of the world we live in, it is possible to have unexpected and novel sample distribution which can lead the model to fail. Hence, in this work, we propose a continuous learning based approach to deal with novelty in the automatic emotion recognition task.

- **Summary**: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the target instance referred by a given text expression in a video clip. The text expression normally contains sophisticated descriptions of the instance's appearance, actions, and relations with others. It is therefore rather difficult for an RVOS model to capture all these attributes correspondingly in the video; in fact, the model often favours more on the action- and relation-related visual attribute of the instance. This can end up with incomplete or even incorrect mask prediction of the target instance. In this paper, we tackle this problem by taking a subject-centric short text expression from the original long text expression. The short one retains only the appearance-related information of the target instance so that we can use it to focus the model's attention on the instance's appearance. We let the model make joint predictions using both long and short text expressions and introduce a long-short predictions intersection loss to align the joint predictions. Besides the improvement on the linguistic part, we also introduce a forward-backward visual consistency loss, which utilizes optical flows to warp visual features between the annotated frames and their temporal neighbors for consistency. We build our method on top of two state of the art transformer-based pipelines for end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences datasets show impressive improvements of our method.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present SAFER, a novel system for emotion recognition from facial expressions. It employs state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to extract various features from facial images and incorporates contextual information, such as background and location type, to enhance its performance. The system has been designed to operate in an open-world setting, meaning it can adapt to unseen and varied facial expressions, making it suitable for real-world applications. An extensive evaluation of SAFER against existing works in the field demonstrates improved performance, achieving an accuracy of 91.4% on the CAER-S dataset. Additionally, the study investigates the effect of novelty such as face masks during the Covid-19 pandemic on facial emotion recognition and critically examines the limitations of mainstream facial expressions datasets. To address these limitations, a novel dataset for facial emotion recognition is proposed. The proposed dataset and the system are expected to be useful for various applications such as human-computer interaction, security, and surveillance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the challenges of Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) methods for underwater robots. While significant progress has been made in state estimation methods that utilize visual data in the past decade, most evaluations have been limited to controlled indoor and urban environments, where impressive performance was demonstrated. However, these techniques have not been extensively tested in extremely challenging conditions, such as underwater scenarios where factors such as water and light conditions, robot path, and depth can greatly impact algorithm performance. Hence, our evaluation is conducted in real-world AUV scenarios as well as laboratory settings which provide precise external reference. A focus is laid on understanding the impact of environmental conditions, such as optical properties of the water and illumination scenarios, on the performance of monocular vSLAM methods. To this end, we first show that all methods perform very well in in-air settings and subsequently show the degradation of their performance in challenging underwater environments. The final goal of this study is to identify techniques that can improve accuracy and robustness of SLAM methods in such conditions. To achieve this goal, we investigate the potential of image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of input images used by the SLAM methods, specifically in low visibility and extreme lighting scenarios in scattering media. We present a first evaluation on calibration maneuvers and simple image restoration techniques to determine their ability to enable or enhance the performance of monocular SLAM methods in underwater environments.

- **Summary**: Learned visual dynamics models have proven effective for robotic manipulation tasks. Yet, it remains unclear how best to represent scenes involving multi-object interactions. Current methods decompose a scene into discrete objects, but they struggle with precise modeling and manipulation amid challenging lighting conditions as they only encode appearance tied with specific illuminations. In this work, we propose using object-centric neural scattering functions (OSFs) as object representations in a model-predictive control framework. OSFs model per-object light transport, enabling compositional scene re-rendering under object rearrangement and varying lighting conditions. By combining this approach with inverse parameter estimation and graph-based neural dynamics models, we demonstrate improved model-predictive control performance and generalization in compositional multi-object environments, even in previously unseen scenarios and harsh lighting conditions.

- **Summary**: Despite advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA), the ability of models to assess their own correctness remains underexplored. Recent work has shown that VQA models, out-of-the-box, can have difficulties abstaining from answering when they are wrong. The option to abstain, also called Selective Prediction, is highly relevant when deploying systems to users who must trust the system's output (e.g., VQA assistants for users with visual impairments). For such scenarios, abstention can be especially important as users may provide out-of-distribution (OOD) or adversarial inputs that make incorrect answers more likely. In this work, we explore Selective VQA in both in-distribution (ID) and OOD scenarios, where models are presented with mixtures of ID and OOD data. The goal is to maximize the number of questions answered while minimizing the risk of error on those questions. We propose a simple yet effective Learning from Your Peers (LYP) approach for training multimodal selection functions for making abstention decisions. Our approach uses predictions from models trained on distinct subsets of the training data as targets for optimizing a Selective VQA model. It does not require additional manual labels or held-out data and provides a signal for identifying examples that are easy/difficult to generalize to. In our extensive evaluations, we show this benefits a number of models across different architectures and scales. Overall, for ID, we reach 32.92% in the selective prediction metric coverage at 1% risk of error (C@1%) which doubles the previous best coverage of 15.79% on this task. For mixed ID/OOD, using models' softmax confidences for abstention decisions performs very poorly, answering <5% of questions at 1% risk of error even when faced with only 10% OOD examples, but a learned selection function with LYP can increase that to 25.38% C@1%.

- **Summary**: While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality samples, their latent variables typically lack semantic meaning and are not suitable for representation learning. Here, we propose InfoDiffusion, an algorithm that augments diffusion models with low-dimensional latent variables that capture high-level factors of variation in the data. InfoDiffusion relies on a learning objective regularized with the mutual information between observed and hidden variables, which improves latent space quality and prevents the latents from being ignored by expressive diffusion-based decoders. Empirically, we find that InfoDiffusion learns disentangled and human-interpretable latent representations that are competitive with state-of-the-art generative and contrastive methods, while retaining the high sample quality of diffusion models. Our method enables manipulating the attributes of generated images and has the potential to assist tasks that require exploring a learned latent space to generate quality samples, e.g., generative design.

Existing methods either involve time-consuming optimization for a specific person with multiple images, or they struggle to synthesize intricate appearance details beyond the facial region. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that not only generalizes to unseen identities based on a single-view image without requiring person-specific optimization, but also captures characteristic details within and beyond the face area (e.g. hairstyle, accessories, etc.). At the core of our method are three branches that produce three tri-planes representing the coarse 3D geometry, detailed appearance of a source image, as well as the expression of a target image. By applying volumetric rendering to the combination of the three tri-planes followed by a super-resolution module, our method yields a high fidelity image of the desired identity, expression and pose. Once trained, our model enables efficient 3D head avatar reconstruction and animation via a single forward pass through a network. Experiments show that the proposed approach generalizes well to unseen validation datasets, surpassing SOTA baseline methods by a large margin on head avatar reconstruction and animation.

- **Summary**: Explainability plays a crucial role in providing a more comprehensive understanding of deep learning models' behaviour. This allows for thorough validation of the model's performance, ensuring that its decisions are based on relevant visual indicators and not biased toward irrelevant patterns existing in training data. However, existing methods provide only instance-level explainability, which requires manual analysis of each sample. Such manual review is time-consuming and prone to human biases. To address this issue, the concept of second-order explainable AI (SOXAI) was recently proposed to extend explainable AI (XAI) from the instance level to the dataset level. SOXAI automates the analysis of the connections between quantitative explanations and dataset biases by identifying prevalent concepts. In this work, we explore the use of this higher-level interpretation of a deep neural network's behaviour to allows us to "explain the explainability" for actionable insights. Specifically, we demonstrate for the first time, via example classification and segmentation cases, that eliminating irrelevant concepts from the training set based on actionable insights from SOXAI can enhance a model's performance.

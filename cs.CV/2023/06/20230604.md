- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in text-to-image generation. They utilize a text encoder and cross-attention blocks to infuse textual information into images at a pixel level. However, their capability to generate images with text containing multiple objects is still restricted. Previous works identify the problem of information mixing in the CLIP text encoder and introduce the T5 text encoder or incorporate strong prior knowledge to assist with the alignment. We find that mixing problems also occur on the image side and in the cross-attention blocks. The noisy images can cause different objects to appear similar, and the cross-attention blocks inject information at a pixel level, leading to leakage of global object understanding and resulting in object mixing. In this paper, we introduce Detector Guidance (DG), which integrates a latent object detection model to separate different objects during the generation process. DG first performs latent object detection on cross-attention maps (CAMs) to obtain object information. Based on this information, DG then masks conflicting prompts and enhances related prompts by manipulating the following CAMs. We evaluate the effectiveness of DG using Stable Diffusion on COCO, CC, and a novel multi-related object benchmark, MRO. Human evaluations demonstrate that DG provides an 8-22\% advantage in preventing the amalgamation of conflicting concepts and ensuring that each object possesses its unique region without any human involvement and additional iterations.

- **Summary**: Large visual-language models, like CLIP, learn generalized representations and have shown promising zero-shot performance. Few-shot adaptation methods, based on prompt tuning, have also been shown to further improve performance on downstream datasets. However, these models are not hierarchically consistent. Frequently, they infer incorrect labels at coarser taxonomic class levels, even when the inference at the leaf level (original class labels) is correct. This is problematic, given their support for open set classification and, in particular, open-grained classification, where practitioners define label sets at various levels of granularity. To address this problem, we propose a prompt tuning technique to calibrate the hierarchical consistency of model predictions. A set of metrics of hierarchical consistency, the Hierarchical Consistent Accuracy (HCA) and the Mean Treecut Accuracy (MTA), are first proposed to benchmark model performance in the open-granularity setting. A prompt tuning technique, denoted as Prompt Tuning for Hierarchical Consistency (ProTeCt), is then proposed to calibrate classification across all possible label set granularities. Results show that ProTeCt can be combined with existing prompt tuning methods to significantly improve open-granularity classification performance without degradation of the original classification performance at the leaf level.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning has become a popular approach for adapting large vision-language models, such as CLIP, to downstream tasks. Typically, prompt learning relies on a fixed prompt token or an input-conditional token to fit a small amount of data under full supervision. While this paradigm can generalize to a certain range of unseen classes, it may struggle when domain gap increases, such as in fine-grained classification and satellite image segmentation. To address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-enhanced Prompt learning (RePrompt), which introduces retrieval mechanisms to cache the knowledge representations from downstream tasks. we first construct a retrieval database from training examples, or from external examples when available. We then integrate this retrieval-enhanced mechanism into various stages of a simple prompt learning baseline. By referencing similar samples in the training set, the enhanced model is better able to adapt to new tasks with few samples. Our extensive experiments over 15 vision datasets, including 11 downstream tasks with few-shot setting and 4 domain generalization benchmarks, demonstrate that RePrompt achieves considerably improved performance. Our proposed approach provides a promising solution to the challenges faced by prompt learning when domain gap increases. The code and models will be available.

- **Summary**: With the development of large language models, many remarkable linguistic systems like ChatGPT have thrived and achieved astonishing success on many tasks, showing the incredible power of foundation models. In the spirit of unleashing the capability of foundation models on vision tasks, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a vision foundation model for image segmentation, has been proposed recently and presents strong zero-shot ability on many downstream 2D tasks. However, whether SAM can be adapted to 3D vision tasks has yet to be explored, especially 3D object detection. With this inspiration, we explore adapting the zero-shot ability of SAM to 3D object detection in this paper. We propose a SAM-powered BEV processing pipeline to detect objects and get promising results on the large-scale Waymo open dataset. As an early attempt, our method takes a step toward 3D object detection with vision foundation models and presents the opportunity to unleash their power on 3D vision tasks.

- **Summary**: We introduce MoviePuzzle, a novel challenge that targets visual narrative reasoning and holistic movie understanding. Despite the notable progress that has been witnessed in the realm of video understanding, most prior works fail to present tasks and models to address holistic video understanding and the innate visual narrative structures existing in long-form videos. To tackle this quandary, we put forth MoviePuzzle task that amplifies the temporal feature learning and structure learning of video models by reshuffling the shot, frame, and clip layers of movie segments in the presence of video-dialogue information. We start by establishing a carefully refined dataset based on MovieNet by dissecting movies into hierarchical layers and randomly permuting the orders. Besides benchmarking the MoviePuzzle with prior arts on movie understanding, we devise a Hierarchical Contrastive Movie Clustering (HCMC) model that considers the underlying structure and visual semantic orders for movie reordering. Specifically, through a pairwise and contrastive learning approach, we train models to predict the correct order of each layer. This equips them with the knack for deciphering the visual narrative structure of movies and handling the disorder lurking in video data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the \MoviePuzzle benchmark, underscoring its efficacy.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) gains increasing attention from researchers as an important part of human-computer interaction. However, the existing available Mandarin audio-visual datasets are limited and lack the depth information. To address this issue, this work establishes the MAVD, a new large-scale Mandarin multimodal corpus comprising 12,484 utterances spoken by 64 native Chinese speakers. To ensure the dataset covers diverse real-world scenarios, a pipeline for cleaning and filtering the raw text material has been developed to create a well-balanced reading material. In particular, the latest data acquisition device of Microsoft, Azure Kinect is used to capture depth information in addition to the traditional audio signals and RGB images during data acquisition. We also provide a baseline experiment, which could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the dataset. The dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/SpringHuo/MAVD.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has made significant progress with the development of pseudo-label-based end-to-end methods. However, many of these methods face challenges due to class imbalance, which hinders the effectiveness of the pseudo-label generator. Furthermore, in the literature, it has been observed that low-quality pseudo-labels severely limit the performance of SSOD. In this paper, we examine the root causes of low-quality pseudo-labels and present novel learning mechanisms to improve the label generation quality. To cope with high false-negative and low precision rates, we introduce an adaptive thresholding mechanism that helps the proposed network to filter out optimal bounding boxes. We further introduce a Jitter-Bagging module to provide accurate information on localization to help refine the bounding boxes. Additionally, two new losses are introduced using the background and foreground scores predicted by the teacher and student networks to improvise the pseudo-label recall rate. Furthermore, our method applies strict supervision to the teacher network by feeding strong & weak augmented data to generate robust pseudo-labels so that it can detect small and complex objects. Finally, the extensive experiments show that the proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets and allows the baseline network to achieve 100% supervised performance with much less (i.e., 20%) labeled data.



### USD: Unknown Sensitive Detector Empowered by Decoupled Objectness and Segment Anything Model

- **Summary**: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a novel and challenging computer vision task that enables object detection with the ability to detect unknown objects. Existing methods typically estimate the object likelihood with an additional objectness branch, but ignore the conflict in learning objectness and classification boundaries, which oppose each other on the semantic manifold and training objective. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective learning strategy, namely Decoupled Objectness Learning (DOL), which divides the learning of these two boundaries into suitable decoder layers. Moreover, detecting unknown objects comprehensively requires a large amount of annotations, but labeling all unknown objects is both difficult and expensive. Therefore, we propose to take advantage of the recent Large Vision Model (LVM), specifically the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to enhance the detection of unknown objects. Nevertheless, the output results of SAM contain noise, including backgrounds and fragments, so we introduce an Auxiliary Supervision Framework (ASF) that uses a pseudo-labeling and a soft-weighting strategies to alleviate the negative impact of noise. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks, including Pascal VOC and MS COCO, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our proposed Unknown Sensitive Detector (USD) outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of Unknown Recall, achieving significant improvements of 14.3\%, 15.5\%, and 8.9\% on the M-OWODB, and 27.1\%, 29.1\%, and 25.1\% on the S-OWODB.

- **Summary**: In face detection, low-resolution faces, such as numerous small faces of a human group in a crowded scene, are common in dense face prediction tasks. They usually contain limited visual clues and make small faces less distinguishable from the other small objects, which poses great challenge to accurate face detection. Although deep convolutional neural network has significantly promoted the research on face detection recently, current deep face detectors rarely take into account low-resolution faces and are still vulnerable to the real-world scenarios where massive amount of low-resolution faces exist. Consequently, they usually achieve degraded performance for low-resolution face detection. In order to alleviate this problem, we develop an efficient detector termed EfficientSRFace by introducing a feature-level super-resolution reconstruction network for enhancing the feature representation capability of the model. This module plays an auxiliary role in the training process, and can be removed during the inference without increasing the inference time. Extensive experiments on public benchmarking datasets, such as FDDB and WIDER Face, show that the embedded image super-resolution module can significantly improve the detection accuracy at the cost of a small amount of additional parameters and computational overhead, while helping our model achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-arts methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce 3rd place solution for PVUW2023 VSS track. Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with numerous real-world applications. We have explored various image-level visual backbones and segmentation heads to tackle the problem of video semantic segmentation. Through our experimentation, we find that InternImage-H as the backbone and Mask2former as the segmentation head achieves the best performance. In addition, we explore two post-precessing methods: CascadePSP and Segment Anything Model (SAM). Ultimately, our approach obtains 62.60\% and 64.84\% mIoU on the VSPW test set1 and final test set, respectively, securing the third position in the PVUW2023 VSS track.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an important technique for perceiving human vital signs, which has received extensive attention. For a long time, researchers have focused on supervised methods that rely on large amounts of labeled data. These methods are limited by the requirement for large amounts of data and the difficulty of acquiring ground truth physiological signals. To address these issues, several self-supervised methods based on contrastive learning have been proposed. However, they focus on the contrastive learning between samples, which neglect the inherent self-similar prior in physiological signals and seem to have a limited ability to cope with noisy. In this paper, a linear self-supervised reconstruction task was designed for extracting the inherent self-similar prior in physiological signals. Besides, a specific noise-insensitive strategy was explored for reducing the interference of motion and illumination. The proposed framework in this paper, namely rPPG-MAE, demonstrates excellent performance even on the challenging VIPL-HR dataset. We also evaluate the proposed method on two public datasets, namely PURE and UBFC-rPPG. The results show that our method not only outperforms existing self-supervised methods but also exceeds the state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised methods. One important observation is that the quality of the dataset seems more important than the size in self-supervised pre-training of rPPG.

- **Summary**: Scene parsing is a great challenge for real-time semantic segmentation. Although traditional semantic segmentation networks have made remarkable leap-forwards in semantic accuracy, the performance of inference speed is unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, this progress is achieved with fairly large networks and powerful computational resources. However, it is difficult to run extremely large models on edge computing devices with limited computing power, which poses a huge challenge to the real-time semantic segmentation tasks. In this paper, we present the Cross-CBAM network, a novel lightweight network for real-time semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Squeeze-and-Excitation Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling Module(SE-ASPP) is proposed to get variable field-of-view and multiscale information. And we propose a Cross Convolutional Block Attention Module(CCBAM), in which a cross-multiply operation is employed in the CCBAM module to make high-level semantic information guide low-level detail information. Different from previous work, these works use attention to focus on the desired information in the backbone. CCBAM uses cross-attention for feature fusion in the FPN structure. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset and Camvid dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Cross-CBAM model by achieving a promising trade-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. On the Cityscapes test set, we achieve 73.4% mIoU with a speed of 240.9FPS and 77.2% mIoU with a speed of 88.6FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti.



### Using Unreliable Pseudo-Labels for Label-Efficient Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: The crux of label-efficient semantic segmentation is to produce high-quality pseudo-labels to leverage a large amount of unlabeled or weakly labeled data. A common practice is to select the highly confident predictions as the pseudo-ground-truths for each pixel, but it leads to a problem that most pixels may be left unused due to their unreliability. However, we argue that every pixel matters to the model training, even those unreliable and ambiguous pixels. Intuitively, an unreliable prediction may get confused among the top classes, however, it should be confident about the pixel not belonging to the remaining classes. Hence, such a pixel can be convincingly treated as a negative key to those most unlikely categories. Therefore, we develop an effective pipeline to make sufficient use of unlabeled data. Concretely, we separate reliable and unreliable pixels via the entropy of predictions, push each unreliable pixel to a category-wise queue that consists of negative keys, and manage to train the model with all candidate pixels. Considering the training evolution, we adaptively adjust the threshold for the reliable-unreliable partition. Experimental results on various benchmarks and training settings demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art alternatives.

- **Summary**: The diffusion model has gained popularity in vision applications due to its remarkable generative performance and versatility. However, high storage and computation demands, resulting from the model size and iterative generation, hinder its use on mobile devices. Existing quantization techniques struggle to maintain performance even in 8-bit precision due to the diffusion model's unique property of temporal variation in activation. We introduce a novel quantization method that dynamically adjusts the quantization interval based on time step information, significantly improving output quality. Unlike conventional dynamic quantization techniques, our approach has no computational overhead during inference and is compatible with both post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). Our extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in output quality with the quantized diffusion model across various datasets.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection has great potential in enhancing safety in the production and monitoring of crucial areas. Currently, most video anomaly detection methods are based on RGB modality, but its redundant semantic information may breach the privacy of residents or patients. The 3D data obtained by depth camera and LiDAR can accurately locate anomalous events in 3D space while preserving human posture and motion information. Identifying individuals through the point cloud is difficult due to its sparsity, which protects personal privacy. In this study, we propose Point Spatio-Temporal Auto-Encoder (PSTAE), an autoencoder framework that uses point cloud videos as input to detect anomalies in point cloud videos. We introduce PSTOp and PSTTransOp to maintain spatial geometric and temporal motion information in point cloud videos. To measure the reconstruction loss of the proposed autoencoder framework, we propose a reconstruction loss measurement strategy based on a shallow feature extractor. Experimental results on the TIMo dataset show that our method outperforms currently representative depth modality-based methods in terms of AUROC and has superior performance in detecting Medical Issue anomalies. These results suggest the potential of point cloud modality in video anomaly detection. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the TIMo dataset.

- **Summary**: Training models to apply common-sense linguistic knowledge and visual concepts from 2D images to 3D scene understanding is a promising direction that researchers have only recently started to explore. However, it still remains understudied whether 2D distilled knowledge can provide useful representations for downstream 3D vision-language tasks such as 3D question answering. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D pre-training Vision-Language method, namely Multi-CLIP, that enables a model to learn language-grounded and transferable 3D scene point cloud representations. We leverage the representational power of the CLIP model by maximizing the agreement between the encoded 3D scene features and the corresponding 2D multi-view image and text embeddings in the CLIP space via a contrastive objective. To validate our approach, we consider the challenging downstream tasks of 3D Visual Question Answering (3D-VQA) and 3D Situated Question Answering (3D-SQA). To this end, we develop novel multi-modal transformer-based architectures and we demonstrate how our pre-training method can benefit their performance. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that Multi-CLIP outperforms state-of-the-art works across the downstream tasks of 3D-VQA and 3D-SQA and leads to a well-structured 3D scene feature space.

- **Summary**: Continual learning has been developed using standard supervised contrastive loss from the perspective of feature learning. Due to the data imbalance during the training, there are still challenges in learning better representations. In this work, we suggest using a different similarity metric instead of cosine similarity in supervised contrastive loss in order to learn more robust representations. We validate the our method on one of the image classification datasets Seq-CIFAR-10 and the results outperform recent continual learning baselines.

- **Summary**: Data is the foundation for the development of computer vision, and the establishment of datasets plays an important role in advancing the techniques of fine-grained visual categorization~(FGVC). In the existing FGVC datasets used in computer vision, it is generally assumed that each collected instance has fixed characteristics and the distribution of different categories is relatively balanced. In contrast, the real world scenario reveals the fact that the characteristics of instances tend to vary with time and exhibit a long-tailed distribution. Hence, the collected datasets may mislead the optimization of the fine-grained classifiers, resulting in unpleasant performance in real applications. Starting from the real-world conditions and to promote the practical progress of fine-grained visual categorization, we present a Concept Drift and Long-Tailed Distribution dataset. Specifically, the dataset is collected by gathering 11195 images of 250 instances in different species for 47 consecutive months in their natural contexts. The collection process involves dozens of crowd workers for photographing and domain experts for labelling. Extensive baseline experiments using the state-of-the-art fine-grained classification models demonstrate the issues of concept drift and long-tailed distribution existed in the dataset, which require the attention of future researches.

- **Summary**: We present the RSSOD-Bench dataset for salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing imagery. While SOD has achieved success in natural scene images with deep learning, research in SOD for remote sensing imagery (RSSOD) is still in its early stages. Existing RSSOD datasets have limitations in terms of scale, and scene categories, which make them misaligned with real-world applications. To address these shortcomings, we construct the RSSOD-Bench dataset, which contains images from four different cities in the USA. The dataset provides annotations for various salient object categories, such as buildings, lakes, rivers, highways, bridges, aircraft, ships, athletic fields, and more. The salient objects in RSSOD-Bench exhibit large-scale variations, cluttered backgrounds, and different seasons. Unlike existing datasets, RSSOD-Bench offers uniform distribution across scene categories. We benchmark 23 different state-of-the-art approaches from both the computer vision and remote sensing communities. Experimental results demonstrate that more research efforts are required for the RSSOD task.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of sharing drivers' face videos for transportation research while adhering to proper ethical guidelines. The paper first gives an overview of the multitude of problems associated with sharing such data and then proposes a framework on how artificial intelligence-based techniques, specifically face swapping, can be used for de-identifying drivers' faces. Through extensive experimentation with an Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of face-swapping algorithms in preserving essential attributes related to human factors research, including eye movements, head movements, and mouth movements. The efficacy of the framework was also tested on various naturalistic driving study data collected at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. The results achieved through the proposed techniques were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using various metrics. Finally, we discuss possible measures for sharing the de-identified videos with the greater research community.

- **Summary**: A novel method to control the Spot robot of Boston Dynamics by Hololens 2 is proposed. This method is mainly designed for people with physical disabilities, users can control the robot's movement and robot arm without using their hands. The eye gaze tracking and head motion tracking technologies of Hololens 2 are utilized for sending control commands. The movement of the robot would follow the eye gaze and the robot arm would mimic the pose of the user's head. Through our experiment, our method is comparable with the traditional control method by joystick in both time efficiency and user experience. Demo can be found on our project webpage: https://zhangganlin.github.io/Holo-Spot-Page/index.html

- **Summary**: NICE-SLAM is a dense visual SLAM system that combines the advantages of neural implicit representations and hierarchical grid-based scene representation. However, the hierarchical grid features are densely stored, leading to memory explosion problems when adapting the framework to large scenes. In our project, we present sparse NICE-SLAM, a sparse SLAM system incorporating the idea of Voxel Hashing into NICE-SLAM framework. Instead of initializing feature grids in the whole space, voxel features near the surface are adaptively added and optimized. Experiments demonstrated that compared to NICE-SLAM algorithm, our approach takes much less memory and achieves comparable reconstruction quality on the same datasets. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/zhangganlin/NICE-SLAM-with-Adaptive-Feature-Grids.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: With the emergence of image super-resolution (SR) algorithm, how to blindly evaluate the quality of super-resolution images has become an urgent task. However, existing blind SR image quality assessment (IQA) metrics merely focus on visual characteristics of super-resolution images, ignoring the available scale information. In this paper, we reveal that the scale factor has a statistically significant impact on subjective quality scores of SR images, indicating that the scale information can be used to guide the task of blind SR IQA. Motivated by this, we propose a scale guided hypernetwork framework that evaluates SR image quality in a scale-adaptive manner. Specifically, the blind SR IQA procedure is divided into three stages, i.e., content perception, evaluation rule generation, and quality prediction. After content perception, a hypernetwork generates the evaluation rule used in quality prediction based on the scale factor of the SR image. We apply the proposed scale guided hypernetwork framework to existing representative blind IQA metrics, and experimental results show that the proposed framework not only boosts the performance of these IQA metrics but also enhances their generalization abilities.

- **Summary**: Visual object tracking has seen significant progress in recent years. However, the vast majority of this work focuses on tracking objects within the image plane of a single camera and ignores the uncertainty associated with predicted object locations. In this work, we focus on the geospatial object tracking problem using data from a distributed camera network. The goal is to predict an object's track in geospatial coordinates along with uncertainty over the object's location while respecting communication constraints that prohibit centralizing raw image data. We present a novel single-object geospatial tracking data set that includes high-accuracy ground truth object locations and video data from a network of four cameras. We present a modeling framework for addressing this task including a novel backbone model and explore how uncertainty calibration and fine-tuning through a differentiable tracker affect performance.

- **Summary**: A major enduring focus of clinical workflows is disease analytics and diagnosis, leading to medical imaging datasets where the modalities and annotations are strongly tied to specific clinical objectives. To date, building task-specific segmentation models is intuitive yet a restrictive approach, lacking insights gained from widespread imaging cohorts. Inspired by the training of medical residents, we explore universal medical image segmentation, whose goal is to learn from diverse medical imaging sources covering a range of clinical targets, body regions, and image modalities. Following this paradigm, we propose Hermes, a context prior learning approach that addresses the challenges related to the heterogeneity on data, modality, and annotations in the proposed universal paradigm. In a collection of seven diverse datasets, we demonstrate the appealing merits of the universal paradigm over the traditional task-specific training paradigm. By leveraging the synergy among various tasks, Hermes shows superior performance and model scalability. Our in-depth investigation on two additional datasets reveals Hermes' strong capabilities for transfer learning, incremental learning, and generalization to different downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Saliency methods are frequently used to explain Deep Neural Network-based models. Adebayo et al.'s work on evaluating saliency methods for classification models illustrate certain explanation methods fail the model and data randomization tests. However, on extending the tests for various state of the art object detectors we illustrate that the ability to explain a model is more dependent on the model itself than the explanation method. We perform sanity checks for object detection and define new qualitative criteria to evaluate the saliency explanations, both for object classification and bounding box decisions, using Guided Backpropagation, Integrated Gradients, and their Smoothgrad versions, together with Faster R-CNN, SSD, and EfficientDet-D0, trained on COCO. In addition, the sensitivity of the explanation method to model parameters and data labels varies class-wise motivating to perform the sanity checks for each class. We find that EfficientDet-D0 is the most interpretable method independent of the saliency method, which passes the sanity checks with little problems.

- **Summary**: While scene text image super-resolution (STISR) has yielded remarkable improvements in accurately recognizing scene text, prior methodologies have placed excessive emphasis on optimizing performance, rather than paying due attention to efficiency - a crucial factor in ensuring deployment of the STISR-STR pipeline. In this work, we propose a novel Efficient Scene Text Image Super-resolution (ESTISR) Network for resource-limited deployment platform. ESTISR's functionality primarily depends on two critical components: a CNN-based feature extractor and an efficient self-attention mechanism used for decoding low-resolution images. We designed a re-parameterized inverted residual block specifically suited for resource-limited circumstances as the feature extractor. Meanwhile, we proposed a novel self-attention mechanism, softmax shrinking, based on a kernel-based approach. This innovative technique offers linear complexity while also naturally incorporating discriminating low-level features into the self-attention structure. Extensive experiments on TextZoom show that ESTISR retains a high image restoration quality and improved STR accuracy of low-resolution images. Furthermore, ESTISR consistently outperforms current methods in terms of actual running time and peak memory consumption, while achieving a better trade-off between performance and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Many hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been developed to optimize the topology of neural networks (NN) with the joint objectives of higher accuracy and lower latency. Recently, both accuracy and latency predictors have been used in NAS with great success, achieving high sample efficiency and accurate modeling of hardware (HW) device latency respectively. However, a new accuracy predictor needs to be trained for every new NAS search space or NN task, and a new latency predictor needs to be additionally trained for every new HW device. In this paper, we explore methods to enable multi-task, multi-search-space, and multi-HW adaptation of accuracy and latency predictors to reduce the cost of NAS. We introduce a novel search-space independent NN encoding based on zero-cost proxies that achieves sample-efficient prediction on multiple tasks and NAS search spaces, improving the end-to-end sample efficiency of latency and accuracy predictors by over an order of magnitude in multiple scenarios. For example, our NN encoding enables multi-search-space transfer of latency predictors from NASBench-201 to FBNet (and vice-versa) in under 85 HW measurements, a 400$\times$ improvement in sample efficiency compared to a recent meta-learning approach. Our method also improves the total sample efficiency of accuracy predictors by over an order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for multi-search-space and multi-task accuracy prediction on 28 NAS search spaces and tasks.

- **Summary**: Generative deep learning models are able to create realistic audio and video. This technology has been used to impersonate the faces and voices of individuals. These ``deepfakes'' are being used to spread misinformation, enable scams, perform fraud, and blackmail the innocent. The technology continues to advance and today attackers have the ability to generate deepfakes in real-time. This new capability poses a significant threat to society as attackers begin to exploit the technology in advances social engineering attacks. In this paper, we discuss the implications of this emerging threat, identify the challenges with preventing these attacks and suggest a better direction for researching stronger defences.

- **Summary**: Human visual reasoning is characterized by an ability to identify abstract patterns from only a small number of examples, and to systematically generalize those patterns to novel inputs. This capacity depends in large part on our ability to represent complex visual inputs in terms of both objects and relations. Recent work in computer vision has introduced models with the capacity to extract object-centric representations, leading to the ability to process multi-object visual inputs, but falling short of the systematic generalization displayed by human reasoning. Other recent models have employed inductive biases for relational abstraction to achieve systematic generalization of learned abstract rules, but have generally assumed the presence of object-focused inputs. Here, we combine these two approaches, introducing Object-Centric Relational Abstraction (OCRA), a model that extracts explicit representations of both objects and abstract relations, and achieves strong systematic generalization in tasks involving complex visual displays.

- **Summary**: Insect-pests significantly impact global agricultural productivity and quality. Effective management involves identifying the full insect community, including beneficial insects and harmful pests, to develop and implement integrated pest management strategies. Automated identification of insects under real-world conditions presents several challenges, including differentiating similar-looking species, intra-species dissimilarity and inter-species similarity, several life cycle stages, camouflage, diverse imaging conditions, and variability in insect orientation. A deep-learning model, InsectNet, is proposed to address these challenges. InsectNet is endowed with five key features: (a) utilization of a large dataset of insect images collected through citizen science; (b) label-free self-supervised learning for large models; (c) improving prediction accuracy for species with a small sample size; (d) enhancing model trustworthiness; and (e) democratizing access through streamlined MLOps. This approach allows accurate identification (>96% accuracy) of over 2500 insect species, including pollinator (e.g., butterflies, bees), parasitoid (e.g., some wasps and flies), predator species (e.g., lady beetles, mantises, dragonflies) and harmful pest species (e.g., armyworms, cutworms, grasshoppers, stink bugs). InsectNet can identify invasive species, provide fine-grained insect species identification, and work effectively in challenging backgrounds. It also can abstain from making predictions when uncertain, facilitating seamless human intervention and making it a practical and trustworthy tool. InsectNet can guide citizen science data collection, especially for invasive species where early detection is crucial. Similar approaches may transform other agricultural challenges like disease detection and underscore the importance of data collection, particularly through citizen science efforts..

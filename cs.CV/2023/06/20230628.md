- **Summary**: The goal in episodic memory (EM) is to search a long egocentric video to answer a natural language query (e.g., "where did I leave my purse?"). Existing EM methods exhaustively extract expensive fixed-length clip features to look everywhere in the video for the answer, which is infeasible for long wearable-camera videos that span hours or even days. We propose SpotEM, an approach to achieve efficiency for a given EM method while maintaining good accuracy. SpotEM consists of three key ideas: 1) a novel clip selector that learns to identify promising video regions to search conditioned on the language query; 2) a set of low-cost semantic indexing features that capture the context of rooms, objects, and interactions that suggest where to look; and 3) distillation losses that address the optimization issues arising from end-to-end joint training of the clip selector and EM model. Our experiments on 200+ hours of video from the Ego4D EM Natural Language Queries benchmark and three different EM models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: computing only 10% - 25% of the clip features, we preserve 84% - 97% of the original EM model's accuracy.

- **Summary**: With the increasing adoption of robots across industries, it is crucial to focus on developing advanced algorithms that enable robots to anticipate, comprehend, and plan their actions effectively in collaboration with humans. We introduce the Robot Autonomous Motion (RoAM) video dataset, which is collected with a custom-made turtlebot3 Burger robot in a variety of indoor environments recording various human motions from the robot's ego-vision. The dataset also includes synchronized records of the LiDAR scan and all control actions taken by the robot as it navigates around static and moving human agents. The unique dataset provides an opportunity to develop and benchmark new visual prediction frameworks that can predict future image frames based on the action taken by the recording agent in partially observable scenarios or cases where the imaging sensor is mounted on a moving platform. We have benchmarked the dataset on our novel deep visual prediction framework called ACPNet where the approximated future image frames are also conditioned on action taken by the robot and demonstrated its potential for incorporating robot dynamics into the video prediction paradigm for mobile robotics and autonomous navigation research.

- **Summary**: In the field of computer vision-driven ice hockey analytics, one of the most challenging and least studied tasks is goalie pose estimation. Unlike general human pose estimation, goalie pose estimation is much more complex as it involves not only the detection of keypoints corresponding to the joints of the goalie concealed under thick padding and mask, but also a large number of non-human keypoints corresponding to the large leg pads and gloves worn, the stick, as well as the hockey net. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GoalieNet, a multi-stage deep neural network for jointly estimating the pose of the goalie, their equipment, and the net. Experimental results using NHL benchmark data demonstrate that the proposed GoalieNet can achieve an average of 84\% accuracy across all keypoints, where 22 out of 29 keypoints are detected with more than 80\% accuracy. This indicates that such a joint pose estimation approach can be a promising research direction.

- **Summary**: Robotic manipulation, in particular in-hand object manipulation, often requires an accurate estimate of the object's 6D pose. To improve the accuracy of the estimated pose, state-of-the-art approaches in 6D object pose estimation use observational data from one or more modalities, e.g., RGB images, depth, and tactile readings. However, existing approaches make limited use of the underlying geometric structure of the object captured by these modalities, thereby, increasing their reliance on visual features. This results in poor performance when presented with objects that lack such visual features or when visual features are simply occluded. Furthermore, current approaches do not take advantage of the proprioceptive information embedded in the position of the fingers. To address these limitations, in this paper: (1) we introduce a hierarchical graph neural network architecture for combining multimodal (vision and touch) data that allows for a geometrically informed 6D object pose estimation, (2) we introduce a hierarchical message passing operation that flows the information within and across modalities to learn a graph-based object representation, and (3) we introduce a method that accounts for the proprioceptive information for in-hand object representation. We evaluate our model on a diverse subset of objects from the YCB Object and Model Set, and show that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art work in accuracy and robustness to occlusion. We also deploy our proposed framework on a real robot and qualitatively demonstrate successful transfer to real settings.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has achieved significant milestones in remote sensing image (RSI) understanding. Its essence lies in designing an unsupervised instance discrimination pretext task to extract image features from a large number of unlabeled images that are beneficial for downstream tasks. However, existing instance discrimination based SSCL suffer from two limitations when applied to the RSI semantic segmentation task: 1) Positive sample confounding issue; 2) Feature adaptation bias. It introduces a feature adaptation bias when applied to semantic segmentation tasks that require pixel-level or object-level features. In this study, We observed that the discrimination information can be mapped to specific regions in RSI through the gradient of unsupervised contrastive loss, these specific regions tend to contain singular ground objects. Based on this, we propose contrastive learning with Gradient guided Sampling Strategy (GraSS) for RSI semantic segmentation. GraSS consists of two stages: Instance Discrimination warm-up (ID warm-up) and Gradient guided Sampling contrastive training (GS training). The ID warm-up aims to provide initial discrimination information to the contrastive loss gradients. The GS training stage aims to utilize the discrimination information contained in the contrastive loss gradients and adaptively select regions in RSI patches that contain more singular ground objects, in order to construct new positive and negative samples. Experimental results on three open datasets demonstrate that GraSS effectively enhances the performance of SSCL in high-resolution RSI semantic segmentation. Compared to seven baseline methods from five different types of SSCL, GraSS achieves an average improvement of 1.57\% and a maximum improvement of 3.58\% in terms of mean intersection over the union.

- **Summary**: The large language model and high-level vision model have achieved impressive performance improvements with large datasets and model sizes. However, low-level computer vision tasks, such as image dehaze and blur removal, still rely on a small number of datasets and small-sized models, which generally leads to overfitting and local optima. Therefore, we propose a framework to integrate large-model prior into low-level computer vision tasks. Just as with the task of image segmentation, the degradation of haze is also texture-related. So we propose to detect gray-scale coding, network channel expansion, and pre-dehaze structures to integrate large-model prior knowledge into any low-level dehazing network. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of large models in guiding low-level visual tasks through different datasets and algorithms comparison experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of grayscale coding, network channel expansion, and recurrent network structures through ablation experiments. Under the conditions where additional data and training resources are not required, we successfully prove that the integration of large-model prior knowledge will improve the dehaze performance and save training time for low-level visual tasks.

- **Summary**: Representation learning has been evolving from traditional supervised training to Contrastive Learning (CL) and Masked Image Modeling (MIM). Previous works have demonstrated their pros and cons in specific scenarios, i.e., CL and supervised pre-training excel at capturing longer-range global patterns and enabling better feature discrimination, while MIM can introduce more local and diverse attention across all transformer layers. In this paper, we explore how to obtain a model that combines their strengths. We start by examining previous feature distillation and mask feature reconstruction methods and identify their limitations. We find that their increasing diversity mainly derives from the asymmetric designs, but these designs may in turn compromise the discrimination ability. In order to better obtain both discrimination and diversity, we propose a simple but effective Hybrid Distillation strategy, which utilizes both the supervised/CL teacher and the MIM teacher to jointly guide the student model. Hybrid Distill imitates the token relations of the MIM teacher to alleviate attention collapse, as well as distills the feature maps of the supervised/CL teacher to enable discrimination. Furthermore, a progressive redundant token masking strategy is also utilized to reduce the distilling costs and avoid falling into local optima. Experiment results prove that Hybrid Distill can achieve superior performance on different benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In the field of visual scene understanding, deep neural networks have made impressive advancements in various core tasks like segmentation, tracking, and detection. However, most approaches operate on the close-set assumption, meaning that the model can only identify pre-defined categories that are present in the training set. Recently, open vocabulary settings were proposed due to the rapid progress of vision language pre-training. These new approaches seek to locate and recognize categories beyond the annotated label space. The open vocabulary approach is more general, practical, and effective compared to weakly supervised and zero-shot settings. This paper provides a thorough review of open vocabulary learning, summarizing and analyzing recent developments in the field. In particular, we begin by comparing it to related concepts such as zero-shot learning, open-set recognition, and out-of-distribution detection. Then, we review several closely related tasks in the case of segmentation and detection, including long-tail problems, few-shot, and zero-shot settings. For the method survey, we first present the basic knowledge of detection and segmentation in close-set as the preliminary knowledge. Next, we examine various scenarios in which open vocabulary learning is used, identifying common design elements and core ideas. Then, we compare the recent detection and segmentation approaches in commonly used datasets and benchmarks. Finally, we conclude with insights, issues, and discussions regarding future research directions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive literature review of open vocabulary learning.

- **Summary**: Photographing in the under-illuminated scenes, the presence of complex light sources often leave strong flare artifacts in images, where the intensity, the spectrum, the reflection, and the aberration altogether contribute the deterioration. Besides the image quality, it also influence the performance of down-stream visual applications. Thus, removing the lens flare and ghosts is a challenge issue especially in low-light environment. However, existing methods for flare removal mainly restricted to the problems of inadequate simulation and real-world capture, where the categories of scattered flares are singular and the reflected ghosts are unavailable. Therefore, a comprehensive deterioration procedure is crucial for constructing the dataset of flare removal. Based on the theoretical analysis and real-world evaluation, we propose a well-developed methodology for generating the data-pairs with flare deterioration. The procedure is comprehensive, where the similarity of scattered flares and the symmetric effect of reflected ghosts are realized. Moreover, we also construct a real-shot pipeline that respectively processes the effects of scattering and reflective flares, aiming to directly generate the data for end-to-end methods. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology add diversity to the existing flare datasets and construct a comprehensive mapping procedure for flare data pairs. And our method facilities the data-driven model to realize better restoration in flare images and proposes a better evaluation system based on real shots, resulting promote progress in the area of real flare removal.

- **Summary**: Various strategies for label-scarce object detection have been explored by the computer vision research community. These strategies mainly rely on assumptions that are specific to natural images and not directly applicable to the biological and biomedical vision domains. For example, most semi-supervised learning strategies rely on a small set of labeled data as a confident source of ground truth. In many biological vision applications, however, the ground truth is unknown and indirect information might be available in the form of noisy estimations or orthogonal evidence. In this work, we frame a crucial problem in spatial transcriptomics - decoding barcodes from In-Situ-Sequencing (ISS) images - as a semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) problem. Our proposed framework incorporates additional available sources of information into a semi-supervised learning framework in the form of privileged information. The privileged information is incorporated into the teacher's pseudo-labeling in a teacher-student self-training iteration. Although the available privileged information could be data domain specific, we have introduced a general strategy of pseudo-labeling enhanced by privileged information (PLePI) and exemplified the concept using ISS images, as well on the COCO benchmark using extra evidence provided by CLIP.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) graph generalization are critical for many real-world applications. Existing methods neglect to discard spurious or noisy features of inputs, which are irrelevant to the label. Besides, they mainly conduct instance-level class-invariant graph learning and fail to utilize the structural class relationships between graph instances. In this work, we endeavor to address these issues in a unified framework, dubbed Individual and Structural Graph Information Bottlenecks (IS-GIB). To remove class spurious feature caused by distribution shifts, we propose Individual Graph Information Bottleneck (I-GIB) which discards irrelevant information by minimizing the mutual information between the input graph and its embeddings. To leverage the structural intra- and inter-domain correlations, we propose Structural Graph Information Bottleneck (S-GIB). Specifically for a batch of graphs with multiple domains, S-GIB first computes the pair-wise input-input, embedding-embedding, and label-label correlations. Then it minimizes the mutual information between input graph and embedding pairs while maximizing the mutual information between embedding and label pairs. The critical insight of S-GIB is to simultaneously discard spurious features and learn invariant features from a high-order perspective by maintaining class relationships under multiple distributional shifts. Notably, we unify the proposed I-GIB and S-GIB to form our complementary framework IS-GIB. Extensive experiments conducted on both node- and graph-level tasks consistently demonstrate the superior generalization ability of IS-GIB.

- **Summary**: Food instance segmentation is essential to estimate the serving size of dishes in a food image. The recent cutting-edge techniques for instance segmentation are deep learning networks with impressive segmentation quality and fast computation. Nonetheless, they are hungry for data and expensive for annotation. This paper proposes an incremental learning framework to optimize the model performance given a limited data labelling budget. The power of the framework is a novel difficulty assessment model, which forecasts how challenging an unlabelled sample is to the latest trained instance segmentation model. The data collection procedure is divided into several stages, each in which a new sample package is collected. The framework allocates the labelling budget to the most difficult samples. The unlabelled samples that meet a certain qualification from the assessment model are used to generate pseudo-labels. Eventually, the manual labels and pseudo-labels are sent to the training data to improve the instance segmentation model. On four large-scale food datasets, our proposed framework outperforms current incremental learning benchmarks and achieves competitive performance with the model trained on fully annotated samples.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional (3D) object recognition technology is being used as a core technology in advanced technologies such as autonomous driving of automobiles. There are two sets of approaches for 3D object recognition: (i) hand-crafted approaches like Global Orthographic Object Descriptor (GOOD), and (ii) deep learning-based approaches such as MobileNet and VGG. However, it is needed to know which of these approaches works better in an open-ended domain where the number of known categories increases over time, and the system should learn about new object categories using few training examples. In this paper, we first implemented an offline 3D object recognition system that takes an object view as input and generates category labels as output. In the offline stage, instance-based learning (IBL) is used to form a new category and we use K-fold cross-validation to evaluate the obtained object recognition performance. We then test the proposed approach in an online fashion by integrating the code into a simulated teacher test. As a result, we concluded that the approach using deep learning features is more suitable for open-ended fashion. Moreover, we observed that concatenating the hand-crafted and deep learning features increases the classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: Long-tailed recognition with imbalanced class distribution naturally emerges in practical machine learning applications. Existing methods such as data reweighing, resampling, and supervised contrastive learning enforce the class balance with a price of introducing imbalance between instances of head class and tail class, which may ignore the underlying rich semantic substructures of the former and exaggerate the biases in the latter. We overcome these drawbacks by a novel ``subclass-balancing contrastive learning (SBCL)'' approach that clusters each head class into multiple subclasses of similar sizes as the tail classes and enforce representations to capture the two-layer class hierarchy between the original classes and their subclasses. Since the clustering is conducted in the representation space and updated during the course of training, the subclass labels preserve the semantic substructures of head classes. Meanwhile, it does not overemphasize tail class samples, so each individual instance contribute to the representation learning equally. Hence, our method achieves both the instance- and subclass-balance, while the original class labels are also learned through contrastive learning among subclasses from different classes. We evaluate SBCL over a list of long-tailed benchmark datasets and it achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we present extensive analyses and ablation studies of SBCL to verify its advantages.

- **Summary**: The popularity of self-supervised learning has made it possible to train models without relying on labeled data, which saves expensive annotation costs. However, most existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods often overlook the combination of global and local feature information. This paper proposes a multi-network contrastive learning framework based on global and local representations. We introduce global and local feature information for self-supervised contrastive learning through multiple networks. The model learns feature information at different scales of an image by contrasting the embedding pairs generated by multiple networks. The framework also expands the number of samples used for contrast and improves the training efficiency of the model. Linear evaluation results on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms several existing classical self-supervised learning methods.

- **Summary**: Adversarial examples have raised widespread attention in security-critical applications because of their transferability across different models. Although many methods have been proposed to boost adversarial transferability, a gap still exists in the practical demand. In this paper, we argue that the model-specific discriminative regions are a key factor to cause the over-fitting to the source model, and thus reduce the transferability to the target model. For that, a patch-wise mask is utilized to prune the model-specific regions when calculating adversarial perturbations. To accurately localize these regions, we present a learnable approach to optimize the mask automatically. Specifically, we simulate the target models in our framework, and adjust the patch-wise mask according to the feedback of simulated models. To improve the efficiency, Differential Evolutionary (DE) algorithm is utilized to search for patch-wise masks for a specific image. During iterative attacks, the learned masks are applied to the image to drop out the patches related to model-specific regions, thus making the gradients more generic and improving the adversarial transferability. The proposed approach is a pre-processing method and can be integrated with existing gradient-based methods to further boost the transfer attack success rate. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We incorporate the proposed approach with existing methods in the ensemble attacks and achieve an average success rate of 93.01% against seven advanced defense methods, which can effectively enhance the state-of-the-art transfer-based attack performance.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning, has been rapidly applied in wireless communication networks. FL enables Internet of Things (IoT) clients to obtain well-trained models while preventing privacy leakage. Person detection can be deployed on edge devices with limited computing power if combined with FL to process the video data directly at the edge. However, due to the different hardware and deployment scenarios of different cameras, the data collected by the camera present non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), and the global model derived from FL aggregation is less effective. Meanwhile, existing research lacks public data set for real-world FL object detection, which is not conducive to studying the non-IID problem on IoT cameras. Therefore, we open source a non-IID IoT person detection (NIPD) data set, which is collected from five different cameras. To our knowledge, this is the first true device-based non-IID person detection data set. Based on this data set, we explain how to establish a FL experimental platform and provide a benchmark for non-IID person detection. NIPD is expected to promote the application of FL and the security of smart city.

- **Summary**: The explosive growth of rumors with text and images on social media platforms has drawn great attention. Existing studies have made significant contributions to cross-modal information interaction and fusion, but they fail to fully explore hierarchical and complex semantic correlation across different modality content, severely limiting their performance on detecting multi-modal rumor. In this work, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced hierarchical information correlation learning approach (KhiCL) for multi-modal rumor detection by jointly modeling the basic semantic correlation and high-order knowledge-enhanced entity correlation. Specifically, KhiCL exploits cross-modal joint dictionary to transfer the heterogeneous unimodality features into the common feature space and captures the basic cross-modal semantic consistency and inconsistency by a cross-modal fusion layer. Moreover, considering the description of multi-modal content is narrated around entities, KhiCL extracts visual and textual entities from images and text, and designs a knowledge relevance reasoning strategy to find the shortest semantic relevant path between each pair of entities in external knowledge graph, and absorbs all complementary contextual knowledge of other connected entities in this path for learning knowledge-enhanced entity representations. Furthermore, KhiCL utilizes a signed attention mechanism to model the knowledge-enhanced entity consistency and inconsistency of intra-modality and inter-modality entity pairs by measuring their corresponding semantic relevant distance. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: We propose OrbCam, a lensless architecture for imaging with spherical sensors. Prior work in lensless imager techniques have focused largely on using planar sensors; for such designs, it is important to use a modulation element, e.g. amplitude or phase masks, to construct a invertible imaging system. In contrast, we show that the diversity of pixel orientations on a curved surface is sufficient to improve the conditioning of the mapping between the scene and the sensor. Hence, when imaging on a spherical sensor, all pixels can have the same angular response function such that the lensless imager is comprised of pixels that are identical to each other and differ only in their orientations. We provide the computational tools for the design of the angular response of the pixels in a spherical sensor that leads to well-conditioned and noise-robust measurements. We validate our design in both simulation and a lab prototype. The implications of our design is that the lensless imaging can be enabled easily for curved and flexible surfaces thereby opening up a new set of application domains.

- **Summary**: Large-scale vision-language (V-L) models have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities for downstream tasks through prompt tuning. However, their performance suffers significantly in the presence of class imbalance, a common issue in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the effects of class imbalance on the generalization performance of V-L models and extend Neural Collapse phenomenon to these models, revealing the geometric reasons behind the impact of class imbalance on their generalization ability. To address this problem, we propose Neural Collapse based Prompt Tuning (NPT), a novel method that optimizes prompts so that both text and image features satisfy the same simplex ETF structure. NPT incorporates two regularization terms, geometric de-biasing and multi-modal isomorphism, to enhance the robustness of V-L models under class imbalance conditions while maintaining their generalization capabilities. Our comprehensive experiments show that NPT outperforms existing prompt learning techniques across 11 diverse image recognition datasets, achieving an absolute average gain of 2.63\% for novel classes and 2.47\% for harmonic mean when facing imbalanced data.

- **Summary**: Due to limitations in data quality, some essential visual tasks are difficult to perform independently. Introducing previously unavailable information to transfer informative dark knowledge has been a common way to solve such hard tasks. However, research on why transferred knowledge works has not been extensively explored. To address this issue, in this paper, we discover the correlation between feature discriminability and dimensional structure (DS) by analyzing and observing features extracted from simple and hard tasks. On this basis, we express DS using deep channel-wise correlation and intermediate spatial distribution, and propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation (CMKD) method for better supervised cross-modal learning (CML) performance. The proposed method enforces output features to be channel-wise independent and intermediate ones to be uniformly distributed, thereby learning semantically irrelevant features from the hard task to boost its accuracy. This is especially useful in specific applications where the performance gap between dual modalities is relatively large. Furthermore, we collect a real-world CML dataset to promote community development. The dataset contains more than 10,000 paired optical and radar images and is continuously being updated. Experimental results on real-world and benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Multi-scale features are of great importance in encoding objects with scale variance in object detection tasks. A common strategy for multi-scale feature extraction is adopting the classic top-down and bottom-up feature pyramid networks. However, these approaches suffer from the loss or degradation of feature information, impairing the fusion effect of non-adjacent levels. This paper proposes an asymptotic feature pyramid network (AFPN) to support direct interaction at non-adjacent levels. AFPN is initiated by fusing two adjacent low-level features and asymptotically incorporates higher-level features into the fusion process. In this way, the larger semantic gap between non-adjacent levels can be avoided. Given the potential for multi-object information conflicts to arise during feature fusion at each spatial location, adaptive spatial fusion operation is further utilized to mitigate these inconsistencies. We incorporate the proposed AFPN into both two-stage and one-stage object detection frameworks and evaluate with the MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets. Experimental evaluation shows that our method achieves more competitive results than other state-of-the-art feature pyramid networks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a method to reprogram pre-trained audio-driven talking face synthesis models to be able to operate with text inputs. As the audio-driven talking face synthesis model takes speech audio as inputs, in order to generate a talking avatar with the desired speech content, speech recording needs to be performed in advance. However, this is burdensome to record audio for every video to be generated. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a novel method that embeds input text into the learned audio latent space of the pre-trained audio-driven model. To this end, we design a Text-to-Audio Embedding Module (TAEM) which is guided to learn to map a given text input to the audio latent features. Moreover, to model the speaker characteristics lying in the audio features, we propose to inject visual speaker embedding into the TAEM, which is obtained from a single face image. After training, we can synthesize talking face videos with either text or speech audio.

- **Summary**: Multi-label classification (MLC) suffers from the inevitable label noise in training data due to the difficulty in annotating various semantic labels in each image. To mitigate the influence of noisy labels, existing methods mainly devote to identifying and correcting the label mistakes via a trained MLC model. However, these methods still involve annoying noisy labels in training, which can result in imprecise recognition of noisy labels and weaken the performance. In this paper, considering that the negative labels are substantially more than positive labels, and most noisy labels are from the negative labels, we directly discard all the negative labels in the dataset, and propose a new method dubbed positive and unlabeled multi-label classification (PU-MLC). By extending positive-unlabeled learning into MLC task, our method trains model with only positive labels and unlabeled data, and introduces adaptive re-balance factor and adaptive temperature coefficient in the loss function to alleviate the catastrophic imbalance in label distribution and over-smoothing of probabilities in training. Furthermore, to capture both local and global dependencies in the image, we also introduce a local-global convolution module, which supplements global information into existing convolution layers with no retraining of backbone required. Our PU-MLC is simple and effective, and it is applicable to both MLC and MLC with partial labels (MLC-PL) tasks. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that our PU-MLC achieves significantly improvements on both MLC and MLC-PL settings with even fewer annotations. Code will be released.

- **Summary**: The safety of wind turbines is a prerequisite for the stable operation of offshore wind farms. However, bird damage poses a direct threat to the safe operation of wind turbines and wind turbine blades. In addition, millions of birds are killed by wind turbines every year. In order to protect the ecological environment and maintain the safe operation of offshore wind turbines, and to address the problem of the low detection capability of current target detection algorithms in low-light environments such as at night, this paper proposes a method to improve the network performance by integrating the CBAM attention mechanism and the RetinexNet network into YOLOv5. First, the training set images are fed into the YOLOv5 network with integrated CBAM attention module for training, and the optimal weight model is stored. Then, low-light images are enhanced and denoised using Decom-Net and Enhance-Net, and the accuracy is tested on the optimal weight model. In addition, the k-means++ clustering algorithm is used to optimise the anchor box selection method, which solves the problem of unstable initial centroids and achieves better clustering results. Experimental results show that the accuracy of this model in bird detection tasks can reach 87.40%, an increase of 21.25%. The model can detect birds near wind turbines in real time and shows strong stability in night, rainy and shaky conditions, proving that the model can ensure the safe and stable operation of wind turbines.

- **Summary**: Rapid renovation of Europe's inefficient buildings is required to reduce climate change. However, analyzing and evaluating buildings at scale is challenging because every building is unique. In current practice, the energy performance of buildings is assessed during on-site visits, which are slow, costly, and local. This paper presents a building point cloud dataset that promotes a data-driven, large-scale understanding of the 3D representation of buildings and their energy characteristics. We generate building point clouds by intersecting building footprints with geo-referenced LiDAR data and link them with attributes from UK's energy performance database via the Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN). To achieve a representative sample, we select one million buildings from a range of rural and urban regions across England, of which half a million are linked to energy characteristics. Building point clouds in new regions can be generated with the open-source code published alongside the paper. The dataset enables novel research in building energy modeling and can be easily expanded to other research fields by adding building features via the UPRN or geo-location.

- **Summary**: Liver cancer has high morbidity and mortality rates in the world. Multi-phase CT is a main medical imaging modality for detecting/identifying and diagnosing liver tumors. Automatically detecting and classifying liver lesions in CT images have the potential to improve the clinical workflow. This task remains challenging due to liver lesions' large variations in size, appearance, image contrast, and the complexities of tumor types or subtypes. In this work, we customize a multi-object labeling tool for multi-phase CT images, which is used to curate a large-scale dataset containing 1,631 patients with four-phase CT images, multi-organ masks, and multi-lesion (six major types of liver lesions confirmed by pathology) masks. We develop a two-stage liver lesion detection pipeline, where the high-sensitivity detecting algorithms in the first stage discover as many lesion proposals as possible, and the lesion-reclassification algorithms in the second stage remove as many false alarms as possible. The multi-sensitivity lesion detection algorithm maximizes the information utilization of the individual probability maps of segmentation, and the lesion-shuffle augmentation effectively explores the texture contrast between lesions and the liver. Independently tested on 331 patient cases, the proposed model achieves high sensitivity and specificity for malignancy classification in the multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT (99.2%, 97.1%, diagnosis setting) and in the noncontrast CT (97.3%, 95.7%, screening setting).

- **Summary**: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a highly prevalent group of disorders and represent strong clinical behavioral similarities, and that make it very challenging for accurate identification of different NDDs such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Moreover, there is no reliable physiological markers for NDDs diagnosis and it solely relies on psychological evaluation criteria. However, it is crucial to prevent misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis by intelligent assisted diagnosis, which is closely related to the follow-up corresponding treatment. In order to relieve these issues, we propose a novel open set recognition framework for NDDs screening and detection, which is the first application of open set recognition in this field. It combines auto encoder and adversarial reciprocal points open set recognition to accurately identify known classes as well as recognize classes never encountered. And considering the strong similarities between different subjects, we present a joint scaling method called MMS to distinguish unknown disorders. To validate the feasibility of our presented method, we design a reciprocal opposition experiment protocol on the hybrid datasets from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I) and THE ADHD-200 SAMPLE (ADHD-200) with 791 samples from four sites and the results demonstrate the superiority on various metrics. Our OpenNDD has achieved promising performance, where the accuracy is 77.38%, AUROC is 75.53% and the open set classification rate is as high as 59.43%.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the challenges of applying vision-language models (VLMs) to zero-shot visual recognition tasks in an open-world setting, with a focus on contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP. We first examine the performance of VLMs on concepts of different granularity levels. We propose a way to fairly evaluate the performance discrepancy under two experimental setups and find that VLMs are better at recognizing fine-grained concepts. Furthermore, we find that the similarity scores from VLMs do not strictly reflect the correctness of the textual inputs given visual input. We propose an evaluation protocol to test our hypothesis that the scores can be biased towards more informative descriptions, and the nature of the similarity score between embedding makes it challenging for VLMs to recognize the correctness between similar but wrong descriptions. Our study highlights the challenges of using VLMs in open-world settings and suggests directions for future research to improve their zero-shot capabilities.



### Evaluating Similitude and Robustness of Deep Image Denoising Models via Adversarial Attack

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown superior performance comparing to traditional image denoising algorithms. However, DNNs are inevitably vulnerable while facing adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an adversarial attack method named denoising-PGD which can successfully attack all the current deep denoising models while keep the noise distribution almost unchanged. We surprisingly find that the current mainstream non-blind denoising models (DnCNN, FFDNet, ECNDNet, BRDNet), blind denoising models (DnCNN-B, Noise2Noise, RDDCNN-B, FAN), plug-and-play (DPIR, CurvPnP) and unfolding denoising models (DeamNet) almost share the same adversarial sample set on both grayscale and color images, respectively. Shared adversarial sample set indicates that all these models are similar in term of local behaviors at the neighborhood of all the test samples. Thus, we further propose an indicator to measure the local similarity of models, called robustness similitude. Non-blind denoising models are found to have high robustness similitude across each other, while hybrid-driven models are also found to have high robustness similitude with pure data-driven non-blind denoising models. According to our robustness assessment, data-driven non-blind denoising models are the most robust. We use adversarial training to complement the vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Moreover, the model-driven image denoising BM3D shows resistance on adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion models have recently shown impressive results in generative tasks. By learning powerful priors from huge collections of training images, such models are able to gradually modify complete noise to a clean natural image via a sequence of small denoising steps, seemingly making them well-suited for single image denoising. However, effectively applying denoising diffusion models to removal of realistic noise is more challenging than it may seem, since their formulation is based on additive white Gaussian noise, unlike noise in real-world images. In this work, we present SVNR, a novel formulation of denoising diffusion that assumes a more realistic, spatially-variant noise model. SVNR enables using the noisy input image as the starting point for the denoising diffusion process, in addition to conditioning the process on it. To this end, we adapt the diffusion process to allow each pixel to have its own time embedding, and propose training and inference schemes that support spatially-varying time maps. Our formulation also accounts for the correlation that exists between the condition image and the samples along the modified diffusion process. In our experiments we demonstrate the advantages of our approach over a strong diffusion model baseline, as well as over a state-of-the-art single image denoising method.

- **Summary**: In the field of wildlife observation and conservation, approaches involving machine learning on audio recordings are becoming increasingly popular. Unfortunately, available datasets from this field of research are often not optimal learning material; Samples can be weakly labeled, of different lengths or come with a poor signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we introduce a generalized approach that first relabels subsegments of MEL spectrogram representations, to achieve higher performances on the actual multi-class classification tasks. For both the binary pre-sorting and the classification, we make use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and various data-augmentation techniques. We showcase the results of this approach on the challenging \textit{ComparE 2021} dataset, with the task of classifying between different primate species sounds, and report significantly higher Accuracy and UAR scores in contrast to comparatively equipped model baselines.

- **Summary**: Deep unfolding network (DUN) that unfolds the optimization algorithm into a deep neural network has achieved great success in compressive sensing (CS) due to its good interpretability and high performance. Each stage in DUN corresponds to one iteration in optimization. At the test time, all the sampling images generally need to be processed by all stages, which comes at a price of computation burden and is also unnecessary for the images whose contents are easier to restore. In this paper, we focus on CS reconstruction and propose a novel Dynamic Path-Controllable Deep Unfolding Network (DPC-DUN). DPC-DUN with our designed path-controllable selector can dynamically select a rapid and appropriate route for each image and is slimmable by regulating different performance-complexity tradeoffs. Extensive experiments show that our DPC-DUN is highly flexible and can provide excellent performance and dynamic adjustment to get a suitable tradeoff, thus addressing the main requirements to become appealing in practice.

- **Summary**: The phenomenon of seat occupancy in university libraries is a prevalent issue. However, existing solutions, such as software-based seat reservations and sensors-based occupancy detection, have proven to be inadequate in effectively addressing this problem. In this study, we propose a novel approach: a serial dual-channel object detection model based on Faster RCNN. This model is designed to discern all instances of occupied seats within the library and continuously update real-time information regarding seat occupancy status. To train the neural network, a distinctive dataset is utilized, which blends virtual images generated using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) with real-world images. Notably, our test results underscore the remarkable performance uplift attained through the application of self-generated virtual datasets in training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly within specialized scenarios. Furthermore, this study introduces a pioneering detection model that seamlessly amalgamates the Faster R-CNN-based object detection framework with a transfer learning-based object classification algorithm. This amalgamation not only significantly curtails the computational resources and time investments needed for neural network training but also considerably heightens the efficiency of single-frame detection rates. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface and a mobile application have been meticulously developed, constituting a computer vision-driven platform for detecting seat occupancy within library premises. Noteworthy is the substantial enhancement in seat occupancy recognition accuracy, coupled with a reduction in computational resources required for neural network training, collectively contributing to a considerable amplification in the overall efficiency of library seat management.

- **Summary**: The recently emerging research area in robotics, ground view change detection, suffers from its ill-posed-ness because of visual uncertainty combined with complex nonlinear perspective projection. To regularize the ill-posed-ness, the commonly applied supervised learning methods (e.g., CSCD-Net) rely on manually annotated high-quality object-class-specific priors. In this work, we consider general application domains where no manual annotation is available and present a fully self-supervised approach. The present approach adopts the powerful and versatile idea that object changes detected during everyday robot navigation can be reused as additional priors to improve future change detection tasks. Furthermore, a robustified framework is implemented and verified experimentally in a new challenging practical application scenario: ground-view small object change detection.

- **Summary**: When studying the results of a segmentation algorithm using convolutional neural networks, one wonders about the reliability and consistency of the results. This leads to questioning the possibility of using such an algorithm in applications where there is little room for doubt. We propose in this paper a new attention gate based on the use of Chan-Vese energy minimization to control more precisely the segmentation masks given by a standard CNN architecture such as the U-Net model. This mechanism allows to obtain a constraint on the segmentation based on the resolution of a PDE. The study of the results allows us to observe the spatial information retained by the neural network on the region of interest and obtains competitive results on the binary segmentation. We illustrate the efficiency of this approach for medical image segmentation on a database of MRI brain images.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have showcased their remarkable capability to synthesize diverse and high-quality images, sparking interest in their application for real image editing. However, existing diffusion-based approaches for local image editing often suffer from undesired artifacts due to the pixel-level blending of the noised target images and diffusion latent variables, which lack the necessary semantics for maintaining image consistency. To address these issues, we propose PFB-Diff, a Progressive Feature Blending method for Diffusion-based image editing. Unlike previous methods, PFB-Diff seamlessly integrates text-guided generated content into the target image through multi-level feature blending. The rich semantics encoded in deep features and the progressive blending scheme from high to low levels ensure semantic coherence and high quality in edited images. Additionally, we introduce an attention masking mechanism in the cross-attention layers to confine the impact of specific words to desired regions, further improving the performance of background editing. PFB-Diff can effectively address various editing tasks, including object/background replacement and object attribute editing. Our method demonstrates its superior performance in terms of image fidelity, editing accuracy, efficiency, and faithfulness to the original image, without the need for fine-tuning or training.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are being widely applied in medical image segmentation thanks to their ability to extract high-level features and capture important aspects of the image. However, there is often a trade-off between the need for high accuracy and the desire for low computational cost. A model with higher parameters can theoretically achieve better performance but also result in more computational complexity and higher memory usage, and thus is not practical to implement. In this paper, we look for a lightweight U-Net-based model which can remain the same or even achieve better performance, namely U-Lite. We design U-Lite based on the principle of Depthwise Separable Convolution so that the model can both leverage the strength of CNNs and reduce a remarkable number of computing parameters. Specifically, we propose Axial Depthwise Convolutions with kernels 7x7 in both the encoder and decoder to enlarge the model receptive field. To further improve the performance, we use several Axial Dilated Depthwise Convolutions with filters 3x3 for the bottleneck as one of our branches. Overall, U-Lite contains only 878K parameters, 35 times less than the traditional U-Net, and much more times less than other modern Transformer-based models. The proposed model cuts down a large amount of computational complexity while attaining an impressive performance on medical segmentation tasks compared to other state-of-the-art architectures. The code will be available at: https://github.com/duong-db/U-Lite.

- **Summary**: Leveraging geodesic distances and the geometrical information they convey is key for many data-oriented applications in imaging. Geodesic distance computation has been used for long for image segmentation using Image based metrics. We introduce a new method by generating isotropic Riemannian metrics adapted to a problem using CNN and give as illustrations an example of application. We then apply this idea to the segmentation of brain tumours as unit balls for the geodesic distance computed with the metric potential output by a CNN, thus imposing geometrical and topological constraints on the output mask. We show that geodesic distance modules work well in machine learning frameworks and can be used to achieve state-of-the-art performances while ensuring geometrical and/or topological properties.

- **Summary**: AIM To analyse the performance of a deep-learning (DL) algorithm currently deployed as diagnostic decision support software in two NHS Trusts used to identify normal chest x-rays in active clinical pathways.   MATERIALS AND METHODS A DL algorithm has been deployed in Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (SFT) since December 2022, and at Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust (CHFT) since March 2023. The algorithm was developed and trained prior to deployment, and is used to assign abnormality scores to each GP-requested chest x-ray (CXR). The algorithm classifies a subset of examinations with the lowest abnormality scores as High Confidence Normal (HCN), and displays this result to the Trust. This two-site study includes 4,654 CXR continuous examinations processed by the algorithm over a six-week period.   RESULTS When classifying 20.0% of assessed examinations (930) as HCN, the model classified exams with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.96. There were 0.77% of examinations (36) classified incorrectly as HCN, with none of the abnormalities considered clinically significant by auditing radiologists. The DL software maintained fast levels of service to clinicians, with results returned to Trusts in a mean time of 7.1 seconds.   CONCLUSION The DL algorithm performs with a low rate of error and is highly effective as an automated diagnostic decision support tool, used to autonomously report a subset of CXRs as normal with high confidence. Removing 20% of all CXRs reduces workload for reporters and allows radiology departments to focus resources elsewhere.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning algorithms based on instance discrimination effectively prevent representation collapse and produce promising results in representation learning. However, the process of attracting positive pairs (i.e., two views of the same instance) in the embedding space and repelling all other instances (i.e., negative pairs) irrespective of their categories could result in discarding important features. To address this issue, we propose an approach to identifying those images with similar semantic content and treating them as positive instances, named semantic positive pairs set (SPPS), thereby reducing the risk of discarding important features during representation learning. Our approach could work with any contrastive instance discrimination framework such as SimCLR or MOCO. We conduct experiments on three datasets: ImageNet, STL-10 and CIFAR-10 to evaluate our approach. The experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline method vanilla SimCLR across all three datasets; for example, our approach improves upon vanilla SimCLR under linear evaluation protocol by 4.18% on ImageNet with a batch size 1024 and 800 epochs.

- **Summary**: Machine learning methods have proven useful in transcribing historical data. However, results from even highly accurate methods require manual verification and correction. Such manual review can be time-consuming and expensive, therefore the objective of this paper was to make it more efficient. Previously, we used machine learning to transcribe 2.3 million handwritten occupation codes from the Norwegian 1950 census with high accuracy (97%). We manually reviewed the 90,000 (3%) codes with the lowest model confidence. We allocated those 90,000 codes to human reviewers, who used our annotation tool to review the codes. To assess reviewer agreement, some codes were assigned to multiple reviewers. We then analyzed the review results to understand the relationship between accuracy improvements and effort. Additionally, we interviewed the reviewers to improve the workflow. The reviewers corrected 62.8% of the labels and agreed with the model label in 31.9% of cases. About 0.2% of the images could not be assigned a label, while for 5.1% the reviewers were uncertain, or they assigned an invalid label. 9,000 images were independently reviewed by multiple reviewers, resulting in an agreement of 86.43% and disagreement of 8.96%. We learned that our automatic transcription is biased towards the most frequent codes, with a higher degree of misclassification for the lowest frequency codes. Our interview findings show that the reviewers did internal quality control and found our custom tool well-suited. So, only one reviewer is needed, but they should report uncertainty.

- **Summary**: Adversarial patch is one of the important forms of performing adversarial attacks in the physical world. To improve the naturalness and aggressiveness of existing adversarial patches, location-aware patches are proposed, where the patch's location on the target object is integrated into the optimization process to perform attacks. Although it is effective, efficiently finding the optimal location for placing the patches is challenging, especially under the black-box attack settings. In this paper, we propose the Distribution-Optimized Adversarial Patch (DOPatch), a novel method that optimizes a multimodal distribution of adversarial locations instead of individual ones. DOPatch has several benefits: Firstly, we find that the locations' distributions across different models are pretty similar, and thus we can achieve efficient query-based attacks to unseen models using a distributional prior optimized on a surrogate model. Secondly, DOPatch can generate diverse adversarial samples by characterizing the distribution of adversarial locations. Thus we can improve the model's robustness to location-aware patches via carefully designed Distributional-Modeling Adversarial Training (DOP-DMAT). We evaluate DOPatch on various face recognition and image recognition tasks and demonstrate its superiority and efficiency over existing methods. We also conduct extensive ablation studies and analyses to validate the effectiveness of our method and provide insights into the distribution of adversarial locations.

- **Summary**: Efficient and accurate segmentation of unseen objects is crucial for robotic manipulation. However, it remains challenging due to over- or under-segmentation. Although existing refinement methods can enhance the segmentation quality, they fix only minor boundary errors or are not sufficiently fast. In this work, we propose INSTAnce Boundary Explicit Error Estimation and Refinement (INSTA-BEEER), a novel refinement model that allows for adding and deleting instances and sharpening boundaries. Leveraging an error-estimation-then-refinement scheme, the model first estimates the pixel-wise boundary explicit errors: true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative pixels of the instance boundary in the initial segmentation. It then refines the initial segmentation using these error estimates as guidance. Experiments show that the proposed model significantly enhances segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, with a fast runtime (less than 0.1 s), the model consistently improves performance across various initial segmentation methods, making it highly suitable for practical robotic applications.

- **Summary**: Faster rendering of synthetic images is a core problem in the field of computer graphics. Rendering algorithms, such as path-tracing is dependent on parameters like size of the image, number of light bounces, number of samples per pixel, all of which, are fixed if one wants to obtain a image of a desired quality. It is also dependent on the size and complexity of the scene being rendered. One of the largest bottleneck in rendering, particularly when the scene is very large, is querying for objects in the path of a given ray in the scene. By changing the data type that represents the objects in the scene, one may reduce render time, however, a different representation of a scene requires the modification of the rendering algorithm. In this paper, (a) we introduce directed distance field, as a functional representation of a object; (b) how the directed distance functions, when stored as a neural network, be optimized and; (c) how such an object can be rendered with a modified path-tracing algorithm.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training is a practical approach for improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. Although bringing reliable robustness, the performance toward clean examples is negatively affected after adversarial training, which means a trade-off exists between accuracy and robustness. Recently, some studies have tried to use knowledge distillation methods in adversarial training, achieving competitive performance in improving the robustness but the accuracy for clean samples is still limited. In this paper, to mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off, we introduce the Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robustness Distillation (MTARD) to guide the model's adversarial training process by applying a strong clean teacher and a strong robust teacher to handle the clean examples and adversarial examples, respectively. During the optimization process, to ensure that different teachers show similar knowledge scales, we design the Entropy-Based Balance algorithm to adjust the teacher's temperature and keep the teachers' information entropy consistent. Besides, to ensure that the student has a relatively consistent learning speed from multiple teachers, we propose the Normalization Loss Balance algorithm to adjust the learning weights of different types of knowledge. A series of experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that MTARD outperforms the state-of-the-art adversarial training and distillation methods against various adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: Object detection on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images, as an emerging solution to facilitate robust detection for around-the-clock applications, has received extensive attention in recent years. With the help of IR images, object detectors have been more reliable and robust in practical applications by using RGB-IR combined information. However, existing methods still suffer from modality miscalibration and fusion imprecision problems. Since transformer has the powerful capability to model the pairwise correlations between different features, in this paper, we propose a novel Calibrated and Complementary Transformer called $\mathrm{C}^2$Former to address these two problems simultaneously. In $\mathrm{C}^2$Former, we design an Inter-modality Cross-Attention (ICA) module to obtain the calibrated and complementary features by learning the cross-attention relationship between the RGB and IR modality. To reduce the computational cost caused by computing the global attention in ICA, an Adaptive Feature Sampling (AFS) module is introduced to decrease the dimension of feature maps. Because $\mathrm{C}^2$Former performs in the feature domain, it can be embedded into existed RGB-IR object detectors via the backbone network. Thus, one single-stage and one two-stage object detector both incorporating our $\mathrm{C}^2$Former are constructed to evaluate its effectiveness and versatility. With extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle and KAIST RGB-IR datasets, we verify that our method can fully utilize the RGB-IR complementary information and achieve robust detection results.

- **Summary**: Given the special situation of modeling gigapixel images, multiple instance learning (MIL) has become one of the most important frameworks for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. In current practice, most MIL networks often face two unavoidable problems in training: i) insufficient WSI data, and ii) the sample memorization inclination inherent in neural networks. These problems may hinder MIL models from adequate and efficient training, suppressing the continuous performance promotion of classification models on WSIs. Inspired by the basic idea of Mixup, this paper proposes a new Pseudo-bag Mixup (PseMix) data augmentation scheme to improve the training of MIL models. This scheme generalizes the Mixup strategy for general images to special WSIs via pseudo-bags so as to be applied in MIL-based WSI classification. Cooperated by pseudo-bags, our PseMix fulfills the critical size alignment and semantic alignment in Mixup strategy. Moreover, it is designed as an efficient and decoupled method, neither involving time-consuming operations nor relying on MIL model predictions. Comparative experiments and ablation studies are specially designed to evaluate the effectiveness and advantages of our PseMix. Experimental results show that PseMix could often assist state-of-the-art MIL networks to refresh the classification performance on WSIs. Besides, it could also boost the generalization ability of MIL models, and promote their robustness to patch occlusion and noisy labels.

- **Summary**: Pan-sharpening, as one of the most commonly used techniques in remote sensing systems, aims to inject spatial details from panchromatic images into multispectral images (MS) to obtain high-resolution multispectral images. Since deep learning has received widespread attention because of its powerful fitting ability and efficient feature extraction, a variety of pan-sharpening methods have been proposed to achieve remarkable performance. However, current pan-sharpening methods usually require the paired panchromatic (PAN) and MS images as input, which limits their usage in some scenarios. To address this issue, in this paper we observe that the spatial details from PAN images are mainly high-frequency cues, i.e., the edges reflect the contour of input PAN images. This motivates us to develop a PAN-agnostic representation to store some base edges, so as to compose the contour for the corresponding PAN image via them. As a result, we can perform the pan-sharpening task with only the MS image when inference. To this end, a memory-based network is adapted to extract and memorize the spatial details during the training phase and is used to replace the process of obtaining spatial information from PAN images when inference, which is called Memory-based Spatial Details Network (MSDN). Finally, we integrate the proposed MSDN module into the existing deep learning-based pan-sharpening methods to achieve an end-to-end pan-sharpening network. With extensive experiments on the Gaofen1 and WorldView-4 satellites, we verify that our method constructs good spatial details without PAN images and achieves the best performance.

- **Summary**: Fabric defect segmentation is integral to textile quality control. Despite this, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data and the diversity of fabric defects present significant challenges to the application of deep learning in this field. These factors limit the generalization and segmentation performance of existing models, impeding their ability to handle the complexity of diverse fabric types and defects. To overcome these obstacles, this study introduces an innovative method to infuse specialized knowledge of fabric defects into the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a large-scale visual model. By introducing and training a unique set of fabric defect-related parameters, this approach seamlessly integrates domain-specific knowledge into SAM without the need for extensive modifications to the pre-existing model parameters. The revamped SAM model leverages generalized image understanding learned from large-scale natural image datasets while incorporating fabric defect-specific knowledge, ensuring its proficiency in fabric defect segmentation tasks. The experimental results reveal a significant improvement in the model's segmentation performance, attributable to this novel amalgamation of generic and fabric-specific knowledge. When benchmarking against popular existing segmentation models across three datasets, our proposed model demonstrates a substantial leap in performance. Its impressive results in cross-dataset comparisons and few-shot learning experiments further demonstrate its potential for practical applications in textile quality control.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound (US) imaging is a popular tool in clinical diagnosis, offering safety, repeatability, and real-time capabilities. Freehand 3D US is a technique that provides a deeper understanding of scanned regions without increasing complexity. However, estimating elevation displacement and accumulation error remains challenging, making it difficult to infer the relative position using images alone. The addition of external lightweight sensors has been proposed to enhance reconstruction performance without adding complexity, which has been shown to be beneficial. We propose a novel online self-consistency network (OSCNet) using multiple inertial measurement units (IMUs) to improve reconstruction performance. OSCNet utilizes a modal-level self-supervised strategy to fuse multiple IMU information and reduce differences between reconstruction results obtained from each IMU data. Additionally, a sequence-level self-consistency strategy is proposed to improve the hierarchical consistency of prediction results among the scanning sequence and its sub-sequences. Experiments on large-scale arm and carotid datasets with multiple scanning tactics demonstrate that our OSCNet outperforms previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction performance.

- **Summary**: Reliable pseudo-labels from unlabeled data play a key role in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, the state-of-the-art SSOD methods all rely on pseudo-labels with high confidence, which ignore valuable pseudo-labels with lower confidence. Additionally, the insufficient excavation for unlabeled data results in an excessively low recall rate thus hurting the network training. In this paper, we propose a novel Low-confidence Samples Mining (LSM) method to utilize low-confidence pseudo-labels efficiently. Specifically, we develop an additional pseudo information mining (PIM) branch on account of low-resolution feature maps to extract reliable large-area instances, the IoUs of which are higher than small-area ones. Owing to the complementary predictions between PIM and the main branch, we further design self-distillation (SD) to compensate for both in a mutually-learning manner. Meanwhile, the extensibility of the above approaches enables our LSM to apply to Faster-RCNN and Deformable-DETR respectively. On the MS-COCO benchmark, our method achieves 3.54% mAP improvement over state-of-the-art methods under 5% labeling ratios.

- **Summary**: Land cover (LC) segmentation plays a critical role in various applications, including environmental analysis and natural disaster management. However, generating accurate LC maps is a complex and time-consuming task that requires the expertise of multiple annotators and regular updates to account for environmental changes. In this work, we introduce SPADA, a framework for fuel map delineation that addresses the challenges associated with LC segmentation using sparse annotations and domain adaptation techniques for semantic segmentation. Performance evaluations using reliable ground truths, such as LUCAS and Urban Atlas, demonstrate the technique's effectiveness. SPADA outperforms state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches as well as third-party products, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 42.86 and an F1 score of 67.93 on Urban Atlas and LUCAS, respectively.

- **Summary**: Leveraging vast training data (SA-1B), the foundation Segment Anything Model (SAM) proposed by Meta AI Research exhibits remarkable generalization and zero-shot capabilities. Nonetheless, as a category-agnostic instance segmentation method, SAM heavily depends on prior manual guidance involving points, boxes, and coarse-grained masks. Additionally, its performance on remote sensing image segmentation tasks has yet to be fully explored and demonstrated. In this paper, we consider designing an automated instance segmentation approach for remote sensing images based on the SAM foundation model, incorporating semantic category information. Inspired by prompt learning, we propose a method to learn the generation of appropriate prompts for SAM input. This enables SAM to produce semantically discernible segmentation results for remote sensing images, which we refer to as RSPrompter. We also suggest several ongoing derivatives for instance segmentation tasks, based on recent developments in the SAM community, and compare their performance with RSPrompter. Extensive experimental results on the WHU building, NWPU VHR-10, and SSDD datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed method. Our code is accessible at \url{https://kyanchen.github.io/RSPrompter}.

- **Summary**: Despite their impressive performance in various surgical scene understanding tasks, deep learning-based methods are frequently hindered from deploying to real-world surgical applications for various causes. Particularly, data collection, annotation, and domain shift in-between sites and patients are the most common obstacles. In this work, we mitigate data-related issues by efficiently leveraging minimal source images to generate synthetic surgical instrument segmentation datasets and achieve outstanding generalization performance on unseen real domains. Specifically, in our framework, only one background tissue image and at most three images of each foreground instrument are taken as the seed images. These source images are extensively transformed and employed to build up the foreground and background image pools, from which randomly sampled tissue and instrument images are composed with multiple blending techniques to generate new surgical scene images. Besides, we introduce hybrid training-time augmentations to diversify the training data further. Extensive evaluation on three real-world datasets, i.e., Endo2017, Endo2018, and RoboTool, demonstrates that our one-to-many synthetic surgical instruments datasets generation and segmentation framework can achieve encouraging performance compared with training with real data. Notably, on the RoboTool dataset, where a more significant domain gap exists, our framework shows its superiority of generalization by a considerable margin. We expect that our inspiring results will attract research attention to improving model generalization with data synthesizing.

- **Summary**: Captions that describe or explain charts help improve recall and comprehension of the depicted data and provide a more accessible medium for people with visual disabilities. However, current approaches for automatically generating such captions struggle to articulate the perceptual or cognitive features that are the hallmark of charts (e.g., complex trends and patterns). In response, we introduce VisText: a dataset of 12,441 pairs of charts and captions that describe the charts' construction, report key statistics, and identify perceptual and cognitive phenomena. In VisText, a chart is available as three representations: a rasterized image, a backing data table, and a scene graph -- a hierarchical representation of a chart's visual elements akin to a web page's Document Object Model (DOM). To evaluate the impact of VisText, we fine-tune state-of-the-art language models on our chart captioning task and apply prefix-tuning to produce captions that vary the semantic content they convey. Our models generate coherent, semantically rich captions and perform on par with state-of-the-art chart captioning models across machine translation and text generation metrics. Through qualitative analysis, we identify six broad categories of errors that our models make that can inform future work.

- **Summary**: The irregularity and permutation invariance of point cloud data pose challenges for effective learning. Conventional methods for addressing this issue involve converting raw point clouds to intermediate representations such as 3D voxel grids or range images. While such intermediate representations solve the problem of permutation invariance, they can result in significant loss of information. Approaches that do learn on raw point clouds either have trouble in resolving neighborhood relationships between points or are too complicated in their formulation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to representing point clouds as a locality preserving 1D ordering induced by the Hilbert space-filling curve. We also introduce Point2Point, a neural architecture that can effectively learn on Hilbert-sorted point clouds. We show that Point2Point shows competitive performance on point cloud segmentation and generation tasks. Finally, we show the performance of Point2Point on Spatio-temporal Occupancy prediction from Point clouds.

- **Summary**: Treatment planning is a critical component of the radiotherapy workflow, typically carried out by a medical physicist using a time-consuming trial-and-error manner. Previous studies have proposed knowledge-based or deep learning-based methods for predicting dose distribution maps to assist medical physicists in improving the efficiency of treatment planning. However, these dose prediction methods usuallylack the effective utilization of distance information between surrounding tissues andtargets or organs-at-risk (OARs). Moreover, they are poor in maintaining the distribution characteristics of ray paths in the predicted dose distribution maps, resulting in a loss of valuable information obtained by medical physicists. In this paper, we propose a distance-aware diffusion model (DoseDiff) for precise prediction of dose distribution. We define dose prediction as a sequence of denoising steps, wherein the predicted dose distribution map is generated with the conditions of the CT image and signed distance maps (SDMs). The SDMs are obtained by a distance transformation from the masks of targets or OARs, which provide the distance information from each pixel in the image to the outline of the targets or OARs. Besides, we propose a multiencoder and multi-scale fusion network (MMFNet) that incorporates a multi-scale fusion and a transformer-based fusion module to enhance information fusion between the CT image and SDMs at the feature level. Our model was evaluated on two datasets collected from patients with breast cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer, respectively. The results demonstrate that our DoseDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art dose prediction methods in terms of both quantitative and visual quality.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new diffusion-based approach for shape completion on 3D range scans. Compared with prior deterministic and probabilistic methods, we strike a balance between realism, multi-modality, and high fidelity. We propose DiffComplete by casting shape completion as a generative task conditioned on the incomplete shape. Our key designs are two-fold. First, we devise a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism to inject conditional features in a spatially-consistent manner. So, we can capture both local details and broader contexts of the conditional inputs to control the shape completion. Second, we propose an occupancy-aware fusion strategy in our model to enable the completion of multiple partial shapes and introduce higher flexibility on the input conditions. DiffComplete sets a new SOTA performance (e.g., 40% decrease on l_1 error) on two large-scale 3D shape completion benchmarks. Our completed shapes not only have a realistic outlook compared with the deterministic methods but also exhibit high similarity to the ground truths compared with the probabilistic alternatives. Further, DiffComplete has strong generalizability on objects of entirely unseen classes for both synthetic and real data, eliminating the need for model re-training in various applications.

- **Summary**: The aim of this research is to recognize human actions performed on stage to aid visually impaired and blind individuals. To achieve this, we have created a theatre human action recognition system that uses skeleton data captured by depth image as input. We collected new samples of human actions in a theatre environment, and then tested the transfer learning technique with three pre-trained Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks for skeleton-based human action recognition: the spatio-temporal graph convolution network, the two-stream adaptive graph convolution network, and the multi-scale disentangled unified graph convolution network. We selected the NTU-RGBD human action benchmark as the source domain and used our collected dataset as the target domain. We analyzed the transferability of the pre-trained models and proposed two configurations to apply and adapt the transfer learning technique to the diversity between the source and target domains. The use of transfer learning helped to improve the performance of the human action system within the context of theatre. The results indicate that Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks is positively transferred, and there was an improvement in performance compared to the baseline without transfer learning.

- **Summary**: We propose LENS, a modular approach for tackling computer vision problems by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). Our system uses a language model to reason over outputs from a set of independent and highly descriptive vision modules that provide exhaustive information about an image. We evaluate the approach on pure computer vision settings such as zero- and few-shot object recognition, as well as on vision and language problems. LENS can be applied to any off-the-shelf LLM and we find that the LLMs with LENS perform highly competitively with much bigger and much more sophisticated systems, without any multimodal training whatsoever. We open-source our code at https://github.com/ContextualAI/lens and provide an interactive demo.

Together, these provide an automated end-to-end machine learning pipeline that simplifies and standardizes data loading, experimental setup, and model evaluation. To enable holistic evaluation, we offer a comprehensive methodology to assess (1) generalization, (2) time and space complexity, and (3) modality robustness. MultiBench paves the way towards a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of multimodal models, while ensuring ease of use, accessibility, and reproducibility. Our toolkits are publicly available, will be regularly updated, and welcome inputs from the community.

- **Summary**: The increasing access to data poses both opportunities and risks in deep learning, as one can manipulate the behaviors of deep learning models with malicious training samples. Such attacks are known as data poisoning. Recent advances in defense strategies against data poisoning have highlighted the effectiveness of aggregation schemes in achieving state-of-the-art results in certified poisoning robustness. However, the practical implications of these approaches remain unclear. Here we focus on Deep Partition Aggregation, a representative aggregation defense, and assess its practical aspects, including efficiency, performance, and robustness. For evaluations, we use ImageNet resized to a resolution of 64 by 64 to enable evaluations at a larger scale than previous ones. Firstly, we demonstrate a simple yet practical approach to scaling base models, which improves the efficiency of training and inference for aggregation defenses. Secondly, we provide empirical evidence supporting the data-to-complexity ratio, i.e. the ratio between the data set size and sample complexity, as a practical estimation of the maximum number of base models that can be deployed while preserving accuracy. Last but not least, we point out how aggregation defenses boost poisoning robustness empirically through the poisoning overfitting phenomenon, which is the key underlying mechanism for the empirical poisoning robustness of aggregations. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights for practical implementations of aggregation defenses to mitigate the threat of data poisoning.

- **Summary**: This paper studies a category of visual question answering tasks, in which accessing external knowledge is necessary for answering the questions. This category is called outside-knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA). A major step in developing OK-VQA systems is to retrieve relevant documents for the given multi-modal query. Current state-of-the-art asymmetric dense retrieval model for this task uses an architecture with a multi-modal query encoder and a uni-modal document encoder. Such an architecture requires a large amount of training data for effective performance. We propose an automatic data generation pipeline for pre-training passage retrieval models for OK-VQA tasks. The proposed approach leads to 26.9% Precision@5 improvements compared to the current state-of-the-art asymmetric architecture. Additionally, the proposed pre-training approach exhibits a good ability in zero-shot retrieval scenarios.

- **Summary**: The task of recognising Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (HMER) is crucial in the fields of digital education and scholarly research. However, it is difficult to accurately determine the length and complex spatial relationships among symbols in handwritten mathematical expressions. In this study, we present a novel encoder-decoder architecture (DenseBAM-GI) for HMER, where the encoder has a Bottleneck Attention Module (BAM) to improve feature representation and the decoder has a Gated Input-GRU (GI-GRU) unit with an extra gate to make decoding long and complex expressions easier. The proposed model is an efficient and lightweight architecture with performance equivalent to state-of-the-art models in terms of Expression Recognition Rate (exprate). It also performs better in terms of top 1, 2, and 3 error accuracy across the CROHME 2014, 2016, and 2019 datasets. DenseBAM-GI achieves the best exprate among all models on the CROHME 2019 dataset. Importantly, these successes are accomplished with a drop in the complexity of the calculation and a reduction in the need for GPU memory.

- **Summary**: Video retrieval (VR) involves retrieving the ground truth video from the video database given a text caption or vice-versa. The two important components of compositionality: objects \& attributes and actions are joined using correct semantics to form a proper text query. These components (objects \& attributes, actions and semantics) each play an important role to help distinguish among videos and retrieve the correct ground truth video. However, it is unclear what is the effect of these components on the video retrieval performance. We therefore, conduct a systematic study to evaluate the compositional and semantic understanding of video retrieval models on standard benchmarks such as MSRVTT, MSVD and DIDEMO. The study is performed on two categories of video retrieval models: (i) which are pre-trained on video-text pairs and fine-tuned on downstream video retrieval datasets (Eg. Frozen-in-Time, Violet, MCQ etc.) (ii) which adapt pre-trained image-text representations like CLIP for video retrieval (Eg. CLIP4Clip, XCLIP, CLIP2Video etc.). Our experiments reveal that actions and semantics play a minor role compared to objects \& attributes in video understanding. Moreover, video retrieval models that use pre-trained image-text representations (CLIP) have better semantic and compositional understanding as compared to models pre-trained on video-text data.

- **Summary**: Cell line authentication plays a crucial role in the biomedical field, ensuring researchers work with accurately identified cells. Supervised deep learning has made remarkable strides in cell line identification by studying cell morphological features through cell imaging. However, batch effects, a significant issue stemming from the different times at which data is generated, lead to substantial shifts in the underlying data distribution, thus complicating reliable differentiation between cell lines from distinct batch cultures. To address this challenge, we introduce CLANet, a pioneering framework for cross-batch cell line identification using brightfield images, specifically designed to tackle three distinct batch effects. We propose a cell cluster-level selection method to efficiently capture cell density variations, and a self-supervised learning strategy to manage image quality variations, thus producing reliable patch representations. Additionally, we adopt multiple instance learning(MIL) for effective aggregation of instance-level features for cell line identification. Our innovative time-series segment sampling module further enhances MIL's feature-learning capabilities, mitigating biases from varying incubation times across batches. We validate CLANet using data from 32 cell lines across 93 experimental batches from the AstraZeneca Global Cell Bank. Our results show that CLANet outperforms related approaches (e.g. domain adaptation, MIL), demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing batch effects in cell line identification.

- **Summary**: The class imbalance problem in deep learning has been explored in several studies, but there has yet to be a systematic analysis of this phenomenon in object detection. Here, we present comprehensive analyses and experiments of the foreground-background (F-B) imbalance problem in object detection, which is very common and caused by small, infrequent objects of interest. We experimentally study the effects of different aspects of F-B imbalance (object size, number of objects, dataset size, object type) on detection performance. In addition, we also compare 9 leading methods for addressing this problem, including Faster-RCNN, SSD, OHEM, Libra-RCNN, Focal-Loss, GHM, PISA, YOLO-v3, and GFL with a range of datasets from different imaging domains. We conclude that (1) the F-B imbalance can indeed cause a significant drop in detection performance, (2) The detection performance is more affected by F-B imbalance when fewer training data are available, (3) in most cases, decreasing object size leads to larger performance drop than decreasing number of objects, given the same change in the ratio of object pixels to non-object pixels, (6) among all selected methods, Libra-RCNN and PISA demonstrate the best performance in addressing the issue of F-B imbalance. (7) When the training dataset size is large, the choice of method is not impactful (8) Soft-sampling methods, including focal-loss, GHM, and GFL, perform fairly well on average but are relatively unstable.

- **Summary**: Meeting online is becoming the new normal. Creating an immersive experience for online meetings is a necessity towards more diverse and seamless environments. Efficient photorealistic rendering of human 3D dynamics is the core of immersive meetings. Current popular applications achieve real-time conferencing but fall short in delivering photorealistic human dynamics, either due to limited 2D space or the use of avatars that lack realistic interactions between participants. Recent advances in neural rendering, such as the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), offer the potential for greater realism in metaverse meetings. However, the slow rendering speed of NeRF poses challenges for real-time conferencing. We envision a pipeline for a future extended reality metaverse conferencing system that leverages monocular video acquisition and free-viewpoint synthesis to enhance data and hardware efficiency. Towards an immersive conferencing experience, we explore an accelerated NeRF-based free-viewpoint synthesis algorithm for rendering photorealistic human dynamics more efficiently. We show that our algorithm achieves comparable rendering quality while performing training and inference 44.5% and 213% faster than state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Our exploration provides a design basis for constructing metaverse conferencing systems that can handle complex application scenarios, including dynamic scene relighting with customized themes and multi-user conferencing that harmonizes real-world people into an extended world.

- **Summary**: The lack of ability to adapt the motion compensation model to video content is an important limitation of current end-to-end learned video compression models. This paper advances the state-of-the-art by proposing an adaptive motion-compensation model for end-to-end rate-distortion optimized hierarchical bi-directional video compression. In particular, we propose two novelties: i) a multi-scale deformable alignment scheme at the feature level combined with multi-scale conditional coding, ii) motion-content adaptive inference. In addition, we employ a gain unit, which enables a single model to operate at multiple rate-distortion operating points. We also exploit the gain unit to control bit allocation among intra-coded vs. bi-directionally coded frames by fine tuning corresponding models for truly flexible-rate learned video coding. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance exceeding those of all prior art in learned video coding.

- **Summary**: We present Palm, a solution to the Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task utilizing vision-language and large language models. Given an input video with annotated action periods, the LTA task aims to predict possible future actions. We hypothesize that an optimal solution should capture the interdependency between past and future actions, and be able to infer future actions based on the structure and dependency encoded in the past actions. Large language models have demonstrated remarkable commonsense-based reasoning ability. Inspired by that, Palm chains an image captioning model and a large language model. It predicts future actions based on frame descriptions and action labels extracted from the input videos. Our method outperforms other participants in the EGO4D LTA challenge and achieves the best performance in terms of action prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/DanDoge/Palm

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the impact of LiDAR configuration shifts on the performance of 3D LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation models, a topic not extensively studied before. We explore the effect of using different LiDAR channels when training and testing a 3D LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation model, utilizing Cylinder3D for the experiments. A Cylinder3D model is trained and tested on simulated 3D LiDAR point cloud datasets created using the Mississippi State University Autonomous Vehicle Simulator (MAVS) and 32, 64 channel 3D LiDAR point clouds of the RELLIS-3D dataset collected in a real-world off-road environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that sensor and spatial domain shifts significantly impact the performance of LiDAR-based semantic segmentation models. In the absence of spatial domain changes between training and testing, models trained and tested on the same sensor type generally exhibited better performance. Moreover, higher-resolution sensors showed improved performance compared to those with lower-resolution ones. However, results varied when spatial domain changes were present. In some cases, the advantage of a sensor's higher resolution led to better performance both with and without sensor domain shifts. In other instances, the higher resolution resulted in overfitting within a specific domain, causing a lack of generalization capability and decreased performance when tested on data with different sensor configurations.

- **Summary**: Automated medical image segmentation inherently involves a certain degree of uncertainty. One key factor contributing to this uncertainty is the ambiguity that can arise in determining the boundaries of a target region of interest, primarily due to variations in image appearance. On top of this, even among experts in the field, different opinions can emerge regarding the precise definition of specific anatomical structures. This work specifically addresses the modeling of segmentation uncertainty, known as inter-rater uncertainty. Its primary objective is to explore and analyze the variability in segmentation outcomes that can occur when multiple experts in medical imaging interpret and annotate the same images. We introduce a novel Bayesian neural network-based architecture to estimate inter-rater uncertainty in medical image segmentation. Our approach has three key advancements. Firstly, we introduce a one-encoder-multi-decoder architecture specifically tailored for uncertainty estimation, enabling us to capture the rater-specific representation of each expert involved. Secondly, we propose Bayesian modeling for the new architecture, allowing efficient capture of the inter-rater distribution, particularly in scenarios with limited annotations. Lastly, we enhance the rater-specific representation by integrating an attention module into each decoder. This module facilitates focused and refined segmentation results for each rater. We conduct extensive evaluations using synthetic and real-world datasets to validate our technical innovations rigorously. Our method surpasses existing baseline methods in five out of seven diverse tasks on the publicly available \emph{QUBIQ} dataset, considering two evaluation metrics encompassing different uncertainty aspects. Our codes, models, and the new dataset are available through our GitHub repository: https://github.com/HaoWang420/bOEMD-net .

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks are powerful tools to understand complex patterns and making decisions. However, their black-box nature impedes a complete understanding of their inner workings. While online saliency-guided training methods try to highlight the prominent features in the model's output to alleviate this problem, it is still ambiguous if the visually explainable features align with robustness of the model against adversarial examples. In this paper, we investigate the saliency trained model's vulnerability to adversarial examples methods. Models are trained using an online saliency-guided training method and evaluated against popular algorithms of adversarial examples. We quantify the robustness and conclude that despite the well-explained visualizations in the model's output, the salient models suffer from the lower performance against adversarial examples attacks.

- **Summary**: The availability of real-time semantics greatly improves the core geometric functionality of SLAM systems, enabling numerous robotic and AR/VR applications. We present a new methodology for real-time semantic mapping from RGB-D sequences that combines a 2D neural network and a 3D network based on a SLAM system with 3D occupancy mapping. When segmenting a new frame we perform latent feature re-projection from previous frames based on differentiable rendering. Fusing re-projected feature maps from previous frames with current-frame features greatly improves image segmentation quality, compared to a baseline that processes images independently. For 3D map processing, we propose a novel geometric quasi-planar over-segmentation method that groups 3D map elements likely to belong to the same semantic classes, relying on surface normals. We also describe a novel neural network design for lightweight semantic map post-processing. Our system achieves state-of-the-art semantic mapping quality within 2D-3D networks-based systems and matches the performance of 3D convolutional networks on three real indoor datasets, while working in real-time. Moreover, it shows better cross-sensor generalization abilities compared to 3D CNNs, enabling training and inference with different depth sensors. Code and data will be released on project page: http://jingwenwang95.github.io/SeMLaPS

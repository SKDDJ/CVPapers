- **Summary**: Domain adaptation (DA) adapts a training dataset from a source domain for use in a learning task in a target domain in combination with data available at the target. One popular approach for DA is to create a domain-independent representation (DIRep) learned by a generator from all input samples and then train a classifier on top of it using all labeled samples. A domain discriminator is added to train the generator adversarially to exclude domain specific features from the DIRep. However, this approach tends to generate insufficient information for accurate classification learning. In this paper, we present a novel approach that integrates the adversarial model with a variational autoencoder. In addition to the DIRep, we introduce a domain-dependent representation (DDRep) such that information from both DIRep and DDRep is sufficient to reconstruct samples from both domains. We further penalize the size of the DDRep to drive as much information as possible to the DIRep, which maximizes the accuracy of the classifier in labeling samples in both domains. We empirically evaluate our model using synthetic datasets and demonstrate that spurious class-related features introduced in the source domain are successfully absorbed by the DDRep. This leaves a rich and clean DIRep for accurate transfer learning in the target domain. We further demonstrate its superior performance against other algorithms for a number of common image datasets. We also show we can take advantage of pretrained models.

- **Summary**: Self-training is an important technique for solving semi-supervised learning problems. It leverages unlabeled data by generating pseudo-labels and combining them with a limited labeled dataset for training. The effectiveness of self-training heavily relies on the accuracy of these pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce doubly robust self-training, a novel semi-supervised algorithm that provably balances between two extremes. When the pseudo-labels are entirely incorrect, our method reduces to a training process solely using labeled data. Conversely, when the pseudo-labels are completely accurate, our method transforms into a training process utilizing all pseudo-labeled data and labeled data, thus increasing the effective sample size. Through empirical evaluations on both the ImageNet dataset for image classification and the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset for 3D object detection, we demonstrate the superiority of the doubly robust loss over the standard self-training baseline.

- **Summary**: This document presents a preliminary approach to latent fingerprint enhancement, fundamentally designed around a mixed Unet architecture. It combines the capabilities of the Resnet-101 network and Unet encoder, aiming to form a potentially powerful composite. This combination, enhanced with attention mechanisms and forward skip connections, is intended to optimize the enhancement of ridge and minutiae features in fingerprints. One innovative element of this approach includes a novel Fingerprint Enhancement Gabor layer, specifically designed for GPU computations. This illustrates how modern computational resources might be harnessed to expedite enhancement. Given its potential functionality as either a CNN or Transformer layer, this Gabor layer could offer improved agility and processing speed to the system. However, it is important to note that this approach is still in the early stages of development and has not yet been fully validated through rigorous experiments. As such, it may require additional time and testing to establish its robustness and usability in the field of latent fingerprint enhancement. This includes improvements in processing speed, enhancement adaptability with distinct latent fingerprint types, and full validation in experimental approaches such as open-set (identification 1:N) and open-set validation, fingerprint quality evaluation, among others.

- **Summary**: Neural network approaches are machine learning methods that are widely used in various domains, such as healthcare and cybersecurity. Neural networks are especially renowned for their ability to deal with image datasets. During the training process with images, various fundamental mathematical operations are performed in the neural network. These operations include several algebraic and mathematical functions, such as derivatives, convolutions, and matrix inversions and transpositions. Such operations demand higher processing power than what is typically required for regular computer usage. Since CPUs are built with serial processing, they are not appropriate for handling large image datasets. On the other hand, GPUs have parallel processing capabilities and can provide higher speed. This paper utilizes advanced neural network techniques, such as VGG16, Resnet50, Densenet, Inceptionv3, Xception, Mobilenet, XGBOOST VGG16, and our proposed models, to compare CPU and GPU resources. We implemented a system for classifying Autism disease using face images of autistic and non-autistic children to compare performance during testing. We used evaluation matrices such as Accuracy, F1 score, Precision, Recall, and Execution time. It was observed that GPU outperformed CPU in all tests conducted. Moreover, the performance of the neural network models in terms of accuracy increased on GPU compared to CPU.

- **Summary**: The spreading of attention has been proposed as a mechanism for how humans group features to segment objects. However, such a mechanism has not yet been implemented and tested in naturalistic images. Here, we leverage the feature maps from self-supervised vision Transformers and propose a model of human object-based attention spreading and segmentation. Attention spreads within an object through the feature affinity signal between different patches of the image. We also collected behavioral data on people grouping objects in natural images by judging whether two dots are on the same object or on two different objects. We found that our models of affinity spread that were built on feature maps from the self-supervised Transformers showed significant improvement over baseline and CNN based models on predicting reaction time patterns of humans, despite not being trained on the task or with any other object labels. Our work provides new benchmarks for evaluating models of visual representation learning including Transformers.

- **Summary**: This paper surveys and evaluates some popular state of the art methods for algorithmic curvature and normal estimation. In addition to surveying existing methods we also propose a new method for robust curvature estimation and evaluate it against existing methods thus demonstrating its superiority to existing methods in the case of significant data noise. Throughout this paper we are concerned with computation in low dimensional spaces (N < 10) and primarily focus on the computation of the Weingarten map and quantities that may be derived from this; however, the algorithms discussed are theoretically applicable in any dimension. One thing that is common to all these methods is their basis in an estimated graph structure. For any of these methods to work the local geometry of the manifold must be exploited; however, in the case of point cloud data it is often difficult to discover a robust manifold structure underlying the data, even in simple cases, which can greatly influence the results of these algorithms. We hope that in pushing these algorithms to their limits we are able to discover, and perhaps resolve, many major pitfalls that may affect potential users and future researchers hoping to improve these methods

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved promising results in image restoration tasks, yet suffer from time-consuming, excessive computational resource consumption, and unstable restoration. To address these issues, we propose a robust and efficient Diffusion-based Low-Light image enhancement approach, dubbed DiffLL. Specifically, we present a wavelet-based conditional diffusion model (WCDM) that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to produce results with satisfactory perceptual fidelity. Additionally, it also takes advantage of the strengths of wavelet transformation to greatly accelerate inference and reduce computational resource usage without sacrificing information. To avoid chaotic content and diversity, we perform both forward diffusion and reverse denoising in the training phase of WCDM, enabling the model to achieve stable denoising and reduce randomness during inference. Moreover, we further design a high-frequency restoration module (HFRM) that utilizes the vertical and horizontal details of the image to complement the diagonal information for better fine-grained restoration. Extensive experiments on publicly available real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually, and it achieves remarkable improvements in efficiency compared to previous diffusion-based methods. In addition, we empirically show that the application for low-light face detection also reveals the latent practical values of our method.

- **Summary**: We investigate whether prompts learned independently for different tasks can be later combined through prompt algebra to obtain a model that supports composition of tasks. We consider Visual Language Models (VLM) with prompt tuning as our base classifier and formally define the notion of prompt algebra. We propose constrained prompt tuning to improve performance of the composite classifier. In the proposed scheme, prompts are constrained to appear in the lower dimensional subspace spanned by the basis vectors of the pre-trained vocabulary. Further regularization is added to ensure that the learned prompt is grounded correctly to the existing pre-trained vocabulary. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on object classification and object-attribute classification datasets. On average, our composite model obtains classification accuracy within 2.5% of the best base model. On UTZappos it improves classification accuracy over the best base model by 8.45% on average.

- **Summary**: Perception is crucial in the realm of autonomous driving systems, where bird's eye view (BEV)-based architectures have recently reached state-of-the-art performance. The desirability of self-supervised representation learning stems from the expensive and laborious process of annotating 2D and 3D data. Although previous research has investigated pretraining methods for both LiDAR and camera-based 3D object detection, a unified pretraining framework for multimodal BEV perception is missing. In this study, we introduce CALICO, a novel framework that applies contrastive objectives to both LiDAR and camera backbones. Specifically, CALICO incorporates two stages: point-region contrast (PRC) and region-aware distillation (RAD). PRC better balances the region- and scene-level representation learning on the LiDAR modality and offers significant performance improvement compared to existing methods. RAD effectively achieves contrastive distillation on our self-trained teacher model. CALICO's efficacy is substantiated by extensive evaluations on 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, where it delivers significant performance improvements. Notably, CALICO outperforms the baseline method by 10.5% and 8.6% on NDS and mAP. Moreover, CALICO boosts the robustness of multimodal 3D object detection against adversarial attacks and corruption. Additionally, our framework can be tailored to different backbones and heads, positioning it as a promising approach for multimodal BEV perception.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in various domains. It trains a model on denoising tasks that encompass different noise levels simultaneously, representing a form of multi-task learning (MTL). However, analyzing and improving diffusion models from an MTL perspective remains under-explored. In particular, MTL can sometimes lead to the well-known phenomenon of $\textit{negative transfer}$, which results in the performance degradation of certain tasks due to conflicts between tasks. In this paper, we aim to analyze diffusion training from an MTL standpoint, presenting two key observations: $\textbf{(O1)}$ the task affinity between denoising tasks diminishes as the gap between noise levels widens, and $\textbf{(O2)}$ negative transfer can arise even in the context of diffusion training. Building upon these observations, our objective is to enhance diffusion training by mitigating negative transfer. To achieve this, we propose leveraging existing MTL methods, but the presence of a huge number of denoising tasks makes this computationally expensive to calculate the necessary per-task loss or gradient. To address this challenge, we propose clustering the denoising tasks into small task clusters and applying MTL methods to them. Specifically, based on $\textbf{(O2)}$, we employ interval clustering to enforce temporal proximity among denoising tasks within clusters. We show that interval clustering can be solved with dynamic programming and utilize signal-to-noise ratio, timestep, and task affinity for clustering objectives. Through this, our approach addresses the issue of negative transfer in diffusion models by allowing for efficient computation of MTL methods. We validate the proposed clustering and its integration with MTL methods through various experiments, demonstrating improved sample quality of diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Information extraction, e.g., attribute value extraction, has been extensively studied and formulated based only on text. However, many attributes can benefit from image-based extraction, like color, shape, pattern, among others. The visual modality has long been underutilized, mainly due to multimodal annotation difficulty. In this paper, we aim to patch the visual modality to the textual-established attribute information extractor. The cross-modality integration faces several unique challenges: (C1) images and textual descriptions are loosely paired intra-sample and inter-samples; (C2) images usually contain rich backgrounds that can mislead the prediction; (C3) weakly supervised labels from textual-established extractors are biased for multimodal training. We present PV2TEA, an encoder-decoder architecture equipped with three bias reduction schemes: (S1) Augmented label-smoothed contrast to improve the cross-modality alignment for loosely-paired image and text; (S2) Attention-pruning that adaptively distinguishes the visual foreground; (S3) Two-level neighborhood regularization that mitigates the label textual bias via reliability estimation. Empirical results on real-world e-Commerce datasets demonstrate up to 11.74% absolute (20.97% relatively) F1 increase over unimodal baselines.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) usually rely on edge/shape information to classify images. Visualization methods developed over the last decade confirm that ConvNets rely on edge information. We investigate situations where the ConvNet needs to rely on image intensity in addition to shape. We show that the ConvNet relies on image intensity information using visualization.

- **Summary**: Dynamical systems with complex behaviours, e.g. immune system cells interacting with a pathogen, are commonly modelled by splitting the behaviour into different regimes, or modes, each with simpler dynamics, and then learning the switching behaviour from one mode to another. Switching Dynamical Systems (SDS) are a powerful tool that automatically discovers these modes and mode-switching behaviour from time series data. While effective, these methods focus on independent objects, where the modes of one object are independent of the modes of the other objects. In this paper, we focus on the more general interacting object setting for switching dynamical systems, where the per-object dynamics also depends on an unknown and dynamically changing subset of other objects and their modes. To this end, we propose a novel graph-based approach for switching dynamical systems, GRAph Switching dynamical Systems (GRASS), in which we use a dynamic graph to characterize interactions between objects and learn both intra-object and inter-object mode-switching behaviour. We introduce two new datasets for this setting, a synthesized ODE-driven particles dataset and a real-world Salsa Couple Dancing dataset. Experiments show that GRASS can consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We present GenMM, a generative model that "mines" as many diverse motions as possible from a single or few example sequences. In stark contrast to existing data-driven methods, which typically require long offline training time, are prone to visual artifacts, and tend to fail on large and complex skeletons, GenMM inherits the training-free nature and the superior quality of the well-known Motion Matching method. GenMM can synthesize a high-quality motion within a fraction of a second, even with highly complex and large skeletal structures. At the heart of our generative framework lies the generative motion matching module, which utilizes the bidirectional visual similarity as a generative cost function to motion matching, and operates in a multi-stage framework to progressively refine a random guess using exemplar motion matches. In addition to diverse motion generation, we show the versatility of our generative framework by extending it to a number of scenarios that are not possible with motion matching alone, including motion completion, key frame-guided generation, infinite looping, and motion reassembly. Code and data for this paper are at https://wyysf-98.github.io/GenMM/

- **Summary**: E-commerce websites (e.g. Amazon) have a plethora of structured and unstructured information (text and images) present on the product pages. Sellers often either don't label or mislabel values of the attributes (e.g. color, size etc.) for their products. Automatically identifying these attribute values from an eCommerce product page that contains both text and images is a challenging task, especially when the attribute value is not explicitly mentioned in the catalog. In this paper, we present a scalable solution for this problem where we pose attribute extraction problem as a question-answering task, which we solve using \textbf{MXT}, consisting of three key components: (i) \textbf{M}AG (Multimodal Adaptation Gate), (ii) \textbf{X}ception network, and (iii) \textbf{T}5 encoder-decoder. Our system consists of a generative model that \emph{generates} attribute-values for a given product by using both textual and visual characteristics (e.g. images) of the product. We show that our system is capable of handling zero-shot attribute prediction (when attribute value is not seen in training data) and value-absent prediction (when attribute value is not mentioned in the text) which are missing in traditional classification-based and NER-based models respectively. We have trained our models using distant supervision, removing dependency on human labeling, thus making them practical for real-world applications. With this framework, we are able to train a single model for 1000s of (product-type, attribute) pairs, thus reducing the overhead of training and maintaining separate models. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that our framework improves the absolute recall@90P by 10.16\% and 6.9\% from the existing state of the art models. In a popular e-commerce store, we have deployed our models for 1000s of (product-type, attribute) pairs.

- **Summary**: The development of learning-based hyperspectral image compression methods has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing. Such methods require a high number of hyperspectral images to be used during training to optimize all parameters and reach a high compression performance. However, existing hyperspectral datasets are not sufficient to train and evaluate learning-based compression methods, which hinders the research in this field. To address this problem, in this paper we present HySpecNet-11k that is a large-scale hyperspectral benchmark dataset made up of 11,483 nonoverlapping image patches. Each patch is a portion of 128 $\times$ 128 pixels with 224 spectral bands and a ground sample distance of 30 m. We exploit HySpecNet-11k to benchmark the current state of the art in learning-based hyperspectral image compression by focussing our attention on various 1D, 2D and 3D convolutional autoencoder architectures. Nevertheless, HySpecNet-11k can be used for any unsupervised learning task in the framework of hyperspectral image analysis. The dataset, our code and the pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://hyspecnet.rsim.berlin

- **Summary**: Color-guided depth super-resolution (DSR) is an encouraging paradigm that enhances a low-resolution (LR) depth map guided by an extra high-resolution (HR) RGB image from the same scene. Existing methods usually use interpolation to upscale the depth maps before feeding them into the network and transfer the high-frequency information extracted from HR RGB images to guide the reconstruction of depth maps. However, the extracted high-frequency information usually contains textures that are not present in depth maps in the existence of the cross-modality gap, and the noises would be further aggravated by interpolation due to the resolution gap between the RGB and depth images. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Symmetric Uncertainty-aware Feature Transmission (SUFT) for color-guided DSR. (1) For the resolution gap, SUFT builds an iterative up-and-down sampling pipeline, which makes depth features and RGB features spatially consistent while suppressing noise amplification and blurring by replacing common interpolated pre-upsampling. (2) For the cross-modality gap, we propose a novel Symmetric Uncertainty scheme to remove parts of RGB information harmful to the recovery of HR depth maps. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and challenging real-world settings suggest that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Rehearsal-based video incremental learning often employs knowledge distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of previously learned data. However, this method faces two major challenges for video task: substantial computing resources from loading teacher model and limited replay capability from performance-limited teacher model. To address these problems, we first propose a knowledge distillation-free framework for rehearsal-based video incremental learning called \textit{Teacher Agent}. Instead of loading parameter-heavy teacher networks, we introduce an agent generator that is either parameter-free or uses only a few parameters to obtain accurate and reliable soft labels. This method not only greatly reduces the computing requirement but also circumvents the problem of knowledge misleading caused by inaccurate predictions of the teacher model. Moreover, we put forward a self-correction loss which provides an effective regularization signal for the review of old knowledge, which in turn alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Further, to ensure that the samples in the memory buffer are memory-efficient and representative, we introduce a unified sampler for rehearsal-based video incremental learning to mine fixed-length key video frames. Interestingly, based on the proposed strategies, the network exhibits a high level of robustness against spatial resolution reduction when compared to the baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method, yielding significant performance improvements while utilizing only half the spatial resolution of video clips as network inputs in the incremental phases.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in vision backbones have significantly improved their performance by simultaneously modeling images' local and global contexts. However, the bidirectional interaction between these two contexts has not been well explored and exploited, which is important in the human visual system. This paper proposes a Fully Adaptive Self-Attention (FASA) mechanism for vision transformer to model the local and global information as well as the bidirectional interaction between them in context-aware ways. Specifically, FASA employs self-modulated convolutions to adaptively extract local representation while utilizing self-attention in down-sampled space to extract global representation. Subsequently, it conducts a bidirectional adaptation process between local and global representation to model their interaction. In addition, we introduce a fine-grained downsampling strategy to enhance the down-sampled self-attention mechanism for finer-grained global perception capability. Based on FASA, we develop a family of lightweight vision backbones, Fully Adaptive Transformer (FAT) family. Extensive experiments on multiple vision tasks demonstrate that FAT achieves impressive performance. Notably, FAT accomplishes a 77.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K using only 4.5M parameters and 0.7G FLOPs, which surpasses the most advanced ConvNets and Transformers with similar model size and computational costs. Moreover, our model exhibits faster speed on modern GPU compared to other models. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/FAT.

- **Summary**: Despite the huge success of deep convolutional neural networks in face recognition (FR) tasks, current methods lack explainability for their predictions because of their "black-box" nature. In recent years, studies have been carried out to give an interpretation of the decision of a deep FR system. However, the affinity between the input facial image and the extracted deep features has not been explored. This paper contributes to the problem of explainable face recognition by first conceiving a face reconstruction-based explanation module, which reveals the correspondence between the deep feature and the facial regions. To further interpret the decision of an FR model, a novel visual saliency explanation algorithm has been proposed. It provides insightful explanation by producing visual saliency maps that represent similar and dissimilar regions between input faces. A detailed analysis has been presented for the generated visual explanation to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: One tough problem of image inpainting is to restore complex structures in the corrupted regions. It motivates interactive image inpainting which leverages additional hints, e.g., sketches, to assist the inpainting process. Sketch is simple and intuitive to end users, but meanwhile has free forms with much randomness. Such randomness may confuse the inpainting models, and incur severe artifacts in completed images. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage image inpainting method termed SketchRefiner. In the first stage, we propose using a cross-correlation loss function to robustly calibrate and refine the user-provided sketches in a coarse-to-fine fashion. In the second stage, we learn to extract informative features from the abstracted sketches in the feature space and modulate the inpainting process. We also propose an algorithm to simulate real sketches automatically and build a test protocol with different applications. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that SketchRefiner effectively utilizes sketch information and eliminates the artifacts due to the free-form sketches. Our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones both qualitatively and quantitatively, meanwhile revealing great potential in real-world applications. Our code and dataset are available.



### Adapting Pre-trained Language Models to Vision-Language Tasks via Dynamic Visual Prompting

- **Summary**: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have played an increasing role in multimedia research. In terms of vision-language (VL) tasks, they often serve as a language encoder and still require an additional fusion network for VL reasoning, resulting in excessive memory overhead. In this paper, we focus on exploring PLMs as a stand-alone model for VL reasoning tasks. Inspired by the recently popular prompt tuning, we first prove that the processed visual features can be also projected onto the semantic space of PLMs and act as prompt tokens to bridge the gap between single- and multi-modal learning. However, this solution exhibits obvious redundancy in visual information and model inference, and the placement of prompt tokens also greatly affects the final performance. Based on these observations, we further propose a novel transfer learning approach for PLMs, termed Dynamic Visual Prompting (DVP). Concretely, DVP first deploys a cross-attention module to obtain text-related and compact visual prompt tokens, thereby greatly reducing the input length of PLMs. To obtain the optimal placement, we also equip DVP with a reinforcement-learning based search algorithm, which can automatically merge DVP with PLMs for different VL tasks via a very short search process. In addition, we also experiment DVP with the recently popular adapter approach to keep the most parameters of PLMs intact when adapting to VL tasks, helping PLMs achieve a quick shift between single- and multi-modal tasks. We apply DVP to two representative PLMs, namely BERT and T5, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of VL reasoning benchmarks including VQA2.0, GQA and SNLIVE. The experimental results not only show the advantage of DVP on efficiency and performance, but also confirm its superiority in adapting pre-trained language models to VL tasks.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic and controllable motions for virtual characters is a challenging task in computer animation, and its implications extend to games, simulations, and virtual reality. Recent studies have drawn inspiration from the success of diffusion models in image generation, demonstrating the potential for addressing this task. However, the majority of these studies have been limited to offline applications that target at sequence-level generation that generates all steps simultaneously. To enable real-time motion synthesis with diffusion models in response to time-varying control signals, we propose the framework of the Controllable Motion Diffusion Model (COMODO). Our framework begins with an auto-regressive motion diffusion model (A-MDM), which generates motion sequences step by step. In this way, simply using the standard DDPM algorithm without any additional complexity, our framework is able to generate high-fidelity motion sequences over extended periods with different types of control signals. Then, we propose our reinforcement learning-based controller and controlling strategies on top of the A-MDM model, so that our framework can steer the motion synthesis process across multiple tasks, including target reaching, joystick-based control, goal-oriented control, and trajectory following. The proposed framework enables the real-time generation of diverse motions that react adaptively to user commands on-the-fly, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. Besides, it is compatible with the inpainting-based editing methods and can predict much more diverse motions without additional fine-tuning of the basic motion generation models. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in performing various tasks and compare its performance against state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We investigate knowledge retrieval with multi-modal queries, i.e. queries containing information split across image and text inputs, a challenging task that differs from previous work on cross-modal retrieval. We curate a new dataset called ReMuQ for benchmarking progress on this task. ReMuQ requires a system to retrieve knowledge from a large corpus by integrating contents from both text and image queries. We introduce a retriever model ``ReViz'' that can directly process input text and images to retrieve relevant knowledge in an end-to-end fashion without being dependent on intermediate modules such as object detectors or caption generators. We introduce a new pretraining task that is effective for learning knowledge retrieval with multimodal queries and also improves performance on downstream tasks. We demonstrate superior performance in retrieval on two datasets (ReMuQ and OK-VQA) under zero-shot settings as well as further improvements when finetuned on these datasets.

- **Summary**: Continual learning (CL) is an important technique to allow artificial neural networks to work in open environments. CL enables a system to learn new tasks without severe interference to its performance on old tasks, i.e., overcome the problems of catastrophic forgetting. In joint learning, it is well known that the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem caused by intentional attacks or environmental perturbations will severely impair the ability of networks to generalize. In this work, we reported a special form of catastrophic forgetting raised by the OOD problem in continual learning settings, and we named it out-of-distribution forgetting (OODF). In continual image classification tasks, we found that for a given category, introducing an intra-class distribution shift significantly impaired the recognition accuracy of CL methods for that category during subsequent learning. Interestingly, this phenomenon is special for CL as the same level of distribution shift had only negligible effects in the joint learning scenario. We verified that CL methods without dedicating subnetworks for individual tasks are all vulnerable to OODF. Moreover, OODF does not depend on any specific way of shifting the distribution, suggesting it is a risk for CL in a wide range of circumstances. Taken together, our work identified an under-attended risk during CL, highlighting the importance of developing approaches that can overcome OODF.

- **Summary**: Underwater object detection (UOD) is crucial for marine economic development, environmental protection, and the planet's sustainable development. The main challenges of this task arise from low-contrast, small objects, and mimicry of aquatic organisms. The key to addressing these challenges is to focus the model on obtaining more discriminative information. We observe that the edges of underwater objects are highly unique and can be distinguished from low-contrast or mimicry environments based on their edges. Motivated by this observation, we propose an Edge-guided Representation Learning Network, termed ERL-Net, that aims to achieve discriminative representation learning and aggregation under the guidance of edge cues. Firstly, we introduce an edge-guided attention module to model the explicit boundary information, which generates more discriminative features. Secondly, a feature aggregation module is proposed to aggregate the multi-scale discriminative features by regrouping them into three levels, effectively aggregating global and local information for locating and recognizing underwater objects. Finally, we propose a wide and asymmetric receptive field block to enable features to have a wider receptive field, allowing the model to focus on more small object information. Comprehensive experiments on three challenging underwater datasets show that our method achieves superior performance on the UOD task.

- **Summary**: In recent years, "U-shaped" neural networks featuring encoder and decoder structures have gained popularity in the field of medical image segmentation. Various variants of this model have been developed. Nevertheless, the evaluation of these models has received less attention compared to model development. In response, we propose a comprehensive method for evaluating medical image segmentation models for multi-indicator and multi-organ (named MIMO). MIMO allows models to generate independent thresholds which are then combined with multi-indicator evaluation and confidence estimation to screen and measure each organ. As a result, MIMO offers detailed information on the segmentation of each organ in each sample, thereby aiding developers in analyzing and improving the model. Additionally, MIMO can produce concise usability and comprehensiveness scores for different models. Models with higher scores are deemed to be excellent models, which is convenient for clinical evaluation. Our research tests eight different medical image segmentation models on two abdominal multi-organ datasets and evaluates them from four perspectives: correctness, confidence estimation, Usable Region and MIMO. Furthermore, robustness experiments are tested. Experimental results demonstrate that MIMO offers novel insights into multi-indicator and multi-organ medical image evaluation and provides a specific and concise measure for the usability and comprehensiveness of the model.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision that involves segmenting images into semantically meaningful regions at the pixel level. However, existing approaches often rely on expensive human annotations as supervision for model training, limiting their scalability to large, unlabeled datasets. To address this challenge, we present ZeroSeg, a novel method that leverages the existing pretrained vision-language (VL) model (e.g. CLIP) to train open-vocabulary zero-shot semantic segmentation models. Although acquired extensive knowledge of visual concepts, it is non-trivial to exploit knowledge from these VL models to the task of semantic segmentation, as they are usually trained at an image level. ZeroSeg overcomes this by distilling the visual concepts learned by VL models into a set of segment tokens, each summarizing a localized region of the target image. We evaluate ZeroSeg on multiple popular segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, in a zero-shot manner (i.e., no training or adaption on target segmentation datasets). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared to other zero-shot segmentation methods under the same training data, while also performing competitively compared to strongly supervised methods. Finally, we also demonstrated the effectiveness of ZeroSeg on open-vocabulary segmentation, through both human studies and qualitative visualizations.

- **Summary**: Fully-supervised polyp segmentation has accomplished significant triumphs over the years in advancing the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, label-efficient solutions from weak supervision like scribbles are rarely explored yet primarily meaningful and demanding in medical practice due to the expensiveness and scarcity of densely-annotated polyp data. Besides, various deployment issues, including data shifts and corruption, put forward further requests for model generalization and robustness. To address these concerns, we design a framework of Spatial-Spectral Dual-branch Mutual Teaching and Entropy-guided Pseudo Label Ensemble Learning (S$^2$ME). Concretely, for the first time in weakly-supervised medical image segmentation, we promote the dual-branch co-teaching framework by leveraging the intrinsic complementarity of features extracted from the spatial and spectral domains and encouraging cross-space consistency through collaborative optimization. Furthermore, to produce reliable mixed pseudo labels, which enhance the effectiveness of ensemble learning, we introduce a novel adaptive pixel-wise fusion technique based on the entropy guidance from the spatial and spectral branches. Our strategy efficiently mitigates the deleterious effects of uncertainty and noise present in pseudo labels and surpasses previous alternatives in terms of efficacy. Ultimately, we formulate a holistic optimization objective to learn from the hybrid supervision of scribbles and pseudo labels. Extensive experiments and evaluation on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method regarding in-distribution accuracy, out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness, highlighting its promising clinical significance.

- **Summary**: Structural MRI(S-MRI) is one of the most versatile imaging modality that revolutionized the anatomical study of brain in past decades. The corpus callosum (CC) is the principal white matter fibre tract, enabling all kinds of inter-hemispheric communication. Thus, subtle changes in CC might be associated with various neurological disorders. The present work proposes the potential of YOLOv5-based CC detection framework to differentiate atypical Parkinsonian disorders (PD) from healthy controls (HC). With 3 rounds of hold-out validation, mean classification accuracy of 92% is obtained using the proposed method on a proprietary dataset consisting of 20 healthy subjects and 20 cases of APDs, with an improvement of 5% over SOTA methods (CC morphometry and visual texture analysis) that used the same dataset. Subsequently, in order to incorporate the explainability of YOLO predictions, Eigen CAM based heatmap is generated for identifying the most important sub-region in CC that leads to the classification. The result of Eigen CAM showed CC mid-body as the most distinguishable sub-region in classifying APDs and HC, which is in-line with SOTA methodologies and the current prevalent understanding in medicine.

- **Summary**: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) system offers a user-friendly interface and enables human-computer interaction. However, VQA models commonly face the challenge of language bias, resulting from the learned superficial correlation between questions and answers. To address this issue, in this study, we present a novel framework to reduce the language bias of the VQA for remote sensing data (RSVQA). Specifically, we add an adversarial branch to the original VQA framework. Based on the adversarial branch, we introduce two regularizers to constrain the training process against language bias. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance in terms of language bias, we propose a new metric that combines standard accuracy with the performance drop when incorporating question and random image information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We believe that our method can shed light on future work for reducing language bias on the RSVQA task.

- **Summary**: Deep learning based automatic medical image segmentation models often suffer from domain shift, where the models trained on a source domain do not generalize well to other unseen domains. As a vision foundation model with powerful generalization capabilities, Segment Anything Model (SAM) shows potential for improving the cross-domain robustness of medical image segmentation. However, SAM and its fine-tuned models performed significantly worse in fully automatic mode compared to when given manual prompts. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the degradation in performance was related to the coupling effect of poor prompts and mask segmentation. In fully automatic mode, the presence of inevitable poor prompts (such as points outside the mask or boxes significantly larger than the mask) can significantly mislead mask generation. To address the coupling effect, we propose the decoupling SAM (DeSAM). DeSAM modifies SAM's mask decoder to decouple mask generation and prompt embeddings while leveraging pre-trained weights. We conducted experiments on publicly available prostate cross-site datasets. The results show that DeSAM improves dice score by an average of 8.96% (from 70.06% to 79.02%) compared to previous state-of-the-art domain generalization method. Moreover, DeSAM can be trained on personal devices with entry-level GPU since our approach does not rely on tuning the heavyweight image encoder.

- **Summary**: The field of image generation has made significant progress thanks to the introduction of Diffusion Models, which learn to progressively reverse a given image corruption. Recently, a few studies introduced alternative ways of corrupting images in Diffusion Models, with an emphasis on blurring. However, these studies are purely empirical and it remains unclear what is the optimal procedure for corrupting an image. In this work, we hypothesize that the optimal procedure minimizes the length of the path taken when corrupting an image towards a given final state. We propose the Fisher metric for the path length, measured in the space of probability distributions. We compute the shortest path according to this metric, and we show that it corresponds to a combination of image sharpening, rather than blurring, and noise deblurring. While the corruption was chosen arbitrarily in previous work, our Shortest Path Diffusion (SPD) determines uniquely the entire spatiotemporal structure of the corruption. We show that SPD improves on strong baselines without any hyperparameter tuning, and outperforms all previous Diffusion Models based on image blurring. Furthermore, any small deviation from the shortest path leads to worse performance, suggesting that SPD provides the optimal procedure to corrupt images. Our work sheds new light on observations made in recent works and provides a new approach to improve diffusion models on images and other types of data.

- **Summary**: Without explicit feedback, humans can rapidly learn the meaning of words. Children can acquire a new word after just a few passive exposures, a process known as fast mapping. This word learning capability is believed to be the most fundamental building block of multimodal understanding and reasoning. Despite recent advancements in multimodal learning, a systematic and rigorous evaluation is still missing for human-like word learning in machines. To fill in this gap, we introduce the MachinE Word Learning (MEWL) benchmark to assess how machines learn word meaning in grounded visual scenes. MEWL covers human's core cognitive toolkits in word learning: cross-situational reasoning, bootstrapping, and pragmatic learning. Specifically, MEWL is a few-shot benchmark suite consisting of nine tasks for probing various word learning capabilities. These tasks are carefully designed to be aligned with the children's core abilities in word learning and echo the theories in the developmental literature. By evaluating multimodal and unimodal agents' performance with a comparative analysis of human performance, we notice a sharp divergence in human and machine word learning. We further discuss these differences between humans and machines and call for human-like few-shot word learning in machines.

- **Summary**: We present DiffRoom, a novel framework for tackling the problem of high-quality 3D indoor room reconstruction and generation, both of which are challenging due to the complexity and diversity of the room geometry. Although diffusion-based generative models have previously demonstrated impressive performance in image generation and object-level 3D generation, they have not yet been applied to room-level 3D generation due to their computationally intensive costs. In DiffRoom, we propose a sparse 3D diffusion network that is efficient and possesses strong generative performance for Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF), based on a rough occupancy prior. Inspired by KinectFusion's incremental alignment and fusion of local SDFs, we propose a diffusion-based TSDF fusion approach that iteratively diffuses and fuses TSDFs, facilitating the reconstruction and generation of an entire room environment. Additionally, to ease training, we introduce a curriculum diffusion learning paradigm that speeds up the training convergence process and enables high-quality reconstruction. According to the user study, the mesh quality generated by our DiffRoom can even outperform the ground truth mesh provided by ScanNet.

- **Summary**: The pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm based on layout-aware multimodal pre-trained models has achieved significant progress on document image question answering. However, domain pre-training and task fine-tuning for additional visual, layout, and task modules prevent them from directly utilizing off-the-shelf instruction-tuning language foundation models, which have recently shown promising potential in zero-shot learning. Contrary to aligning language models to the domain of document image question answering, we align document image question answering to off-the-shell instruction-tuning language foundation models to utilize their zero-shot capability. Specifically, we propose layout and task aware instruction prompt called LATIN-Prompt, which consists of layout-aware document content and task-aware descriptions. The former recovers the layout information among text segments from OCR tools by appropriate spaces and line breaks. The latter ensures that the model generates answers that meet the requirements, especially format requirements, through a detailed description of task. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that LATIN-Prompt can improve the zero-shot performance of instruction-tuning language foundation models on document image question answering and help them achieve comparable levels to SOTAs based on the pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm. Quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of LATIN-Prompt. We provide the code in supplementary and will release the code to facilitate future research.

- **Summary**: Purpose: We propose a novel contrastive learning latent space representation for MRI datasets with partially acquired scans. We show that this latent space can be utilized for accelerated MR image reconstruction.   Theory and Methods: Our novel framework, referred to as COLADA (stands for Contrastive Learning for highly accelerated MR image reconstruction), maximizes the mutual information between differently accelerated images of an MRI scan by using self-supervised contrastive learning. In other words, it attempts to "pull" the latent representations of the same scan together and "push" the latent representations of other scans away. The generated MRI latent space is subsequently utilized for MR image reconstruction and the performance was assessed in comparison to several baseline deep learning reconstruction methods. Furthermore, the quality of the proposed latent space representation was analyzed using Alignment and Uniformity.   Results: COLADA comprehensively outperformed other reconstruction methods with robustness to variations in undersampling patterns, pathological abnormalities, and noise in k-space during inference. COLADA proved the high quality of reconstruction on unseen data with minimal fine-tuning. The analysis of representation quality suggests that the contrastive features produced by COLADA are optimally distributed in latent space.   Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize contrastive learning on differently accelerated images for MR image reconstruction. The proposed latent space representation has practical usage due to a large number of existing partially sampled datasets. This implies the possibility of exploring self-supervised contrastive learning further to enhance the latent space of MRI for image reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Driver distraction causes a significant number of traffic accidents every year, resulting in economic losses and casualties. Currently, the level of automation in commercial vehicles is far from completely unmanned, and drivers still play an important role in operating and controlling the vehicle. Therefore, driver distraction behavior detection is crucial for road safety. At present, driver distraction detection primarily relies on traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) and supervised learning methods. However, there are still challenges such as the high cost of labeled datasets, limited ability to capture high-level semantic information, and weak generalization performance. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a new self-supervised learning method based on masked image modeling for driver distraction behavior detection. Firstly, a self-supervised learning framework for masked image modeling (MIM) is introduced to solve the serious human and material consumption issues caused by dataset labeling. Secondly, the Swin Transformer is employed as an encoder. Performance is enhanced by reconfiguring the Swin Transformer block and adjusting the distribution of the number of window multi-head self-attention (W-MSA) and shifted window multi-head self-attention (SW-MSA) detection heads across all stages, which leads to model more lightening. Finally, various data augmentation strategies are used along with the best random masking strategy to strengthen the model's recognition and generalization ability. Test results on a large-scale driver distraction behavior dataset show that the self-supervised learning method proposed in this paper achieves an accuracy of 99.60%, approximating the excellent performance of advanced supervised learning methods.

- **Summary**: Capturing and editing full head performances enables the creation of virtual characters with various applications such as extended reality and media production. The past few years witnessed a steep rise in the photorealism of human head avatars. Such avatars can be controlled through different input data modalities, including RGB, audio, depth, IMUs and others. While these data modalities provide effective means of control, they mostly focus on editing the head movements such as the facial expressions, head pose and/or camera viewpoint. In this paper, we propose AvatarStudio, a text-based method for editing the appearance of a dynamic full head avatar. Our approach builds on existing work to capture dynamic performances of human heads using neural radiance field (NeRF) and edits this representation with a text-to-image diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce an optimization strategy for incorporating multiple keyframes representing different camera viewpoints and time stamps of a video performance into a single diffusion model. Using this personalized diffusion model, we edit the dynamic NeRF by introducing view-and-time-aware Score Distillation Sampling (VT-SDS) following a model-based guidance approach. Our method edits the full head in a canonical space, and then propagates these edits to remaining time steps via a pretrained deformation network. We evaluate our method visually and numerically via a user study, and results show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our experiments validate the design choices of our method and highlight that our edits are genuine, personalized, as well as 3D- and time-consistent.

- **Summary**: Histological staining of tissue biopsies, especially hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, serves as the benchmark for disease diagnosis and comprehensive clinical assessment of tissue. However, the process is laborious and time-consuming, often limiting its usage in crucial applications such as surgical margin assessment. To address these challenges, we combine an emerging 3D quantitative phase imaging technology, termed quantitative oblique back illumination microscopy (qOBM), with an unsupervised generative adversarial network pipeline to map qOBM phase images of unaltered thick tissues (i.e., label- and slide-free) to virtually stained H&E-like (vH&E) images. We demonstrate that the approach achieves high-fidelity conversions to H&E with subcellular detail using fresh tissue specimens from mouse liver, rat gliosarcoma, and human gliomas. We also show that the framework directly enables additional capabilities such as H&E-like contrast for volumetric imaging. The quality and fidelity of the vH&E images are validated using both a neural network classifier trained on real H&E images and tested on virtual H&E images, and a user study with neuropathologists. Given its simple and low-cost embodiment and ability to provide real-time feedback in vivo, this deep learning-enabled qOBM approach could enable new workflows for histopathology with the potential to significantly save time, labor, and costs in cancer screening, detection, treatment guidance, and more.

- **Summary**: Quantifying the dissimilarity between two unstructured 3D point clouds is a challenging task, with existing metrics often relying on measuring the distance between corresponding points that can be either inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel distance metric called Calibrated Local Geometry Distance (CLGD), which computes the difference between the underlying 3D surfaces calibrated and induced by a set of reference points. By associating each reference point with two given point clouds through computing its directional distances to them, the difference in directional distances of an identical reference point characterizes the geometric difference between a typical local region of the two point clouds. Finally, CLGD is obtained by averaging the directional distance differences of all reference points. We evaluate CLGD on various optimization and unsupervised learning-based tasks, including shape reconstruction, rigid registration, scene flow estimation, and feature representation. Extensive experiments show that CLGD achieves significantly higher accuracy under all tasks in a memory and computationally efficient manner, compared with existing metrics. As a generic metric, CLGD has the potential to advance 3D point cloud modeling. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/rsy6318/CLGD.

- **Summary**: Real-world objects perform complex motions that involve multiple independent motion components. For example, while talking, a person continuously changes their expressions, head, and body pose. In this work, we propose a novel method to decompose motion in videos by using a pretrained image GAN model. We discover disentangled motion subspaces in the latent space of widely used style-based GAN models that are semantically meaningful and control a single explainable motion component. The proposed method uses only a few $(\approx10)$ ground truth video sequences to obtain such subspaces. We extensively evaluate the disentanglement properties of motion subspaces on face and car datasets, quantitatively and qualitatively. Further, we present results for multiple downstream tasks such as motion editing, and selective motion transfer, e.g. transferring only facial expressions without training for it.

- **Summary**: Monitoring animal behavior can facilitate conservation efforts by providing key insights into wildlife health, population status, and ecosystem function. Automatic recognition of animals and their behaviors is critical for capitalizing on the large unlabeled datasets generated by modern video devices and for accelerating monitoring efforts at scale. However, the development of automated recognition systems is currently hindered by a lack of appropriately labeled datasets. Existing video datasets 1) do not classify animals according to established biological taxonomies; 2) are too small to facilitate large-scale behavioral studies and are often limited to a single species; and 3) do not feature temporally localized annotations and therefore do not facilitate localization of targeted behaviors within longer video sequences. Thus, we propose MammalNet, a new large-scale animal behavior dataset with taxonomy-guided annotations of mammals and their common behaviors. MammalNet contains over 18K videos totaling 539 hours, which is ~10 times larger than the largest existing animal behavior dataset. It covers 17 orders, 69 families, and 173 mammal categories for animal categorization and captures 12 high-level animal behaviors that received focus in previous animal behavior studies. We establish three benchmarks on MammalNet: standard animal and behavior recognition, compositional low-shot animal and behavior recognition, and behavior detection.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce FMapping, an efficient neural field mapping framework that facilitates the continuous estimation of a colorized point cloud map in real-time dense RGB SLAM. To achieve this challenging goal without depth, a hurdle is how to improve efficiency and reduce the mapping uncertainty of the RGB SLAM system. To this end, we first build up a theoretical analysis by decomposing the SLAM system into tracking and mapping parts, and the mapping uncertainty is explicitly defined within the frame of neural representations. Based on the analysis, we then propose an effective factorization scheme for scene representation and introduce a sliding window strategy to reduce the uncertainty for scene reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage the factorized neural field to decompose uncertainty into a lower-dimensional space, which enhances robustness to noise and improves training efficiency. We then propose the sliding window sampler to reduce uncertainty by incorporating coherent geometric cues from observed frames during map initialization to enhance convergence. Our factorized neural mapping approach enjoys some advantages, such as low memory consumption, more efficient computation, and fast convergence during map initialization. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method can update the map of high-fidelity colorized point clouds around 2 seconds in real time while requiring no customized CUDA kernels. Additionally, it utilizes x20 fewer parameters than the most concise neural implicit mapping of prior methods for SLAM, e.g., iMAP [ 31] and around x1000 fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art approach, e.g., NICE-SLAM [ 42].

- **Summary**: We focus on the weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing task (AVVP), which aims to identify and locate all the events in audio/visual modalities. Previous works only concentrate on video-level overall label denoising across modalities, but overlook the segment-level label noise, where adjacent video segments (i.e., 1-second video clips) may contain different events. However, recognizing events in the segment is challenging because its label could be any combination of events that occur in the video. To address this issue, we consider tackling AVVP from the language perspective, since language could freely describe how various events appear in each segment beyond fixed labels. Specifically, we design language prompts to describe all cases of event appearance for each video. Then, the similarity between language prompts and segments is calculated, where the event of the most similar prompt is regarded as the segment-level label. In addition, to deal with the mislabeled segments, we propose to perform dynamic re-weighting on the unreliable segments to adjust their labels. Experiments show that our simple yet effective approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: The binding problem in human cognition, concerning how the brain represents and connects objects within a fixed network of neural connections, remains a subject of intense debate. Most machine learning efforts addressing this issue in an unsupervised setting have focused on slot-based methods, which may be limiting due to their discrete nature and difficulty to express uncertainty. Recently, the Complex AutoEncoder was proposed as an alternative that learns continuous and distributed object-centric representations. However, it is only applicable to simple toy data. In this paper, we present Rotating Features, a generalization of complex-valued features to higher dimensions, and a new evaluation procedure for extracting objects from distributed representations. Additionally, we show the applicability of our approach to pre-trained features. Together, these advancements enable us to scale distributed object-centric representations from simple toy to real-world data. We believe this work advances a new paradigm for addressing the binding problem in machine learning and has the potential to inspire further innovation in the field.

- **Summary**: It is a long-term vision for Autonomous Driving (AD) community that the perception models can learn from a large-scale point cloud dataset, to obtain unified representations that can achieve promising results on different tasks or benchmarks. Previous works mainly focus on the self-supervised pre-training pipeline, meaning that they perform the pre-training and fine-tuning on the same benchmark, which is difficult to attain the performance scalability and cross-dataset application for the pre-training checkpoint. In this paper, for the first time, we are committed to building a large-scale pre-training point-cloud dataset with diverse data distribution, and meanwhile learning generalizable representations from such a diverse pre-training dataset. We formulate the point-cloud pre-training task as a semi-supervised problem, which leverages the few-shot labeled and massive unlabeled point-cloud data to generate the unified backbone representations that can be directly applied to many baseline models and benchmarks, decoupling the AD-related pre-training process and downstream fine-tuning task. During the period of backbone pre-training, by enhancing the scene- and instance-level distribution diversity and exploiting the backbone's ability to learn from unknown instances, we achieve significant performance gains on a series of downstream perception benchmarks including Waymo, nuScenes, and KITTI, under different baseline models like PV-RCNN++, SECOND, CenterPoint.

- **Summary**: The performance of neural networks in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is highly influenced by the chosen loss (objective) function. The majority of objective functions for neural models can be divided into metric learning and statistical learning. Metric learning approaches require a pair mining strategy that often lacks efficiency, while statistical learning approaches are not generating highly compact features due to their indirect feature optimization. To this end, we propose a novel repeller-attractor loss that falls in the metric learning paradigm, yet directly optimizes for the L2 metric without the need of generating pairs. Our loss is formed of three components. One leading objective ensures that the learned features are attracted to each designated learnable class anchor. The second loss component regulates the anchors and forces them to be separable by a margin, while the third objective ensures that the anchors do not collapse to zero. Furthermore, we develop a more efficient two-stage retrieval system by harnessing the learned class anchors during the first stage of the retrieval process, eliminating the need of comparing the query with every image in the database. We establish a set of four datasets (CIFAR-100, Food-101, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet) and evaluate the proposed objective in the context of few-shot and full-set training on the CBIR task, by using both convolutional and transformer architectures. Compared to existing objective functions, our empirical evidence shows that the proposed objective is generating superior and more consistent results.

- **Summary**: We introduce Wuerstchen, a novel technique for text-to-image synthesis that unites competitive performance with unprecedented cost-effectiveness and ease of training on constrained hardware. Building on recent advancements in machine learning, our approach, which utilizes latent diffusion strategies at strong latent image compression rates, significantly reduces the computational burden, typically associated with state-of-the-art models, while preserving, if not enhancing, the quality of generated images. Wuerstchen achieves notable speed improvements at inference time, thereby rendering real-time applications more viable. One of the key advantages of our method lies in its modest training requirements of only 9,200 GPU hours, slashing the usual costs significantly without compromising the end performance. In a comparison against the state-of-the-art, we found the approach to yield strong competitiveness. This paper opens the door to a new line of research that prioritizes both performance and computational accessibility, hence democratizing the use of sophisticated AI technologies. Through Wuerstchen, we demonstrate a compelling stride forward in the realm of text-to-image synthesis, offering an innovative path to explore in future research.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel multi-temporal urban mapping approach using multi-modal satellite data from the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) missions. In particular, it focuses on the problem of a partly missing optical modality due to clouds. The proposed model utilizes two networks to extract features from each modality separately. In addition, a reconstruction network is utilized to approximate the optical features based on the SAR data in case of a missing optical modality. Our experiments on a multi-temporal urban mapping dataset with Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a multi-modal approach that uses zero values as a replacement for missing optical data, as well as a uni-modal SAR-based approach. Therefore, the proposed method is effective in exploiting multi-modal data, if available, but it also retains its effectiveness in case the optical modality is missing.

- **Summary**: Since distribution shifts are likely to occur during test-time and can drastically decrease the model's performance, online test-time adaptation (TTA) continues to update the model after deployment, leveraging the current test data. Clearly, a method proposed for online TTA has to perform well for all kinds of environmental conditions. By introducing the variable factors 'domain non-stationarity' and 'temporal correlation', we first unfold all practically relevant settings and define the entity as universal TTA. To tackle the problem of universal TTA, we identify and highlight several challenges a self-training based method has to deal with, including: 1) model bias and the occurrence of trivial solutions when performing entropy minimization on varying sequence lengths with and without multiple domain shifts, 2) loss of generalization which exacerbates the adaptation to future domain shifts and the occurrence of catastrophic forgetting, and 3) performance degradation due to shifts in label prior. To prevent the model from becoming biased, we leverage a dataset and model-agnostic certainty and diversity weighting. In order to maintain generalization and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we propose to continually weight-average the source and adapted model. To compensate for disparities in the label prior during test-time, we propose an adaptive additive prior correction scheme. We evaluate our approach, named ROID, on a wide range of settings, datasets, and models, setting new standards in the field of universal TTA.

- **Summary**: Geodesics are essential in many geometry processing applications. However, traditional algorithms for computing geodesic distances and paths on 3D mesh models are often inefficient and slow. This makes them impractical for scenarios that require extensive querying of arbitrary point-to-point geodesics. Although neural implicit representations have emerged as a popular way of representing 3D shape geometries, there is still no research on representing geodesics with deep implicit functions. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first attempt to represent geodesics on 3D mesh models using neural implicit functions. Specifically, we introduce neural geodesic fields (NeuroGFs), which are learned to represent the all-pairs geodesics of a given mesh. By using NeuroGFs, we can efficiently and accurately answer queries of arbitrary point-to-point geodesic distances and paths, overcoming the limitations of traditional algorithms. Evaluations on common 3D models show that NeuroGFs exhibit exceptional performance in solving the single-source all-destination (SSAD) and point-to-point geodesics, and achieve high accuracy consistently. Besides, NeuroGFs also offer the unique advantage of encoding both 3D geometry and geodesics in a unified representation. Moreover, we further extend generalizable learning frameworks of NeuroGFs by adding shape feature encoders, which also show satisfactory performances for unseen shapes and categories.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral target detection is good at finding dim and small objects based on spectral characteristics. However, existing representation-based methods are hindered by the problem of the unknown background dictionary and insufficient utilization of spatial information. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient optimizing approach based on low-rank representation (LRR) and graph Laplacian regularization (GLR). Firstly, to obtain a complete and pure background dictionary, we propose a LRR-based background subspace learning method by jointly mining the low-dimensional structure of all pixels. Secondly, to fully exploit local spatial relationships and capture the underlying geometric structure, a local region-based GLR is employed to estimate the coefficients. Finally, the desired detection map is generated by computing the ratio of representation errors from binary hypothesis testing. The experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of the approach. For reproduction, the accompanying code is available at https://github.com/shendb2022/LRBSL-GLR.

- **Summary**: The recent upsurge in pre-trained large models (e.g. GPT-4) has swept across the entire deep learning community. Such powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced generative ability and multimodal understanding capability, which quickly achieve new state-of-the-art performances on a variety of benchmarks. The pre-trained LLM usually plays the role as a universal AI model that can conduct various tasks, including context reasoning, article analysis and image content comprehension. However, considering the prohibitively high memory and computational cost for implementing such a large model, the conventional models (such as CNN and ViT), are still essential for many visual perception tasks. In this paper, we propose to enhance the representation ability of ordinary vision models for perception tasks (e.g. image classification) by taking advantage of large pre-trained models. We present a new learning paradigm in which the knowledge extracted from large pre-trained models are utilized to help models like CNN and ViT learn enhanced representations and achieve better performance. Firstly, we curate a high quality description set by prompting a multimodal LLM to generate descriptive text for all training images. Furthermore, we feed these detailed descriptions into a pre-trained encoder to extract text embeddings with rich semantic information that encodes the content of images. During training, text embeddings will serve as extra supervising signals and be aligned with image representations learned by vision models. The alignment process helps vision models learn better and achieve higher accuracy with the assistance of pre-trained LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that the proposed algorithm consistently improves the performance for various vision models with heterogeneous architectures.

- **Summary**: Modern Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) learn a mapping from position to volumetric density via proposal network samplers. In contrast to the coarse-to-fine sampling approach with two NeRFs, this offers significant potential for speedups using lower network capacity as the task of mapping spatial coordinates to volumetric density involves no view-dependent effects and is thus much easier to learn. Given that most of the network capacity is utilized to estimate radiance, NeRFs could store valuable density information in their parameters or their deep features. To this end, we take one step back and analyze large, trained ReLU-MLPs used in coarse-to-fine sampling. We find that trained NeRFs, Mip-NeRFs and proposal network samplers map samples with high density to local minima along a ray in activation feature space. We show how these large MLPs can be accelerated by transforming the intermediate activations to a weight estimate, without any modifications to the parameters post-optimization. With our approach, we can reduce the computational requirements of trained NeRFs by up to 50% with only a slight hit in rendering quality and no changes to the training protocol or architecture. We evaluate our approach on a variety of architectures and datasets, showing that our proposition holds in various settings.

- **Summary**: Postoperative complications pose a significant challenge in the healthcare industry, resulting in elevated healthcare expenses and prolonged hospital stays, and in rare instances, patient mortality. To improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs, healthcare providers rely on various perioperative risk scores to guide clinical decisions and prioritize care. In recent years, machine learning techniques have shown promise in predicting postoperative complications and fatality, with deep learning models achieving remarkable success in healthcare applications. However, research on the application of deep learning models to intra-operative anesthesia management data is limited. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of transformer-based models in predicting postoperative acute renal failure, postoperative pulmonary complications, and postoperative in-hospital mortality. We compare our method's performance with state-of-the-art tabular data prediction models, including gradient boosting trees and sequential attention models, on a clinical dataset. Our results demonstrate that transformer-based models can achieve superior performance in predicting postoperative complications and outperform traditional machine learning models. This work highlights the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically transformer-based models, in revolutionizing the healthcare industry's approach to postoperative care.

- **Summary**: The detection of flooded areas using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a critical task with applications in crisis and disaster management, as well as environmental resource planning. However, the complex nature of SAR images presents a challenge that often leads to an overestimation of the flood extent. To address this issue, we propose a novel differential attention metric-based network (DAM-Net) in this study. The DAM-Net comprises two key components: a weight-sharing Siamese backbone to obtain multi-scale change features of multi-temporal images and tokens containing high-level semantic information of water-body changes, and a temporal differential fusion (TDF) module that integrates semantic tokens and change features to generate flood maps with reduced speckle noise. Specifically, the backbone is split into multiple stages. In each stage, we design three modules, namely, temporal-wise feature extraction (TWFE), cross-temporal change attention (CTCA), and temporal-aware change enhancement (TACE), to effectively extract the change features. In TACE of the last stage, we introduce a class token to record high-level semantic information of water-body changes via the attention mechanism. Another challenge faced by data-driven deep learning algorithms is the limited availability of flood detection datasets. To overcome this, we have created the S1GFloods open-source dataset, a global-scale high-resolution Sentinel-1 SAR image pairs dataset covering 46 global flood events between 2015 and 2022. The experiments on the S1GFloods dataset using the proposed DAM-Net showed top results compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall accuracy, F1-score, and IoU, which reached 97.8%, 96.5%, and 93.2%, respectively. Our dataset and code will be available online at https://github.com/Tamer-Saleh/S1GFlood-Detection.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based Generative Models (DGMs) have achieved unparalleled performance in synthesizing high-quality visual content, opening up the opportunity to improve image super-resolution (SR) tasks. Recent solutions for these tasks often train architecture-specific DGMs from scratch, or require iterative fine-tuning and distillation on pre-trained DGMs, both of which take considerable time and hardware investments. More seriously, since the DGMs are established with a discrete pre-defined upsampling scale, they cannot well match the emerging requirements of arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR), where a unified model adapts to arbitrary upsampling scales, instead of preparing a series of distinct models for each case. These limitations beg an intriguing question: can we identify the ASSR capability of existing pre-trained DGMs without the need for distillation or fine-tuning? In this paper, we take a step towards resolving this matter by proposing Diff-SR, a first ASSR attempt based solely on pre-trained DGMs, without additional training efforts. It is motivated by an exciting finding that a simple methodology, which first injects a specific amount of noise into the low-resolution images before invoking a DGM's backward diffusion process, outperforms current leading solutions. The key insight is determining a suitable amount of noise to inject, i.e., small amounts lead to poor low-level fidelity, while over-large amounts degrade the high-level signature. Through a finely-grained theoretical analysis, we propose the Perceptual Recoverable Field (PRF), a metric that achieves the optimal trade-off between these two factors. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness, flexibility, and adaptability of Diff-SR, demonstrating superior performance to state-of-the-art solutions under diverse ASSR environments.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image models are trained on extensive amounts of data, leading them to implicitly encode factual knowledge within their parameters. While some facts are useful, others may be incorrect or become outdated (e.g., the current President of the United States). We introduce ReFACT, a novel approach for editing factual knowledge in text-to-image generative models. ReFACT updates the weights of a specific layer in the text encoder, only modifying a tiny portion of the model's parameters, and leaving the rest of the model unaffected. We empirically evaluate ReFACT on an existing benchmark, alongside RoAD, a newly curated dataset. ReFACT achieves superior performance in terms of generalization to related concepts while preserving unrelated concepts. Furthermore, ReFACT maintains image generation quality, making it a valuable tool for updating and correcting factual information in text-to-image models.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new robust loss function, the T-Loss, for medical image segmentation. The proposed loss is based on the negative log-likelihood of the Student-t distribution and can effectively handle outliers in the data by controlling its sensitivity with a single parameter. This parameter is updated during the backpropagation process, eliminating the need for additional computation or prior information about the level and spread of noisy labels. Our experiments show that the T-Loss outperforms traditional loss functions in terms of dice scores on two public medical datasets for skin lesion and lung segmentation. We also demonstrate the ability of T-Loss to handle different types of simulated label noise, resembling human error. Our results provide strong evidence that the T-Loss is a promising alternative for medical image segmentation where high levels of noise or outliers in the dataset are a typical phenomenon in practice.

- **Summary**: Visual question answering (VQA) methods in remote sensing (RS) aim to answer natural language questions with respect to an RS image. Most of the existing methods require a large amount of computational resources, which limits their application in operational scenarios in RS. To address this issue, in this paper we present an effective lightweight transformer-based VQA in RS (LiT-4-RSVQA) architecture for efficient and accurate VQA in RS. Our architecture consists of: i) a lightweight text encoder module; ii) a lightweight image encoder module; iii) a fusion module; and iv) a classification module. The experimental results obtained on a VQA benchmark dataset demonstrate that our proposed LiT-4-RSVQA architecture provides accurate VQA results while significantly reducing the computational requirements on the executing hardware.

- **Summary**: We study domain-adaptive image synthesis, the problem of teaching pretrained image generative models a new style or concept from as few as one image to synthesize novel images, to better understand the compositional image synthesis. We present a framework that leverages a pretrained class-conditional generation model and visual prompt tuning. Specifically, we propose a novel source class distilled visual prompt that learns disentangled prompts of semantic (e.g., class) and domain (e.g., style) from a few images. Learned domain prompt is then used to synthesize images of any classes in the style of target domain. We conduct studies on various target domains with the number of images ranging from one to a few to many, and show qualitative results which show the compositional generalization of our method. Moreover, we show that our method can help improve zero-shot domain adaptation classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: The intimate entanglement between objects affordances and human poses is of large interest, among others, for behavioural sciences, cognitive psychology, and Computer Vision communities. In recent years, the latter has developed several object-centric approaches: starting from items, learning pipelines synthesizing human poses and dynamics in a realistic way, satisfying both geometrical and functional expectations. However, the inverse perspective is significantly less explored: Can we infer 3D objects and their poses from human interactions alone? Our investigation follows this direction, showing that a generic 3D human point cloud is enough to pop up an unobserved object, even when the user is just imitating a functionality (e.g., looking through a binocular) without involving a tangible counterpart. We validate our method qualitatively and quantitatively, with synthetic data and sequences acquired for the task, showing applicability for XR/VR.

- **Summary**: The ability to create high-quality 3D faces from a single image has become increasingly important with wide applications in video conferencing, AR/VR, and advanced video editing in movie industries. In this paper, we propose Face Diffusion NeRF (FDNeRF), a new generative method to reconstruct high-quality Face NeRFs from single images, complete with semantic editing and relighting capabilities. FDNeRF utilizes high-resolution 3D GAN inversion and expertly trained 2D latent-diffusion model, allowing users to manipulate and construct Face NeRFs in zero-shot learning without the need for explicit 3D data. With carefully designed illumination and identity preserving loss, as well as multi-modal pre-training, FD-NeRF offers users unparalleled control over the editing process enabling them to create and edit face NeRFs using just single-view images, text prompts, and explicit target lighting. The advanced features of FDNeRF have been designed to produce more impressive results than existing 2D editing approaches that rely on 2D segmentation maps for editable attributes. Experiments show that our FDNeRF achieves exceptionally realistic results and unprecedented flexibility in editing compared with state-of-the-art 3D face reconstruction and editing methods.

- **Summary**: The development of federated learning (FL) methods, which aim to learn from distributed databases (i.e., clients) without accessing data on clients, has recently attracted great attention. Most of these methods assume that the clients are associated with the same data modality. However, remote sensing (RS) images in different clients can be associated with different data modalities that can improve the classification performance when jointly used. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce a novel multi-modal FL framework that aims to learn from decentralized multi-modal RS image archives for RS image classification problems. The proposed framework is made up of three modules: 1) multi-modal fusion (MF); 2) feature whitening (FW); and 3) mutual information maximization (MIM). The MF module performs iterative model averaging to learn without accessing data on clients in the case that clients are associated with different data modalities. The FW module aligns the representations learned among the different clients. The MIM module maximizes the similarity of images from different modalities. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to iterative model averaging, which is a widely used algorithm in FL. The code of the proposed framework is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/MM-FL.

- **Summary**: The generative modeling landscape has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, particularly in generating natural images and art. Recent techniques have shown impressive potential in creating complex visual compositions while delivering impressive realism and quality. However, state-of-the-art methods have been focusing on the narrow domain of natural images, while other distributions remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the problem of text-to-figure generation, that is creating scientific figures of papers from text descriptions. We present FigGen, a diffusion-based approach for text-to-figure as well as the main challenges of the proposed task. Code and models are available at https://github.com/joanrod/figure-diffusion

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language pre-training have enabled machines to perform better in multimodal object discrimination (e.g., image-text semantic alignment) and image synthesis (e.g., text-to-image generation). On the other hand, fine-tuning pre-trained models with discriminative or generative capabilities such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion on domain-specific datasets has shown to be effective in various tasks by adapting to specific domains. However, few studies have explored the possibility of learning both discriminative and generative capabilities and leveraging their synergistic effects to create a powerful and personalized multimodal model during fine-tuning. This paper presents UniDiff, a unified multi-modal model that integrates image-text contrastive learning (ITC), text-conditioned image synthesis learning (IS), and reciprocal semantic consistency modeling (RSC). UniDiff effectively learns aligned semantics and mitigates the issue of semantic collapse during fine-tuning on small datasets by leveraging RSC on visual features from CLIP and diffusion models, without altering the pre-trained model's basic architecture. UniDiff demonstrates versatility in both multi-modal understanding and generative tasks. Experimental results on three datasets (Fashion-man, Fashion-woman, and E-commercial Product) showcase substantial enhancements in vision-language retrieval and text-to-image generation, illustrating the advantages of combining discriminative and generative fine-tuning. The proposed UniDiff model establishes a robust pipeline for personalized modeling and serves as a benchmark for future comparisons in the field.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be manipulated to exhibit specific behaviors when exposed to specific trigger patterns, without affecting their performance on normal samples. This type of attack is known as a backdoor attack. Recent research has focused on designing invisible triggers for backdoor attacks to ensure visual stealthiness. These triggers have demonstrated strong attack performance even under backdoor defense, which aims to eliminate or suppress the backdoor effect in the model. However, through experimental observations, we have noticed that these carefully designed invisible triggers are often susceptible to visual distortion during inference, such as Gaussian blurring or environmental variations in real-world scenarios. This phenomenon significantly undermines the effectiveness of attacks in practical applications. Unfortunately, this issue has not received sufficient attention and has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called the Visible, Semantic, Sample-Specific, and Compatible trigger (VSSC-trigger), which leverages a recent powerful image method known as the stable diffusion model. In this approach, a text trigger is utilized as a prompt and combined with a benign image. The resulting combination is then processed by a pre-trained stable diffusion model, generating a corresponding semantic object. This object is seamlessly integrated with the original image, resulting in a new realistic image, referred to as the poisoned image. Extensive experimental results and analysis validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed attack method, even in the presence of visual distortion. We believe that the new trigger proposed in this work, along with the proposed idea to address the aforementioned issues, will have significant prospective implications for further advancements in this direction.

- **Summary**: Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS) is a recently proposed variation of the dilated convolution in which the spacings between the non-zero elements in the kernel, or equivalently their positions, are learnable. Non-integer positions are handled via interpolation. Thanks to this trick, positions have well-defined gradients. The original DCLS used bilinear interpolation, and thus only considered the four nearest pixels. Yet here we show that longer range interpolations, and in particular a Gaussian interpolation, allow improving performance on ImageNet1k classification on two state-of-the-art convolutional architectures (ConvNeXt and Conv\-Former), without increasing the number of parameters. The method code is based on PyTorch and is available at https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/Dilated-Convolution-with-Learnable-Spacings-PyTorch

- **Summary**: To cope with the high requirements during the computation of semantic segmentations of earth observation imagery, current state-of-the-art pipelines divide the corresponding data into smaller images. Existing methods and benchmark datasets oftentimes rely on pixel-based tiling schemes or on geo-tiling schemes employed by web mapping applications. The selection of subimages (comprising size, location and orientation) is crucial. It affects the available context information of each pixel, defines the number of tiles during training, and influences the degree of information degradation while down- and up-sampling the tile contents to the size required by the segmentation model. We propose a new segmentation pipeline for earth observation imagery relying on a tiling scheme that creates geo-tiles based on the geo-information of the raster data. This approach exhibits several beneficial properties compared to pixel-based or common web mapping approaches. The proposed tiling scheme shows flexible customization properties regarding tile granularity, tile stride and image boundary alignment. This allows us to perform a tile specific data augmentation during training and a substitution of pixel predictions with limited context information using data of overlapping tiles during inference. The generated tiles show a consistent spatial tile extent w.r.t. heterogeneous sensors, varying recording distances and different latitudes. We demonstrate how the proposed tiling system allows to improve the results of current state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models. To foster future research we make the source code publicly available.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is the problem of identifying inputs which are unrelated to the in-distribution task. The OOD detection performance when the in-distribution (ID) is ImageNet-1K is commonly being tested on a small range of test OOD datasets. We find that most of the currently used test OOD datasets, including datasets from the open set recognition (OSR) literature, have severe issues: In some cases more than 50$\%$ of the dataset contains objects belonging to one of the ID classes. These erroneous samples heavily distort the evaluation of OOD detectors. As a solution, we introduce with NINCO a novel test OOD dataset, each sample checked to be ID free, which with its fine-grained range of OOD classes allows for a detailed analysis of an OOD detector's strengths and failure modes, particularly when paired with a number of synthetic "OOD unit-tests". We provide detailed evaluations across a large set of architectures and OOD detection methods on NINCO and the unit-tests, revealing new insights about model weaknesses and the effects of pretraining on OOD detection performance. We provide code and data at https://github.com/j-cb/NINCO.

- **Summary**: Event cameras differ from conventional RGB cameras in that they produce asynchronous data sequences. While RGB cameras capture every frame at a fixed rate, event cameras only capture changes in the scene, resulting in sparse and asynchronous data output. Despite the fact that event data carries useful information that can be utilized in motion deblurring of RGB cameras, integrating event and image information remains a challenge. Recent state-of-the-art CNN-based deblurring solutions produce multiple 2-D event frames based on the accumulation of event data over a time period. In most of these techniques, however, the number of event frames is fixed and predefined, which reduces temporal resolution drastically, particularly for scenarios when fast-moving objects are present or when longer exposure times are required. It is also important to note that recent modern cameras (e.g., cameras in mobile phones) dynamically set the exposure time of the image, which presents an additional problem for networks developed for a fixed number of event frames. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based event feature extraction module has been developed for addressing these challenges, which enables us to use a dynamically varying number of event frames. Using these modules, we constructed a state-of-the-art deblurring network, Deformable Convolutions and LSTM-based Flexible Event Frame Fusion Network (DLEFNet). It is particularly useful for scenarios in which exposure times vary depending on factors such as lighting conditions or the presence of fast-moving objects in the scene. It has been demonstrated through evaluation results that the proposed method can outperform the existing state-of-the-art networks for deblurring task in synthetic and real-world data sets.

- **Summary**: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a widely used imaging modality, but requires long scanning times to acquire high resolution datasets. By leveraging the unique geometry present within this domain, we present a novel approach to dMRI angular super-resolution that extends upon the parametric continuous convolution (PCConv) framework. We introduce several additions to the operation including a Fourier feature mapping, global coordinates, and domain specific context. Using this framework, we build a fully parametric continuous convolution network (PCCNN) and compare against existing models. We demonstrate the PCCNN performs competitively while using significantly less parameters. Moreover, we show that this formulation generalises well to clinically relevant downstream analyses such as fixel-based analysis, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging.

- **Summary**: Sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and sexual violence are prevalent problems in this day and age. Women's safety is an important issue that needs to be highlighted and addressed. Given this issue, we have studied each of these concerns and the factors that affect it based on images generated from movies. We have classified the three terms (harassment, abuse, and violence) based on the visual attributes present in images depicting these situations. We identified that factors such as facial expression of the victim and perpetrator and unwanted touching had a direct link to identifying the scenes containing sexual harassment, abuse and violence. We also studied and outlined how state-of-the-art explicit content detectors such as Google Cloud Vision API and Clarifai API fail to identify and categorise these images. Based on these definitions and characteristics, we have developed a first-of-its-kind dataset from various Indian movie scenes. These scenes are classified as sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual violence and exported in the PASCAL VOC 1.1 format. Our dataset is annotated on the identified relevant features and can be used to develop and train a deep-learning computer vision model to identify these issues. The dataset is publicly available for research and development.



### DeepFake-Adapter: Dual-Level Adapter for DeepFake Detection

- **Summary**: Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize well to unseen or degraded samples, which can be attributed to the over-fitting of low-level forgery patterns. Here we argue that high-level semantics are also indispensable recipes for generalizable forgery detection. Recently, large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown promising generalization capability. In this paper, we propose the first parameter-efficient tuning approach for deepfake detection, namely DeepFake-Adapter, to effectively and efficiently adapt the generalizable high-level semantics from large pre-trained ViTs to aid deepfake detection. Given large pre-trained models but limited deepfake data, DeepFake-Adapter introduces lightweight yet dedicated dual-level adapter modules to a ViT while keeping the model backbone frozen. Specifically, to guide the adaptation process to be aware of both global and local forgery cues of deepfake data, 1) we not only insert Globally-aware Bottleneck Adapters in parallel to MLP layers of ViT, 2) but also actively cross-attend Locally-aware Spatial Adapters with features from ViT. Unlike existing deepfake detection methods merely focusing on low-level forgery patterns, the forgery detection process of our model can be regularized by generalizable high-level semantics from a pre-trained ViT and adapted by global and local low-level forgeries of deepfake data. Extensive experiments on several standard deepfake detection benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, DeepFake-Adapter demonstrates a convincing advantage under cross-dataset and cross-manipulation settings. The source code is released at https://github.com/rshaojimmy/DeepFake-Adapter

- **Summary**: During the diagnostic process, clinicians leverage multimodal information, such as chief complaints, medical images, and laboratory-test results. Deep-learning models for aiding diagnosis have yet to meet this requirement. Here we report a Transformer-based representation-learning model as a clinical diagnostic aid that processes multimodal input in a unified manner. Rather than learning modality-specific features, the model uses embedding layers to convert images and unstructured and structured text into visual tokens and text tokens, and bidirectional blocks with intramodal and intermodal attention to learn a holistic representation of radiographs, the unstructured chief complaint and clinical history, structured clinical information such as laboratory-test results and patient demographic information. The unified model outperformed an image-only model and non-unified multimodal diagnosis models in the identification of pulmonary diseases (by 12% and 9%, respectively) and in the prediction of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (by 29% and 7%, respectively). Leveraging unified multimodal Transformer-based models may help streamline triage of patients and facilitate the clinical decision process.

- **Summary**: Precise estimation of predictive uncertainty in deep neural networks is a critical requirement for reliable decision-making in machine learning and statistical modeling, particularly in the context of medical AI. Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a promising framework for representing the model uncertainty by providing well-calibrated confidence levels for individual predictions. However, the quantification of model uncertainty in conformal prediction remains an active research area, yet to be fully addressed. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art CP methodologies and their theoretical foundations. We propose a probabilistic approach in quantifying the model uncertainty derived from the produced prediction sets in conformal prediction and provide certified boundaries for the computed uncertainty. By doing so, we allow model uncertainty measured by CP to be compared by other uncertainty quantification methods such as Bayesian (e.g., MC-Dropout and DeepEnsemble) and Evidential approaches.

- **Summary**: Conversational generative AI has demonstrated remarkable promise for empowering biomedical practitioners, but current investigations focus on unimodal text. Multimodal conversational AI has seen rapid progress by leveraging billions of image-text pairs from the public web, but such general-domain vision-language models still lack sophistication in understanding and conversing about biomedical images. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient approach for training a vision-language conversational assistant that can answer open-ended research questions of biomedical images. The key idea is to leverage a large-scale, broad-coverage biomedical figure-caption dataset extracted from PubMed Central, use GPT-4 to self-instruct open-ended instruction-following data from the captions, and then fine-tune a large general-domain vision-language model using a novel curriculum learning method. Specifically, the model first learns to align biomedical vocabulary using the figure-caption pairs as is, then learns to master open-ended conversational semantics using GPT-4 generated instruction-following data, broadly mimicking how a layperson gradually acquires biomedical knowledge. This enables us to train a Large Language and Vision Assistant for BioMedicine (LLaVA-Med) in less than 15 hours (with eight A100s). LLaVA-Med exhibits excellent multimodal conversational capability and can follow open-ended instruction to assist with inquiries about a biomedical image. On three standard biomedical visual question answering datasets, LLaVA-Med outperforms previous supervised state-of-the-art on certain metrics. To facilitate biomedical multimodal research, we will release our instruction-following data and the LLaVA-Med model.

- **Summary**: Existing object pose estimation methods commonly require a one-to-one point matching step that forces them to be separated into two consecutive stages: visual correspondence detection (e.g., by matching feature descriptors as part of a perception front-end) followed by geometric alignment (e.g., by optimizing a robust estimation objective for pointcloud registration or perspective-n-point). Instead, we propose a matching-free probabilistic formulation with two main benefits: i) it enables unified and concurrent optimization of both visual correspondence and geometric alignment, and ii) it can represent different plausible modes of the entire distribution of likely poses. This in turn allows for a more graceful treatment of geometric perception scenarios where establishing one-to-one matches between points is conceptually ill-defined, such as textureless, symmetrical and/or occluded objects and scenes where the correct pose is uncertain or there are multiple equally valid solutions.

- **Summary**: Warning: This paper contains several contents that may be toxic, harmful, or offensive.   In the last few years, text-to-image generative models have gained remarkable success in generating images with unprecedented quality accompanied by a breakthrough of inference speed. Despite their rapid progress, human biases that manifest in the training examples, particularly with regard to common stereotypical biases, like gender and skin tone, still have been found in these generative models. In this work, we seek to measure more complex human biases exist in the task of text-to-image generations. Inspired by the well-known Implicit Association Test (IAT) from social psychology, we propose a novel Text-to-Image Association Test (T2IAT) framework that quantifies the implicit stereotypes between concepts and valence, and those in the images. We replicate the previously documented bias tests on generative models, including morally neutral tests on flowers and insects as well as demographic stereotypical tests on diverse social attributes. The results of these experiments demonstrate the presence of complex stereotypical behaviors in image generations.

- **Summary**: Compressive sensing (CS) reconstructs images from sub-Nyquist measurements by solving a sparsity-regularized inverse problem. Traditional CS solvers use iterative optimizers with hand crafted sparsifiers, while early data-driven methods directly learn an inverse mapping from the low-dimensional measurement space to the original image space. The latter outperforms the former, but is restrictive to a pre-defined measurement domain. More recent, deep unrolling methods combine traditional proximal gradient methods and data-driven approaches to iteratively refine an image approximation. To achieve higher accuracy, it has also been suggested to learn both the sampling matrix, and the choice of measurement vectors adaptively. Contrary to the current trend, in this work we hypothesize that a general inverse mapping from a random set of compressed measurements to the image domain exists for a given measurement basis, and can be learned. Such a model is single-shot, non-restrictive and does not parametrize the sampling process. To this end, we propose MOSAIC, a novel compressive sensing framework to reconstruct images given any random selection of measurements, sampled using a fixed basis. Motivated by the uneven distribution of information across measurements, MOSAIC incorporates an embedding technique to efficiently apply attention mechanisms on an encoded sequence of measurements, while dispensing the need to use unrolled deep networks. A range of experiments validate our proposed architecture as a promising alternative for existing CS reconstruction methods, by achieving the state-of-the-art for metrics of reconstruction accuracy on standard datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep generative models have shown impressive results in generating realistic images of faces. GANs managed to generate high-quality, high-fidelity images when conditioned on semantic masks, but they still lack the ability to diversify their output. Diffusion models partially solve this problem and are able to generate diverse samples given the same condition. In this paper, we propose a multi-conditioning approach for diffusion models via cross-attention exploiting both attributes and semantic masks to generate high-quality and controllable face images. We also studied the impact of applying perceptual-focused loss weighting into the latent space instead of the pixel space. Our method extends the previous approaches by introducing conditioning on more than one set of features, guaranteeing a more fine-grained control over the generated face images. We evaluate our approach on the CelebA-HQ dataset, and we show that it can generate realistic and diverse samples while allowing for fine-grained control over multiple attributes and semantic regions. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to evaluate the impact of different conditioning strategies on the quality and diversity of the generated images.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large vision-language models have revolutionized the image classification paradigm. Despite showing impressive zero-shot capabilities, a pre-defined set of categories, a.k.a. the vocabulary, is assumed at test time for composing the textual prompts. However, such assumption can be impractical when the semantic context is unknown and evolving. We thus formalize a novel task, termed as Vocabulary-free Image Classification (VIC), where we aim to assign to an input image a class that resides in an unconstrained language-induced semantic space, without the prerequisite of a known vocabulary. VIC is a challenging task as the semantic space is extremely large, containing millions of concepts, with hard-to-discriminate fine-grained categories. In this work, we first empirically verify that representing this semantic space by means of an external vision-language database is the most effective way to obtain semantically relevant content for classifying the image. We then propose Category Search from External Databases (CaSED), a method that exploits a pre-trained vision-language model and an external vision-language database to address VIC in a training-free manner. CaSED first extracts a set of candidate categories from captions retrieved from the database based on their semantic similarity to the image, and then assigns to the image the best matching candidate category according to the same vision-language model. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate that CaSED outperforms other complex vision-language frameworks, while being efficient with much fewer parameters, paving the way for future research in this direction.

- **Summary**: The cost of data annotation is a substantial impediment for multi-label image classification: in every image, every category must be labeled as present or absent. Single positive multi-label (SPML) learning is a cost-effective solution, where models are trained on a single positive label per image. Thus, SPML is a more challenging domain, since it requires dealing with missing labels. In this work, we propose a method to turn single positive data into fully-labeled data: Pseudo Multi-Labels. Basically, a teacher network is trained on single positive labels. Then, we treat the teacher model's predictions on the training data as ground-truth labels to train a student network on fully-labeled images. With this simple approach, we show that the performance achieved by the student model approaches that of a model trained on the actual fully-labeled images.

- **Summary**: Developing embodied agents in simulation has been a key research topic in recent years. Exciting new tasks, algorithms, and benchmarks have been developed in various simulators. However, most of them assume deaf agents in silent environments, while we humans perceive the world with multiple senses. We introduce Sonicverse, a multisensory simulation platform with integrated audio-visual simulation for training household agents that can both see and hear. Sonicverse models realistic continuous audio rendering in 3D environments in real-time. Together with a new audio-visual VR interface that allows humans to interact with agents with audio, Sonicverse enables a series of embodied AI tasks that need audio-visual perception. For semantic audio-visual navigation in particular, we also propose a new multi-task learning model that achieves state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we demonstrate Sonicverse's realism via sim-to-real transfer, which has not been achieved by other simulators: an agent trained in Sonicverse can successfully perform audio-visual navigation in real-world environments.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Exquisite demand exists for customizing the pretrained large text-to-image model, $\textit{e.g.}$, Stable Diffusion, to generate innovative concepts, such as the users themselves. However, the newly-added concept from previous customization methods often shows weaker combination abilities than the original ones even given several images during training. We thus propose a new personalization method that allows for the seamless integration of a unique individual into the pre-trained diffusion model using just $\textbf{one facial photograph}$ and only $\textbf{1024 learnable parameters}$ under $\textbf{3 minutes}$. So as we can effortlessly generate stunning images of this person in any pose or position, interacting with anyone and doing anything imaginable from text prompts. To achieve this, we first analyze and build a well-defined celeb basis from the embedding space of the pre-trained large text encoder. Then, given one facial photo as the target identity, we generate its own embedding by optimizing the weight of this basis and locking all other parameters. Empowered by the proposed celeb basis, the new identity in our customized model showcases a better concept combination ability than previous personalization methods. Besides, our model can also learn several new identities at once and interact with each other where the previous customization model fails to. The code will be released.



### Second Sight: Using brain-optimized encoding models to align image distributions with human brain activity

- **Summary**: Two recent developments have accelerated progress in image reconstruction from human brain activity: large datasets that offer samples of brain activity in response to many thousands of natural scenes, and the open-sourcing of powerful stochastic image-generators that accept both low- and high-level guidance. Most work in this space has focused on obtaining point estimates of the target image, with the ultimate goal of approximating literal pixel-wise reconstructions of target images from the brain activity patterns they evoke. This emphasis belies the fact that there is always a family of images that are equally compatible with any evoked brain activity pattern, and the fact that many image-generators are inherently stochastic and do not by themselves offer a method for selecting the single best reconstruction from among the samples they generate. We introduce a novel reconstruction procedure (Second Sight) that iteratively refines an image distribution to explicitly maximize the alignment between the predictions of a voxel-wise encoding model and the brain activity patterns evoked by any target image. We show that our process converges on a distribution of high-quality reconstructions by refining both semantic content and low-level image details across iterations. Images sampled from these converged image distributions are competitive with state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Interestingly, the time-to-convergence varies systematically across visual cortex, with earlier visual areas generally taking longer and converging on narrower image distributions, relative to higher-level brain areas. Second Sight thus offers a succinct and novel method for exploring the diversity of representations across visual brain areas.

- **Summary**: Well-formed context aware image captions and tags in enterprise content such as marketing material are critical to ensure their brand presence and content recall. Manual creation and updates to ensure the same is non trivial given the scale and the tedium towards this task. We propose a new unified Vision-Language (VL) model based on the One For All (OFA) model, with a focus on context-assisted image captioning where the caption is generated based on both the image and its context. Our approach aims to overcome the context-independent (image and text are treated independently) nature of the existing approaches. We exploit context by pretraining our model with datasets of three tasks: news image captioning where the news article is the context, contextual visual entailment, and keyword extraction from the context. The second pretraining task is a new VL task, and we construct and release two datasets for the task with 1.1M and 2.2K data instances. Our system achieves state-of-the-art results with an improvement of up to 8.34 CIDEr score on the benchmark news image captioning datasets. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first effort at incorporating contextual information in pretraining the models for the VL tasks.

- **Summary**: Although data diffusion embeddings are ubiquitous in unsupervised learning and have proven to be a viable technique for uncovering the underlying intrinsic geometry of data, diffusion embeddings are inherently limited due to their discrete nature. To this end, we propose neural FIM, a method for computing the Fisher information metric (FIM) from point cloud data - allowing for a continuous manifold model for the data. Neural FIM creates an extensible metric space from discrete point cloud data such that information from the metric can inform us of manifold characteristics such as volume and geodesics. We demonstrate Neural FIM's utility in selecting parameters for the PHATE visualization method as well as its ability to obtain information pertaining to local volume illuminating branching points and cluster centers embeddings of a toy dataset and two single-cell datasets of IPSC reprogramming and PBMCs (immune cells).

- **Summary**: Three challenges limit the progress of robot learning research: robots are expensive (few labs can participate), everyone uses different robots (findings do not generalize across labs), and we lack internet-scale robotics data. We take on these challenges via a new benchmark: Train Offline, Test Online (TOTO). TOTO provides remote users with access to shared robotic hardware for evaluating methods on common tasks and an open-source dataset of these tasks for offline training. Its manipulation task suite requires challenging generalization to unseen objects, positions, and lighting. We present initial results on TOTO comparing five pretrained visual representations and four offline policy learning baselines, remotely contributed by five institutions. The real promise of TOTO, however, lies in the future: we release the benchmark for additional submissions from any user, enabling easy, direct comparison to several methods without the need to obtain hardware or collect data.

- **Summary**: Creating a vivid video from the event or scenario in our imagination is a truly fascinating experience. Recent advancements in text-to-video synthesis have unveiled the potential to achieve this with prompts only. While text is convenient in conveying the overall scene context, it may be insufficient to control precisely. In this paper, we explore customized video generation by utilizing text as context description and motion structure (e.g. frame-wise depth) as concrete guidance. Our method, dubbed Make-Your-Video, involves joint-conditional video generation using a Latent Diffusion Model that is pre-trained for still image synthesis and then promoted for video generation with the introduction of temporal modules. This two-stage learning scheme not only reduces the computing resources required, but also improves the performance by transferring the rich concepts available in image datasets solely into video generation. Moreover, we use a simple yet effective causal attention mask strategy to enable longer video synthesis, which mitigates the potential quality degradation effectively. Experimental results show the superiority of our method over existing baselines, particularly in terms of temporal coherence and fidelity to users' guidance. In addition, our model enables several intriguing applications that demonstrate potential for practical usage.

- **Summary**: Text-based image editing has advanced significantly in recent years. With the rise of diffusion models, image editing via textual instructions has become ubiquitous. Unfortunately, current models lack the ability to customize the quantity of the change per pixel or per image fragment, resorting to changing the entire image in an equal amount, or editing a specific region using a binary mask. In this paper, we suggest a new framework which enables the user to customize the quantity of change for each image fragment, thereby enhancing the flexibility and verbosity of modern diffusion models. Our framework does not require model training or fine-tuning, but instead performs everything at inference time, making it easily applicable to an existing model. We show both qualitatively and quantitatively that our method allows better controllability and can produce results which are unattainable by existing models.

- **Summary**: Text-conditional diffusion models are able to generate high-fidelity images with diverse contents. However, linguistic representations frequently exhibit ambiguous descriptions of the envisioned objective imagery, requiring the incorporation of additional control signals to bolster the efficacy of text-guided diffusion models. In this work, we propose Cocktail, a pipeline to mix various modalities into one embedding, amalgamated with a generalized ControlNet (gControlNet), a controllable normalisation (ControlNorm), and a spatial guidance sampling method, to actualize multi-modal and spatially-refined control for text-conditional diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a hyper-network gControlNet, dedicated to the alignment and infusion of the control signals from disparate modalities into the pre-trained diffusion model. gControlNet is capable of accepting flexible modality signals, encompassing the simultaneous reception of any combination of modality signals, or the supplementary fusion of multiple modality signals. The control signals are then fused and injected into the backbone model according to our proposed ControlNorm. Furthermore, our advanced spatial guidance sampling methodology proficiently incorporates the control signal into the designated region, thereby circumventing the manifestation of undesired objects within the generated image. We demonstrate the results of our method in controlling various modalities, proving high-quality synthesis and fidelity to multiple external signals.

- **Summary**: Understanding and modeling the 3D scene from a single image is a practical problem. A recent advance proposes a panoptic 3D scene reconstruction task that performs both 3D reconstruction and 3D panoptic segmentation from a single image. Although having made substantial progress, recent works only focus on top-down approaches that fill 2D instances into 3D voxels according to estimated depth, which hinders their performance by two ambiguities. (1) instance-channel ambiguity: The variable ids of instances in each scene lead to ambiguity during filling voxel channels with 2D information, confusing the following 3D refinement. (2) voxel-reconstruction ambiguity: 2D-to-3D lifting with estimated single view depth only propagates 2D information onto the surface of 3D regions, leading to ambiguity during the reconstruction of regions behind the frontal view surface. In this paper, we propose BUOL, a Bottom-Up framework with Occupancy-aware Lifting to address the two issues for panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from a single image. For instance-channel ambiguity, a bottom-up framework lifts 2D information to 3D voxels based on deterministic semantic assignments rather than arbitrary instance id assignments. The 3D voxels are then refined and grouped into 3D instances according to the predicted 2D instance centers. For voxel-reconstruction ambiguity, the estimated multi-plane occupancy is leveraged together with depth to fill the whole regions of things and stuff. Our method shows a tremendous performance advantage over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic dataset 3D-Front and real-world dataset Matterport3D.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to generate high-quality, diverse images from a textual concept (e.g., "a doctor", "love"). However, the internal process of mapping text to a rich visual representation remains an enigma. In this work, we tackle the challenge of understanding concept representations in text-to-image models by decomposing an input text prompt into a small set of interpretable elements. This is achieved by learning a pseudo-token that is a sparse weighted combination of tokens from the model's vocabulary, with the objective of reconstructing the images generated for the given concept. Applied over the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion model, this decomposition reveals non-trivial and surprising structures in the representations of concepts. For example, we find that some concepts such as "a president" or "a composer" are dominated by specific instances (e.g., "Obama", "Biden") and their interpolations. Other concepts, such as "happiness" combine associated terms that can be concrete ("family", "laughter") or abstract ("friendship", "emotion"). In addition to peering into the inner workings of Stable Diffusion, our method also enables applications such as single-image decomposition to tokens, bias detection and mitigation, and semantic image manipulation.

- **Summary**: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to generate a segmentation mask for the object described by a given language expression. Existing classic RES datasets and methods commonly support single-target expressions only, i.e., one expression refers to one target object. Multi-target and no-target expressions are not considered. This limits the usage of RES in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), which extends the classic RES to allow expressions to refer to an arbitrary number of target objects. Towards this, we construct the first large-scale GRES dataset called gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions. GRES and gRefCOCO are designed to be well-compatible with RES, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing RES methods on the GRES task. In the experimental study, we find that one of the big challenges of GRES is complex relationship modeling. Based on this, we propose a region-based GRES baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues, and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies. The proposed approach ReLA achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the both newly proposed GRES and classic RES tasks. The proposed gRefCOCO dataset and method are available at https://henghuiding.github.io/GRES.

- **Summary**: Personalized text-to-image generation using diffusion models has recently been proposed and attracted lots of attention. Given a handful of images containing a novel concept (e.g., a unique toy), we aim to tune the generative model to capture fine visual details of the novel concept and generate photorealistic images following a text condition. We present a plug-in method, named ViCo, for fast and lightweight personalized generation. Specifically, we propose an image attention module to condition the diffusion process on the patch-wise visual semantics. We introduce an attention-based object mask that comes almost at no cost from the attention module. In addition, we design a simple regularization based on the intrinsic properties of text-image attention maps to alleviate the common overfitting degradation. Unlike many existing models, our method does not finetune any parameters of the original diffusion model. This allows more flexible and transferable model deployment. With only light parameter training (~6% of the diffusion U-Net), our method achieves comparable or even better performance than all state-of-the-art models both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Generative models have recently exhibited exceptional capabilities in various scenarios, for example, image generation based on text description. In this work, we focus on the task of generating a series of coherent image sequence based on a given storyline, denoted as open-ended visual storytelling. We make the following three contributions: (i) to fulfill the task of visual storytelling, we introduce two modules into a pre-trained stable diffusion model, and construct an auto-regressive image generator, termed as StoryGen, that enables to generate the current frame by conditioning on both a text prompt and a preceding frame; (ii) to train our proposed model, we collect paired image and text samples by sourcing from various online sources, such as videos, E-books, and establish a data processing pipeline for constructing a diverse dataset, named StorySalon, with a far larger vocabulary than existing animation-specific datasets; (iii) we adopt a three-stage curriculum training strategy, that enables style transfer, visual context conditioning, and human feedback alignment, respectively. Quantitative experiments and human evaluation have validated the superiority of our proposed model, in terms of image quality, style consistency, content consistency, and visual-language alignment. We will make the code, model, and dataset publicly available to the research community.

- **Summary**: Text-guided diffusion models (TDMs) are widely applied but can fail unexpectedly. Common failures include: (i) natural-looking text prompts generating images with the wrong content, or (ii) different random samples of the latent variables that generate vastly different, and even unrelated, outputs despite being conditioned on the same text prompt. In this work, we aim to study and understand the failure modes of TDMs in more detail. To achieve this, we propose SAGE, an adversarial attack on TDMs that uses image classifiers as surrogate loss functions, to search over the discrete prompt space and the high-dimensional latent space of TDMs to automatically discover unexpected behaviors and failure cases in the image generation. We make several technical contributions to ensure that SAGE finds failure cases of the diffusion model, rather than the classifier, and verify this in a human study. Our study reveals four intriguing properties of TDMs that have not been systematically studied before: (1) We find a variety of natural text prompts producing images that fail to capture the semantics of input texts. We categorize these failures into ten distinct types based on the underlying causes. (2) We find samples in the latent space (which are not outliers) that lead to distorted images independent of the text prompt, suggesting that parts of the latent space are not well-structured. (3) We also find latent samples that lead to natural-looking images which are unrelated to the text prompt, implying a potential misalignment between the latent and prompt spaces. (4) By appending a single adversarial token embedding to an input prompt we can generate a variety of specified target objects, while only minimally affecting the CLIP score. This demonstrates the fragility of language representations and raises potential safety concerns. Project page: https://sage-diffusion.github.io/

- **Summary**: In this work, we investigate Active Reinforcement Learning (Active-RL), where an embodied agent simultaneously learns action policy for the task while also controlling its visual observations in partially observable environments. We denote the former as motor policy and the latter as sensory policy. For example, humans solve real world tasks by hand manipulation (motor policy) together with eye movements (sensory policy). Active-RL poses challenges on coordinating two policies given their mutual influence. We propose SUGARL, Sensorimotor Understanding Guided Active Reinforcement Learning, a framework that models motor and sensory policies separately, but jointly learns them using with an intrinsic sensorimotor reward. This learnable reward is assigned by sensorimotor reward module, incentivizes the sensory policy to select observations that are optimal to infer its own motor action, inspired by the sensorimotor stage of humans. Through a series of experiments, we show the effectiveness of our method across a range of observability conditions and its adaptability to existed RL algorithms. The sensory policies learned through our method are observed to exhibit effective active vision strategies.

- **Summary**: During interactive segmentation, a model and a user work together to delineate objects of interest in a 3D point cloud. In an iterative process, the model assigns each data point to an object (or the background), while the user corrects errors in the resulting segmentation and feeds them back into the model. From a machine learning perspective the goal is to design the model and the feedback mechanism in a way that minimizes the required user input. The current best practice segments objects one at a time, and asks the user to provide positive clicks to indicate regions wrongly assigned to the background and negative clicks to indicate regions wrongly assigned to the object (foreground). Sequentially visiting objects is wasteful, since it disregards synergies between objects: a positive click for a given object can, by definition, serve as a negative click for nearby objects, moreover a direct competition between adjacent objects can speed up the identification of their common boundary. We introduce AGILE3D, an efficient, attention-based model that (1) supports simultaneous segmentation of multiple 3D objects, (2) yields more accurate segmentation masks with fewer user clicks, and (3) offers faster inference. We encode the point cloud into a latent feature representation, and view user clicks as queries and employ cross-attention to represent contextual relations between different click locations as well as between clicks and the 3D point cloud features. Every time new clicks are added, we only need to run a lightweight decoder that produces updated segmentation masks. In experiments with four different point cloud datasets, AGILE3D sets a new state of the art, moreover, we also verify its practicality in real-world setups with a real user study.

- **Summary**: We build rearticulable models for arbitrary everyday man-made objects containing an arbitrary number of parts that are connected together in arbitrary ways via 1 degree-of-freedom joints. Given point cloud videos of such everyday objects, our method identifies the distinct object parts, what parts are connected to what other parts, and the properties of the joints connecting each part pair. We do this by jointly optimizing the part segmentation, transformation, and kinematics using a novel energy minimization framework. Our inferred animatable models, enables retargeting to novel poses with sparse point correspondences guidance. We test our method on a new articulating robot dataset, and the Sapiens dataset with common daily objects, as well as real-world scans. Experiments show that our method outperforms two leading prior works on various metrics.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models can create stunning images from natural language descriptions that rival the work of professional artists and photographers. However, these models are large, with complex network architectures and tens of denoising iterations, making them computationally expensive and slow to run. As a result, high-end GPUs and cloud-based inference are required to run diffusion models at scale. This is costly and has privacy implications, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To overcome these challenges, we present a generic approach that, for the first time, unlocks running text-to-image diffusion models on mobile devices in less than $2$ seconds. We achieve so by introducing efficient network architecture and improving step distillation. Specifically, we propose an efficient UNet by identifying the redundancy of the original model and reducing the computation of the image decoder via data distillation. Further, we enhance the step distillation by exploring training strategies and introducing regularization from classifier-free guidance. Our extensive experiments on MS-COCO show that our model with $8$ denoising steps achieves better FID and CLIP scores than Stable Diffusion v$1.5$ with $50$ steps. Our work democratizes content creation by bringing powerful text-to-image diffusion models to the hands of users.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained large text-to-image models synthesize impressive images with an appropriate use of text prompts. However, ambiguities inherent in natural language and out-of-distribution effects make it hard to synthesize image styles, that leverage a specific design pattern, texture or material. In this paper, we introduce StyleDrop, a method that enables the synthesis of images that faithfully follow a specific style using a text-to-image model. The proposed method is extremely versatile and captures nuances and details of a user-provided style, such as color schemes, shading, design patterns, and local and global effects. It efficiently learns a new style by fine-tuning very few trainable parameters (less than $1\%$ of total model parameters) and improving the quality via iterative training with either human or automated feedback. Better yet, StyleDrop is able to deliver impressive results even when the user supplies only a single image that specifies the desired style. An extensive study shows that, for the task of style tuning text-to-image models, StyleDrop implemented on Muse convincingly outperforms other methods, including DreamBooth and textual inversion on Imagen or Stable Diffusion.

- **Summary**: We investigate the potential of learning visual representations using synthetic images generated by text-to-image models. This is a natural question in the light of the excellent performance of such models in generating high-quality images. We consider specifically the Stable Diffusion, one of the leading open source text-to-image models. We show that (1) when the generative model is configured with proper classifier-free guidance scale, training self-supervised methods on synthetic images can match or beat the real image counterpart; (2) by treating the multiple images generated from the same text prompt as positives for each other, we develop a multi-positive contrastive learning method, which we call StableRep. With solely synthetic images, the representations learned by StableRep surpass the performance of representations learned by SimCLR and CLIP using the same set of text prompts and corresponding real images, on large scale datasets. When we further add language supervision, StableRep trained with 20M synthetic images achieves better accuracy than CLIP trained with 50M real images.

- **Summary**: AI models have shown promise in many medical imaging tasks. However, our ability to explain what signals these models have learned is severely lacking. Explanations are needed in order to increase the trust in AI-based models, and could enable novel scientific discovery by uncovering signals in the data that are not yet known to experts. In this paper, we present a method for automatic visual explanations leveraging team-based expertise by generating hypotheses of what visual signals in the images are correlated with the task. We propose the following 4 steps: (i) Train a classifier to perform a given task (ii) Train a classifier guided StyleGAN-based image generator (StylEx) (iii) Automatically detect and visualize the top visual attributes that the classifier is sensitive towards (iv) Formulate hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms, to stimulate future research. Specifically, we present the discovered attributes to an interdisciplinary panel of experts so that hypotheses can account for social and structural determinants of health. We demonstrate results on eight prediction tasks across three medical imaging modalities: retinal fundus photographs, external eye photographs, and chest radiographs. We showcase examples of attributes that capture clinically known features, confounders that arise from factors beyond physiological mechanisms, and reveal a number of physiologically plausible novel attributes. Our approach has the potential to enable researchers to better understand, improve their assessment, and extract new knowledge from AI-based models. Importantly, we highlight that attributes generated by our framework can capture phenomena beyond physiology or pathophysiology, reflecting the real world nature of healthcare delivery and socio-cultural factors. Finally, we intend to release code to enable researchers to train their own StylEx models and analyze their predictive tasks.

- **Summary**: Large-scale generative models are capable of producing high-quality images from detailed text descriptions. However, many aspects of an image are difficult or impossible to convey through text. We introduce self-guidance, a method that provides greater control over generated images by guiding the internal representations of diffusion models. We demonstrate that properties such as the shape, location, and appearance of objects can be extracted from these representations and used to steer sampling. Self-guidance works similarly to classifier guidance, but uses signals present in the pretrained model itself, requiring no additional models or training. We show how a simple set of properties can be composed to perform challenging image manipulations, such as modifying the position or size of objects, merging the appearance of objects in one image with the layout of another, composing objects from many images into one, and more. We also show that self-guidance can be used to edit real images. For results and an interactive demo, see our project page at https://dave.ml/selfguidance/

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Intrinsic images, in the original sense, are image-like maps of scene properties like depth, normal, albedo or shading. This paper demonstrates that StyleGAN can easily be induced to produce intrinsic images. The procedure is straightforward. We show that, if StyleGAN produces $G({w})$ from latents ${w}$, then for each type of intrinsic image, there is a fixed offset ${d}_c$ so that $G({w}+{d}_c)$ is that type of intrinsic image for $G({w})$. Here ${d}_c$ is {\em independent of ${w}$}. The StyleGAN we used was pretrained by others, so this property is not some accident of our training regime. We show that there are image transformations StyleGAN will {\em not} produce in this fashion, so StyleGAN is not a generic image regression engine.   It is conceptually exciting that an image generator should ``know'' and represent intrinsic images. There may also be practical advantages to using a generative model to produce intrinsic images. The intrinsic images obtained from StyleGAN compare well both qualitatively and quantitatively with those obtained by using SOTA image regression techniques; but StyleGAN's intrinsic images are robust to relighting effects, unlike SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: The ability to dynamically extend a model to new data and classes is critical for multiple organ and tumor segmentation. However, due to privacy regulations, accessing previous data and annotations can be problematic in the medical domain. This poses a significant barrier to preserving the high segmentation accuracy of the old classes when learning from new classes because of the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that simply using high-quality pseudo labels can fairly mitigate this problem in the setting of organ segmentation. Furthermore, we put forward an innovative architecture designed specifically for continuous organ and tumor segmentation, which incurs minimal computational overhead. Our proposed design involves replacing the conventional output layer with a suite of lightweight, class-specific heads, thereby offering the flexibility to accommodate newly emerging classes. These heads enable independent predictions for newly introduced and previously learned classes, effectively minimizing the impact of new classes on old ones during the course of continual learning. We further propose incorporating Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embeddings into the organ-specific heads. These embeddings encapsulate the semantic information of each class, informed by extensive image-text co-training. The proposed method is evaluated on both in-house and public abdominal CT datasets under organ and tumor segmentation tasks. Empirical results suggest that the proposed design improves the segmentation performance of a baseline neural network on newly-introduced and previously-learned classes along the learning trajectory.

- **Summary**: Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/hiera.

- **Summary**: Accurate understanding and prediction of human behaviors are critical prerequisites for autonomous vehicles, especially in highly dynamic and interactive scenarios such as intersections in dense urban areas. In this work, we aim at identifying crossing pedestrians and predicting their future trajectories. To achieve these goals, we not only need the context information of road geometry and other traffic participants but also need fine-grained information of the human pose, motion and activity, which can be inferred from human keypoints. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework for pedestrian crossing action recognition and trajectory prediction, which utilizes 3D human keypoints extracted from raw sensor data to capture rich information on human pose and activity. Moreover, we propose to apply two auxiliary tasks and contrastive learning to enable auxiliary supervisions to improve the learned keypoints representation, which further enhances the performance of major tasks. We validate our approach on a large-scale in-house dataset, as well as a public benchmark dataset, and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of evaluation metrics. The effectiveness of each model component is validated in a detailed ablation study.

- **Summary**: Time varying sequences of 3D point clouds, or 4D point clouds, are now being acquired at an increasing pace in several applications (e.g., LiDAR in autonomous or assisted driving). In many cases, such volume of data is transmitted, thus requiring that proper compression tools are applied to either reduce the resolution or the bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a new solution for upscaling and restoration of time-varying 3D video point clouds after they have been heavily compressed. In consideration of recent growing relevance of 3D applications, %We focused on a model allowing user-side upscaling and artifact removal for 3D video point clouds, a real-time stream of which would require . Our model consists of a specifically designed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that combines Dynamic Edge Convolution and Graph Attention Networks for feature aggregation in a Generative Adversarial setting. By taking inspiration PointNet++, We present a different way to sample dense point clouds with the intent to make these modules work in synergy to provide each node enough features about its neighbourhood in order to later on generate new vertices. Compared to other solutions in the literature that address the same task, our proposed model is capable of obtaining comparable results in terms of quality of the reconstruction, while using a substantially lower number of parameters (about 300KB), making our solution deployable in edge computing devices such as LiDAR.

- **Summary**: Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) present diagnostic challenges due to their varied manifestations and overlapping imaging features. To address this, we propose a machine learning approach that utilizes CLIP, a multimodal (image and text) self-supervised model, for ILD classification. We extensively integrate zero-shot CLIP throughout our workflow, starting from the initial extraction of image patches from volumetric CT scans and proceeding to ILD classification using "patch montages". Furthermore, we investigate how domain adaptive pretraining (DAPT) CLIP with task-specific images (CT "patch montages" extracted with ILD-specific prompts for CLIP) and/or text (lung-specific sections of radiology reports) affects downstream ILD classification performance. By leveraging CLIP-extracted "patch montages" and DAPT, we achieve strong zero-shot ILD classification results, including an AUROC of 0.893, without the need for any labeled training data. This work highlights the versatility and potential of multimodal models like CLIP for medical image classification tasks where labeled data is scarce.

- **Summary**: Learned Image Compression (LIC) has recently become the trending technique for image transmission due to its notable performance. Despite its popularity, the robustness of LIC with respect to the quality of image reconstruction remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce an imperceptible attack approach designed to effectively degrade the reconstruction quality of LIC, resulting in the reconstructed image being severely disrupted by noise where any object in the reconstructed images is virtually impossible. More specifically, we generate adversarial examples by introducing a Frobenius norm-based loss function to maximize the discrepancy between original images and reconstructed adversarial examples. Further, leveraging the insensitivity of high-frequency components to human vision, we introduce Imperceptibility Constraint (IC) to ensure that the perturbations remain inconspicuous. Experiments conducted on the Kodak dataset using various LIC models demonstrate effectiveness. In addition, we provide several findings and suggestions for designing future defenses.

- **Summary**: 3D pose estimation offers the opportunity for fast, non-invasive, and accurate motion analysis. This is of special interest also for clinical use. Currently, motion capture systems are used, as they offer robust and precise data acquisition, which is essential in the case of clinical applications. In this study, we investigate the accuracy of the state-of-the-art 3D position estimation approach MeTrabs, compared to the established inertial sensor system MTw Awinda for specific motion exercises. The study uses and provides an evaluation dataset of parallel recordings from 10 subjects during various movement therapy exercises. The information from the Awinda system and the frames for monocular pose estimation are synchronized. For the comparison, clinically relevant parameters for joint angles of ankle, knee, back, and elbow flexion-extension were estimated and evaluated using mean, median, and maximum deviation between the calculated joint angles for the different exercises, camera positions, and clothing items. The results of the analysis indicate that the mean and median deviations can be kept below 5{\deg} for some of the studied angles. These joints could be considered for medical applications even considering the maximum deviations of 15{\deg}. However, caution should be applied to certain particularly problematic joints. In particular, elbow flexions, which showed high maximum deviations of up to 50{\deg} in our analysis. Furthermore, the type of exercise plays a crucial role in the reliable and safe application of the 3D position estimation method. For example, all joint angles showed a significant deterioration in performance during exercises near the ground.

- **Summary**: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is the process of estimating PPG from facial videos. While this approach benefits from contactless interaction, it is reliant on videos of faces, which often constitutes an important privacy concern. Recent research has revealed that deep learning techniques are vulnerable to attacks, which can result in significant data breaches making deep rPPG estimation even more sensitive. To address this issue, we propose a data perturbation method that involves extraction of certain areas of the face with less identity-related information, followed by pixel shuffling and blurring. Our experiments on two rPPG datasets (PURE and UBFC) show that our approach reduces the accuracy of facial recognition algorithms by over 60%, with minimal impact on rPPG extraction. We also test our method on three facial recognition datasets (LFW, CALFW, and AgeDB), where our approach reduced performance by nearly 50%. Our findings demonstrate the potential of our approach as an effective privacy-preserving solution for rPPG estimation.

- **Summary**: For the task of image classification, neural networks primarily rely on visual patterns. In robust networks, we would expect for visually similar classes to be represented similarly. We consider the problem of when semantically similar classes are visually dissimilar, and when visual similarity is present among non-similar classes. We propose a data augmentation technique with the goal of better aligning semantically similar classes with arbitrary (non-visual) semantic relationships. We leverage recent work in diffusion-based semantic mixing to generate semantic hybrids of two classes, and these hybrids are added to the training set as augmented data. We evaluate whether the method increases semantic alignment by evaluating model performance on adversarially perturbed data, with the idea that it should be easier for an adversary to switch one class to a similarly represented class. Results demonstrate that there is an increase in alignment of semantically similar classes when using our proposed data augmentation method.



### Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging

- **Summary**: Snapshot compressive imaging emerges as a promising technology for acquiring real-world hyperspectral signals. It uses an optical encoder and compressively produces the 2D measurement, followed by which the 3D hyperspectral data can be retrieved via training a deep reconstruction network. Existing reconstruction models are trained with a single hardware instance, whose performance is vulnerable to hardware perturbation or replacement, demonstrating an overfitting issue to the physical configuration. This defect limits the deployment of pre-trained models since they would suffer from large performance degradation when are assembled to unseen hardware. To better facilitate the reconstruction model with new hardware, previous efforts resort to centralized training by collecting multi-hardware and data, which is impractical when dealing with proprietary assets among institutions. In light of this, federated learning (FL) has become a feasible solution to enable cross-hardware cooperation without breaking privacy. However, the naive FedAvg is subject to client drift upon data heterogeneity owning to the hardware inconsistency. In this work, we tackle this challenge by marrying prompt tuning with FL to snapshot compressive imaging for the first time and propose an federated hardware-prompt learning (FedHP) method. Rather than mitigating the client drift by rectifying the gradients, which only takes effect on the learning manifold but fails to touch the heterogeneity rooted in the input data space, the proposed FedHP globally learns a hardware-conditioned prompter to align the data distribution, which serves as an indicator of the data inconsistency stemming from different pre-defined coded apertures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method well coordinates the pre-trained model to indeterminate hardware configurations.

- **Summary**: Event-based cameras asynchronously capture individual visual changes in a scene. This makes them more robust than traditional frame-based cameras to highly dynamic motions and poor illumination. It also means that every measurement in a scene can occur at a unique time.   Handling these different measurement times is a major challenge of using event-based cameras. It is often addressed in visual odometry (VO) pipelines by approximating temporally close measurements as occurring at one common time. This grouping simplifies the estimation problem but, absent additional sensors, sacrifices the inherent temporal resolution of event-based cameras.   This paper instead presents a complete stereo VO pipeline that estimates directly with individual event-measurement times without requiring any grouping or approximation in the estimation state. It uses continuous-time trajectory estimation to maintain the temporal fidelity and asynchronous nature of event-based cameras through Gaussian process regression with a physically motivated prior. Its performance is evaluated on the MVSEC dataset, where it achieves 7.9e-3 and 5.9e-3 RMS relative error on two independent sequences, outperforming the existing publicly available event-based stereo VO pipeline by two and four times, respectively.

- **Summary**: Intraoperative ultrasound scanning is a demanding visuotactile task. It requires operators to simultaneously localise the ultrasound perspective and manually perform slight adjustments to the pose of the probe, making sure not to apply excessive force or breaking contact with the tissue, whilst also characterising the visible tissue. In this paper, we propose a method for the identification of the visible tissue, which enables the analysis of ultrasound probe and tissue contact via the detection of acoustic shadow and construction of confidence maps of the perceptual salience. Detailed validation with both in vivo and phantom data is performed. First, we show that our technique is capable of achieving state of the art acoustic shadow scan line classification - with an average binary classification accuracy on unseen data of 0.87. Second, we show that our framework for constructing confidence maps is able to produce an ideal response to a probe's pose that is being oriented in and out of optimality - achieving an average RMSE across five scans of 0.174. The performance evaluation justifies the potential clinical value of the method which can be used both to assist clinical training and optimise robot-assisted ultrasound tissue scanning.

- **Summary**: We propose Consistency-guided Prompt learning (CoPrompt), a new fine-tuning method for vision-language models that addresses the challenge of improving the generalization capability of large foundation models while fine-tuning them on downstream tasks in a few-shot setting. The basic idea of CoPrompt is to enforce a consistency constraint in the prediction of the trainable and pre-trained models to prevent overfitting on the downstream task. Additionally, we introduce the following two components into our consistency constraint to further boost the performance: enforcing consistency on two perturbed inputs and combining two dominant paradigms of tuning, prompting and adapter. Enforcing consistency on perturbed input further regularizes the consistency constraint, effectively improving generalization, while tuning additional parameters with prompting and adapters improves the performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that CoPrompt outperforms existing methods on a range of evaluation suites, including base-to-novel generalization, domain generalization, and cross-dataset evaluation tasks. On the generalization task, CoPrompt improves the state-of-the-art by 2.09% on the zero-shot task and 1.93% on the harmonic mean over 11 recognition datasets. Detailed ablation studies show the effectiveness of each of the components in CoPrompt.

- **Summary**: Matching algorithms are commonly used to predict matches between items in a collection. For example, in 1:1 face verification, a matching algorithm predicts whether two face images depict the same person. Accurately assessing the uncertainty of the error rates of such algorithms can be challenging when data are dependent and error rates are low, two aspects that have been often overlooked in the literature. In this work, we review methods for constructing confidence intervals for error rates in matching tasks such as 1:1 face verification. We derive and examine the statistical properties of these methods and demonstrate how coverage and interval width vary with sample size, error rates, and degree of data dependence using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for best practices for constructing confidence intervals for error rates in matching tasks.

- **Summary**: Point cloud-based place recognition is crucial for mobile robots and autonomous vehicles, especially when the global positioning sensor is not accessible. LiDAR points are scattered on the surface of objects and buildings, which have strong shape priors along different axes. To enhance message passing along particular axes, Stacked Asymmetric Convolution Block (SACB) is designed, which is one of the main contributions in this paper. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that asymmetric convolution and its corresponding strategies employed by SACB can contribute to the more effective representation of point cloud feature. On this basis, Selective Feature Fusion Block (SFFB), which is formed by stacking point- and channel-wise gating layers in a predefined sequence, is proposed to selectively boost salient local features in certain key regions, as well as to align the features before fusion phase. SACBs and SFFBs are combined to construct a robust and accurate architecture for point cloud-based place recognition, which is termed SelFLoc. Comparative experimental results show that SelFLoc achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Oxford and other three in-house benchmarks with an improvement of 1.6 absolute percentages on mean average recall@1.

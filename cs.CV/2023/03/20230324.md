- **Summary**: Current methods for few-shot segmentation (FSSeg) have mainly focused on improving the performance of novel classes while neglecting the performance of base classes. To overcome this limitation, the task of generalized few-shot semantic segmentation (GFSSeg) has been introduced, aiming to predict segmentation masks for both base and novel classes. However, the current prototype-based methods do not explicitly consider the relationship between base and novel classes when updating prototypes, leading to a limited performance in identifying true categories. To address this challenge, we propose a class contrastive loss and a class relationship loss to regulate prototype updates and encourage a large distance between prototypes from different classes, thus distinguishing the classes from each other while maintaining the performance of the base classes. Our proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance for the generalized few-shot segmentation task on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.

- **Summary**: Vision transformer (ViT) expands the success of transformer models from sequential data to images. The model decomposes an image into many smaller patches and arranges them into a sequence. Multi-head self-attentions are then applied to the sequence to learn the attention between patches. Despite many successful interpretations of transformers on sequential data, little effort has been devoted to the interpretation of ViTs, and many questions remain unanswered. For example, among the numerous attention heads, which one is more important? How strong are individual patches attending to their spatial neighbors in different heads? What attention patterns have individual heads learned? In this work, we answer these questions through a visual analytics approach. Specifically, we first identify what heads are more important in ViTs by introducing multiple pruning-based metrics. Then, we profile the spatial distribution of attention strengths between patches inside individual heads, as well as the trend of attention strengths across attention layers. Third, using an autoencoder-based learning solution, we summarize all possible attention patterns that individual heads could learn. Examining the attention strengths and patterns of the important heads, we answer why they are important. Through concrete case studies with experienced deep learning experts on multiple ViTs, we validate the effectiveness of our solution that deepens the understanding of ViTs from head importance, head attention strength, and head attention pattern.

- **Summary**: Currently, most adverse weather removal tasks are handled independently, such as deraining, desnowing, and dehazing. However, in autonomous driving scenarios, the type, intensity, and mixing degree of the weather are unknown, so the separated task setting cannot deal with these complex conditions well. Besides, the vision applications in autonomous driving often aim at high-level tasks, but existing weather removal methods neglect the connection between performance on perceptual tasks and signal fidelity. To this end, in upstream task, we propose a novel \textbf{Mixture of Weather Experts(MoWE)} Transformer framework to handle complex weather removal in a perception-aware fashion. We design a \textbf{Weather-aware Router} to make the experts targeted more relevant to weather types while without the need for weather type labels during inference. To handle diverse weather conditions, we propose \textbf{Multi-scale Experts} to fuse information among neighbor tokens. In downstream task, we propose a \textbf{Label-free Perception-aware Metric} to measure whether the outputs of image processing models are suitable for high level perception tasks without the demand for semantic labels. We collect a syntactic dataset \textbf{MAW-Sim} towards autonomous driving scenarios to benchmark the multiple weather removal performance of existing methods. Our MoWE achieves SOTA performance in upstream task on the proposed dataset and two public datasets, i.e. All-Weather and Rain/Fog-Cityscapes, and also have better perceptual results in downstream segmentation task compared to other methods. Our codes and datasets will be released after acceptance.

- **Summary**: Recent work in Neural Fields (NFs) learn 3D representations from class-specific single view image collections. However, they are unable to reconstruct the input data preserving high-frequency details. Further, these methods do not disentangle appearance from geometry and hence are not suitable for tasks such as texture transfer and editing. In this work, we propose TEGLO (Textured EG3D-GLO) for learning 3D representations from single view in-the-wild image collections for a given class of objects. We accomplish this by training a conditional Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) without any explicit 3D supervision. We equip our method with editing capabilities by creating a dense correspondence mapping to a 2D canonical space. We demonstrate that such mapping enables texture transfer and texture editing without requiring meshes with shared topology. Our key insight is that by mapping the input image pixels onto the texture space we can achieve near perfect reconstruction (>= 74 dB PSNR at 1024^2 resolution). Our formulation allows for high quality 3D consistent novel view synthesis with high-frequency details at megapixel image resolution.

- **Summary**: Conditional image-to-video (cI2V) generation aims to synthesize a new plausible video starting from an image (e.g., a person's face) and a condition (e.g., an action class label like smile). The key challenge of the cI2V task lies in the simultaneous generation of realistic spatial appearance and temporal dynamics corresponding to the given image and condition. In this paper, we propose an approach for cI2V using novel latent flow diffusion models (LFDM) that synthesize an optical flow sequence in the latent space based on the given condition to warp the given image. Compared to previous direct-synthesis-based works, our proposed LFDM can better synthesize spatial details and temporal motion by fully utilizing the spatial content of the given image and warping it in the latent space according to the generated temporally-coherent flow. The training of LFDM consists of two separate stages: (1) an unsupervised learning stage to train a latent flow auto-encoder for spatial content generation, including a flow predictor to estimate latent flow between pairs of video frames, and (2) a conditional learning stage to train a 3D-UNet-based diffusion model (DM) for temporal latent flow generation. Unlike previous DMs operating in pixel space or latent feature space that couples spatial and temporal information, the DM in our LFDM only needs to learn a low-dimensional latent flow space for motion generation, thus being more computationally efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, where LFDM consistently outperforms prior arts. Furthermore, we show that LFDM can be easily adapted to new domains by simply finetuning the image decoder. Our code is available at https://github.com/nihaomiao/CVPR23_LFDM.

- **Summary**: Class-incremental continual learning is a core step towards developing artificial intelligence systems that can continuously adapt to changes in the environment by learning new concepts without forgetting those previously learned. This is especially needed in the medical domain where continually learning from new incoming data is required to classify an expanded set of diseases. In this work, we focus on how old knowledge can be leveraged to learn new classes without catastrophic forgetting. We propose a framework that comprises of two main components: (1) a dynamic architecture with expanding representations to preserve previously learned features and accommodate new features; and (2) a training procedure alternating between two objectives to balance the learning of new features while maintaining the model's performance on old classes. Experiment results on multiple medical datasets show that our solution is able to achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of class accuracy and forgetting.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral change detection plays an essential role of monitoring the dynamic urban development and detecting precise fine object evolution and alteration. In this paper, we have proposed an original Efficient Multi-temporal Self-attention Network (EMS-Net) for hyperspectral change detection. The designed EMS module cuts redundancy of those similar and containing-no-changes feature maps, computing efficient multi-temporal change information for precise binary change map. Besides, to explore the clustering characteristics of the change detection, a novel supervised contrastive loss is provided to enhance the compactness of the unchanged. Experiments implemented on two hyperspectral change detection datasets manifests the out-standing performance and validity of proposed method.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown their competitive advantages performance-wise compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) though they often come with high computational costs. To this end, previous methods explore different attention patterns by limiting a fixed number of spatially nearby tokens to accelerate the ViT's multi-head self-attention (MHSA) operations. However, such structured attention patterns limit the token-to-token connections to their spatial relevance, which disregards learned semantic connections from a full attention mask. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learn instance-dependent attention patterns, by devising a lightweight connectivity predictor module to estimate the connectivity score of each pair of tokens. Intuitively, two tokens have high connectivity scores if the features are considered relevant either spatially or semantically. As each token only attends to a small number of other tokens, the binarized connectivity masks are often very sparse by nature and therefore provide the opportunity to accelerate the network via sparse computations. Equipped with the learned unstructured attention pattern, sparse attention ViT (Sparsifiner) produces a superior Pareto-optimal trade-off between FLOPs and top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared to token sparsity. Our method reduces 48% to 69% FLOPs of MHSA while the accuracy drop is within 0.4%. We also show that combining attention and token sparsity reduces ViT FLOPs by over 60%.

- **Summary**: Image-based Virtual Try-ON aims to transfer an in-shop garment onto a specific person. Existing methods employ a global warping module to model the anisotropic deformation for different garment parts, which fails to preserve the semantic information of different parts when receiving challenging inputs (e.g, intricate human poses, difficult garments). Moreover, most of them directly warp the input garment to align with the boundary of the preserved region, which usually requires texture squeezing to meet the boundary shape constraint and thus leads to texture distortion. The above inferior performance hinders existing methods from real-world applications. To address these problems and take a step towards real-world virtual try-on, we propose a General-Purpose Virtual Try-ON framework, named GP-VTON, by developing an innovative Local-Flow Global-Parsing (LFGP) warping module and a Dynamic Gradient Truncation (DGT) training strategy. Specifically, compared with the previous global warping mechanism, LFGP employs local flows to warp garments parts individually, and assembles the local warped results via the global garment parsing, resulting in reasonable warped parts and a semantic-correct intact garment even with challenging inputs.On the other hand, our DGT training strategy dynamically truncates the gradient in the overlap area and the warped garment is no more required to meet the boundary constraint, which effectively avoids the texture squeezing problem. Furthermore, our GP-VTON can be easily extended to multi-category scenario and jointly trained by using data from different garment categories. Extensive experiments on two high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate our superiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Optical flow estimation has made great progress, but usually suffers from degradation under adverse weather. Although semi/full-supervised methods have made good attempts, the domain shift between the synthetic and real adverse weather images would deteriorate their performance. To alleviate this issue, our start point is to unsupervisedly transfer the knowledge from source clean domain to target degraded domain. Our key insight is that adverse weather does not change the intrinsic optical flow of the scene, but causes a significant difference for the warp error between clean and degraded images. In this work, we propose the first unsupervised framework for adverse weather optical flow via hierarchical motion-boundary adaptation. Specifically, we first employ image translation to construct the transformation relationship between clean and degraded domains. In motion adaptation, we utilize the flow consistency knowledge to align the cross-domain optical flows into a motion-invariance common space, where the optical flow from clean weather is used as the guidance-knowledge to obtain a preliminary optical flow for adverse weather. Furthermore, we leverage the warp error inconsistency which measures the motion misalignment of the boundary between the clean and degraded domains, and propose a joint intra- and inter-scene boundary contrastive adaptation to refine the motion boundary. The hierarchical motion and boundary adaptation jointly promotes optical flow in a unified framework. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: In recent years, point clouds have become increasingly popular for representing three-dimensional (3D) visual objects and scenes. To efficiently store and transmit point clouds, compression methods have been developed, but they often result in a degradation of quality. To reduce color distortion in point clouds, we propose a graph-based quality enhancement network (GQE-Net) that uses geometry information as an auxiliary input and graph convolution blocks to extract local features efficiently. Specifically, we use a parallel-serial graph attention module with a multi-head graph attention mechanism to focus on important points or features and help them fuse together. Additionally, we design a feature refinement module that takes into account the normals and geometry distance between points. To work within the limitations of GPU memory capacity, the distorted point cloud is divided into overlap-allowed 3D patches, which are sent to GQE-Net for quality enhancement. To account for differences in data distribution among different color omponents, three models are trained for the three color components. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, when implementing GQE-Net on the recent G-PCC coding standard test model, 0.43 dB, 0.25 dB, and 0.36 dB Bjontegaard delta (BD)-peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), corresponding to 14.0%, 9.3%, and 14.5% BD-rate savings can be achieved on dense point clouds for the Y, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.

- **Summary**: Event cameras sense the intensity changes asynchronously and produce event streams with high dynamic range and low latency. This has inspired research endeavors utilizing events to guide the challenging video superresolution (VSR) task. In this paper, we make the first attempt to address a novel problem of achieving VSR at random scales by taking advantages of the high temporal resolution property of events. This is hampered by the difficulties of representing the spatial-temporal information of events when guiding VSR. To this end, we propose a novel framework that incorporates the spatial-temporal interpolation of events to VSR in a unified framework. Our key idea is to learn implicit neural representations from queried spatial-temporal coordinates and features from both RGB frames and events. Our method contains three parts. Specifically, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) module first learns the 3D features from events and RGB frames. Then, the Temporal Filter (TF) module unlocks more explicit motion information from the events near the queried timestamp and generates the 2D features. Lastly, the SpatialTemporal Implicit Representation (STIR) module recovers the SR frame in arbitrary resolutions from the outputs of these two modules. In addition, we collect a real-world dataset with spatially aligned events and RGB frames. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly surpasses the prior-arts and achieves VSR with random scales, e.g., 6.5.

- **Summary**: The recently proposed open-world object and open-set detection have achieved a breakthrough in finding never-seen-before objects and distinguishing them from known ones. However, their studies on knowledge transfer from known classes to unknown ones are not deep enough, resulting in the scanty capability for detecting unknowns hidden in the background. In this paper, we propose the unknown sniffer (UnSniffer) to find both unknown and known objects. Firstly, the generalized object confidence (GOC) score is introduced, which only uses known samples for supervision and avoids improper suppression of unknowns in the background. Significantly, such confidence score learned from known objects can be generalized to unknown ones. Additionally, we propose a negative energy suppression loss to further suppress the non-object samples in the background. Next, the best box of each unknown is hard to obtain during inference due to lacking their semantic information in training. To solve this issue, we introduce a graph-based determination scheme to replace hand-designed non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing. Finally, we present the Unknown Object Detection Benchmark, the first publicly benchmark that encompasses precision evaluation for unknown detection to our knowledge. Experiments show that our method is far better than the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this work, we focus on synthesizing high-fidelity novel view images for arbitrary human performers, given a set of sparse multi-view images. It is a challenging task due to the large variation among articulated body poses and heavy self-occlusions. To alleviate this, we introduce an effective generalizable framework Generalizable Model-based Neural Radiance Fields (GM-NeRF) to synthesize free-viewpoint images. Specifically, we propose a geometry-guided attention mechanism to register the appearance code from multi-view 2D images to a geometry proxy which can alleviate the misalignment between inaccurate geometry prior and pixel space. On top of that, we further conduct neural rendering and partial gradient backpropagation for efficient perceptual supervision and improvement of the perceptual quality of synthesis. To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments on synthesized datasets THuman2.0 and Multi-garment, and real-world datasets Genebody and ZJUMocap. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of novel view synthesis and geometric reconstruction.

- **Summary**: This paper advances the fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) literature by putting forward a strong baseline that overshoots prior state-of-the-arts by ~11%. This is not via complicated design though, but by addressing two critical issues facing the community (i) the gold standard triplet loss does not enforce holistic latent space geometry, and (ii) there are never enough sketches to train a high accuracy model. For the former, we propose a simple modification to the standard triplet loss, that explicitly enforces separation amongst photos/sketch instances. For the latter, we put forward a novel knowledge distillation module can leverage photo data for model training. Both modules are then plugged into a novel plug-n-playable training paradigm that allows for more stable training. More specifically, for (i) we employ an intra-modal triplet loss amongst sketches to bring sketches of the same instance closer from others, and one more amongst photos to push away different photo instances while bringing closer a structurally augmented version of the same photo (offering a gain of ~4-6%). To tackle (ii), we first pre-train a teacher on the large set of unlabelled photos over the aforementioned intra-modal photo triplet loss. Then we distill the contextual similarity present amongst the instances in the teacher's embedding space to that in the student's embedding space, by matching the distribution over inter-feature distances of respective samples in both embedding spaces (delivering a further gain of ~4-5%). Apart from outperforming prior arts significantly, our model also yields satisfactory results on generalising to new classes. Project page: https://aneeshan95.github.io/Sketch_PVT/

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a new text-guided 3D shape generation approach (ISS++) that uses images as a stepping stone to bridge the gap between text and shape modalities for generating 3D shapes without requiring paired text and 3D data. The core of our approach is a two-stage feature-space alignment strategy that leverages a pre-trained single-view reconstruction (SVR) model to map CLIP features to shapes: to begin with, map the CLIP image feature to the detail-rich 3D shape space of the SVR model, then map the CLIP text feature to the 3D shape space through encouraging the CLIP-consistency between rendered images and the input text. Besides, to extend beyond the generative capability of the SVR model, we design a text-guided 3D shape stylization module that can enhance the output shapes with novel structures and textures. Further, we exploit pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance the generative diversity, fidelity, and stylization capability. Our approach is generic, flexible, and scalable, and it can be easily integrated with various SVR models to expand the generative space and improve the generative fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generative quality and consistency with the input text.

- **Summary**: Person counting is considered as a fundamental task in video surveillance. However, the scenario diversity in practical applications makes it difficult to exploit a single person counting model for general use. Consequently, engineers must preview the video stream and manually specify an appropriate person counting model based on the scenario of camera shot, which is time-consuming, especially for large-scale deployments. In this paper, we propose a person counting paradigm that utilizes a scenario classifier to automatically select a suitable person counting model for each captured frame. First, the input image is passed through the scenario classifier to obtain a scenario label, which is then used to allocate the frame to one of five fine-tuned models for person counting. Additionally, we present five augmentation datasets collected from different scenarios, including side-view, long-shot, top-view, customized and crowd, which are also integrated to form a scenario classification dataset containing 26323 samples. In our comparative experiments, the proposed paradigm achieves better balance than any single model on the integrated dataset, thus its generalization in various scenarios has been proved.

- **Summary**: We present an algorithm for reconstructing the radiance field of a large-scale scene from a single casually captured video. The task poses two core challenges. First, most existing radiance field reconstruction approaches rely on accurate pre-estimated camera poses from Structure-from-Motion algorithms, which frequently fail on in-the-wild videos. Second, using a single, global radiance field with finite representational capacity does not scale to longer trajectories in an unbounded scene. For handling unknown poses, we jointly estimate the camera poses with radiance field in a progressive manner. We show that progressive optimization significantly improves the robustness of the reconstruction. For handling large unbounded scenes, we dynamically allocate new local radiance fields trained with frames within a temporal window. This further improves robustness (e.g., performs well even under moderate pose drifts) and allows us to scale to large scenes. Our extensive evaluation on the Tanks and Temples dataset and our collected outdoor dataset, Static Hikes, show that our approach compares favorably with the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Image matching is a classic and fundamental task in computer vision. In this paper, under the hypothesis that the areas outside the co-visible regions carry little information, we propose a matching key-points crop (MKPC) algorithm. The MKPC locates, proposes and crops the critical regions, which are the co-visible areas with great efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, building upon MKPC, we propose a general two-stage pipeline for image matching, which is compatible to any image matching models or combinations. We experimented with plugging SuperPoint + SuperGlue into the two-stage pipeline, whose results show that our method enhances the performance for outdoor pose estimations. What's more, in a fair comparative condition, our method outperforms the SOTA on Image Matching Challenge 2022 Benchmark, which represents the hardest outdoor benchmark of image matching currently.

- **Summary**: As it is hard to calibrate single-view RGB images in the wild, existing 3D human mesh reconstruction (3DHMR) methods either use a constant large focal length or estimate one based on the background environment context, which can not tackle the problem of the torso, limb, hand or face distortion caused by perspective camera projection when the camera is close to the human body. The naive focal length assumptions can harm this task with the incorrectly formulated projection matrices. To solve this, we propose Zolly, the first 3DHMR method focusing on perspective-distorted images. Our approach begins with analysing the reason for perspective distortion, which we find is mainly caused by the relative location of the human body to the camera center. We propose a new camera model and a novel 2D representation, termed distortion image, which describes the 2D dense distortion scale of the human body. We then estimate the distance from distortion scale features rather than environment context features. Afterwards, we integrate the distortion feature with image features to reconstruct the body mesh. To formulate the correct projection matrix and locate the human body position, we simultaneously use perspective and weak-perspective projection loss. Since existing datasets could not handle this task, we propose the first synthetic dataset PDHuman and extend two real-world datasets tailored for this task, all containing perspective-distorted human images. Extensive experiments show that Zolly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both perspective-distorted datasets and the standard benchmark (3DPW).

- **Summary**: In recent years, floor plan segmentation has gained significant attention due to its wide range of applications in floor plan reconstruction and robotics. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D floor plan segmentation technique based on a down-sampling approach. Our method employs continuous down-sampling on a floor plan to maintain its structural information while reducing its complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting results obtained from both cluttered floor plans generated by a vacuum cleaning robot in unknown environments and a benchmark of floor plans. Our technique considerably reduces the computational and implementation complexity of floor plan segmentation, making it more suitable for real-world applications. Additionally, we discuss the appropriate metric for evaluating segmentation results. Overall, our approach yields promising results for 2D floor plan segmentation in cluttered environments.

- **Summary**: Multimodal alignment facilitates the retrieval of instances from one modality when queried using another. In this paper, we consider a novel setting where such an alignment is between (i) instruction steps that are depicted as assembly diagrams (commonly seen in Ikea assembly manuals) and (ii) video segments from in-the-wild videos; these videos comprising an enactment of the assembly actions in the real world. To learn this alignment, we introduce a novel supervised contrastive learning method that learns to align videos with the subtle details in the assembly diagrams, guided by a set of novel losses. To study this problem and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we introduce a novel dataset: IAW for Ikea assembly in the wild consisting of 183 hours of videos from diverse furniture assembly collections and nearly 8,300 illustrations from their associated instruction manuals and annotated for their ground truth alignments. We define two tasks on this dataset: First, nearest neighbor retrieval between video segments and illustrations, and, second, alignment of instruction steps and the segments for each video. Extensive experiments on IAW demonstrate superior performances of our approach against alternatives.

- **Summary**: Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to perceive human emotions via language, visual and acoustic modalities. Despite the impressive performance of previous MER approaches, the inherent multimodal heterogeneities still haunt and the contribution of different modalities varies significantly. In this work, we mitigate this issue by proposing a decoupled multimodal distillation (DMD) approach that facilitates flexible and adaptive crossmodal knowledge distillation, aiming to enhance the discriminative features of each modality. Specially, the representation of each modality is decoupled into two parts, i.e., modality-irrelevant/-exclusive spaces, in a self-regression manner. DMD utilizes a graph distillation unit (GD-Unit) for each decoupled part so that each GD can be performed in a more specialized and effective manner. A GD-Unit consists of a dynamic graph where each vertice represents a modality and each edge indicates a dynamic knowledge distillation. Such GD paradigm provides a flexible knowledge transfer manner where the distillation weights can be automatically learned, thus enabling diverse crossmodal knowledge transfer patterns. Experimental results show DMD consistently obtains superior performance than state-of-the-art MER methods. Visualization results show the graph edges in DMD exhibit meaningful distributional patterns w.r.t. the modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we define a new problem of recovering the 3D geometry of an object confined in a transparent enclosure. We also propose a novel method for solving this challenging problem. Transparent enclosures pose challenges of multiple light reflections and refractions at the interface between different propagation media e.g. air or glass. These multiple reflections and refractions cause serious image distortions which invalidate the single viewpoint assumption. Hence the 3D geometry of such objects cannot be reliably reconstructed using existing methods, such as traditional structure from motion or modern neural reconstruction methods. We solve this problem by explicitly modeling the scene as two distinct sub-spaces, inside and outside the transparent enclosure. We use an existing neural reconstruction method (NeuS) that implicitly represents the geometry and appearance of the inner subspace. In order to account for complex light interactions, we develop a hybrid rendering strategy that combines volume rendering with ray tracing. We then recover the underlying geometry and appearance of the model by minimizing the difference between the real and hybrid rendered images. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real data. Experiment results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Codes and data will be available at https://github.com/hirotong/ReNeuS

- **Summary**: Stereo image super-resolution aims to boost the performance of image super-resolution by exploiting the supplementary information provided by binocular systems. Although previous methods have achieved promising results, they did not fully utilize the information of cross-view and intra-view. To further unleash the potential of binocular images, in this letter, we propose a novel Transformerbased parallax fusion module called Parallax Fusion Transformer (PFT). PFT employs a Cross-view Fusion Transformer (CVFT) to utilize cross-view information and an Intra-view Refinement Transformer (IVRT) for intra-view feature refinement. Meanwhile, we adopted the Swin Transformer as the backbone for feature extraction and SR reconstruction to form a pure Transformer architecture called PFT-SSR. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that PFT-SSR achieves competitive results and outperforms most SOTA methods. Source code is available at https://github.com/MIVRC/PFT-PyTorch.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have been widely studied for predicting a medical condition, such as total knee replacement (TKR). It has shown that data of different modalities, such as imaging data, clinical variables and demographic information, provide complementary information and thus can improve the prediction accuracy together. However, the data sources of various modalities may not always be of high quality, and each modality may have only partial information of medical condition. Thus, predictions from different modalities can be opposite, and the final prediction may fail in the presence of such a conflict. Therefore, it is important to consider the reliability of each source data and the prediction output when making a final decision. In this paper, we propose an evidence-aware multi-modal data fusion framework based on the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). The backbone models contain an image branch, a non-image branch and a fusion branch. For each branch, there is an evidence network that takes the extracted features as input and outputs an evidence score, which is designed to represent the reliability of the output from the current branch. The output probabilities along with the evidence scores from multiple branches are combined with the Dempster's combination rule to make a final prediction. Experimental results on the public OA initiative (OAI) dataset for the TKR prediction task show the superiority of the proposed fusion strategy on various backbone models.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks obtained by standard training have been constantly plagued by adversarial examples. Although adversarial training demonstrates its capability to defend against adversarial examples, unfortunately, it leads to an inevitable drop in the natural generalization. To address the issue, we decouple the natural generalization and the robust generalization from joint training and formulate different training strategies for each one. Specifically, instead of minimizing a global loss on the expectation over these two generalization errors, we propose a bi-expert framework called \emph{Generalist} where we simultaneously train base learners with task-aware strategies so that they can specialize in their own fields. The parameters of base learners are collected and combined to form a global learner at intervals during the training process. The global learner is then distributed to the base learners as initialized parameters for continued training. Theoretically, we prove that the risks of Generalist will get lower once the base learners are well trained. Extensive experiments verify the applicability of Generalist to achieve high accuracy on natural examples while maintaining considerable robustness to adversarial ones.

- **Summary**: Biometrics plays a significant role in vision-based surveillance applications. Soft biometrics such as gait is widely used with face in surveillance tasks like person recognition and re-identification. Nevertheless, in practical scenarios, classical fusion techniques respond poorly to changes in individual users and in the external environment. To this end, we propose a novel adaptive multi-biometric fusion strategy for the dynamic incorporation of gait and face biometric cues by leveraging keyless attention deep neural networks. Various external factors such as viewpoint and distance to the camera, are investigated in this study. Extensive experiments have shown superior performanceof the proposed model compared with the state-of-the-art model.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a popular method in representing 3D scenes by optimising a continuous volumetric scene function. Its large success which lies in applying volumetric rendering (VR) is also its Achilles' heel in producing view-dependent effects. As a consequence, glossy and transparent surfaces often appear murky. A remedy to reduce these artefacts is to constrain this VR equation by excluding volumes with back-facing normal. While this approach has some success in rendering glossy surfaces, translucent objects are still poorly represented. In this paper, we present an alternative to the physics-based VR approach by introducing a self-attention-based framework on volumes along a ray. In addition, inspired by modern game engines which utilise Light Probes to store local lighting passing through the scene, we incorporate Learnable Embeddings to capture view dependent effects within the scene. Our method, which we call ABLE-NeRF, significantly reduces `blurry' glossy surfaces in rendering and produces realistic translucent surfaces which lack in prior art. In the Blender dataset, ABLE-NeRF achieves SOTA results and surpasses Ref-NeRF in all 3 image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS.

- **Summary**: The extraction of structured clinical information from free-text radiology reports in the form of radiology graphs has been demonstrated to be a valuable approach for evaluating the clinical correctness of report-generation methods. However, the direct generation of radiology graphs from chest X-ray (CXR) images has not been attempted. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach called Prior-RadGraphFormer that utilizes a transformer model with prior knowledge in the form of a probabilistic knowledge graph (PKG) to generate radiology graphs directly from CXR images. The PKG models the statistical relationship between radiology entities, including anatomical structures and medical observations. This additional contextual information enhances the accuracy of entity and relation extraction. The generated radiology graphs can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as free-text or structured reports generation and multi-label classification of pathologies. Our approach represents a promising method for generating radiology graphs directly from CXR images, and has significant potential for improving medical image analysis and clinical decision-making.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework to reconstruct accurate appearance and geometry with neural radiance fields (NeRF) for interacting hands, enabling the rendering of photo-realistic images and videos for gesture animation from arbitrary views. Given multi-view images of a single hand or interacting hands, an off-the-shelf skeleton estimator is first employed to parameterize the hand poses. Then we design a pose-driven deformation field to establish correspondence from those different poses to a shared canonical space, where a pose-disentangled NeRF for one hand is optimized. Such unified modeling efficiently complements the geometry and texture cues in rarely-observed areas for both hands. Meanwhile, we further leverage the pose priors to generate pseudo depth maps as guidance for occlusion-aware density learning. Moreover, a neural feature distillation method is proposed to achieve cross-domain alignment for color optimization. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the merits of our proposed HandNeRF and report a series of state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively on the large-scale InterHand2.6M dataset.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot quantization (ZSQ) is promising for compressing and accelerating deep neural networks when the data for training full-precision models are inaccessible. In ZSQ, network quantization is performed using synthetic samples, thus, the performance of quantized models depends heavily on the quality of synthetic samples. Nonetheless, we find that the synthetic samples constructed in existing ZSQ methods can be easily fitted by models. Accordingly, quantized models obtained by these methods suffer from significant performance degradation on hard samples. To address this issue, we propose HArd sample Synthesizing and Training (HAST). Specifically, HAST pays more attention to hard samples when synthesizing samples and makes synthetic samples hard to fit when training quantized models. HAST aligns features extracted by full-precision and quantized models to ensure the similarity between features extracted by these two models. Extensive experiments show that HAST significantly outperforms existing ZSQ methods, achieving performance comparable to models that are quantized with real data.

- **Summary**: Manufacturing wafers is an intricate task involving thousands of steps. Defect Pattern Recognition (DPR) of wafer maps is crucial to find the root cause of the issue and further improving the yield in the wafer foundry. Mixed-type DPR is much more complicated compared to single-type DPR due to varied spatial features, the uncertainty of defects, and the number of defects present. To accurately predict the number of defects as well as the types of defects, we propose a novel compact deformable convolutional transformer (DC Transformer). Specifically, DC Transformer focuses on the global features present in the wafer map by virtue of learnable deformable kernels and multi-head attention to the global features. The proposed method succinctly models the internal relationship between the wafer maps and the defects. DC Transformer is evaluated on a real dataset containing 38 defect patterns. Experimental results show that DC Transformer performs exceptionally well in recognizing both single and mixed-type defects. The proposed method outperforms the current state of the models by a considerable margin

- **Summary**: The problem of document structure reconstruction refers to converting digital or scanned documents into corresponding semantic structures. Most existing works mainly focus on splitting the boundary of each element in a single document page, neglecting the reconstruction of semantic structure in multi-page documents. This paper introduces hierarchical reconstruction of document structures as a novel task suitable for NLP and CV fields. To better evaluate the system performance on the new task, we built a large-scale dataset named HRDoc, which consists of 2,500 multi-page documents with nearly 2 million semantic units. Every document in HRDoc has line-level annotations including categories and relations obtained from rule-based extractors and human annotators. Moreover, we proposed an encoder-decoder-based hierarchical document structure parsing system (DSPS) to tackle this problem. By adopting a multi-modal bidirectional encoder and a structure-aware GRU decoder with soft-mask operation, the DSPS model surpass the baseline method by a large margin. All scripts and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jfma-USTC/HRDoc.

- **Summary**: This paper raises the new task of Fisheye Semantic Completion (FSC), where dense texture, structure, and semantics of a fisheye image are inferred even beyond the sensor field-of-view (FoV). Fisheye cameras have larger FoV than ordinary pinhole cameras, yet its unique special imaging model naturally leads to a blind area at the edge of the image plane. This is suboptimal for safety-critical applications since important perception tasks, such as semantic segmentation, become very challenging within the blind zone. Previous works considered the out-FoV outpainting and in-FoV segmentation separately. However, we observe that these two tasks are actually closely coupled. To jointly estimate the tightly intertwined complete fisheye image and scene semantics, we introduce the new FishDreamer which relies on successful ViTs enhanced with a novel Polar-aware Cross Attention module (PCA) to leverage dense context and guide semantically-consistent content generation while considering different polar distributions. In addition to the contribution of the novel task and architecture, we also derive Cityscapes-BF and KITTI360-BF datasets to facilitate training and evaluation of this new track. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed FishDreamer outperforms methods solving each task in isolation and surpasses alternative approaches on the Fisheye Semantic Completion.

- **Summary**: Recent research endeavors have shown that combining neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with pre-trained diffusion models holds great potential for text-to-3D generation.However, a hurdle is that they often encounter guidance collapse when rendering complex scenes from multi-object texts. Because the text-to-image diffusion models are inherently unconstrained, making them less competent to accurately associate object semantics with specific 3D structures. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, dubbed CompoNeRF, that explicitly incorporates an editable 3D scene layout to provide effective guidance at the single object (i.e., local) and whole scene (i.e., global) levels. Firstly, we interpret the multi-object text as an editable 3D scene layout containing multiple local NeRFs associated with the object-specific 3D box coordinates and text prompt, which can be easily collected from users. Then, we introduce a global MLP to calibrate the compositional latent features from local NeRFs, which surprisingly improves the view consistency across different local NeRFs. Lastly, we apply the text guidance on global and local levels through their corresponding views to avoid guidance ambiguity. This way, our CompoNeRF allows for flexible scene editing and re-composition of trained local NeRFs into a new scene by manipulating the 3D layout or text prompt. Leveraging the open-source Stable Diffusion model, our CompoNeRF can generate faithful and editable text-to-3D results while opening a potential direction for text-guided multi-object composition via the editable 3D scene layout.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) is a crucial machine learning task that aims to learn patterns from a set of normal training samples to identify abnormal samples in test data. Most existing AD studies assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same data distribution, but the test data can have large distribution shifts arising in many real-world applications due to different natural variations such as new lighting conditions, object poses, or background appearances, rendering existing AD methods ineffective in such cases. In this paper, we consider the problem of anomaly detection under distribution shift and establish performance benchmarks on three widely-used AD and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization datasets. We demonstrate that simple adaptation of state-of-the-art OOD generalization methods to AD settings fails to work effectively due to the lack of labeled anomaly data. We further introduce a novel robust AD approach to diverse distribution shifts by minimizing the distribution gap between in-distribution and OOD normal samples in both the training and inference stages in an unsupervised way. Our extensive empirical results on the three datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art AD methods and OOD generalization methods on data with various distribution shifts, while maintaining the detection accuracy on in-distribution data.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks due to the accumulation of perturbations in the feature level, and numerous works have boosted model robustness by deactivating the non-robust feature activations that cause model mispredictions. However, we claim that these malicious activations still contain discriminative cues and that with recalibration, they can capture additional useful information for correct model predictions. To this end, we propose a novel, easy-to-plugin approach named Feature Separation and Recalibration (FSR) that recalibrates the malicious, non-robust activations for more robust feature maps through Separation and Recalibration. The Separation part disentangles the input feature map into the robust feature with activations that help the model make correct predictions and the non-robust feature with activations that are responsible for model mispredictions upon adversarial attack. The Recalibration part then adjusts the non-robust activations to restore the potentially useful cues for model predictions. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of FSR compared to traditional deactivation techniques and demonstrate that it improves the robustness of existing adversarial training methods by up to 8.57% with small computational overhead.

- **Summary**: We present a learning-based approach to relight a single image of Lambertian and low-frequency specular objects. Our method enables inserting objects from photographs into new scenes and relighting them under the new environment lighting, which is essential for AR applications. To relight the object, we solve both inverse rendering and re-rendering. To resolve the ill-posed inverse rendering, we propose a weakly-supervised method by a low-rank constraint. To facilitate the weakly-supervised training, we contribute Relit, a large-scale (750K images) dataset of videos with aligned objects under changing illuminations. For re-rendering, we propose a differentiable specular rendering layer to render low-frequency non-Lambertian materials under various illuminations of spherical harmonics. The whole pipeline is end-to-end and efficient, allowing for a mobile app implementation of AR object insertion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://renjiaoyi.github.io/relighting/.

- **Summary**: Object detection at night is a challenging problem due to the absence of night image annotations. Despite several domain adaptation methods, achieving high-precision results remains an issue. False-positive error propagation is still observed in methods using the well-established student-teacher framework, particularly for small-scale and low-light objects. This paper proposes a two-phase consistency unsupervised domain adaptation network, 2PCNet, to address these issues. The network employs high-confidence bounding-box predictions from the teacher in the first phase and appends them to the student's region proposals for the teacher to re-evaluate in the second phase, resulting in a combination of high and low confidence pseudo-labels. The night images and pseudo-labels are scaled-down before being used as input to the student, providing stronger small-scale pseudo-labels. To address errors that arise from low-light regions and other night-related attributes in images, we propose a night-specific augmentation pipeline called NightAug. This pipeline involves applying random augmentations, such as glare, blur, and noise, to daytime images. Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior results to state-of-the-art methods by 20\%, and to supervised models trained directly on the target data.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D human heads in low-view settings presents technical challenges, mainly due to the pronounced risk of overfitting with limited views and high-frequency signals. To address this, we propose geometry decomposition and adopt a two-stage, coarse-to-fine training strategy, allowing for progressively capturing high-frequency geometric details. We represent 3D human heads using the zero level-set of a combined signed distance field, comprising a smooth template, a non-rigid deformation, and a high-frequency displacement field. The template captures features that are independent of both identity and expression and is co-trained with the deformation network across multiple individuals with sparse and randomly selected views. The displacement field, capturing individual-specific details, undergoes separate training for each person. Our network training does not require 3D supervision or object masks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our geometry decomposition and two-stage training strategy. Our method outperforms existing neural rendering approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and novel view synthesis under low-view settings. Moreover, the pre-trained template serves a good initialization for our model when encountering unseen individuals.

- **Summary**: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to design machine learning algorithms that can continually learn new concepts from a few data points, without forgetting knowledge of old classes. The difficulty lies in that limited data from new classes not only lead to significant overfitting issues but also exacerbates the notorious catastrophic forgetting problems. However, existing FSCIL methods ignore the semantic relationships between sample-level and class-level. % Using the advantage that graph neural network (GNN) can mine rich information among few samples, In this paper, we designed a two-level graph network for FSCIL named Sample-level and Class-level Graph Neural Network (SCGN). Specifically, a pseudo incremental learning paradigm is designed in SCGN, which synthesizes virtual few-shot tasks as new tasks to optimize SCGN model parameters in advance. Sample-level graph network uses the relationship of a few samples to aggregate similar samples and obtains refined class-level features. Class-level graph network aims to mitigate the semantic conflict between prototype features of new classes and old classes. SCGN builds two-level graph networks to guarantee the latent semantic of each few-shot class can be effectively represented in FSCIL. Experiments on three popular benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the baselines and sets new state-of-the-art results with remarkable advantages.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation has made significant progress in recent years. Deep learning-based methods are recognized as data-hungry techniques, requiring large amounts of data with manual annotations. However, manual annotation is expensive in the field of medical image analysis, which requires domain-specific expertise. To address this challenge, few-shot learning has the potential to learn new classes from only a few examples. In this work, we propose a novel framework for few-shot medical image segmentation, termed CAT-Net, based on cross masked attention Transformer. Our proposed network mines the correlations between the support image and query image, limiting them to focus only on useful foreground information and boosting the representation capacity of both the support prototype and query features. We further design an iterative refinement framework that refines the query image segmentation iteratively and promotes the support feature in turn. We validated the proposed method on three public datasets: Abd-CT, Abd-MRI, and Card-MRI. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of each component. we will release the source codes of our method upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Owing to the extensive application of infrared object detectors in the safety-critical tasks, it is necessary to evaluate their robustness against adversarial examples in the real world. However, current few physical infrared attacks are complicated to implement in practical application because of their complex transformation from digital world to physical world. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a physically feasible infrared attack method called "adversarial infrared patches". Considering the imaging mechanism of infrared cameras by capturing objects' thermal radiation, adversarial infrared patches conduct attacks by attaching a patch of thermal insulation materials on the target object to manipulate its thermal distribution. To enhance adversarial attacks, we present a novel aggregation regularization to guide the simultaneous learning for the patch' shape and location on the target object. Thus, a simple gradient-based optimization can be adapted to solve for them. We verify adversarial infrared patches in different object detection tasks with various object detectors. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than 90\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) versus the pedestrian detector and vehicle detector in the physical environment, where the objects are captured in different angles, distances, postures, and scenes. More importantly, adversarial infrared patch is easy to implement, and it only needs 0.5 hours to be constructed in the physical world, which verifies its effectiveness and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Automatic 3D content creation has achieved rapid progress recently due to the availability of pre-trained, large language models and image diffusion models, forming the emerging topic of text-to-3D content creation. Existing text-to-3D methods commonly use implicit scene representations, which couple the geometry and appearance via volume rendering and are suboptimal in terms of recovering finer geometries and achieving photorealistic rendering; consequently, they are less effective for generating high-quality 3D assets. In this work, we propose a new method of Fantasia3D for high-quality text-to-3D content creation. Key to Fantasia3D is the disentangled modeling and learning of geometry and appearance. For geometry learning, we rely on a hybrid scene representation, and propose to encode surface normal extracted from the representation as the input of the image diffusion model. For appearance modeling, we introduce the spatially varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) into the text-to-3D task, and learn the surface material for photorealistic rendering of the generated surface. Our disentangled framework is more compatible with popular graphics engines, supporting relighting, editing, and physical simulation of the generated 3D assets. We conduct thorough experiments that show the advantages of our method over existing ones under different text-to-3D task settings. Project page and source codes: https://fantasia3d.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Recently, video moment retrieval and highlight detection (MR/HD) are being spotlighted as the demand for video understanding is drastically increased. The key objective of MR/HD is to localize the moment and estimate clip-wise accordance level, i.e., saliency score, to the given text query. Although the recent transformer-based models brought some advances, we found that these methods do not fully exploit the information of a given query. For example, the relevance between text query and video contents is sometimes neglected when predicting the moment and its saliency. To tackle this issue, we introduce Query-Dependent DETR (QD-DETR), a detection transformer tailored for MR/HD. As we observe the insignificant role of a given query in transformer architectures, our encoding module starts with cross-attention layers to explicitly inject the context of text query into video representation. Then, to enhance the model's capability of exploiting the query information, we manipulate the video-query pairs to produce irrelevant pairs. Such negative (irrelevant) video-query pairs are trained to yield low saliency scores, which in turn, encourages the model to estimate precise accordance between query-video pairs. Lastly, we present an input-adaptive saliency predictor which adaptively defines the criterion of saliency scores for the given video-query pairs. Our extensive studies verify the importance of building the query-dependent representation for MR/HD. Specifically, QD-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA datasets. Codes are available at github.com/wjun0830/QD-DETR.

- **Summary**: Compared with traditional RGB-only visual tracking, few datasets have been constructed for RGB-D tracking. In this paper, we propose ARKitTrack, a new RGB-D tracking dataset for both static and dynamic scenes captured by consumer-grade LiDAR scanners equipped on Apple's iPhone and iPad. ARKitTrack contains 300 RGB-D sequences, 455 targets, and 229.7K video frames in total. Along with the bounding box annotations and frame-level attributes, we also annotate this dataset with 123.9K pixel-level target masks. Besides, the camera intrinsic and camera pose of each frame are provided for future developments. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of this dataset, we further present a unified baseline for both box-level and pixel-level tracking, which integrates RGB features with bird's-eye-view representations to better explore cross-modality 3D geometry. In-depth empirical analysis has verified that the ARKitTrack dataset can significantly facilitate RGB-D tracking and that the proposed baseline method compares favorably against the state of the arts.

- **Summary**: We propose a new, simple framework for crafting adversarial examples for black box attacks. The idea is to simulate the substitution model with a non-trainable model compounded of just one layer of handcrafted convolutional kernels and then train the generator neural network to maximize the distance of the outputs for the original and generated adversarial image. We show that fooling the prediction of the first layer causes the whole network to be fooled and decreases its accuracy on adversarial inputs. Moreover, we do not train the neural network to obtain the first convolutional layer kernels, but we create them using the technique of F-transform. Therefore, our method is very time and resource effective.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have obtained impressive performance across tasks, however they still remain as black boxes, e.g., hard to theoretically analyze. At the same time, Polynomial Networks (PNs) have emerged as an alternative method with a promising performance and improved interpretability but have yet to reach the performance of the powerful DNN baselines. In this work, we aim to close this performance gap. We introduce a class of PNs, which are able to reach the performance of ResNet across a range of six benchmarks. We demonstrate that strong regularization is critical and conduct an extensive study of the exact regularization schemes required to match performance. To further motivate the regularization schemes, we introduce D-PolyNets that achieve a higher-degree of expansion than previously proposed polynomial networks. D-PolyNets are more parameter-efficient while achieving a similar performance as other polynomial networks. We expect that our new models can lead to an understanding of the role of elementwise activation functions (which are no longer required for training PNs).

- **Summary**: Although data-free incremental learning methods are memory-friendly, accurately estimating and counteracting representation shifts is challenging in the absence of historical data. This paper addresses this thorny problem by proposing a novel incremental learning method inspired by human analogy capabilities. Specifically, we design an analogy-making mechanism to remap the new data into the old class by prompt tuning. It mimics the feature distribution of the target old class on the old model using only samples of new classes. The learnt prompts are further used to estimate and counteract the representation shift caused by fine-tuning for the historical prototypes. The proposed method sets up new state-of-the-art performance on four incremental learning benchmarks under both the class and domain incremental learning settings. It consistently outperforms data-replay methods by only saving feature prototypes for each class. It has almost hit the empirical upper bound by joint training on the Core50 benchmark. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/ZhihengCV/A-Prompts}.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) intends to adapt the pretrained model to test distributions with only unlabeled test data streams. Most of the previous TTA methods have achieved great success on simple test data streams such as independently sampled data from single or multiple distributions. However, these attempts may fail in dynamic scenarios of real-world applications like autonomous driving, where the environments gradually change and the test data is sampled correlatively over time. In this work, we explore such practical test data streams to deploy the model on the fly, namely practical test-time adaptation (PTTA). To do so, we elaborate a Robust Test-Time Adaptation (RoTTA) method against the complex data stream in PTTA. More specifically, we present a robust batch normalization scheme to estimate the normalization statistics. Meanwhile, a memory bank is utilized to sample category-balanced data with consideration of timeliness and uncertainty. Further, to stabilize the training procedure, we develop a time-aware reweighting strategy with a teacher-student model. Extensive experiments prove that RoTTA enables continual testtime adaptation on the correlatively sampled data streams. Our method is easy to implement, making it a good choice for rapid deployment.

- **Summary**: Learning based single image super resolution (SISR) task is well investigated in 2D images. However, SISR for 3D Magnetics Resonance Images (MRI) is more challenging compared to 2D, mainly due to the increased number of neural network parameters, the larger memory requirement and the limited amount of available training data. Current SISR methods for 3D volumetric images are based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), especially Wasserstein GANs due to their training stability. Other common architectures in the 2D domain, e.g. transformer models, require large amounts of training data and are therefore not suitable for the limited 3D data. However, Wasserstein GANs can be problematic because they may not converge to a global optimum and thus produce blurry results. Here, we propose a new method for 3D SR based on the GAN framework. Specifically, we use instance noise to balance the GAN training. Furthermore, we use a relativistic GAN loss function and an updating feature extractor during the training process. We show that our method produces highly accurate results. We also show that we need very few training samples. In particular, we need less than 30 samples instead of thousands of training samples that are typically required in previous studies. Finally, we show improved out-of-sample results produced by our model.

- **Summary**: Garments are important to humans. A visual system that can estimate and track the complete garment pose can be useful for many downstream tasks and real-world applications. In this work, we present a complete package to address the category-level garment pose tracking task: (1) A recording system VR-Garment, with which users can manipulate virtual garment models in simulation through a VR interface. (2) A large-scale dataset VR-Folding, with complex garment pose configurations in manipulation like flattening and folding. (3) An end-to-end online tracking framework GarmentTracking, which predicts complete garment pose both in canonical space and task space given a point cloud sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GarmentTracking achieves great performance even when the garment has large non-rigid deformation. It outperforms the baseline approach on both speed and accuracy. We hope our proposed solution can serve as a platform for future research.

- **Summary**: Unprocessed sensor outputs (RAW images) potentially improve both low-level and high-level computer vision algorithms, but the lack of large-scale RAW image datasets is a barrier to research. Thus, reversed Image Signal Processing (ISP) which converts existing RGB images into RAW images has been studied. However, most existing methods require camera-specific metadata or paired RGB and RAW images to model the conversion, and they are not always available. In addition, there are issues in handling diverse ISPs and recovering global illumination. To tackle these limitations, we propose a self-supervised reversed ISP method that does not require metadata and paired images. The proposed method converts a RGB image into a RAW-like image taken in the same environment with the same sensor as a reference RAW image by dynamically selecting parameters of the reversed ISP pipeline based on the reference RAW image. The parameter selection is trained via pseudo paired data created from unpaired RGB and RAW images. We show that the proposed method is able to learn various reversed ISPs with comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art supervised methods and convert unknown RGB images from COCO and Flickr1M to target RAW-like images more accurately in terms of pixel distribution. We also demonstrate that our generated RAW images improve performance on real RAW image object detection task.

- **Summary**: We investigate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (including the modern ConvNeXt network family) to classify transient noise signals (i.e.~glitches) and gravitational waves in data from the Advanced LIGO detectors. First, we use models with a supervised learning approach, both trained from scratch using the Gravity Spy dataset and employing transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained models in this dataset. Second, we also explore a self-supervised approach, pre-training models with automatically generated pseudo-labels. Our findings are very close to existing results for the same dataset, reaching values for the F1 score of 97.18% (94.15%) for the best supervised (self-supervised) model. We further test the models using actual gravitational-wave signals from LIGO-Virgo's O3 run. Although trained using data from previous runs (O1 and O2), the models show good performance, in particular when using transfer learning. We find that transfer learning improves the scores without the need for any training on real signals apart from the less than 50 chirp examples from hardware injections present in the Gravity Spy dataset. This motivates the use of transfer learning not only for glitch classification but also for signal classification.

- **Summary**: Confounding information in the form of text or markings embedded in medical images can severely affect the training of diagnostic deep learning algorithms. However, data collected for clinical purposes often have such markings embedded in them. In dermatology, known examples include drawings or rulers that are overrepresented in images of malignant lesions. In this paper, we encounter text and calipers placed on the images found in national databases containing fetal screening ultrasound scans, which correlate with standard planes to be predicted. In order to utilize the vast amounts of data available in these databases, we develop and validate a series of methods for minimizing the confounding effects of embedded text and calipers on deep learning algorithms designed for ultrasound, using standard plane classification as a test case.

- **Summary**: The Transformer has quickly become the dominant architecture for various pattern recognition tasks due to its capacity for long-range representation. However, transformers are data-hungry models and need large datasets for training. In Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), collecting a massive amount of labeled data is a complicated and expensive task. In this paper, we propose a lite transformer architecture for full-page multi-script handwriting recognition. The proposed model comes with three advantages: First, to solve the common problem of data scarcity, we propose a lite transformer model that can be trained on a reasonable amount of data, which is the case of most HTR public datasets, without the need for external data. Second, it can learn the reading order at page-level thanks to a curriculum learning strategy, allowing it to avoid line segmentation errors, exploit a larger context and reduce the need for costly segmentation annotations. Third, it can be easily adapted to other scripts by applying a simple transfer-learning process using only page-level labeled images. Extensive experiments on different datasets with different scripts (French, English, Spanish, and Arabic) show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most common management tool used to characterize neurological disorders based on brain tissue contrasts. However, acquiring high-resolution MRI scans is time-consuming and infeasible under specific conditions. Hence, multi-contrast super-resolution methods have been developed to improve the quality of low-resolution contrasts by leveraging complementary information from multi-contrast MRI. Current deep learning-based super-resolution methods have limitations in estimating restoration uncertainty and avoiding mode collapse. Although the diffusion model has emerged as a promising approach for image enhancement, capturing complex interactions between multiple conditions introduced by multi-contrast MRI super-resolution remains a challenge for clinical applications. In this paper, we propose a disentangled conditional diffusion model, DisC-Diff, for multi-contrast brain MRI super-resolution. It utilizes the sampling-based generation and simple objective function of diffusion models to estimate uncertainty in restorations effectively and ensure a stable optimization process. Moreover, DisC-Diff leverages a disentangled multi-stream network to fully exploit complementary information from multi-contrast MRI, improving model interpretation under multiple conditions of multi-contrast inputs. We validated the effectiveness of DisC-Diff on two datasets: the IXI dataset, which contains 578 normal brains, and a clinical dataset with 316 pathological brains. Our experimental results demonstrate that DisC-Diff outperforms other state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.

- **Summary**: Neural view synthesis (NVS) is one of the most successful techniques for synthesizing free viewpoint videos, capable of achieving high fidelity from only a sparse set of captured images. This success has led to many variants of the techniques, each evaluated on a set of test views typically using image quality metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, or LPIPS. There has been a lack of research on how NVS methods perform with respect to perceived video quality. We present the first study on perceptual evaluation of NVS and NeRF variants. For this study, we collected two datasets of scenes captured in a controlled lab environment as well as in-the-wild. In contrast to existing datasets, these scenes come with reference video sequences, allowing us to test for temporal artifacts and subtle distortions that are easily overlooked when viewing only static images. We measured the quality of videos synthesized by several NVS methods in a well-controlled perceptual quality assessment experiment as well as with many existing state-of-the-art image/video quality metrics. We present a detailed analysis of the results and recommendations for dataset and metric selection for NVS evaluation.

- **Summary**: Place recognition is an essential and challenging task in loop closing and global localization for robotics and autonomous driving applications. Benefiting from the recent advances in deep learning techniques, the performance of LiDAR place recognition (LPR) has been greatly improved. However, current deep learning-based methods suffer from two major problems: poor generalization ability and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a continual contrastive learning method, named CCL, to tackle the catastrophic forgetting problem and generally improve the robustness of LPR approaches. Our CCL constructs a contrastive feature pool and utilizes contrastive loss to train more transferable representations of places. When transferred into new environments, our CCL continuously reviews the contrastive memory bank and applies a distribution-based knowledge distillation to maintain the retrieval ability of the past data while continually learning to recognize new places from the new data. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on Oxford, MulRan, and PNV datasets using three different LPR methods. The experimental results show that our CCL consistently improves the performance of different methods in different environments outperforming the state-of-the-art continual learning method. The implementation of our method has been released at https://github.com/cloudcjf/CCL.

- **Summary**: Both indoor and outdoor environments are inherently structured and repetitive. Traditional modeling pipelines keep an asset library storing unique object templates, which is both versatile and memory efficient in practice. Inspired by this observation, we propose AssetField, a novel neural scene representation that learns a set of object-aware ground feature planes to represent the scene, where an asset library storing template feature patches can be constructed in an unsupervised manner. Unlike existing methods which require object masks to query spatial points for object editing, our ground feature plane representation offers a natural visualization of the scene in the bird-eye view, allowing a variety of operations (e.g. translation, duplication, deformation) on objects to configure a new scene. With the template feature patches, group editing is enabled for scenes with many recurring items to avoid repetitive work on object individuals. We show that AssetField not only achieves competitive performance for novel-view synthesis but also generates realistic renderings for new scene configurations.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training has been demonstrated to be the most effective approach to defend against adversarial attacks. However, existing adversarial training methods show apparent oscillations and overfitting issue in the training process, degrading the defense efficacy. In this work, we propose a novel framework, termed Parameter Interpolation based Adversarial Training (PIAT), that makes full use of the historical information during training. Specifically, at the end of each epoch, PIAT tunes the model parameters as the interpolation of the parameters of the previous and current epochs. Besides, we suggest to use the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) to further improve the robustness by aligning the clean and adversarial examples. Compared with other regularization methods, NMSE focuses more on the relative magnitude of the logits rather than the absolute magnitude. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and various networks show that our method could prominently improve the model robustness and reduce the generalization error. Moreover, our framework is general and could further boost the robust accuracy when combined with other adversarial training methods.

- **Summary**: Distributed sparse block codes (SBCs) exhibit compact representations for encoding and manipulating symbolic data structures using fixed-with vectors. One major challenge however is to disentangle, or factorize, such data structures into their constituent elements without having to search through all possible combinations. This factorization becomes more challenging when queried by noisy SBCs wherein symbol representations are relaxed due to perceptual uncertainty and approximations made when modern neural networks are used to generate the query vectors. To address these challenges, we first propose a fast and highly accurate method for factorizing a more flexible and hence generalized form of SBCs, dubbed GSBCs. Our iterative factorizer introduces a threshold-based nonlinear activation, a conditional random sampling, and an $\ell_\infty$-based similarity metric. Its random sampling mechanism in combination with the search in superposition allows to analytically determine the expected number of decoding iterations, which matches the empirical observations up to the GSBC's bundling capacity. Secondly, the proposed factorizer maintains its high accuracy when queried by noisy product vectors generated using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This facilitates its application in replacing the large fully connected layer (FCL) in CNNs, whereby C trainable class vectors, or attribute combinations, can be implicitly represented by our factorizer having F-factor codebooks, each with $\sqrt[\leftroot{-2}\uproot{2}F]{C}$ fixed codevectors. We provide a methodology to flexibly integrate our factorizer in the classification layer of CNNs with a novel loss function. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on four deep CNN architectures over CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and RAVEN datasets. In all use cases, the number of parameters and operations are significantly reduced compared to the FCL.

- **Summary**: 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) is an ill-posed task that requires inferring a dense 3D scene from incomplete observations. Previous methods either explicitly incorporate 3D geometric input or rely on learnt 3D prior behind monocular RGB images. However, 3D sensors such as LiDAR are expensive and intrusive while monocular cameras face challenges in modeling precise geometry due to the inherent ambiguity. In this work, we propose StereoScene for 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC), which explores taking full advantage of light-weight camera inputs without resorting to any external 3D sensors. Our key insight is to leverage stereo matching to resolve geometric ambiguity. To improve its robustness in unmatched areas, we introduce bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation to inspire hallucination ability with rich context information. On top of the stereo and BEV representations, a mutual interactive aggregation (MIA) module is carefully devised to fully unleash their power. Specifically, a Bi-directional Interaction Transformer (BIT) augmented with confidence re-weighting is used to encourage reliable prediction through mutual guidance while a Dual Volume Aggregation (DVA) module is designed to facilitate complementary aggregation. Experimental results on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that the proposed StereoScene outperforms the state-of-the-art camera-based methods by a large margin with a relative improvement of 26.9% in geometry and 38.6% in semantic.

- **Summary**: It is important to quantify the uncertainty of input samples, especially in mission-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare, where failure predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data are likely to cause big problems. OOD detection problem fundamentally begins in that the model cannot express what it is not aware of. Post-hoc OOD detection approaches are widely explored because they do not require an additional re-training process which might degrade the model's performance and increase the training cost. In this study, from the perspective of neurons in the deep layer of the model representing high-level features, we introduce a new aspect for analyzing the difference in model outputs between in-distribution data and OOD data. We propose a novel method, Leveraging Important Neurons (LINe), for post-hoc Out of distribution detection.   Shapley value-based pruning reduces the effects of noisy outputs by selecting only high-contribution neurons for predicting specific classes of input data and masking the rest. Activation clipping fixes all values above a certain threshold into the same value, allowing LINe to treat all the class-specific features equally and just consider the difference between the number of activated feature differences between in-distribution and OOD data. Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by outperforming state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets.

- **Summary**: Purely MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF-based methods) often suffer from underfitting with blurred renderings on large-scale scenes due to limited model capacity. Recent approaches propose to geographically divide the scene and adopt multiple sub-NeRFs to model each region individually, leading to linear scale-up in training costs and the number of sub-NeRFs as the scene expands. An alternative solution is to use a feature grid representation, which is computationally efficient and can naturally scale to a large scene with increased grid resolutions. However, the feature grid tends to be less constrained and often reaches suboptimal solutions, producing noisy artifacts in renderings, especially in regions with complex geometry and texture. In this work, we present a new framework that realizes high-fidelity rendering on large urban scenes while being computationally efficient. We propose to use a compact multiresolution ground feature plane representation to coarsely capture the scene, and complement it with positional encoding inputs through another NeRF branch for rendering in a joint learning fashion. We show that such an integration can utilize the advantages of two alternative solutions: a light-weighted NeRF is sufficient, under the guidance of the feature grid representation, to render photorealistic novel views with fine details; and the jointly optimized ground feature planes, can meanwhile gain further refinements, forming a more accurate and compact feature space and output much more natural rendering results.

- **Summary**: Face morphing attacks have emerged as a potential threat, particularly in automatic border control scenarios. Morphing attacks permit more than one individual to use travel documents that can be used to cross borders using automatic border control gates. The potential for morphing attacks depends on the selection of data subjects (accomplice and malicious actors). This work investigates lookalike and identical twins as the source of face morphing generation. We present a systematic study on benchmarking the vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) to lookalike and identical twin morphing images. Therefore, we constructed new face morphing datasets using 16 pairs of identical twin and lookalike data subjects. Morphing images from lookalike and identical twins are generated using a landmark-based method. Extensive experiments are carried out to benchmark the attack potential of lookalike and identical twins. Furthermore, experiments are designed to provide insights into the impact of vulnerability with normal face morphing compared with lookalike and identical twin face morphing.

- **Summary**: Unlike most previous HOI methods that focus on learning better human-object features, we propose a novel and complementary approach called category query learning. Such queries are explicitly associated to interaction categories, converted to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder, and learnt via an auxiliary image-level classification task. This idea is motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the first time applied for the challenging human-object interaction classification task. Our method is simple, general and effective. It is validated on three representative HOI baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks.

Nonetheless, there still remains a displeasing problem if one wants to improve perceptual quality and quantitative scores of recovered image at the same time. In this study, drawing inspiration from the research of transformer properties, we introduce the pretrained transformers to address this problem. In particular, we leverage deep features extracted from a pretrained vision transformer (ViT) to encourage recovered images to be sharp without sacrificing the performance measured by the quantitative metrics. The pretrained transformer can capture the global topological relations (i.e., self-similarity) of image, and we observe that the captured topological relations about the sharp image will change when blur occurs. By comparing the transformer features between recovered image and target one, the pretrained transformer provides high-resolution blur-sensitive semantic information, which is critical in measuring the sharpness of the deblurred image. On the basis of the advantages, we present two types of novel perceptual losses to guide image deblurring. One regards the features as vectors and computes the discrepancy between representations extracted from recovered image and target one in Euclidean space. The other type considers the features extracted from an image as a distribution and compares the distribution discrepancy between recovered image and target one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer properties in improving the perceptual quality while not sacrificing the quantitative scores (PSNR) over the most competitive models, such as Uformer, Restormer, and NAFNet, on defocus deblurring and motion deblurring tasks.

- **Summary**: Content and style disentanglement is an effective way to achieve few-shot font generation. It allows to transfer the style of the font image in a source domain to the style defined with a few reference images in a target domain. However, the content feature extracted using a representative font might not be optimal. In light of this, we propose a content fusion module (CFM) to project the content feature into a linear space defined by the content features of basis fonts, which can take the variation of content features caused by different fonts into consideration. Our method also allows to optimize the style representation vector of reference images through a lightweight iterative style-vector refinement (ISR) strategy. Moreover, we treat the 1D projection of a character image as a probability distribution and leverage the distance between two distributions as the reconstruction loss (namely projected character loss, PCL). Compared to L2 or L1 reconstruction loss, the distribution distance pays more attention to the global shape of characters. We have evaluated our method on a dataset of 300 fonts with 6.5k characters each. Experimental results verify that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot font generation methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces an end-to-end residual network that operates entirely on the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic learning has recently shown great potential for visual understanding, but is currently only performed in the penultimate layer(s) of deep networks. All visual representations are still learned through standard Euclidean networks. In this paper we investigate how to learn hyperbolic representations of visual data directly from the pixel-level. We propose Poincar\'e ResNet, a hyperbolic counterpart of the celebrated residual network, starting from Poincar\'e 2D convolutions up to Poincar\'e residual connections. We identify three roadblocks for training convolutional networks entirely in hyperbolic space and propose a solution for each: (i) Current hyperbolic network initializations collapse to the origin, limiting their applicability in deeper networks. We provide an identity-based initialization that preserves norms over many layers. (ii) Residual networks rely heavily on batch normalization, which comes with expensive Fr\'echet mean calculations in hyperbolic space. We introduce Poincar\'e midpoint batch normalization as a faster and equally effective alternative. (iii) Due to the many intermediate operations in Poincar\'e layers, we lastly find that the computation graphs of deep learning libraries blow up, limiting our ability to train on deep hyperbolic networks. We provide manual backward derivations of core hyperbolic operations to maintain manageable computation graphs.

- **Summary**: The state of the arts in vision-language pretraining (VLP) achieves exemplary performance but suffers from high training costs resulting from slow convergence and long training time, especially on large-scale web datasets. An essential obstacle to training efficiency lies in the entangled prediction rate (percentage of tokens for reconstruction) and corruption rate (percentage of corrupted tokens) in masked language modeling (MLM), that is, a proper corruption rate is achieved at the cost of a large portion of output tokens being excluded from prediction loss. To accelerate the convergence of VLP, we propose a new pretraining task, namely, free language modeling (FLM), that enables a 100% prediction rate with arbitrary corruption rates. FLM successfully frees the prediction rate from the tie-up with the corruption rate while allowing the corruption spans to be customized for each token to be predicted. FLM-trained models are encouraged to learn better and faster given the same GPU time by exploiting bidirectional contexts more flexibly. Extensive experiments show FLM could achieve an impressive 2.5x pretraining time reduction in comparison to the MLM-based methods, while keeping competitive performance on both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. Code will be public at https://github.com/TencentARC/FLM.

- **Summary**: Exemplar-based class-incremental learning (CIL) finetunes the model with all samples of new classes but few-shot exemplars of old classes in each incremental phase, where the "few-shot" abides by the limited memory budget. In this paper, we break this "few-shot" limit based on a simple yet surprisingly effective idea: compressing exemplars by downsampling non-discriminative pixels and saving "many-shot" compressed exemplars in the memory. Without needing any manual annotation, we achieve this compression by generating 0-1 masks on discriminative pixels from class activation maps (CAM). We propose an adaptive mask generation model called class-incremental masking (CIM) to explicitly resolve two difficulties of using CAM: 1) transforming the heatmaps of CAM to 0-1 masks with an arbitrary threshold leads to a trade-off between the coverage on discriminative pixels and the quantity of exemplars, as the total memory is fixed; and 2) optimal thresholds vary for different object classes, which is particularly obvious in the dynamic environment of CIL. We optimize the CIM model alternatively with the conventional CIL model through a bilevel optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on high-resolution CIL benchmarks including Food-101, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1000, and show that using the compressed exemplars by CIM can achieve a new state-of-the-art CIL accuracy, e.g., 4.8 percentage points higher than FOSTER on 10-Phase ImageNet-1000.

- **Summary**: It is still an interesting and challenging problem to synthesize a vivid and realistic singing face driven by music signal. In this paper, we present a method for this task with natural motions of the lip, facial expression, head pose, and eye states. Due to the coupling of the mixed information of human voice and background music in common signals of music audio, we design a decouple-and-fuse strategy to tackle the challenge. We first decompose the input music audio into human voice stream and background music stream. Due to the implicit and complicated correlation between the two-stream input signals and the dynamics of the facial expressions, head motions and eye states, we model their relationship with an attention scheme, where the effects of the two streams are fused seamlessly. Furthermore, to improve the expressiveness of the generated results, we propose to decompose head movements generation into speed generation and direction generation, and decompose eye states generation into the short-time eye blinking generation and the long-time eye closing generation to model them separately. We also build a novel SingingFace Dataset to support the training and evaluation of this task, and to facilitate future works on this topic. Extensive experiments and user study show that our proposed method is capable of synthesizing vivid singing face, which is better than state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Large pre-trained vision-language (VL) models have shown significant promise in adapting to various downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning the entire network is challenging due to the massive number of model parameters. To address this issue, efficient adaptation methods such as prompt tuning have been proposed. We explore the idea of prompt tuning with multi-task pre-trained initialization and find it can significantly improve model performance. Based on our findings, we introduce a new model, termed Prompt-Adapter, that combines pre-trained prompt tunning with an efficient adaptation network. Our approach beat the state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image classification on the public 11 datasets, especially in settings with limited data instances such as 1 shot, 2 shots, 4 shots, and 8 shots images. Our proposed method demonstrates the promise of combining prompt tuning and parameter-efficient networks for efficient vision-language model adaptation.

- **Summary**: Searching by image is popular yet still challenging due to the extensive interference arose from i) data variations (e.g., background, pose, visual angle, brightness) of real-world captured images and ii) similar images in the query dataset. This paper studies a practically meaningful problem of beauty product retrieval (BPR) by neural networks. We broadly extract different types of image features, and raise an intriguing question that whether these features are beneficial to i) suppress data variations of real-world captured images, and ii) distinguish one image from others which look very similar but are intrinsically different beauty products in the dataset, therefore leading to an enhanced capability of BPR. To answer it, we present a novel variable-attention neural network to understand the combination of multiple features (termed VM-Net) of beauty product images. Considering that there are few publicly released training datasets for BPR, we establish a new dataset with more than one million images classified into more than 20K categories to improve both the generalization and anti-interference abilities of VM-Net and other methods. We verify the performance of VM-Net and its competitors on the benchmark dataset Perfect-500K, where VM-Net shows clear improvements over the competitors in terms of MAP@7. The source code and dataset will be released upon publication.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks can be easily fooled into making incorrect predictions through corruption of the input by adversarial perturbations: human-imperceptible artificial noise. So far adversarial training has been the most successful defense against such adversarial attacks. This work focuses on improving adversarial training to boost adversarial robustness. We first analyze, from an instance-wise perspective, how adversarial vulnerability evolves during adversarial training. We find that during training an overall reduction of adversarial loss is achieved by sacrificing a considerable proportion of training samples to be more vulnerable to adversarial attack, which results in an uneven distribution of adversarial vulnerability among data. Such "uneven vulnerability", is prevalent across several popular robust training methods and, more importantly, relates to overfitting in adversarial training. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new adversarial training method: Instance-adaptive Smoothness Enhanced Adversarial Training (ISEAT). It jointly smooths both input and weight loss landscapes in an adaptive, instance-specific, way to enhance robustness more for those samples with higher adversarial vulnerability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing defense methods. Noticeably, our method, when combined with the latest data augmentation and semi-supervised learning techniques, achieves state-of-the-art robustness against $\ell_{\infty}$-norm constrained attacks on CIFAR10 of 59.32% for Wide ResNet34-10 without extra data, and 61.55% for Wide ResNet28-10 with extra data.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel data augmentation approach, DistractFlow, for training optical flow estimation models by introducing realistic distractions to the input frames. Based on a mixing ratio, we combine one of the frames in the pair with a distractor image depicting a similar domain, which allows for inducing visual perturbations congruent with natural objects and scenes. We refer to such pairs as distracted pairs. Our intuition is that using semantically meaningful distractors enables the model to learn related variations and attain robustness against challenging deviations, compared to conventional augmentation schemes focusing only on low-level aspects and modifications. More specifically, in addition to the supervised loss computed between the estimated flow for the original pair and its ground-truth flow, we include a second supervised loss defined between the distracted pair's flow and the original pair's ground-truth flow, weighted with the same mixing ratio. Furthermore, when unlabeled data is available, we extend our augmentation approach to self-supervised settings through pseudo-labeling and cross-consistency regularization. Given an original pair and its distracted version, we enforce the estimated flow on the distracted pair to agree with the flow of the original pair. Our approach allows increasing the number of available training pairs significantly without requiring additional annotations. It is agnostic to the model architecture and can be applied to training any optical flow estimation models. Our extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks, including Sintel, KITTI, and SlowFlow, show that DistractFlow improves existing models consistently, outperforming the latest state of the art.

- **Summary**: Medical datasets and especially biobanks, often contain extensive tabular data with rich clinical information in addition to images. In practice, clinicians typically have less data, both in terms of diversity and scale, but still wish to deploy deep learning solutions. Combined with increasing medical dataset sizes and expensive annotation costs, the necessity for unsupervised methods that can pretrain multimodally and predict unimodally has risen.   To address these needs, we propose the first self-supervised contrastive learning framework that takes advantage of images and tabular data to train unimodal encoders. Our solution combines SimCLR and SCARF, two leading contrastive learning strategies, and is simple and effective. In our experiments, we demonstrate the strength of our framework by predicting risks of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease (CAD) using cardiac MR images and 120 clinical features from 40,000 UK Biobank subjects. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our approach to natural images using the DVM car advertisement dataset.   We take advantage of the high interpretability of tabular data and through attribution and ablation experiments find that morphometric tabular features, describing size and shape, have outsized importance during the contrastive learning process and improve the quality of the learned embeddings. Finally, we introduce a novel form of supervised contrastive learning, label as a feature (LaaF), by appending the ground truth label as a tabular feature during multimodal pretraining, outperforming all supervised contrastive baselines.

- **Summary**: MRI synthesis promises to mitigate the challenge of missing MRI modality in clinical practice. Diffusion model has emerged as an effective technique for image synthesis by modelling complex and variable data distributions. However, most diffusion-based MRI synthesis models are using a single modality. As they operate in the original image domain, they are memory-intensive and less feasible for multi-modal synthesis. Moreover, they often fail to preserve the anatomical structure in MRI. Further, balancing the multiple conditions from multi-modal MRI inputs is crucial for multi-modal synthesis. Here, we propose the first diffusion-based multi-modality MRI synthesis model, namely Conditioned Latent Diffusion Model (CoLa-Diff). To reduce memory consumption, we design CoLa-Diff to operate in the latent space. We propose a novel network architecture, e.g., similar cooperative filtering, to solve the possible compression and noise in latent space. To better maintain the anatomical structure, brain region masks are introduced as the priors of density distributions to guide diffusion process. We further present auto-weight adaptation to employ multi-modal information effectively. Our experiments demonstrate that CoLa-Diff outperforms other state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods, promising to serve as an effective tool for multi-modal MRI synthesis.

- **Summary**: Openable part detection is the task of detecting the openable parts of an object in a single-view image, and predicting corresponding motion parameters. Prior work investigated the unrealistic setting where all input images only contain a single openable object. We generalize this task to scenes with multiple objects each potentially possessing openable parts, and create a corresponding dataset based on real-world scenes. We then address this more challenging scenario with OPDFormer: a part-aware transformer architecture. Our experiments show that the OPDFormer architecture significantly outperforms prior work. The more realistic multiple-object scenarios we investigated remain challenging for all methods, indicating opportunities for future work.

- **Summary**: In Computed Tomography, machine learning is often used for automated data processing. However, increasing model complexity is accompanied by increasingly large volume datasets, which in turn increases the cost of model training. Unlike most work that mitigates this by advancing model architectures and training algorithms, we consider the annotation procedure and its effect on the model performance. We assume three main virtues of a good dataset collected for a model training to be label quality, diversity, and completeness. We compare the effects of those virtues on the model performance using open medical CT datasets and conclude, that quality is more important than diversity early during labeling; the diversity, in turn, is more important than completeness. Based on this conclusion and additional experiments, we propose a labeling procedure for the segmentation of tomographic images to minimize efforts spent on labeling while maximizing the model performance.

- **Summary**: Realistic face rendering from multi-view images is beneficial to various computer vision and graphics applications. Due to the complex spatially-varying reflectance properties and geometry characteristics of faces, however, it remains challenging to recover 3D facial representations both faithfully and efficiently in the current studies. This paper presents a novel 3D face rendering model, namely NeuFace, to learn accurate and physically-meaningful underlying 3D representations by neural rendering techniques. It naturally incorporates the neural BRDFs into physically based rendering, capturing sophisticated facial geometry and appearance clues in a collaborative manner. Specifically, we introduce an approximated BRDF integration and a simple yet new low-rank prior, which effectively lower the ambiguities and boost the performance of the facial BRDFs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of NeuFace in human face rendering, along with a decent generalization ability to common objects.

- **Summary**: Visual place recognition has gained significant attention in recent years as a crucial technology in autonomous driving and robotics. Currently, the two main approaches are the perspective view retrieval (P2P) paradigm and the equirectangular image retrieval (E2E) paradigm. However, it is practical and natural to assume that users only have consumer-grade pinhole cameras to obtain query perspective images and retrieve them in panoramic database images from map providers. To address this, we propose \textit{PanoVPR}, a perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) visual place recognition framework that employs sliding windows to eliminate feature truncation caused by hard cropping. Specifically, PanoVPR slides windows over the entire equirectangular image and computes feature descriptors for each window, which are then compared to determine place similarity. Notably, our unified framework enables direct transfer of the backbone from P2P methods without any modification, supporting not only CNNs but also Transformers. To facilitate training and evaluation, we derive the Pitts250k-P2E dataset from the Pitts250k and establish YQ360, latter is the first P2E visual place recognition dataset collected by a mobile robot platform aiming to simulate real-world task scenarios better. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PanoVPR achieves state-of-the-art performance and obtains 3.8% and 8.0% performance gain on Pitts250k-P2E and YQ360 compared to the previous best method, respectively. Code and datasets will be publicly available at https://github.com/zafirshi/PanoVPR.

- **Summary**: In practical scenarios where training data is limited, many predictive signals in the data can be rather from some biases in data acquisition (i.e., less generalizable), so that one cannot prevent a model from co-adapting on such (so-called) "shortcut" signals: this makes the model fragile in various distribution shifts. To bypass such failure modes, we consider an adversarial threat model under a mutual information constraint to cover a wider class of perturbations in training. This motivates us to extend the standard information bottleneck to additionally model the nuisance information. We propose an autoencoder-based training to implement the objective, as well as practical encoder designs to facilitate the proposed hybrid discriminative-generative training concerning both convolutional- and Transformer-based architectures. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves robustness of learned representations (remarkably without using any domain-specific knowledge), with respect to multiple challenging reliability measures. For example, our model could advance the state-of-the-art on a recent challenging OBJECTS benchmark in novelty detection by $78.4\% \rightarrow 87.2\%$ in AUROC, while simultaneously enjoying improved corruption, background and (certified) adversarial robustness.

- **Summary**: The impact of a drop on a solid surface is an important phenomenon that has various implications and applications. However, the multiphase nature of this phenomenon causes complications in the prediction of its morphological evolution, especially when the drop splashes. While most machine-learning-based drop-impact studies have centred around physical parameters, this study used a computer-vision strategy by training an encoder-decoder to predict the drop morphologies using image data. Herein, we show that this trained encoder-decoder is able to successfully generate videos that show the morphologies of splashing and non-splashing drops. Remarkably, in each frame of these generated videos, the spreading diameter of the drop was found to be in good agreement with that of the actual videos. Moreover, there was also a high accuracy in splashing/non-splashing prediction. These findings demonstrate the ability of the trained encoder-decoder to generate videos that can accurately represent the drop morphologies. This approach provides a faster and cheaper alternative to experimental and numerical studies.

- **Summary**: Neuromorphic (event-based) image sensors draw inspiration from the human-retina to create an electronic device that can process visual stimuli in a way that closely resembles its biological counterpart. These sensors process information significantly different than the traditional RGB sensors. Specifically, the sensory information generated by event-based image sensors are orders of magnitude sparser compared to that of RGB sensors. The first generation of neuromorphic image sensors, Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), are inspired by the computations confined to the photoreceptors and the first retinal synapse. In this work, we highlight the capability of the second generation of neuromorphic image sensors, Integrated Retinal Functionality in CMOS Image Sensors (IRIS), which aims to mimic full retinal computations from photoreceptors to output of the retina (retinal ganglion cells) for targeted feature-extraction. The feature of choice in this work is Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS) that is processed locally in the IRIS sensor. Our results show that OMS can accomplish standard computer vision tasks with similar efficiency to conventional RGB and DVS solutions but offers drastic bandwidth reduction. This cuts the wireless and computing power budgets and opens up vast opportunities in high-speed, robust, energy-efficient, and low-bandwidth real-time decision making.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks for scene perception in automated vehicles achieve excellent results for the domains they were trained on. However, in real-world conditions, the domain of operation and its underlying data distribution are subject to change. Adverse weather conditions, in particular, can significantly decrease model performance when such data are not available during training.Additionally, when a model is incrementally adapted to a new domain, it suffers from catastrophic forgetting, causing a significant drop in performance on previously observed domains. Despite recent progress in reducing catastrophic forgetting, its causes and effects remain obscure. Therefore, we study how the representations of semantic segmentation models are affected during domain-incremental learning in adverse weather conditions. Our experiments and representational analyses indicate that catastrophic forgetting is primarily caused by changes to low-level features in domain-incremental learning and that learning more general features on the source domain using pre-training and image augmentations leads to efficient feature reuse in subsequent tasks, which drastically reduces catastrophic forgetting. These findings highlight the importance of methods that facilitate generalized features for effective continual learning algorithms.

- **Summary**: With the dramatic advances in deep learning technology, machine learning research is focusing on improving the interpretability of model predictions as well as prediction performance in both basic and applied research. While deep learning models have much higher prediction performance than traditional machine learning models, the specific prediction process is still difficult to interpret and/or explain. This is known as the black-boxing of machine learning models and is recognized as a particularly important problem in a wide range of research fields, including manufacturing, commerce, robotics, and other industries where the use of such technology has become commonplace, as well as the medical field, where mistakes are not tolerated. This bulletin is based on the summary of the author's dissertation. The research summarized in the dissertation focuses on the attention mechanism, which has been the focus of much attention in recent years, and discusses its potential for both basic research in terms of improving prediction performance and interpretability, and applied research in terms of evaluating it for real-world applications using large data sets beyond the laboratory environment. The dissertation also concludes with a summary of the implications of these findings for subsequent research and future prospects in the field.

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning is a challenging problem since only a few examples are provided to recognize a new class. Several recent studies exploit additional semantic information, e.g. text embeddings of class names, to address the issue of rare samples through combining semantic prototypes with visual prototypes. However, these methods still suffer from the spurious visual features learned from the rare support samples, resulting in limited benefits. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic Prompt (SP) approach for few-shot learning. Instead of the naive exploitation of semantic information for remedying classifiers, we explore leveraging semantic information as prompts to tune the visual feature extraction network adaptively. Specifically, we design two complementary mechanisms to insert semantic prompts into the feature extractor: one is to enable the interaction between semantic prompts and patch embeddings along the spatial dimension via self-attention, another is to supplement visual features with the transformed semantic prompts along the channel dimension. By combining these two mechanisms, the feature extractor presents a better ability to attend to the class-specific features and obtains more generalized image representations with merely a few support samples. Through extensive experiments on four datasets, the proposed approach achieves promising results, improving the 1-shot learning accuracy by 3.67% on average.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representations (INR) have gained increasing attention in representing 3D scenes and images, and have been recently applied to encode videos (e.g., NeRV, E-NeRV). While achieving promising results, existing INR-based methods are limited to encoding a handful of short videos (e.g., seven 5-second videos in the UVG dataset) with redundant visual content, leading to a model design that fits individual video frames independently and is not efficiently scalable to a large number of diverse videos. This paper focuses on developing neural representations for a more practical setup -- encoding long and/or a large number of videos with diverse visual content. We first show that instead of dividing videos into small subsets and encoding them with separate models, encoding long and diverse videos jointly with a unified model achieves better compression results. Based on this observation, we propose D-NeRV, a novel neural representation framework designed to encode diverse videos by (i) decoupling clip-specific visual content from motion information, (ii) introducing temporal reasoning into the implicit neural network, and (iii) employing the task-oriented flow as intermediate output to reduce spatial redundancies. Our new model largely surpasses NeRV and traditional video compression techniques on UCF101 and UVG datasets on the video compression task. Moreover, when used as an efficient data-loader, D-NeRV achieves 3%-10% higher accuracy than NeRV on action recognition tasks on the UCF101 dataset under the same compression ratios.

- **Summary**: Recent technological advances in synthetic data have enabled the generation of images with such high quality that human beings cannot tell the difference between real-life photographs and Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated images. Given the critical necessity of data reliability and authentication, this article proposes to enhance our ability to recognise AI-generated images through computer vision. Initially, a synthetic dataset is generated that mirrors the ten classes of the already available CIFAR-10 dataset with latent diffusion which provides a contrasting set of images for comparison to real photographs. The model is capable of generating complex visual attributes, such as photorealistic reflections in water. The two sets of data present as a binary classification problem with regard to whether the photograph is real or generated by AI. This study then proposes the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images into two categories; Real or Fake. Following hyperparameter tuning and the training of 36 individual network topologies, the optimal approach could correctly classify the images with 92.98% accuracy. Finally, this study implements explainable AI via Gradient Class Activation Mapping to explore which features within the images are useful for classification. Interpretation reveals interesting concepts within the image, in particular, noting that the actual entity itself does not hold useful information for classification; instead, the model focuses on small visual imperfections in the background of the images. The complete dataset engineered for this study, referred to as the CIFAKE dataset, is made publicly available to the research community for future work.

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques have achieved superior performance in computer-aided medical image analysis, yet they are still vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial attacks, resulting in potential misdiagnosis in clinical practice. Oppositely, recent years have also witnessed remarkable progress in defense against these tailored adversarial examples in deep medical diagnosis systems. In this exposition, we present a comprehensive survey on recent advances in adversarial attack and defense for medical image analysis with a novel taxonomy in terms of the application scenario. We also provide a unified theoretical framework for different types of adversarial attack and defense methods for medical image analysis. For a fair comparison, we establish a new benchmark for adversarially robust medical diagnosis models obtained by adversarial training under various scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey paper that provides a thorough evaluation of adversarially robust medical diagnosis models. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative results, we conclude this survey with a detailed discussion of current challenges for adversarial attack and defense in medical image analysis systems to shed light on future research directions.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing visual stimuli from measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been a meaningful and challenging task. Previous studies have successfully achieved reconstructions with structures similar to the original images, such as the outlines and size of some natural images. However, these reconstructions lack explicit semantic information and are difficult to discern. In recent years, many studies have utilized multi-modal pre-trained models with stronger generative capabilities to reconstruct images that are semantically similar to the original ones. However, these images have uncontrollable structural information such as position and orientation. To address both of the aforementioned issues simultaneously, we propose a two-stage image reconstruction model called MindDiffuser, utilizing Stable Diffusion. In Stage 1, the VQ-VAE latent representations and the CLIP text embeddings decoded from fMRI are put into the image-to-image process of Stable Diffusion, which yields a preliminary image that contains semantic and structural information. In Stage 2, we utilize the low-level CLIP visual features decoded from fMRI as supervisory information, and continually adjust the two features in Stage 1 through backpropagation to align the structural information. The results of both qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that our proposed model has surpassed the current state-of-the-art models in terms of reconstruction results on Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD). Furthermore, the results of ablation experiments indicate that each component of our model is effective for image reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Automated shape repair approaches currently lack access to datasets that describe real-world damaged geometry. We present Fantastic Breaks (and Where to Find Them: https://terascale-all-sensing-research-studio.github.io/FantasticBreaks), a dataset containing scanned, waterproofed, and cleaned 3D meshes for 150 broken objects, paired and geometrically aligned with complete counterparts. Fantastic Breaks contains class and material labels, proxy repair parts that join to broken meshes to generate complete meshes, and manually annotated fracture boundaries. Through a detailed analysis of fracture geometry, we reveal differences between Fantastic Breaks and synthetic fracture datasets generated using geometric and physics-based methods. We show experimental shape repair evaluation with Fantastic Breaks using multiple learning-based approaches pre-trained with synthetic datasets and re-trained with subset of Fantastic Breaks.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of Deep Learning (DL)-based methods for radiographic image analysis has created a great demand for expert-labeled radiology data. Recent self-supervised frameworks have alleviated the need for expert labeling by obtaining supervision from associated radiology reports. These frameworks, however, struggle to distinguish the subtle differences between different pathologies in medical images. Additionally, many of them do not provide interpretation between image regions and text, making it difficult for radiologists to assess model predictions. In this work, we propose Local Region Contrastive Learning (LRCLR), a flexible fine-tuning framework that adds layers for significant image region selection as well as cross-modality interaction. Our results on an external validation set of chest x-rays suggest that LRCLR identifies significant local image regions and provides meaningful interpretation against radiology text while improving zero-shot performance on several chest x-ray medical findings.

- **Summary**: Any-scale image synthesis offers an efficient and scalable solution to synthesize photo-realistic images at any scale, even going beyond 2K resolution. However, existing GAN-based solutions depend excessively on convolutions and a hierarchical architecture, which introduce inconsistency and the $``$texture sticking$"$ issue when scaling the output resolution. From another perspective, INR-based generators are scale-equivariant by design, but their huge memory footprint and slow inference hinder these networks from being adopted in large-scale or real-time systems. In this work, we propose $\textbf{C}$olumn-$\textbf{R}$ow $\textbf{E}$ntangled $\textbf{P}$ixel $\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\textbf{CREPS}$), a new generative model that is both efficient and scale-equivariant without using any spatial convolutions or coarse-to-fine design. To save memory footprint and make the system scalable, we employ a novel bi-line representation that decomposes layer-wise feature maps into separate $``$thick$"$ column and row encodings. Experiments on various datasets, including FFHQ, LSUN-Church, MetFaces, and Flickr-Scenery, confirm CREPS' ability to synthesize scale-consistent and alias-free images at any arbitrary resolution with proper training and inference speed.

- **Summary**: We present a near real-time method for 6-DoF tracking of an unknown object from a monocular RGBD video sequence, while simultaneously performing neural 3D reconstruction of the object. Our method works for arbitrary rigid objects, even when visual texture is largely absent. The object is assumed to be segmented in the first frame only. No additional information is required, and no assumption is made about the interaction agent. Key to our method is a Neural Object Field that is learned concurrently with a pose graph optimization process in order to robustly accumulate information into a consistent 3D representation capturing both geometry and appearance. A dynamic pool of posed memory frames is automatically maintained to facilitate communication between these threads. Our approach handles challenging sequences with large pose changes, partial and full occlusion, untextured surfaces, and specular highlights. We show results on HO3D, YCBInEOAT, and BEHAVE datasets, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. Project page: https://bundlesdf.github.io

- **Summary**: We present Video Pre-trained Transformer. VPT uses four SOTA encoder models from prior work to convert a video into a sequence of compact embeddings. Our backbone, based on a reference Flan-T5-11B architecture, learns a universal representation of the video that is a non-linear sum of the encoder models. It learns using an autoregressive causal language modeling loss by predicting the words spoken in YouTube videos. Finally, we evaluate on standard downstream benchmarks by training fully connected prediction heads for each task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of multiple frozen SOTA models as encoders in an "embedding -> backbone -> prediction head" design pattern - all others have trained their own joint encoder models. Additionally, we include more modalities than the current SOTA, Merlot Reserve, by adding explicit Scene Graph information. For these two reasons, we believe it could combine the world's best open-source models to achieve SOTA performance. Initial experiments demonstrate the model is learning appropriately, but more experimentation and compute is necessary, and already in progress, to realize our loftier goals. Alongside this work, we build on the YT-20M dataset, reproducing it and adding 25,000 personally selected YouTube videos to its corpus. All code and model checkpoints are open sourced under a standard MIT license.

- **Summary**: Generating photorealistic images with controllable camera pose and scene contents is essential for many applications including AR/VR and simulation. Despite the fact that rapid progress has been made in 3D-aware generative models, most existing methods focus on object-centric images and are not applicable to generating urban scenes for free camera viewpoint control and scene editing. To address this challenging task, we propose UrbanGIRAFFE, which uses a coarse 3D panoptic prior, including the layout distribution of uncountable stuff and countable objects, to guide a 3D-aware generative model. Our model is compositional and controllable as it breaks down the scene into stuff, objects, and sky. Using stuff prior in the form of semantic voxel grids, we build a conditioned stuff generator that effectively incorporates the coarse semantic and geometry information. The object layout prior further allows us to learn an object generator from cluttered scenes. With proper loss functions, our approach facilitates photorealistic 3D-aware image synthesis with diverse controllability, including large camera movement, stuff editing, and object manipulation. We validate the effectiveness of our model on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the challenging KITTI-360 dataset.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has attracted much attention in recent years because of the high cost of medical image annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel Inherent Consistent Learning (ICL) method, aims to learn robust semantic category representations through the semantic consistency guidance of labeled and unlabeled data to help segmentation. In practice, we introduce two external modules, namely Supervised Semantic Proxy Adaptor (SSPA) and Unsupervised Semantic Consistent Learner (USCL) that is based on the attention mechanism to align the semantic category representations of labeled and unlabeled data, as well as update the global semantic representations over the entire training set. The proposed ICL is a plug-and-play scheme for various network architectures, and the two modules are not involved in the testing stage. Experimental results on three public benchmarks show that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art, especially when the number of annotated data is extremely limited.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are a class of bio-inspired neural networks that promise to bring low-power and low-latency inference to edge devices through asynchronous and sparse processing. However, being temporal models, SNNs depend heavily on expressive states to generate predictions on par with classical artificial neural networks (ANNs). These states converge only after long transient periods, and quickly decay without input data, leading to higher latency, power consumption, and lower accuracy. This work addresses this issue by initializing the state with an auxiliary ANN running at a low rate. The SNN then uses the state to generate predictions with high temporal resolution until the next initialization phase. Our hybrid ANN-SNN model thus combines the best of both worlds: It does not suffer from long state transients and state decay thanks to the ANN, and can generate predictions with high temporal resolution, low latency, and low power thanks to the SNN. We show for the task of event-based 2D and 3D human pose estimation that our method consumes 88% less power with only a 4% decrease in performance compared to its fully ANN counterparts when run at the same inference rate. Moreover, when compared to SNNs, our method achieves a 74% lower error. This research thus provides a new understanding of how ANNs and SNNs can be used to maximize their respective benefits.

- **Summary**: In this work, we investigate the problem of creating high-fidelity 3D content from only a single image. This is inherently challenging: it essentially involves estimating the underlying 3D geometry while simultaneously hallucinating unseen textures. To address this challenge, we leverage prior knowledge from a well-trained 2D diffusion model to act as 3D-aware supervision for 3D creation. Our approach, Make-It-3D, employs a two-stage optimization pipeline: the first stage optimizes a neural radiance field by incorporating constraints from the reference image at the frontal view and diffusion prior at novel views; the second stage transforms the coarse model into textured point clouds and further elevates the realism with diffusion prior while leveraging the high-quality textures from the reference image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works by a large margin, resulting in faithful reconstructions and impressive visual quality. Our method presents the first attempt to achieve high-quality 3D creation from a single image for general objects and enables various applications such as text-to-3D creation and texture editing.

- **Summary**: The recent amalgamation of transformer and convolutional designs has led to steady improvements in accuracy and efficiency of the models. In this work, we introduce FastViT, a hybrid vision transformer architecture that obtains the state-of-the-art latency-accuracy trade-off. To this end, we introduce a novel token mixing operator, RepMixer, a building block of FastViT, that uses structural reparameterization to lower the memory access cost by removing skip-connections in the network. We further apply train-time overparametrization and large kernel convolutions to boost accuracy and empirically show that these choices have minimal effect on latency. We show that - our model is 3.5x faster than CMT, a recent state-of-the-art hybrid transformer architecture, 4.9x faster than EfficientNet, and 1.9x faster than ConvNeXt on a mobile device for the same accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. At similar latency, our model obtains 4.2% better Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet than MobileOne. Our model consistently outperforms competing architectures across several tasks -- image classification, detection, segmentation and 3D mesh regression with significant improvement in latency on both a mobile device and a desktop GPU. Furthermore, our model is highly robust to out-of-distribution samples and corruptions, improving over competing robust models.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a practical photometric solution for the challenging problem of in-the-wild inverse rendering under unknown ambient lighting. Our system recovers scene geometry and reflectance using only multi-view images captured by a smartphone. The key idea is to exploit smartphone's built-in flashlight as a minimally controlled light source, and decompose image intensities into two photometric components -- a static appearance corresponds to ambient flux, plus a dynamic reflection induced by the moving flashlight. Our method does not require flash/non-flash images to be captured in pairs. Building on the success of neural light fields, we use an off-the-shelf method to capture the ambient reflections, while the flashlight component enables physically accurate photometric constraints to decouple reflectance and illumination. Compared to existing inverse rendering methods, our setup is applicable to non-darkroom environments yet sidesteps the inherent difficulties of explicit solving ambient reflections. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that our method is easy to implement, casual to set up, and consistently outperforms existing in-the-wild inverse rendering techniques. Finally, our neural reconstruction can be easily exported to PBR textured triangle mesh ready for industrial renderers.

- **Summary**: As a pioneering work, PointContrast conducts unsupervised 3D representation learning via leveraging contrastive learning over raw RGB-D frames and proves its effectiveness on various downstream tasks. However, the trend of large-scale unsupervised learning in 3D has yet to emerge due to two stumbling blocks: the inefficiency of matching RGB-D frames as contrastive views and the annoying mode collapse phenomenon mentioned in previous works. Turning the two stumbling blocks into empirical stepping stones, we first propose an efficient and effective contrastive learning framework, which generates contrastive views directly on scene-level point clouds by a well-curated data augmentation pipeline and a practical view mixing strategy. Second, we introduce reconstructive learning on the contrastive learning framework with an exquisite design of contrastive cross masks, which targets the reconstruction of point color and surfel normal. Our Masked Scene Contrast (MSC) framework is capable of extracting comprehensive 3D representations more efficiently and effectively. It accelerates the pre-training procedure by at least 3x and still achieves an uncompromised performance compared with previous work. Besides, MSC also enables large-scale 3D pre-training across multiple datasets, which further boosts the performance and achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning results on several downstream tasks, e.g., 75.5% mIoU on ScanNet semantic segmentation validation set.

- **Summary**: We present DiffuScene for indoor 3D scene synthesis based on a novel scene graph denoising diffusion probabilistic model, which generates 3D instance properties stored in a fully-connected scene graph and then retrieves the most similar object geometry for each graph node i.e. object instance which is characterized as a concatenation of different attributes, including location, size, orientation, semantic, and geometry features. Based on this scene graph, we designed a diffusion model to determine the placements and types of 3D instances. Our method can facilitate many downstream applications, including scene completion, scene arrangement, and text-conditioned scene synthesis. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that our method can synthesize more physically plausible and diverse indoor scenes than state-of-the-art methods. Extensive ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our design choice in scene diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Considering the ill-posed nature, contrastive regularization has been developed for single image dehazing, introducing the information from negative images as a lower bound. However, the contrastive samples are nonconsensual, as the negatives are usually represented distantly from the clear (i.e., positive) image, leaving the solution space still under-constricted. Moreover, the interpretability of deep dehazing models is underexplored towards the physics of the hazing process. In this paper, we propose a novel curricular contrastive regularization targeted at a consensual contrastive space as opposed to a non-consensual one. Our negatives, which provide better lower-bound constraints, can be assembled from 1) the hazy image, and 2) corresponding restorations by other existing methods. Further, due to the different similarities between the embeddings of the clear image and negatives, the learning difficulty of the multiple components is intrinsically imbalanced. To tackle this issue, we customize a curriculum learning strategy to reweight the importance of different negatives. In addition, to improve the interpretability in the feature space, we build a physics-aware dual-branch unit according to the atmospheric scattering model. With the unit, as well as curricular contrastive regularization, we establish our dehazing network, named C2PNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our C2PNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extreme PSNR boosts of 3.94dB and 1.50dB, respectively, on SOTS-indoor and SOTS-outdoor datasets.

- **Summary**: One-shot object detection (OSOD) aims to detect all object instances towards the given category specified by a query image. Most existing studies in OSOD endeavor to explore effective cross-image correlation and alleviate the semantic feature misalignment, however, ignoring the phenomenon of the model bias towards the base classes and the generalization degradation on the novel classes. Observing this, we propose a novel framework, namely Base-class Suppression and Prior Guidance (BSPG) network to overcome the problem. Specifically, the objects of base categories can be explicitly detected by a base-class predictor and adaptively eliminated by our base-class suppression module. Moreover, a prior guidance module is designed to calculate the correlation of high-level features in a non-parametric manner, producing a class-agnostic prior map to provide the target features with rich semantic cues and guide the subsequent detection process. Equipped with the proposed two modules, we endow the model with a strong discriminative ability to distinguish the target objects from distractors belonging to the base classes. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the previous techniques by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance under various evaluation settings.

- **Summary**: Integrated Gradients (IG) as well as its variants are well-known techniques for interpreting the decisions of deep neural networks. While IG-based approaches attain state-of-the-art performance, they often integrate noise into their explanation saliency maps, which reduce their interpretability. To minimize the noise, we examine the source of the noise analytically and propose a new approach to reduce the explanation noise based on our analytical findings. We propose the Important Direction Gradient Integration (IDGI) framework, which can be easily incorporated into any IG-based method that uses the Reimann Integration for integrated gradient computation. Extensive experiments with three IG-based methods show that IDGI improves them drastically on numerous interpretability metrics.

- **Summary**: Light Field Networks, the re-formulations of radiance fields to oriented rays, are magnitudes faster than their coordinate network counterparts, and provide higher fidelity with respect to representing 3D structures from 2D observations. They would be well suited for generic scene representation and manipulation, but suffer from one problem: they are limited to holistic and static scenes. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Light Field Network (DyLiN) method that can handle non-rigid deformations, including topological changes. We learn a deformation field from input rays to canonical rays, and lift them into a higher dimensional space to handle discontinuities. We further introduce CoDyLiN, which augments DyLiN with controllable attribute inputs. We train both models via knowledge distillation from pretrained dynamic radiance fields. We evaluated DyLiN using both synthetic and real world datasets that include various non-rigid deformations. DyLiN qualitatively outperformed and quantitatively matched state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual fidelity, while being 25 - 71x computationally faster. We also tested CoDyLiN on attribute annotated data and it surpassed its teacher model. Project page: https://dylin2023.github.io .

- **Summary**: Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential component of robot navigation and localization systems that allows them to identify a place using only image data. VPR is challenging due to the significant changes in a place's appearance under different illumination throughout the day, with seasonal weather and when observed from different viewpoints. Currently, no single VPR technique excels in every environmental condition, each exhibiting unique benefits and shortcomings. As a result, VPR systems combining multiple techniques achieve more reliable VPR performance in changing environments, at the cost of higher computational loads. Addressing this shortcoming, we propose an adaptive VPR system dubbed Adaptive Multi-Self Identification and Correction (A-MuSIC). We start by developing a method to collect information of the runtime performance of a VPR technique by analysing the frame-to-frame continuity of matched queries. We then demonstrate how to operate the method on a static ensemble of techniques, generating data on which techniques are contributing the most for the current environment. A-MuSIC uses the collected information to both select a minimal subset of techniques and to decide when a re-selection is required during navigation. A-MuSIC matches or beats state-of-the-art VPR performance across all tested benchmark datasets while maintaining its computational load on par with individual techniques.

- **Summary**: We present PACE, a novel method for modifying motion-captured virtual agents to interact with and move throughout dense, cluttered 3D scenes. Our approach changes a given motion sequence of a virtual agent as needed to adjust to the obstacles and objects in the environment. We first take the individual frames of the motion sequence most important for modeling interactions with the scene and pair them with the relevant scene geometry, obstacles, and semantics such that interactions in the agents motion match the affordances of the scene (e.g., standing on a floor or sitting in a chair). We then optimize the motion of the human by directly altering the high-DOF pose at each frame in the motion to better account for the unique geometric constraints of the scene. Our formulation uses novel loss functions that maintain a realistic flow and natural-looking motion. We compare our method with prior motion generating techniques and highlight the benefits of our method with a perceptual study and physical plausibility metrics. Human raters preferred our method over the prior approaches. Specifically, they preferred our method 57.1% of the time versus the state-of-the-art method using existing motions, and 81.0% of the time versus a state-of-the-art motion synthesis method. Additionally, our method performs significantly higher on established physical plausibility and interaction metrics. Specifically, we outperform competing methods by over 1.2% in terms of the non-collision metric and by over 18% in terms of the contact metric. We have integrated our interactive system with Microsoft HoloLens and demonstrate its benefits in real-world indoor scenes. Our project website is available at https://gamma.umd.edu/pace/.

- **Summary**: While substantial progresses have been made in automated 2D portrait stylization, admirable 3D portrait stylization from a single user photo remains to be an unresolved challenge. One primary obstacle here is the lack of high quality stylized 3D training data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework \emph{AgileGAN3D} that can produce 3D artistically appealing and personalized portraits with detailed geometry. New stylization can be obtained with just a few (around 20) unpaired 2D exemplars. We achieve this by first leveraging existing 2D stylization capabilities, \emph{style prior creation}, to produce a large amount of augmented 2D style exemplars. These augmented exemplars are generated with accurate camera pose labels, as well as paired real face images, which prove to be critical for the downstream 3D stylization task. Capitalizing on the recent advancement of 3D-aware GAN models, we perform \emph{guided transfer learning} on a pretrained 3D GAN generator to produce multi-view-consistent stylized renderings. In order to achieve 3D GAN inversion that can preserve subject's identity well, we incorporate \emph{multi-view consistency loss} in the training of our encoder. Our pipeline demonstrates strong capability in turning user photos into a diverse range of 3D artistic portraits. Both qualitative results and quantitative evaluations have been conducted to show the superior performance of our method. Code and pretrained models will be released for reproduction purpose.

- **Summary**: Assessing the aesthetics of an image is challenging, as it is influenced by multiple factors including composition, color, style, and high-level semantics. Existing image aesthetic assessment (IAA) methods primarily rely on human-labeled rating scores, which oversimplify the visual aesthetic information that humans perceive. Conversely, user comments offer more comprehensive information and are a more natural way to express human opinions and preferences regarding image aesthetics. In light of this, we propose learning image aesthetics from user comments, and exploring vision-language pretraining methods to learn multimodal aesthetic representations. Specifically, we pretrain an image-text encoder-decoder model with image-comment pairs, using contrastive and generative objectives to learn rich and generic aesthetic semantics without human labels. To efficiently adapt the pretrained model for downstream IAA tasks, we further propose a lightweight rank-based adapter that employs text as an anchor to learn the aesthetic ranking concept. Our results show that our pretrained aesthetic vision-language model outperforms prior works on image aesthetic captioning over the AVA-Captions dataset, and it has powerful zero-shot capability for aesthetic tasks such as zero-shot style classification and zero-shot IAA, surpassing many supervised baselines. With only minimal finetuning parameters using the proposed adapter module, our model achieves state-of-the-art IAA performance over the AVA dataset.

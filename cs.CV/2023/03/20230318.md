- **Summary**: Development of defenses against physical world attacks such as adversarial patches is gaining traction within the research community. We contribute to the field of adversarial patch detection by introducing an uncertainty-based adversarial patch localizer which localizes adversarial patch on an image, permitting post-processing patch-avoidance or patch-reconstruction. We quantify our prediction uncertainties with the development of \textit{\textbf{D}etection of \textbf{U}ncertainties in the \textbf{E}xceedance of \textbf{T}hreshold} (DUET) algorithm. This algorithm provides a framework to ascertain confidence in the adversarial patch localization, which is essential for safety-sensitive applications such as self-driving cars and medical imaging. We conducted experiments on localizing adversarial patches and found our proposed DUET model outperforms baseline models. We then conduct further analyses on our choice of model priors and the adoption of Bayesian Neural Networks in different layers within our model architecture. We found that isometric gaussian priors in Bayesian Neural Networks are suitable for patch localization tasks and the presence of Bayesian layers in the earlier neural network blocks facilitates top-end localization performance, while Bayesian layers added in the later neural network blocks contribute to better model generalization. We then propose two different well-performing models to tackle different use cases.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a classic and fundamental computer vision problem dedicated to assigning each pixel with its corresponding class. Some recent methods introduce edge-based information for improving the segmentation performance. However these methods are specific and limited to certain network architectures, and they can not be transferred to other models or tasks. Therefore, we propose an abstract and universal edge supervision method called Edge-aware Plug-and-play Scheme (EPS), which can be easily and quickly applied to any semantic segmentation models. The core is edge-width/thickness preserving guided for semantic segmentation. The EPS first extracts the Edge Ground Truth (Edge GT) with a predefined edge thickness from the training data; and then for any network architecture, it directly copies the decoder head for the auxiliary task with the Edge GT supervision. To ensure the edge thickness preserving consistantly, we design a new boundarybased loss, called Polar Hausdorff (PH) Loss, for the auxiliary supervision. We verify the effectiveness of our EPS on the Cityscapes dataset using 22 models. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into any state-of-the-art (SOTA) models with zero modification, resulting in promising enhancement of the segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: The ability to classify images accurately and efficiently is dependent on having access to large labeled datasets and testing on data from the same domain that the model is trained on. Classification becomes more challenging when dealing with new data from a different domain, where collecting a large labeled dataset and training a new classifier from scratch is time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes infeasible or impossible. Cross-domain classification frameworks were developed to handle this data domain shift problem by utilizing unsupervised image-to-image (UI2I) translation models to translate an input image from the unlabeled domain to the labeled domain. The problem with these unsupervised models lies in their unsupervised nature. For lack of annotations, it is not possible to use the traditional supervised metrics to evaluate these translation models to pick the best-saved checkpoint model. In this paper, we introduce a new method called Pseudo Supervised Metrics that was designed specifically to support cross-domain classification applications contrary to other typically used metrics such as the FID which was designed to evaluate the model in terms of the quality of the generated image from a human-eye perspective. We show that our metric not only outperforms unsupervised metrics such as the FID, but is also highly correlated with the true supervised metrics, robust, and explainable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can be used as a standard metric for future research in this field by applying it to a critical real-world problem (the boiling crisis problem).

- **Summary**: Lung cancer has emerged as a severe disease that threatens human life and health. The precise segmentation of lung regions is a crucial prerequisite for localizing tumors, which can provide accurate information for lung image analysis. In this work, we first propose a lung image segmentation model using the NASNet-Large as an encoder and then followed by a decoder architecture, which is one of the most commonly used architectures in deep learning for image segmentation. The proposed NASNet-Large-decoder architecture can extract high-level information and expand the feature map to recover the segmentation map. To further improve the segmentation results, we propose a post-processing layer to remove the irrelevant portion of the segmentation map. Experimental results show that an accurate segmentation model with 0.92 dice scores outperforms state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Efficient crowd counting models are urgently required for the applications in scenarios with limited computing resources, such as edge computing and mobile devices. A straightforward method to achieve this is knowledge distillation (KD), which involves using a trained teacher network to guide the training of a student network. However, this traditional two-phase training method can be time-consuming, particularly for large datasets, and it is also challenging for the student network to mimic the learning process of the teacher network. To overcome these challenges, we propose an online knowledge learning method for crowd counting. Our method builds an end-to-end training framework that integrates two independent networks into a single architecture, which consists of a shared shallow module, a teacher branch, and a student branch. This approach is more efficient than the two-stage training technique of traditional KD. Moreover, we propose a feature relation distillation method which allows the student branch to more effectively comprehend the evolution of inter-layer features by constructing a new inter-layer relationship matrix. It is combined with response distillation and feature internal distillation to enhance the transfer of mutually complementary information from the teacher branch to the student branch. Extensive experiments on four challenging crowd counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods despite using far fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) has a wide range of applications in early warning, rescue, and guidance. However, CNN based deep learning methods are not effective at segmenting infrared small target (IRST) that it lack of clear contour and texture features, and transformer based methods also struggle to achieve significant results due to the absence of convolution induction bias. To address these issues, we propose a new model called attention with bilinear correlation (ABC), which is based on the transformer architecture and includes a convolution linear fusion transformer (CLFT) module with a novel attention mechanism for feature extraction and fusion, which effectively enhances target features and suppresses noise. Additionally, our model includes a u-shaped convolution-dilated convolution (UCDC) module located deeper layers of the network, which takes advantage of the smaller resolution of deeper features to obtain finer semantic information. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/PANPEIWEN/ABC

- **Summary**: Automatic radiology reporting has great clinical potential to relieve radiologists from heavy workloads and improve diagnosis interpretation. Recently, researchers have enhanced data-driven neural networks with medical knowledge graphs to eliminate the severe visual and textual bias in this task. The structures of such graphs are exploited by using the clinical dependencies formed by the disease topic tags via general knowledge and usually do not update during the training process. Consequently, the fixed graphs can not guarantee the most appropriate scope of knowledge and limit the effectiveness. To address the limitation, we propose a knowledge graph with Dynamic structure and nodes to facilitate medical report generation with Contrastive Learning, named DCL. In detail, the fundamental structure of our graph is pre-constructed from general knowledge. Then we explore specific knowledge extracted from the retrieved reports to add additional nodes or redefine their relations in a bottom-up manner. Each image feature is integrated with its very own updated graph before being fed into the decoder module for report generation. Finally, this paper introduces Image-Report Contrastive and Image-Report Matching losses to better represent visual features and textual information. Evaluated on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, our DCL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on these two benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Denoising Diffusion Models have demonstrated remarkable success in generating semantically valuable pixel-wise representations for image generative modeling. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, called Diff-UNet, for medical volumetric segmentation. Our approach integrates the diffusion model into a standard U-shaped architecture to extract semantic information from the input volume effectively, resulting in excellent pixel-level representations for medical volumetric segmentation. To enhance the robustness of the diffusion model's prediction results, we also introduce a Step-Uncertainty based Fusion (SUF) module during inference to combine the outputs of the diffusion models at each step. We evaluate our method on three datasets, including multimodal brain tumors in MRI, liver tumors, and multi-organ CT volumes, and demonstrate that Diff-UNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods significantly. Our experimental results also indicate the universality and effectiveness of the proposed model. The proposed framework has the potential to facilitate the accurate diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions by enabling more precise segmentation of anatomical structures.

- **Summary**: Masked image modeling (MIM) with transformer backbones has recently been exploited as a powerful self-supervised pre-training technique. The existing MIM methods adopt the strategy to mask random patches of the image and reconstruct the missing pixels, which only considers semantic information at a lower level, and causes a long pre-training time.This paper presents HybridMIM, a novel hybrid self-supervised learning method based on masked image modeling for 3D medical image segmentation.Specifically, we design a two-level masking hierarchy to specify which and how patches in sub-volumes are masked, effectively providing the constraints of higher level semantic information. Then we learn the semantic information of medical images at three levels, including:1) partial region prediction to reconstruct key contents of the 3D image, which largely reduces the pre-training time burden (pixel-level); 2) patch-masking perception to learn the spatial relationship between the patches in each sub-volume (region-level).and 3) drop-out-based contrastive learning between samples within a mini-batch, which further improves the generalization ability of the framework (sample-level). The proposed framework is versatile to support both CNN and transformer as encoder backbones, and also enables to pre-train decoders for image segmentation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four widely-used public medical image segmentation datasets, including BraTS2020, BTCV, MSD Liver, and MSD Spleen. The experimental results show the clear superiority of HybridMIM against competing supervised methods, masked pre-training approaches, and other self-supervised methods, in terms of quantitative metrics, timing performance and qualitative observations.

### Extracting Class Activation Maps from Non-Discriminative Features as well

- **Summary**: Extracting class activation maps (CAM) from a classification model often results in poor coverage on foreground objects, i.e., only the discriminative region (e.g., the "head" of "sheep") is recognized and the rest (e.g., the "leg" of "sheep") mistakenly as background. The crux behind is that the weight of the classifier (used to compute CAM) captures only the discriminative features of objects. We tackle this by introducing a new computation method for CAM that explicitly captures non-discriminative features as well, thereby expanding CAM to cover whole objects. Specifically, we omit the last pooling layer of the classification model, and perform clustering on all local features of an object class, where "local" means "at a spatial pixel position". We call the resultant K cluster centers local prototypes - represent local semantics like the "head", "leg", and "body" of "sheep". Given a new image of the class, we compare its unpooled features to every prototype, derive K similarity matrices, and then aggregate them into a heatmap (i.e., our CAM). Our CAM thus captures all local features of the class without discrimination. We evaluate it in the challenging tasks of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), and plug it in multiple state-of-the-art WSSS methods, such as MCTformer and AMN, by simply replacing their original CAM with ours. Our extensive experiments on standard WSSS benchmarks (PASCAL VOC and MS COCO) show the superiority of our method: consistent improvements with little computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Driving scenes are extremely diverse and complicated that it is impossible to collect all cases with human effort alone. While data augmentation is an effective technique to enrich the training data, existing methods for camera data in autonomous driving applications are confined to the 2D image plane, which may not optimally increase data diversity in 3D real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a 3D data augmentation approach termed Drive-3DAug, aiming at augmenting the driving scenes on camera in the 3D space. We first utilize Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to reconstruct the 3D models of background and foreground objects. Then, augmented driving scenes can be obtained by placing the 3D objects with adapted location and orientation at the pre-defined valid region of backgrounds. As such, the training database could be effectively scaled up. However, the 3D object modeling is constrained to the image quality and the limited viewpoints. To overcome these problems, we modify the original NeRF by introducing a geometric rectified loss and a symmetric-aware training strategy. We evaluate our method for the camera-only monocular 3D detection task on the Waymo and nuScences datasets. The proposed data augmentation approach contributes to a gain of 1.7% and 1.4% in terms of detection accuracy, on Waymo and nuScences respectively. Furthermore, the constructed 3D models serve as digital driving assets and could be recycled for different detectors or other 3D perception tasks.

- **Summary**: Recently, various deep learning methods have shown significant successes in medical image analysis, especially in the detection of cancer metastases in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). However, in order to obtain good performance, these research achievements rely on hundreds of well-annotated WSIs. In this study, we tackle the tumor localization and detection problem under the setting of few labeled whole slide images and introduce a patch-based analysis pipeline based on the latest reverse knowledge distillation architecture. To address the extremely unbalanced normal and tumorous samples in training sample collection, we applied the focal loss formula to the representation similarity metric for model optimization. Compared with prior arts, our method achieves similar performance by less than ten percent of training samples on the public Camelyon16 dataset. In addition, this is the first work that show the great potential of the knowledge distillation models in computational histopathology.

- **Summary**: The success of data mixing augmentations in image classification tasks has been well-received. However, these techniques cannot be readily applied to object detection due to challenges such as spatial misalignment, foreground/background distinction, and plurality of instances. To tackle these issues, we first introduce a novel conceptual framework called Supervision Interpolation, which offers a fresh perspective on interpolation-based augmentations by relaxing and generalizing Mixup. Building on this framework, we propose LossMix, a simple yet versatile and effective regularization that enhances the performance and robustness of object detectors and more. Our key insight is that we can effectively regularize the training on mixed data by interpolating their loss errors instead of ground truth labels. Empirical results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that LossMix consistently outperforms currently popular mixing strategies. Furthermore, we design a two-stage domain mixing method that leverages LossMix to surpass Adaptive Teacher (CVPR 2022) and set a new state of the art for unsupervised domain adaptation.



### Local-to-Global Panorama Inpainting for Locale-Aware Indoor Lighting Prediction

- **Summary**: Predicting panoramic indoor lighting from a single perspective image is a fundamental but highly ill-posed problem in computer vision and graphics. To achieve locale-aware and robust prediction, this problem can be decomposed into three sub-tasks: depth-based image warping, panorama inpainting and high-dynamic-range (HDR) reconstruction, among which the success of panorama inpainting plays a key role. Recent methods mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to fill the missing contents in the warped panorama. However, they usually achieve suboptimal performance since the missing contents occupy a very large portion in the panoramic space while CNNs are plagued by limited receptive fields. The spatially-varying distortion in the spherical signals further increases the difficulty for conventional CNNs. To address these issues, we propose a local-to-global strategy for large-scale panorama inpainting. In our method, a depth-guided local inpainting is first applied on the warped panorama to fill small but dense holes. Then, a transformer-based network, dubbed PanoTransformer, is designed to hallucinate reasonable global structures in the large holes. To avoid distortion, we further employ cubemap projection in our design of PanoTransformer. The high-quality panorama recovered at any locale helps us to capture spatially-varying indoor illumination with physically-plausible global structures and fine details.



### SOCS: Semantically-aware Object Coordinate Space for Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation under Large Shape Variations

- **Summary**: Most learning-based approaches to category-level 6D pose estimation are design around normalized object coordinate space (NOCS). While being successful, NOCS-based methods become inaccurate and less robust when handling objects of a category containing significant intra-category shape variations. This is because the object coordinates induced by global and rigid alignment of objects are semantically incoherent, making the coordinate regression hard to learn and generalize. We propose Semantically-aware Object Coordinate Space (SOCS) built by warping-and-aligning the objects guided by a sparse set of keypoints with semantically meaningful correspondence. SOCS is semantically coherent: Any point on the surface of a object can be mapped to a semantically meaningful location in SOCS, allowing for accurate pose and size estimation under large shape variations. To learn effective coordinate regression to SOCS, we propose a novel multi-scale coordinate-based attention network. Evaluations demonstrate that our method is easy to train, well-generalizing for large intra-category shape variations and robust to inter-object occlusions.

- **Summary**: Heatmap-based methods play an important role in anatomical landmark detection. However, most current heatmap-based methods assume that the distributions of all landmarks are the same and the distribution of each landmark is isotropic, which may not be in line with reality. For example, the landmark on the jaw is more likely to be located along the edge and less likely to be located inside or outside the jaw. Manually annotating tends to follow similar rules, resulting in an anisotropic distribution for annotated landmarks, which represents the uncertainty in the annotation. To estimate the uncertainty, we propose a module named Pyramid Covariance Predictor to predict the covariance matrices of the target Gaussian distributions, which determine the distributions of landmarks and represent the uncertainty of landmark annotation. Specifically, the Pyramid Covariance Predictor utilizes the pyramid features extracted by the encoder of the backbone U-Net and predicts the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix of the landmark location distribution. Experimental results show that the proposed Pyramid Covariance Predictor can accurately predict the distributions and improve the performance of anatomical landmark detection.

- **Summary**: The goal of domain generalization (DG) is to enhance the generalization capability of the model learned from a source domain to other unseen domains. The recently developed Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) method aims to achieve this goal by minimizing the sharpness measure of the loss landscape. Though SAM and its variants have demonstrated impressive DG performance, they may not always converge to the desired flat region with a small loss value. In this paper, we present two conditions to ensure that the model could converge to a flat minimum with a small loss, and present an algorithm, named Sharpness-Aware Gradient Matching (SAGM), to meet the two conditions for improving model generalization capability. Specifically, the optimization objective of SAGM will simultaneously minimize the empirical risk, the perturbed loss (i.e., the maximum loss within a neighborhood in the parameter space), and the gap between them. By implicitly aligning the gradient directions between the empirical risk and the perturbed loss, SAGM improves the generalization capability over SAM and its variants without increasing the computational cost. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed SAGM method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on five DG benchmarks, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet.

- **Summary**: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) aims at automatically and accurately forecasting objective scores for visual signals, which has been widely used to monitor product and service quality in low-light applications, covering smartphone photography, video surveillance, autonomous driving, etc. Recent developments in this field are dominated by unimodal solutions inconsistent with human subjective rating patterns, where human visual perception is simultaneously reflected by multiple sensory information (e.g., sight and hearing). In this article, we present a unique blind multimodal quality assessment (BMQA) of low-light images from subjective evaluation to objective score. To investigate the multimodal mechanism, we first establish a multimodal low-light image quality (MLIQ) database with authentic low-light distortions, containing image and audio modality pairs. Further, we specially design the key modules of BMQA, considering multimodal quality representation, latent feature alignment and fusion, and hybrid self-supervised and supervised learning. Extensive experiments show that our BMQA yields state-of-the-art accuracy on the proposed MLIQ benchmark database. In particular, we also build an independent single-image modality Dark-4K database, which is used to verify its applicability and generalization performance in mainstream unimodal applications. Qualitative and quantitative results on Dark-4K show that BMQA achieves superior performance to existing BIQA approaches as long as a pre-trained quality semantic description model is provided. The proposed framework and two databases as well as the collected BIQA methods and evaluation metrics are made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Just noticeable difference (JND) refers to the maximum visual change that human eyes cannot perceive, and it has a wide range of applications in multimedia systems. However, most existing JND approaches only focus on a single modality, and rarely consider the complementary effects of multimodal information. In this article, we investigate the JND modeling from an end-to-end homologous multimodal perspective, namely hmJND-Net. Specifically, we explore three important visually sensitive modalities, including saliency, depth, and segmentation. To better utilize homologous multimodal information, we establish an effective fusion method via summation enhancement and subtractive offset, and align homologous multimodal features based on a self-attention driven encoder-decoder paradigm. Extensive experimental results on eight different benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our hmJND-Net over eight representative methods.

- **Summary**: Both static and moving objects usually exist in real-life videos. Most video object segmentation methods only focus on exacting and exploiting motion cues to perceive moving objects. Once faced with static objects frames, moving object predictors may predict failed results caused by uncertain motion information, such as low-quality optical flow maps. Besides, many sources such as RGB, depth, optical flow and static saliency can provide useful information about the objects. However, existing approaches only utilize the RGB or RGB and optical flow. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive multi-source predictor for zero-shot video object segmentation. In the static object predictor, the RGB source is converted to depth and static saliency sources, simultaneously. In the moving object predictor, we propose the multi-source fusion structure. First, the spatial importance of each source is highlighted with the help of the interoceptive spatial attention module (ISAM). Second, the motion-enhanced module (MEM) is designed to generate pure foreground motion attention for improving both static and moving features used in the decoder. Furthermore, we design a feature purification module (FPM) to filter the inter-source incompatible features. By the ISAM, MEM and FPM, the multi-source features are effectively fused. In addition, we put forward an adaptive predictor fusion network (APF) to evaluate the quality of optical flow and fuse the predictions from the static object predictor and the moving object predictor in order to prevent over-reliance on the failed results caused by low-quality optical flow maps. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three challenging ZVOS benchmarks. And, the static object predictor can precisely predicts a high-quality depth map and static saliency map at the same time.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles must be capable of handling the occlusion of the environment to ensure safe and efficient driving. In urban environment, occlusion often arises due to other vehicles obscuring the perception of the ego vehicle. Since the occlusion condition can impact the trajectories of vehicles, the behavior of other vehicles is helpful in making inferences about the occlusion as a remedy for perceptual deficiencies. This paper introduces a novel social occlusion inference approach that learns a mapping from agent trajectories and scene context to an occupancy grid map (OGM) representing the view of ego vehicle. Specially, vectorized features are encoded through the polyline encoder to aggregate features of vectors into features of polylines. A transformer module is then utilized to model the high-order interactions of polylines. Importantly, occlusion queries are proposed to fuse polyline features and generate the OGM without the input of visual modality. To verify the performance of vectorized representation, we design a baseline based on a fully transformer encoder-decoder architecture mapping the OGM with occlusion and historical trajectories information to the ground truth OGM. We evaluate our approach on an unsignalized intersection in the INTERACTION dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Autonomous navigation of drones using computer vision has achieved promising performance. Nano-sized drones based on edge computing platforms are lightweight, flexible, and cheap, thus suitable for exploring narrow spaces. However, due to their extremely limited computing power and storage, vision algorithms designed for high-performance GPU platforms cannot be used for nano drones. To address this issue this paper presents a lightweight CNN depth estimation network deployed on nano drones for obstacle avoidance. Inspired by Knowledge Distillation (KD), a Channel-Aware Distillation Transformer (CADiT) is proposed to facilitate the small network to learn knowledge from a larger network. The proposed method is validated on the KITTI dataset and tested on a nano drone Crazyflie, with an ultra-low power microprocessor GAP8.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease prognosis is critical for early Mild Cognitive Impairment patients for timely treatment to improve the patient's quality of life. Whilst existing prognosis techniques demonstrate potential results, they are highly limited in terms of using a single modality. Most importantly, they fail in considering a key element for prognosis: not all features extracted at the current moment may contribute to the prognosis prediction several years later. To address the current drawbacks of the literature, we propose a novel hypergraph framework based on an information bottleneck strategy (HGIB). Firstly, our framework seeks to discriminate irrelevant information, and therefore, solely focus on harmonising relevant information for future MCI conversion prediction e.g., two years later). Secondly, our model simultaneously accounts for multi-modal data based on imaging and non-imaging modalities. HGIB uses a hypergraph structure to represent the multi-modality data and accounts for various data modality types. Thirdly, the key of our model is based on a new optimisation scheme. It is based on modelling the principle of information bottleneck into loss functions that can be integrated into our hypergraph neural network. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments on ADNI, that our proposed HGIB framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art hypergraph neural networks for Alzheimer's disease prognosis. We showcase our model even under fewer labels. Finally, we further support the robustness and generalisation capabilities of our framework under both topological and feature perturbations.

- **Summary**: In many binary segmentation tasks, most CNNs-based methods use a U-shape encoder-decoder network as their basic structure. They ignore two key problems when the encoder exchanges information with the decoder: one is the lack of interference control mechanism between them, the other is without considering the disparity of the contributions from different encoder levels. In this work, we propose a simple yet general gated network (GateNet) to tackle them all at once. With the help of multi-level gate units, the valuable context information from the encoder can be selectively transmitted to the decoder. In addition, we design a gated dual branch structure to build the cooperation among the features of different levels and improve the discrimination ability of the network. Furthermore, we introduce a ``Fold'' operation to improve the atrous convolution and form a novel folded atrous convolution, which can be flexibly embedded in ASPP or DenseASPP to accurately localize foreground objects of various scales. GateNet can be easily generalized to many binary segmentation tasks, including general and specific object segmentation and multi-modal segmentation. Without bells and whistles, our network consistently performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods under 10 metrics on 33 datasets of 10 binary segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Purpose Predicting the progression of MCI to Alzheimer's disease is an important step in reducing the progression of the disease. Therefore, many methods have been introduced for this task based on deep learning. Among these approaches, the methods based on ROIs are in a good position in terms of accuracy and complexity. In these techniques, some specific parts of the brain are extracted as ROI manually for all of the patients. Extracting ROI manually is time-consuming and its results depend on human expertness and precision. Method To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel smart method for detecting ROIs automatically based on Explainable AI using Grad-Cam and a 3DCNN model that extracts ROIs per patient. After extracting the ROIs automatically, Alzheimer's disease is predicted using extracted ROI-based 3D CNN. Results We implement our method on 176 MCI patients of the famous ADNI dataset and obtain remarkable results compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The accuracy acquired using 5-fold cross-validation is 98.6 and the AUC is 1. We also compare the results of the ROI-based method with the whole brain-based method. The results show that the performance is impressively increased. Conclusion The experimental results show that the proposed smart ROI extraction, which extracts the ROIs automatically, performs well for Alzheimer's disease prediction. The proposed method can also be used for Alzheimer's disease classification and diagnosis.

- **Summary**: To develop generic and reliable approaches for diagnosing and assessing the severity of COVID-19 from chest X-rays (CXR), a large number of well-maintained COVID-19 datasets are needed. Existing severity quantification architectures require expensive training calculations to achieve the best results. For healthcare professionals to quickly and automatically identify COVID-19 patients and predict associated severity indicators, computer utilities are needed. In this work, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based neural network model that relies on a small number of trainable parameters to quantify the severity of COVID-19 and other lung diseases. We present a feasible approach to quantify the severity of CXR, called Vision Transformer Regressor Infection Prediction (ViTReg-IP), derived from a ViT and a regression head. We investigate the generalization potential of our model using a variety of additional test chest radiograph datasets from different open sources. In this context, we performed a comparative study with several competing deep learning analysis methods. The experimental results show that our model can provide peak performance in quantifying severity with high generalizability at a relatively low computational cost.

- **Summary**: The main challenge of Multi-Object Tracking~(MOT) lies in maintaining a continuous trajectory for each target. Existing methods often learn reliable motion patterns to match the same target between adjacent frames and discriminative appearance features to re-identify the lost targets after a long period. However, the reliability of motion prediction and the discriminability of appearances can be easily hurt by dense crowds and extreme occlusions in the tracking process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective multi-object tracker, i.e., MotionTrack, which learns robust short-term and long-term motions in a unified framework to associate trajectories from a short to long range. For dense crowds, we design a novel Interaction Module to learn interaction-aware motions from short-term trajectories, which can estimate the complex movement of each target. For extreme occlusions, we build a novel Refind Module to learn reliable long-term motions from the target's history trajectory, which can link the interrupted trajectory with its corresponding detection. Our Interaction Module and Refind Module are embedded in the well-known tracking-by-detection paradigm, which can work in tandem to maintain superior performance. Extensive experimental results on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in challenging scenarios, and it achieves state-of-the-art performances at various MOT metrics.

- **Summary**: We develop a generalized 3D shape generation prior model, tailored for multiple 3D tasks including unconditional shape generation, point cloud completion, and cross-modality shape generation, etc. On one hand, to precisely capture local fine detailed shape information, a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is utilized to index local geometry from a compactly learned codebook based on a broad set of task training data. On the other hand, a discrete diffusion generator is introduced to model the inherent structural dependencies among different tokens. In the meantime, a multi-frequency fusion module (MFM) is developed to suppress high-frequency shape feature fluctuations, guided by multi-frequency contextual information. The above designs jointly equip our proposed 3D shape prior model with high-fidelity, diverse features as well as the capability of cross-modality alignment, and extensive experiments have demonstrated superior performances on various 3D shape generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Is there an initialization for deep networks that requires no learning? ExplainFix adopts two design principles: the "fixed filters" principle that all spatial filter weights of convolutional neural networks can be fixed at initialization and never learned, and the "nimbleness" principle that only few network parameters suffice. We contribute (a) visual model-based explanations, (b) speed and accuracy gains, and (c) novel tools for deep convolutional neural networks. ExplainFix gives key insights that spatially fixed networks should have a steered initialization, that spatial convolution layers tend to prioritize low frequencies, and that most network parameters are not necessary in spatially fixed models. ExplainFix models have up to 100x fewer spatial filter kernels than fully learned models and matching or improved accuracy. Our extensive empirical analysis confirms that ExplainFix guarantees nimbler models (train up to 17\% faster with channel pruning), matching or improved predictive performance (spanning 13 distinct baseline models, four architectures and two medical image datasets), improved robustness to larger learning rate, and robustness to varying model size. We are first to demonstrate that all spatial filters in state-of-the-art convolutional deep networks can be fixed at initialization, not learned.

- **Summary**: Single-branch object detection methods use shared features for localization and classification, yet the shared features are not fit for the two different tasks simultaneously. Multi-branch object detection methods usually use different features for localization and classification separately, ignoring the relevance between different tasks. Therefore, we propose multi-semantic interactive learning (MSIL) to mine the semantic relevance between different branches and extract multi-semantic enhanced features of objects. MSIL first performs semantic alignment of regression and classification branches, then merges the features of different branches by semantic fusion, finally extracts relevant information by semantic separation and passes it back to the regression and classification branches respectively. More importantly, MSIL can be integrated into existing object detection nets as a plug-and-play component. Experiments on the MS COCO, and Pascal VOC datasets show that the integration of MSIL with existing algorithms can utilize the relevant information between semantics of different tasks and achieve better performance.

- **Summary**: With the feature size continuously shrinking in advanced technology nodes, mask optimization is increasingly crucial in the conventional design flow, accompanied by an explosive growth in prohibitive computational overhead in optical proximity correction (OPC) methods. Recently, inverse lithography technique (ILT) has drawn significant attention and is becoming prevalent in emerging OPC solutions. However, ILT methods are either time-consuming or in weak performance of mask printability and manufacturability. In this paper, we present DevelSet, a GPU and deep neural network (DNN) accelerated level set OPC framework for metal layer. We first improve the conventional level set-based ILT algorithm by introducing the curvature term to reduce mask complexity and applying GPU acceleration to overcome computational bottlenecks. To further enhance printability and fast iterative convergence, we propose a novel deep neural network delicately designed with level set intrinsic principles to facilitate the joint optimization of DNN and GPU accelerated level set optimizer. Experimental results show that DevelSet framework surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in printability and boost the runtime performance achieving instant level (around 1 second).

- **Summary**: The continuous improvement of human-computer interaction technology makes it possible to compute emotions. In this paper, we introduce our submission to the CVPR 2023 Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW). Sentiment analysis in human-computer interaction should, as far as possible Start with multiple dimensions, fill in the single imperfect emotion channel, and finally determine the emotion tendency by fitting multiple results. Therefore, We exploited multimodal features extracted from video of different lengths from the competition dataset, including audio, pose and images. Well-informed emotion representations drive us to propose a Attention-based multimodal framework for emotion estimation. Our system achieves the performance of 0.361 on the validation dataset. The code is available at [https://github.com/xkwangcn/ABAW-5th-RT-IAI].

- **Summary**: Conventional training of deep neural networks requires a large number of the annotated image which is a laborious and time-consuming task, particularly for rare objects. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) methods offer a remedy by realizing robust object detection using only a few training samples per class. An unexplored challenge for FSOD is that instances from unlabeled novel classes that do not belong to the fixed set of training classes appear in the background. These objects behave similarly to label noise, leading to FSOD performance degradation. We develop a semi-supervised algorithm to detect and then utilize these unlabeled novel objects as positive samples during training to improve FSOD performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical ternary classification region proposal network (HTRPN) to localize the potential unlabeled novel objects and assign them new objectness labels. Our improved hierarchical sampling strategy for the region proposal network (RPN) also boosts the perception ability of the object detection model for large objects. Our experimental results indicate that our method is effective and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSOD methods.

- **Summary**: Visual Abductive Reasoning (VAR) is an emerging vision-language (VL) topic where the model needs to retrieve/generate a likely textual hypothesis from a visual input (image or part of an image) using backward reasoning based on prior knowledge or commonsense. Unlike in conventional VL retrieval or captioning tasks, where entities of texts appear in the image, in abductive inferences, the relevant facts about inferences are not directly visible in the input images. Besides, the inferences are causally relevant to regional visual hints and vary with the latter. Existing works highlight visual parts from a global background with specific prompt tuning techniques (e.g., colorful prompt tuning) on top of foundation models, like CLIP. However, these methods uniformly patchify "regional hints" and "global context" at the same granularity level and may lose fine-grained visual details significant for abductive reasoning.   To tackle this, we propose a simple yet effective Regional Prompt Tuning, which encodes "regional visual hints" and "global contexts" separately at fine and coarse-grained levels. Specifically, our model explicitly upsamples, then patchify local hints to get fine-grained regional prompts. These prompts are concatenated with coarse-grained contextual tokens from whole images. We also equip our model with a new Dual-Contrastive Loss to regress the visual feature simultaneously toward features of factual description (a.k.a. clue text) and plausible hypothesis (abductive inference text) during training. Extensive experiments on the Sherlock dataset demonstrate that our fully fine-tuned RGP/RGPs with Dual-Contrastive Loss significantly outperforms previous SOTAs, achieving the 1 rank on abductive reasoning leaderboards among all submissions, under all metrics (e.g., P@1$_{i->t}$: RGPs 38.78 vs CPT-CLIP 33.44, higher=better). We would open-source our codes for further research.

- **Summary**: Large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) reduce the time for developing predictive models for various vision-grounded language downstream tasks by providing rich, adaptable image and text representations. However, these models suffer from societal biases owing to the skewed distribution of various identity groups in the training data. These biases manifest as the skewed similarity between the representations for specific text concepts and images of people of different identity groups and, therefore, limit the usefulness of such models in real-world high-stakes applications. In this work, we present DeAR (Debiasing with Additive Residuals), a novel debiasing method that learns additive residual image representations to offset the original representations, ensuring fair output representations. In doing so, it reduces the ability of the representations to distinguish between the different identity groups. Further, we observe that the current fairness tests are performed on limited face image datasets that fail to indicate why a specific text concept should/should not apply to them. To bridge this gap and better evaluate DeAR, we introduce the Protected Attribute Tag Association (PATA) dataset - a new context-based bias benchmarking dataset for evaluating the fairness of large pre-trained VLMs. Additionally, PATA provides visual context for a diverse human population in different scenarios with both positive and negative connotations. Experimental results for fairness and zero-shot performance preservation using multiple datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our framework.

- **Summary**: A computer vision system using low-resolution image sensors can provide intelligent services (e.g., activity recognition) but preserve unnecessary visual privacy information from the hardware level. However, preserving visual privacy and enabling accurate machine recognition have adversarial needs on image resolution. Modeling the trade-off of privacy preservation and machine recognition performance can guide future privacy-preserving computer vision systems using low-resolution image sensors. In this paper, using the at-home activity of daily livings (ADLs) as the scenario, we first obtained the most important visual privacy features through a user survey. Then we quantified and analyzed the effects of image resolution on human and machine recognition performance in activity recognition and privacy awareness tasks. We also investigated how modern image super-resolution techniques influence these effects. Based on the results, we proposed a method for modeling the trade-off of privacy preservation and activity recognition on low-resolution images.

- **Summary**: Grounding 3D object affordance seeks to locate objects' ''action possibilities'' regions in the 3D space, which serves as a link between perception and operation for embodied agents. Existing studies primarily focus on connecting visual affordances with geometry structures, e.g. relying on annotations to declare interactive regions of interest on the object and establishing a mapping between the regions and affordances. However, the essence of learning object affordance is to understand how to use it, and the manner that detaches interactions is limited in generalization. Normally, humans possess the ability to perceive object affordances in the physical world through demonstration images or videos. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel task setting: grounding 3D object affordance from 2D interactions in images, which faces the challenge of anticipating affordance through interactions of different sources. To address this problem, we devise a novel Interaction-driven 3D Affordance Grounding Network (IAG), which aligns the region feature of objects from different sources and models the interactive contexts for 3D object affordance grounding. Besides, we collect a Point-Image Affordance Dataset (PIAD) to support the proposed task. Comprehensive experiments on PIAD demonstrate the reliability of the proposed task and the superiority of our method. The project is available at https://github.com/yyvhang/IAGNet.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a challenging task aiming to localize objects with only image-level supervision. Recent works apply visual transformer to WSOL and achieve significant success by exploiting the long-range feature dependency in self-attention mechanism. However, existing transformer-based methods synthesize the classification feature maps as the localization map, which leads to optimization conflicts between classification and localization tasks. To address this problem, we propose to learn a task-specific spatial-aware token (SAT) to condition localization in a weakly supervised manner. Specifically, a spatial token is first introduced in the input space to aggregate representations for localization task. Then a spatial aware attention module is constructed, which allows spatial token to generate foreground probabilities of different patches by querying and to extract localization knowledge from the classification task. Besides, for the problem of sparse and unbalanced pixel-level supervision obtained from the image-level label, two spatial constraints, including batch area loss and normalization loss, are designed to compensate and enhance this supervision. Experiments show that the proposed SAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200 and ImageNet, with 98.45% and 73.13% GT-known Loc, respectively. Even under the extreme setting of using only 1 image per class from ImageNet for training, SAT already exceeds the SOTA method by 2.1% GT-known Loc. Code and models are available at https://github.com/wpy1999/SAT.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a small cow stall number dataset named CowStallNumbers, which is extracted from cow teat videos with the goal of advancing cow stall number detection. This dataset contains 1042 training images and 261 test images with the stall number ranging from 0 to 60. In addition, we fine-tuned a ResNet34 model and augmented the dataset with the random crop, center crop, and random rotation. The experimental result achieves a 92% accuracy in stall number recognition and a 40.1% IoU score in stall number position prediction.

- **Summary**: Semantically coherent out-of-distribution (SCOOD) detection aims to discern outliers from the intended data distribution with access to unlabeled extra set. The coexistence of in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples will exacerbate the model overfitting when no distinction is made. To address this problem, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware optimal transport scheme. Our scheme consists of an energy-based transport (ET) mechanism that estimates the fluctuating cost of uncertainty to promote the assignment of semantic-agnostic representation, and an inter-cluster extension strategy that enhances the discrimination of semantic property among different clusters by widening the corresponding margin distance. Furthermore, a T-energy score is presented to mitigate the magnitude gap between the parallel transport and classifier branches. Extensive experiments on two standard SCOOD benchmarks demonstrate the above-par OOD detection performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 27.69% and 34.4% on FPR@95, respectively.

- **Summary**: For video models to be transferred and applied seamlessly across video tasks in varied environments, Video Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (VUDA) has been introduced to improve the robustness and transferability of video models. However, current VUDA methods rely on a vast amount of high-quality unlabeled target data, which may not be available in real-world cases. We thus consider a more realistic \textit{Few-Shot Video-based Domain Adaptation} (FSVDA) scenario where we adapt video models with only a few target video samples. While a few methods have touched upon Few-Shot Domain Adaptation (FSDA) in images and in FSVDA, they rely primarily on spatial augmentation for target domain expansion with alignment performed statistically at the instance level. However, videos contain more knowledge in terms of rich temporal and semantic information, which should be fully considered while augmenting target domains and performing alignment in FSVDA. We propose a novel SSA2lign to address FSVDA at the snippet level, where the target domain is expanded through a simple snippet-level augmentation followed by the attentive alignment of snippets both semantically and statistically, where semantic alignment of snippets is conducted through multiple perspectives. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SSA2lign across multiple cross-domain action recognition benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Continuous Video Domain Adaptation (CVDA) is a scenario where a source model is required to adapt to a series of individually available changing target domains continuously without source data or target supervision. It has wide applications, such as robotic vision and autonomous driving. The main underlying challenge of CVDA is to learn helpful information only from the unsupervised target data while avoiding forgetting previously learned knowledge catastrophically, which is out of the capability of previous Video-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation methods. Therefore, we propose a Confidence-Attentive network with geneRalization enhanced self-knowledge disTillation (CART) to address the challenge in CVDA. Firstly, to learn from unsupervised domains, we propose to learn from pseudo labels. However, in continuous adaptation, prediction errors can accumulate rapidly in pseudo labels, and CART effectively tackles this problem with two key modules. Specifically, The first module generates refined pseudo labels using model predictions and deploys a novel attentive learning strategy. The second module compares the outputs of augmented data from the current model to the outputs of weakly augmented data from the source model, forming a novel consistency regularization on the model to alleviate the accumulation of prediction errors. Extensive experiments suggest that the CVDA performance of CART outperforms existing methods by a considerable margin.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often trained on the premise that the complete training data set is provided ahead of time. However, in real-world scenarios, data often arrive in chunks over time. This leads to important considerations about the optimal strategy for training DNNs, such as whether to fine-tune them with each chunk of incoming data (warm-start) or to retrain them from scratch with the entire corpus of data whenever a new chunk is available. While employing the latter for training can be resource-intensive, recent work has pointed out the lack of generalization in warm-start models. Therefore, to strike a balance between efficiency and generalization, we introduce Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn (LURE) an online learning paradigm for DNNs. LURE interchanges between the unlearning phase, which selectively forgets the undesirable information in the model through weight reinitialization in a data-dependent manner, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning on generalizable features. We show that our training paradigm provides consistent performance gains across datasets in both classification and few-shot settings. We further show that it leads to more robust and well-calibrated models.

- **Summary**: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) generalizes conventional Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) by assuming that the target domain is dynamic over time rather than stationary. In this paper, we explore Multi-Modal Continual Test-Time Adaptation (MM-CTTA) as a new extension of CTTA for 3D semantic segmentation. The key to MM-CTTA is to adaptively attend to the reliable modality while avoiding catastrophic forgetting during continual domain shifts, which is out of the capability of previous TTA or CTTA methods. To fulfill this gap, we propose an MM-CTTA method called Continual Cross-Modal Adaptive Clustering (CoMAC) that addresses this task from two perspectives. On one hand, we propose an adaptive dual-stage mechanism to generate reliable cross-modal predictions by attending to the reliable modality based on the class-wise feature-centroid distance in the latent space. On the other hand, to perform test-time adaptation without catastrophic forgetting, we design class-wise momentum queues that capture confident target features for adaptation while stochastically restoring pseudo-source features to revisit source knowledge. We further introduce two new benchmarks to facilitate the exploration of MM-CTTA in the future. Our experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This report addresses the technical aspects of de-identification of medical images of human subjects and biospecimens, such that re-identification risk of ethical, moral, and legal concern is sufficiently reduced to allow unrestricted public sharing for any purpose, regardless of the jurisdiction of the source and distribution sites. All medical images, regardless of the mode of acquisition, are considered, though the primary emphasis is on those with accompanying data elements, especially those encoded in formats in which the data elements are embedded, particularly Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM). These images include image-like objects such as Segmentations, Parametric Maps, and Radiotherapy (RT) Dose objects. The scope also includes related non-image objects, such as RT Structure Sets, Plans and Dose Volume Histograms, Structured Reports, and Presentation States. Only de-identification of publicly released data is considered, and alternative approaches to privacy preservation, such as federated learning for artificial intelligence (AI) model development, are out of scope, as are issues of privacy leakage from AI model sharing. Only technical issues of public sharing are addressed.

- **Summary**: Humans have the innate capability to answer diverse questions, which is rooted in the natural ability to correlate different concepts based on their semantic relationships and decompose difficult problems into sub-tasks. On the contrary, existing visual reasoning methods assume training samples that capture every possible object and reasoning problem, and rely on black-boxed models that commonly exploit statistical priors. They have yet to develop the capability to address novel objects or spurious biases in real-world scenarios, and also fall short of interpreting the rationales behind their decisions. Inspired by humans' reasoning of the visual world, we tackle the aforementioned challenges from a compositional perspective, and propose an integral framework consisting of a principled object factorization method and a novel neural module network. Our factorization method decomposes objects based on their key characteristics, and automatically derives prototypes that represent a wide range of objects. With these prototypes encoding important semantics, the proposed network then correlates objects by measuring their similarity on a common semantic space and makes decisions with a compositional reasoning process. It is capable of answering questions with diverse objects regardless of their availability during training, and overcoming the issues of biased question-answer distributions. In addition to the enhanced generalizability, our framework also provides an interpretable interface for understanding the decision-making process of models.

- **Summary**: Microarray technology is a new and powerful tool for the concurrent monitoring of a large number of gene expressions. Each microarray experiment produces hundreds of images. Each digital image requires a large storage space. Hence, real-time processing of these images and transmission of them necessitates efficient and custom-made lossless compression schemes. In this paper, we offer a new architecture for the lossless compression of microarray images. In this architecture, we have used dedicated hardware for the separation of foreground pixels from background ones. By separating these pixels and using pipeline architecture, a higher lossless compression ratio has been achieved as compared to other existing methods.

- **Summary**: This paper explores an expression-related self-supervised learning (SSL) method (ContraWarping) to perform expression classification in the 5th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition. Affective datasets are expensive to annotate, and SSL methods could learn from large-scale unlabeled data, which is more suitable for this task. By evaluating on the Aff-Wild2 dataset, we demonstrate that ContraWarping outperforms most existing supervised methods and shows great application potential in the affective analysis area.

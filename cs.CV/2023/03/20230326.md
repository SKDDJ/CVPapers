- **Summary**: Catastrophic forgetting has been a major challenge in continual learning, where the model needs to learn new tasks with limited or no access to data from previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, methods based on knowledge distillation in feature space have been proposed and shown to reduce forgetting. However, most feature distillation methods directly constrain the new features to match the old ones, overlooking the need for plasticity. To achieve a better stability-plasticity trade-off, we propose Backward Feature Projection (BFP), a method for continual learning that allows the new features to change up to a learnable linear transformation of the old features. BFP preserves the linear separability of the old classes while allowing the emergence of new feature directions to accommodate new classes. BFP can be integrated with existing experience replay methods and boost performance by a significant margin. We also demonstrate that BFP helps learn a better representation space, in which linear separability is well preserved during continual learning and linear probing achieves high classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation strategies are actively used when training deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies suggest that they are effective at various tasks. However, the effect of data augmentation on DNNs' interpretability is not yet widely investigated. In this paper, we explore the relationship between interpretability and data augmentation strategy in which models are trained with different data augmentation methods and are evaluated in terms of interpretability. To quantify the interpretability, we devise three evaluation methods based on alignment with humans, faithfulness to the model, and the number of human-recognizable concepts in the model. Comprehensive experiments show that models trained with mixed sample data augmentation show lower interpretability, especially for CutMix and SaliencyMix augmentations. This new finding suggests that it is important to carefully adopt mixed sample data augmentation due to the impact on model interpretability, especially in mission-critical applications.

- **Summary**: The automatic generation of stylized co-speech gestures has recently received increasing attention. Previous systems typically allow style control via predefined text labels or example motion clips, which are often not flexible enough to convey user intent accurately. In this work, we present GestureDiffuCLIP, a neural network framework for synthesizing realistic, stylized co-speech gestures with flexible style control. We leverage the power of the large-scale Contrastive-Language-Image-Pre-training (CLIP) model and present a novel CLIP-guided mechanism that extracts efficient style representations from multiple input modalities, such as a piece of text, an example motion clip, or a video. Our system learns a latent diffusion model to generate high-quality gestures and infuses the CLIP representations of style into the generator via an adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer. We further devise a gesture-transcript alignment mechanism that ensures a semantically correct gesture generation based on contrastive learning. Our system can also be extended to allow fine-grained style control of individual body parts. We demonstrate an extensive set of examples showing the flexibility and generalizability of our model to a variety of style descriptions. In a user study, we show that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches regarding human likeness, appropriateness, and style correctness.

- **Summary**: Melanoma is a prevalent lethal type of cancer that is treatable if diagnosed at early stages of development. Skin lesions are a typical indicator for diagnosing melanoma but they often led to delayed diagnosis due to high similarities of cancerous and benign lesions at early stages of melanoma. Deep learning (DL) can be used as a solution to classify skin lesion pictures with a high accuracy, but clinical adoption of deep learning faces a significant challenge. The reason is that the decision processes of deep learning models are often uninterpretable which makes them black boxes that are challenging to trust. We develop an explainable deep learning architecture for melanoma diagnosis which generates clinically interpretable visual explanations for its decisions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed architectures matches clinical explanations significantly better than existing architectures.



### BoxVIS: Video Instance Segmentation with Box Annotations

- **Summary**: It is expensive and labour-extensive to label the pixel-wise object masks in a video. As a result, the amount of pixel-wise annotations in existing video instance segmentation (VIS) datasets is small, limiting the generalization capability of trained VIS models. An alternative but much cheaper solution is to use bounding boxes to label instances in videos. Inspired by the recent success of box-supervised image instance segmentation, we adapt the state-of-the-art pixel-supervised VIS models to a box-supervised VIS (BoxVIS) baseline, and observe slight performance degradation. We consequently propose to improve the BoxVIS performance from two aspects. First, we propose a box-center guided spatial-temporal pairwise affinity (STPA) loss to predict instance masks for better spatial and temporal consistency. Second, we collect a larger scale box-annotated VIS dataset (BVISD) by consolidating the videos from current VIS benchmarks and converting images from the COCO dataset to short pseudo video clips. With the proposed BVISD and the STPA loss, our trained BoxVIS model achieves 43.2\% and 29.0\% mask AP on the YouTube-VIS 2021 and OVIS valid sets, respectively. It exhibits comparable instance mask prediction performance and better generalization ability than state-of-the-art pixel-supervised VIS models by using only 16\% of their annotation time and cost.

- **Summary**: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID), which aims to search identities across different spectra, is a challenging task due to large cross-modality discrepancy between visible and infrared images. The key to reduce the discrepancy is to filter out identity-irrelevant interference and effectively learn modality-invariant person representations. In this paper, we propose a novel Modality Restitution and Compensation Network (MRCN) to narrow the gap between the two modalities. Specifically, we first reduce the modality discrepancy by using two Instance Normalization (IN) layers. Next, to reduce the influence of IN layers on removing discriminative information and to reduce modality differences, we propose a Modality Restitution Module (MRM) and a Modality Compensation Module (MCM) to respectively distill modality-irrelevant and modality-relevant features from the removed information. Then, the modality-irrelevant features are used to restitute to the normalized visible and infrared features, while the modality-relevant features are used to compensate for the features of the other modality. Furthermore, to better disentangle the modality-relevant features and the modality-irrelevant features, we propose a novel Center-Quadruplet Causal (CQC) loss to encourage the network to effectively learn the modality-relevant features and the modality-irrelevant features. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of our method on the challenging SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets. More remarkably, our method achieves 95.1% in terms of Rank-1 and 89.2% in terms of mAP on the RegDB dataset.

- **Summary**: Multi-frame methods improve monocular depth estimation over single-frame approaches by aggregating spatial-temporal information via feature matching. However, the spatial-temporal feature leads to accuracy degradation in dynamic scenes. To enhance the performance, recent methods tend to propose complex architectures for feature matching and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we show that a simple learning framework, together with designed feature augmentation, leads to superior performance. (1) A novel dynamic objects detecting method with geometry explainability is proposed. The detected dynamic objects are excluded during training, which guarantees the static environment assumption and relieves the accuracy degradation problem of the multi-frame depth estimation. (2) Multi-scale feature fusion is proposed for feature matching in the multi-frame depth network, which improves feature matching, especially between frames with large camera motion. (3) The robust knowledge distillation with a robust teacher network and reliability guarantee is proposed, which improves the multi-frame depth estimation without computation complexity increase during the test. The experiments show that our proposed methods achieve great performance improvement on the multi-frame depth estimation.

- **Summary**: Modern object detectors take advantage of rectangular bounding boxes as a conventional way to represent objects. When it comes to fisheye images, rectangular boxes involve more background noise rather than semantic information. Although multi-point representation has been proposed, both the regression accuracy and convergence still perform inferior to the widely used rectangular boxes. In order to further exploit the advantages of multi-point representation for distorted images, Concentric Rectangles Regression Strategy(CRRS) is proposed in this work. We adopt smoother mean loss to allocate weights and discuss the effect of hyper-parameter to prediction results. Moreover, an accurate pixel-level method is designed to obtain irregular IoU for estimating detector performance. Compared with the previous work for muti-point representation, the experiments show that CRRS can improve the training performance both in accurate and stability. We also prove that multi-task weighting strategy facilitates regression process in this design.

- **Summary**: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) aims to predict the attributes of a target pedestrian in a surveillance system. Existing methods address the PAR problem by training a multi-label classifier with predefined attribute classes. However, it is impossible to exhaust all pedestrian attributes in the real world. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel pedestrian open-attribute recognition (POAR) framework. Our key idea is to formulate the POAR problem as an image-text search problem. We design a Transformer-based image encoder with a masking strategy. A set of attribute tokens are introduced to focus on specific pedestrian parts (e.g., head, upper body, lower body, feet, etc.) and encode corresponding attributes into visual embeddings. Each attribute category is described as a natural language sentence and encoded by the text encoder. Then, we compute the similarity between the visual and text embeddings of attributes to find the best attribute descriptions for the input images. Different from existing methods that learn a specific classifier for each attribute category, we model the pedestrian at a part-level and explore the searching method to handle the unseen attributes. Finally, a many-to-many contrastive (MTMC) loss with masked tokens is proposed to train the network since a pedestrian image can comprise multiple attributes. Extensive experiments have been conducted on benchmark PAR datasets with an open-attribute setting. The results verified the effectiveness of the proposed POAR method, which can form a strong baseline for the POAR task. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/IvyYZ/POAR}.

- **Summary**: Humans excel at learning from expert demonstrations and solving their own problems. To equip intelligent robots and assistants, such as AR glasses, with this ability, it is essential to ground human hand interactions (i.e., affordances) from demonstration videos and apply them to a target image like a user's AR glass view. The video-to-image affordance grounding task is challenging due to (1) the need to predict fine-grained affordances, and (2) the limited training data, which inadequately covers video-image discrepancies and negatively impacts grounding. To tackle them, we propose Affordance Transformer (Afformer), which has a fine-grained transformer-based decoder that gradually refines affordance grounding. Moreover, we introduce Mask Affordance Hand (MaskAHand), a self-supervised pre-training technique for synthesizing video-image data and simulating context changes, enhancing affordance grounding across video-image discrepancies. Afformer with MaskAHand pre-training achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including a substantial 37% improvement on the OPRA dataset.

- **Summary**: Fisheye cameras suffer from image distortion while having a large field of view(LFOV). And this fact leads to poor performance on some fisheye vision tasks. One of the solutions is to optimize the current vision algorithm for fisheye images. However, most of the CNN-based methods and the Transformer-based methods lack the capability of leveraging distortion information efficiently. In this work, we propose a novel patch embedding method called Sector Patch Embedding(SPE), conforming to the distortion pattern of the fisheye image. Furthermore, we put forward a synthetic fisheye dataset based on the ImageNet-1K and explore the performance of several Transformer models on the dataset. The classification top-1 accuracy of ViT and PVT is improved by 0.75% and 2.8% with SPE respectively. The experiments show that the proposed sector patch embedding method can better perceive distortion and extract features on the fisheye images. Our method can be easily adopted to other Transformer-based models. Source code is at https://github.com/IN2-ViAUn/Sector-Patch-Embedding.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose YOSO, a real-time panoptic segmentation framework. YOSO predicts masks via dynamic convolutions between panoptic kernels and image feature maps, in which you only need to segment once for both instance and semantic segmentation tasks. To reduce the computational overhead, we design a feature pyramid aggregator for the feature map extraction, and a separable dynamic decoder for the panoptic kernel generation. The aggregator re-parameterizes interpolation-first modules in a convolution-first way, which significantly speeds up the pipeline without any additional costs. The decoder performs multi-head cross-attention via separable dynamic convolution for better efficiency and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, YOSO is the first real-time panoptic segmentation framework that delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Specifically, YOSO achieves 46.4 PQ, 45.6 FPS on COCO; 52.5 PQ, 22.6 FPS on Cityscapes; 38.0 PQ, 35.4 FPS on ADE20K; and 34.1 PQ, 7.1 FPS on Mapillary Vistas.

- **Summary**: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to form class-agnostic models segmenting unseen classes with only a handful of annotations. Previous methods limited to the semantic feature and prototype representation suffer from coarse segmentation granularity and train-set overfitting. In this work, we design Hierarchically Decoupled Matching Network (HDMNet) mining pixel-level support correlation based on the transformer architecture. The self-attention modules are used to assist in establishing hierarchical dense features, as a means to accomplish the cascade matching between query and support features. Moreover, we propose a matching module to reduce train-set overfitting and introduce correlation distillation leveraging semantic correspondence from coarse resolution to boost fine-grained segmentation. Our method performs decently in experiments. We achieve $50.0\%$ mIoU on \coco~dataset one-shot setting and $56.0\%$ on five-shot segmentation, respectively.

- **Summary**: We present SDTracker, a method that harnesses the potential of synthetic data for multi-object tracking of real-world scenes in a domain generalization and semi-supervised fashion. First, we use the ImageNet dataset as an auxiliary to randomize the style of synthetic data. With out-of-domain data, we further enforce pyramid consistency loss across different "stylized" images from the same sample to learn domain invariant features. Second, we adopt the pseudo-labeling method to effectively utilize the unlabeled MOT17 training data. To obtain high-quality pseudo-labels, we apply proximal policy optimization (PPO2) algorithm to search confidence thresholds for each sequence. When using the unlabeled MOT17 training set, combined with the pure-motion tracking strategy upgraded via developed post-processing, we finally reach 61.4 HOTA.

- **Summary**: Despite the recent emergence of video captioning models, how to generate vivid, fine-grained video descriptions based on the background knowledge (i.e., long and informative commentary about the domain-specific scenes with appropriate reasoning) is still far from being solved, which however has great applications such as automatic sports narrative. In this paper, we present GOAL, a benchmark of over 8.9k soccer video clips, 22k sentences, and 42k knowledge triples for proposing a challenging new task setting as Knowledge-grounded Video Captioning (KGVC). Moreover, we conduct experimental adaption of existing methods to show the difficulty and potential directions for solving this valuable and applicable task.

- **Summary**: Controllability, generalizability and efficiency are the major objectives of constructing face avatars represented by neural implicit field. However, existing methods have not managed to accommodate the three requirements simultaneously. They either focus on static portraits, restricting the representation ability to a specific subject, or suffer from substantial computational cost, limiting their flexibility. In this paper, we propose One-shot Talking face Avatar (OTAvatar), which constructs face avatars by a generalized controllable tri-plane rendering solution so that each personalized avatar can be constructed from only one portrait as the reference. Specifically, OTAvatar first inverts a portrait image to a motion-free identity code. Second, the identity code and a motion code are utilized to modulate an efficient CNN to generate a tri-plane formulated volume, which encodes the subject in the desired motion. Finally, volume rendering is employed to generate an image in any view. The core of our solution is a novel decoupling-by-inverting strategy that disentangles identity and motion in the latent code via optimization-based inversion. Benefiting from the efficient tri-plane representation, we achieve controllable rendering of generalized face avatar at $35$ FPS on A100. Experiments show promising performance of cross-identity reenactment on subjects out of the training set and better 3D consistency.

- **Summary**: Most existing online knowledge distillation(OKD) techniques typically require sophisticated modules to produce diverse knowledge for improving students' generalization ability. In this paper, we strive to fully utilize multi-model settings instead of well-designed modules to achieve a distillation effect with excellent generalization performance. Generally, model generalization can be reflected in the flatness of the loss landscape. Since averaging parameters of multiple models can find flatter minima, we are inspired to extend the process to the sampled convex combinations of multi-student models in OKD. Specifically, by linearly weighting students' parameters in each training batch, we construct a Hybrid-Weight Model(HWM) to represent the parameters surrounding involved students. The supervision loss of HWM can estimate the landscape's curvature of the whole region around students to measure the generalization explicitly. Hence we integrate HWM's loss into students' training and propose a novel OKD framework via parameter hybridization(OKDPH) to promote flatter minima and obtain robust solutions. Considering the redundancy of parameters could lead to the collapse of HWM, we further introduce a fusion operation to keep the high similarity of students. Compared to the state-of-the-art(SOTA) OKD methods and SOTA methods of seeking flat minima, our OKDPH achieves higher performance with fewer parameters, benefiting OKD with lightweight and robust characteristics. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tianlizhang/OKDPH.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to develop an accurate 3D geometry representation of satellite images using satellite-ground image pairs. Our focus is on the challenging problem of 3D-aware ground-views synthesis from a satellite image. We draw inspiration from the density field representation used in volumetric neural rendering and propose a new approach, called Sat2Density. Our method utilizes the properties of ground-view panoramas for the sky and non-sky regions to learn faithful density fields of 3D scenes in a geometric perspective. Unlike other methods that require extra depth information during training, our Sat2Density can automatically learn accurate and faithful 3D geometry via density representation without depth supervision. This advancement significantly improves the ground-view panorama synthesis task. Additionally, our study provides a new geometric perspective to understand the relationship between satellite and ground-view images in 3D space.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the problem of procedure planning in instructional videos, which aims to make goal-directed plans given the current visual observations in unstructured real-life videos. Previous works cast this problem as a sequence planning problem and leverage either heavy intermediate visual observations or natural language instructions as supervision, resulting in complex learning schemes and expensive annotation costs. In contrast, we treat this problem as a distribution fitting problem. In this sense, we model the whole intermediate action sequence distribution with a diffusion model (PDPP), and thus transform the planning problem to a sampling process from this distribution. In addition, we remove the expensive intermediate supervision, and simply use task labels from instructional videos as supervision instead. Our model is a U-Net based diffusion model, which directly samples action sequences from the learned distribution with the given start and end observations. Furthermore, we apply an efficient projection method to provide accurate conditional guides for our model during the learning and sampling process. Experiments on three datasets with different scales show that our PDPP model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics, even without the task supervision.

- **Summary**: Background subtraction (BGS) aims to extract all moving objects in the video frames to obtain binary foreground segmentation masks. Deep learning has been widely used in this field. Compared with supervised-based BGS methods, unsupervised methods have better generalization. However, previous unsupervised deep learning BGS algorithms perform poorly in sophisticated scenarios such as shadows or night lights, and they cannot detect objects outside the pre-defined categories. In this work, we propose an unsupervised BGS algorithm based on zero-shot object detection called Zero-shot Background Subtraction (ZBS). The proposed method fully utilizes the advantages of zero-shot object detection to build the open-vocabulary instance-level background model. Based on it, the foreground can be effectively extracted by comparing the detection results of new frames with the background model. ZBS performs well for sophisticated scenarios, and it has rich and extensible categories. Furthermore, our method can easily generalize to other tasks, such as abandoned object detection in unseen environments. We experimentally show that ZBS surpasses state-of-the-art unsupervised BGS methods by 4.70% F-Measure on the CDnet 2014 dataset. The code is released at https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/ZBS.

- **Summary**: Conditioning image generation on specific features of the desired output is a key ingredient of modern generative models. Most existing approaches focus on conditioning the generation based on free-form text, while some niche studies use scene graphs to describe the content of the image to be generated. This paper explores novel methods to condition image generation that are based on object-centric relational representations. In particular, we propose a methodology to condition the generation of a particular object in an image on the attributed graph representing its structure and associated style. We show that such architectural biases entail properties that facilitate the manipulation and conditioning of the generative process and allow for regularizing the training procedure. The proposed framework is implemented by means of a neural network architecture combining convolutional operators that operate on both the underlying graph and the 2D grid that becomes the output image. The resulting model learns to generate multi-channel masks of the object that can be used as a soft inductive bias in the downstream generative task. Empirical results show that the proposed approach compares favorably against relevant baselines on image generation conditioned on human poses.

- **Summary**: Auto-Regressive (AR) models have achieved impressive results in 2D image generation by modeling joint distributions in the grid space. While this approach has been extended to the 3D domain for powerful shape generation, it still has two limitations: expensive computations on volumetric grids and ambiguous auto-regressive order along grid dimensions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Improved Auto-regressive Model (ImAM) for 3D shape generation, which applies discrete representation learning based on a latent vector instead of volumetric grids. Our approach not only reduces computational costs but also preserves essential geometric details by learning the joint distribution in a more tractable order. Moreover, thanks to the simplicity of our model architecture, we can naturally extend it from unconditional to conditional generation by concatenating various conditioning inputs, such as point clouds, categories, images, and texts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImAM can synthesize diverse and faithful shapes of multiple categories, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Colorectal cancer (CRC) molecular subtypes play a crucial role in determining treatment options. Immunotherapy is effective for the microsatellite instability (MSI) subtype of CRC, but not for the microsatellite stability (MSS) subtype. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed for automated determination of CRC subtypes from H\&E stained histopathological images. However, previous CNN architectures only consider binary outcomes of MSI or MSS, and do not account for additional biological cues that may affect the histopathological imaging phenotype. In this study, we propose a biologically-primed CNN (BP-CNN) architecture for CRC subtype classification from H\&E stained images. Our BP-CNN accounts for additional biological cues by casting the binary classification outcome into a biologically-informed multi-class outcome. We evaluated the BP-CNN approach using a 5-fold cross-validation experimental setup for model development on the TCGA-CRC-DX cohort, comparing it to a baseline binary classification CNN. Our BP-CNN achieved superior performance when using either single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) molecular features (AUC: 0.824$\pm$0.02 vs. 0.761$\pm$0.04, paired t-test, p$<$0.05) or CpG-Island methylation phenotype (CIMP) molecular features (AUC: 0.834$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.787$\pm$0.03, paired t-test, p$<$0.05). A combination of CIMP and SNP models further improved classification accuracy (AUC: 0.847$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.787$\pm$0.03, paired t-test, p$=$0.01). Our BP-CNN approach has the potential to provide insight into the biological cues that influence cancer histopathological imaging phenotypes and to improve the accuracy of deep-learning-based methods for determining cancer subtypes from histopathological imaging data.

- **Summary**: 3D-aware image synthesis has attracted increasing interest as it models the 3D nature of our real world. However, performing realistic object-level editing of the generated images in the multi-object scenario still remains a challenge. Recently, a 2D GAN termed BlobGAN has demonstrated great multi-object editing capabilities on real-world indoor scene datasets. In this work, we propose BlobGAN-3D, which is a 3D-aware improvement of the original 2D BlobGAN. We enable explicit camera pose control while maintaining the disentanglement for individual objects in the scene by extending the 2D blobs into 3D blobs. We keep the object-level editing capabilities of BlobGAN and in addition allow flexible control over the 3D location of the objects in the scene. We test our method on real-world indoor datasets and show that our method can achieve comparable image quality compared to the 2D BlobGAN and other 3D-aware GAN baselines while being able to enable camera pose control and object-level editing in the challenging multi-object real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) had achieved unprecedented novel view synthesis results, they have been struggling in dealing with large-scale cluttered scenes with sparse input views and highly view-dependent appearances. Specifically, existing NeRF-based models tend to produce blurry rendering with the volumetric reconstruction often inaccurate, where a lot of reconstruction errors are observed in the form of foggy "floaters" hovering within the entire volume of an opaque 3D scene. Such inaccuracies impede NeRF's potential for accurate 3D NeRF registration, object detection, segmentation, etc., which possibly accounts for only limited significant research effort so far to directly address these important 3D fundamental computer vision problems to date. This paper analyzes the NeRF's struggles in such settings and proposes Clean-NeRF for accurate 3D reconstruction and novel view rendering in complex scenes. Our key insights consist of enforcing effective appearance and geometry constraints, which are absent in the conventional NeRF reconstruction, by 1) automatically detecting and modeling view-dependent appearances in the training views to prevent them from interfering with density estimation, which is complete with 2) a geometric correction procedure performed on each traced ray during inference. Clean-NeRF can be implemented as a plug-in that can immediately benefit existing NeRF-based methods without additional input. Codes will be released.

- **Summary**: Because multimodal data contains more modal information, multimodal sentiment analysis has become a recent research hotspot. However, redundant information is easily involved in feature fusion after feature extraction, which has a certain impact on the feature representation after fusion. Therefore, in this papaer, we propose a new multimodal sentiment analysis model. In our model, we use BERT + BiLSTM as new feature extractor to capture the long-distance dependencies in sentences and consider the position information of input sequences to obtain richer text features. To remove redundant information and make the network pay more attention to the correlation between image and text features, CNN and CBAM attention are added after splicing text features and picture features, to improve the feature representation ability. On the MVSA-single dataset and HFM dataset, compared with the baseline model, the ACC of our model is improved by 1.78% and 1.91%, and the F1 value is enhanced by 3.09% and 2.0%, respectively. The experimental results show that our model achieves a sound effect, similar to the advanced model.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in optical coherence tomography such as the development of high speed ultrahigh resolution scanners and corresponding signal processing techniques may reveal new potential biomarkers in retinal diseases. Newly visible features are, for example, small hyperreflective specks in age-related macular degeneration. Identifying these new markers is crucial to investigate potential association with disease progression and treatment outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to reliably detect these features in 3D volumetric scans. Because manual labeling of entire volumes is infeasible a need for automatic detection arises. Labeled datasets are often not publicly available and there are usually large variations in scan protocols and scanner types. Thus, this work focuses on an unsupervised approach that is based on local peak-detection and random walker segmentation to detect small features on each B-scan of the volume.

- **Summary**: Text-driven generation models are flourishing in video generation and editing. However, face-centric text-to-video generation remains a challenge due to the lack of a suitable dataset containing high-quality videos and highly relevant texts. This paper presents CelebV-Text, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset of facial text-video pairs, to facilitate research on facial text-to-video generation tasks. CelebV-Text comprises 70,000 in-the-wild face video clips with diverse visual content, each paired with 20 texts generated using the proposed semi-automatic text generation strategy. The provided texts are of high quality, describing both static and dynamic attributes precisely. The superiority of CelebV-Text over other datasets is demonstrated via comprehensive statistical analysis of the videos, texts, and text-video relevance. The effectiveness and potential of CelebV-Text are further shown through extensive self-evaluation. A benchmark is constructed with representative methods to standardize the evaluation of the facial text-to-video generation task. All data and models are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Blind text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging as one needs to cope with diverse font styles and unknown degradation. To address the problem, existing methods perform character recognition in parallel to regularize the SR task, either through a loss constraint or intermediate feature condition. Nonetheless, the high-level prior could still fail when encountering severe degradation. The problem is further compounded given characters of complex structures, e.g., Chinese characters that combine multiple pictographic or ideographic symbols into a single character. In this work, we present a novel prior that focuses more on the character structure. In particular, we learn to encapsulate rich and diverse structures in a StyleGAN and exploit such generative structure priors for restoration. To restrict the generative space of StyleGAN so that it obeys the structure of characters yet remains flexible in handling different font styles, we store the discrete features for each character in a codebook. The code subsequently drives the StyleGAN to generate high-resolution structural details to aid text SR. Compared to priors based on character recognition, the proposed structure prior exerts stronger character-specific guidance to restore faithful and precise strokes of a designated character. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed generative structure prior in facilitating robust text SR.

- **Summary**: 3D scene understanding, e.g., point cloud semantic and instance segmentation, often requires large-scale annotated training data, but clearly, point-wise labels are too tedious to prepare. While some recent methods propose to train a 3D network with small percentages of point labels, we take the approach to an extreme and propose ``One Thing One Click,'' meaning that the annotator only needs to label one point per object. To leverage these extremely sparse labels in network training, we design a novel self-training approach, in which we iteratively conduct the training and label propagation, facilitated by a graph propagation module. Also, we adopt a relation network to generate the per-category prototype to enhance the pseudo label quality and guide the iterative training. Besides, our model can be compatible to 3D instance segmentation equipped with a point-clustering strategy. Experimental results on both ScanNet-v2 and S3DIS show that our self-training approach, with extremely-sparse annotations, outperforms all existing weakly supervised methods for 3D semantic and instance segmentation by a large margin, and our results are also comparable to those of the fully supervised counterparts.

- **Summary**: The connection between brain activity and corresponding visual stimuli is crucial in comprehending the human brain. While deep generative models have exhibited advancement in recovering brain recordings by generating images conditioned on fMRI signals, accomplishing high-quality generation with consistent semantics continues to pose challenges. Moreover, the prediction of brain activity from visual stimuli remains a formidable undertaking. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that addresses both fMRI decoding and encoding. Commencing with the establishment of two latent spaces capable of representing and reconstructing fMRI signals and visual images, respectively, we proceed to align the fMRI signals and visual images within the latent space, thereby enabling a bidirectional transformation between the two domains. Our Latent Embedding Alignment (LEA) model concurrently recovers visual stimuli from fMRI signals and predicts brain activity from images within a unified framework. The performance of LEA surpasses that of existing methods on multiple benchmark fMRI decoding and encoding datasets. By integrating fMRI decoding and encoding, LEA offers a comprehensive solution for modeling the intricate relationship between brain activity and visual stimuli.

- **Summary**: Training machines to synthesize diverse handwritings is an intriguing task. Recently, RNN-based methods have been proposed to generate stylized online Chinese characters. However, these methods mainly focus on capturing a person's overall writing style, neglecting subtle style inconsistencies between characters written by the same person. For example, while a person's handwriting typically exhibits general uniformity (e.g., glyph slant and aspect ratios), there are still small style variations in finer details (e.g., stroke length and curvature) of characters. In light of this, we propose to disentangle the style representations at both writer and character levels from individual handwritings to synthesize realistic stylized online handwritten characters. Specifically, we present the style-disentangled Transformer (SDT), which employs two complementary contrastive objectives to extract the style commonalities of reference samples and capture the detailed style patterns of each sample, respectively. Extensive experiments on various language scripts demonstrate the effectiveness of SDT. Notably, our empirical findings reveal that the two learned style representations provide information at different frequency magnitudes, underscoring the importance of separate style extraction.

- **Summary**: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is the most widely used imaging method in dentistry. As hundreds of X-ray projections are needed to reconstruct a high-quality CBCT image (i.e., the attenuation field) in traditional algorithms, sparse-view CBCT reconstruction has become a main focus to reduce radiation dose. Several attempts have been made to solve it while still suffering from insufficient data or poor generalization ability for novel patients. This paper proposes a novel attenuation field encoder-decoder framework by first encoding the volumetric feature from multi-view X-ray projections, then decoding it into the desired attenuation field. The key insight is when building the volumetric feature, we comply with the multi-view CBCT reconstruction nature and emphasize the view consistency property by geometry-aware spatial feature querying and adaptive feature fusing. Moreover, the prior knowledge information learned from data population guarantees our generalization ability when dealing with sparse view input. Comprehensive evaluations have demonstrated the superiority in terms of reconstruction quality, and the downstream application further validates the feasibility of our method in real-world clinics.

- **Summary**: Building object detectors that are robust to domain shifts is critical for real-world applications. Prior approaches fine-tune a pre-trained backbone and risk overfitting it to in-distribution (ID) data and distorting features useful for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We propose to use Relative Gradient Norm (RGN) as a way to measure the vulnerability of a backbone to feature distortion, and show that high RGN is indeed correlated with lower OOD performance. Our analysis of RGN yields interesting findings: some backbones lose OOD robustness during fine-tuning, but others gain robustness because their architecture prevents the parameters from changing too much from the initial model. Given these findings, we present recipes to boost OOD robustness for both types of backbones. Specifically, we investigate regularization and architectural choices for minimizing gradient updates so as to prevent the tuned backbone from losing generalizable features. Our proposed techniques complement each other and show substantial improvements over baselines on diverse architectures and datasets.

- **Summary**: Video-based 3D human pose and shape estimations are evaluated by intra-frame accuracy and inter-frame smoothness. Although these two metrics are responsible for different ranges of temporal consistency, existing state-of-the-art methods treat them as a unified problem and use monotonous modeling structures (e.g., RNN or attention-based block) to design their networks. However, using a single kind of modeling structure is difficult to balance the learning of short-term and long-term temporal correlations, and may bias the network to one of them, leading to undesirable predictions like global location shift, temporal inconsistency, and insufficient local details. To solve these problems, we propose to structurally decouple the modeling of long-term and short-term correlations in an end-to-end framework, Global-to-Local Transformer (GLoT). First, a global transformer is introduced with a Masked Pose and Shape Estimation strategy for long-term modeling. The strategy stimulates the global transformer to learn more inter-frame correlations by randomly masking the features of several frames. Second, a local transformer is responsible for exploiting local details on the human mesh and interacting with the global transformer by leveraging cross-attention. Moreover, a Hierarchical Spatial Correlation Regressor is further introduced to refine intra-frame estimations by decoupled global-local representation and implicit kinematic constraints. Our GLoT surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods with the lowest model parameters on popular benchmarks, i.e., 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M.

- **Summary**: The paper 'Deep Learning on a Data Diet' by Paul et al. (2021) introduces two innovative metrics for pruning datasets during the training of neural networks. While we are able to replicate the results for the EL2N score at epoch 20, the same cannot be said for the GraNd score at initialization. The GraNd scores later in training provide useful pruning signals, however. The GraNd score at initialization calculates the average gradient norm of an input sample across multiple randomly initialized models before any training has taken place. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the GraNd score at initialization and the input norm of a sample, suggesting that the latter could have been a cheap new baseline for data pruning. Unfortunately, neither the GraNd score at initialization nor the input norm surpasses random pruning in performance. This contradicts one of the findings in Paul et al. (2021). We were unable to reproduce their CIFAR-10 results using both an updated version of the original JAX repository and in a newly implemented PyTorch codebase. An investigation of the underlying JAX/FLAX code from 2021 surfaced a bug in the checkpoint restoring code that was fixed in April 2021 (https://github.com/google/flax/commit/28fbd95500f4bf2f9924d2560062fa50e919b1a5).

- **Summary**: Movie highlights stand out of the screenplay for efficient browsing and play a crucial role on social media platforms. Based on existing efforts, this work has two observations: (1) For different annotators, labeling highlight has uncertainty, which leads to inaccurate and time-consuming annotations. (2) Besides previous supervised or unsupervised settings, some existing video corpora can be useful, e.g., trailers, but they are often noisy and incomplete to cover the full highlights. In this work, we study a more practical and promising setting, i.e., reformulating highlight detection as "learning with noisy labels". This setting does not require time-consuming manual annotations and can fully utilize existing abundant video corpora. First, based on movie trailers, we leverage scene segmentation to obtain complete shots, which are regarded as noisy labels. Then, we propose a Collaborative noisy Label Cleaner (CLC) framework to learn from noisy highlight moments. CLC consists of two modules: augmented cross-propagation (ACP) and multi-modality cleaning (MMC). The former aims to exploit the closely related audio-visual signals and fuse them to learn unified multi-modal representations. The latter aims to achieve cleaner highlight labels by observing the changes in losses among different modalities. To verify the effectiveness of CLC, we further collect a large-scale highlight dataset named MovieLights. Comprehensive experiments on MovieLights and YouTube Highlights datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Models pre-trained on large-scale datasets are often finetuned to support newer tasks and datasets that arrive over time. This process necessitates storing copies of the model over time for each task that the pre-trained model is finetuned to. Building on top of recent model patching work, we propose $\Delta$-Patching for finetuning neural network models in an efficient manner, without the need to store model copies. We propose a simple and lightweight method called $\Delta$-Networks to achieve this objective. Our comprehensive experiments across setting and architecture variants show that $\Delta$-Networks outperform earlier model patching work while only requiring a fraction of parameters to be trained. We also show that this approach can be used for other problem settings such as transfer learning and zero-shot domain adaptation, as well as other tasks such as detection and segmentation.

- **Summary**: With the surge of large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs), fine-tuning these models to numerous downstream tasks becomes a crucial problem. Consequently, parameter efficient transfer learning (PETL) of large models has grasped huge attention. While recent PETL methods showcase impressive performance, they rely on optimistic assumptions: 1) the entire parameter set of a PTM is available, and 2) a sufficiently large memory capacity for the fine-tuning is equipped. However, in most real-world applications, PTMs are served as a black-box API or proprietary software without explicit parameter accessibility. Besides, it is hard to meet a large memory requirement for modern PTMs. In this work, we propose black-box visual prompting (BlackVIP), which efficiently adapts the PTMs without knowledge about model architectures and parameters. BlackVIP has two components; 1) Coordinator and 2) simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation with gradient correction (SPSA-GC). The Coordinator designs input-dependent image-shaped visual prompts, which improves few-shot adaptation and robustness on distribution/location shift. SPSA-GC efficiently estimates the gradient of a target model to update Coordinator. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that BlackVIP enables robust adaptation to diverse domains without accessing PTMs' parameters, with minimal memory requirements.

### RGBT Tracking via Progressive Fusion Transformer with Dynamically Guided Learning

- **Summary**: Existing Transformer-based RGBT tracking methods either use cross-attention to fuse the two modalities, or use self-attention and cross-attention to model both modality-specific and modality-sharing information. However, the significant appearance gap between modalities limits the feature representation ability of certain modalities during the fusion process. To address this problem, we propose a novel Progressive Fusion Transformer called ProFormer, which progressively integrates single-modality information into the multimodal representation for robust RGBT tracking. In particular, ProFormer first uses a self-attention module to collaboratively extract the multimodal representation, and then uses two cross-attention modules to interact it with the features of the dual modalities respectively. In this way, the modality-specific information can well be activated in the multimodal representation. Finally, a feed-forward network is used to fuse two interacted multimodal representations for the further enhancement of the final multimodal representation. In addition, existing learning methods of RGBT trackers either fuse multimodal features into one for final classification, or exploit the relationship between unimodal branches and fused branch through a competitive learning strategy. However, they either ignore the learning of single-modality branches or result in one branch failing to be well optimized. To solve these problems, we propose a dynamically guided learning algorithm that adaptively uses well-performing branches to guide the learning of other branches, for enhancing the representation ability of each branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ProFormer sets a new state-of-the-art performance on RGBT210, RGBT234, LasHeR, and VTUAV datasets.

- **Summary**: We present a novel method for solving square jigsaw puzzles based on global optimization. The method is fully automatic, assumes no prior information, and can handle puzzles with known or unknown piece orientation. At the core of the optimization process is nonlinear relaxation labeling, a well-founded approach for deducing global solutions from local constraints, but unlike the classical scheme here we propose a multi-phase approach that guarantees convergence to feasible puzzle solutions. Next to the algorithmic novelty, we also present a new compatibility function for the quantification of the affinity between adjacent puzzle pieces. Competitive results and the advantage of the multi-phase approach are demonstrated on standard datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Contrastive Transformer, a contrastive learning scheme using the Transformer innate patches. Contrastive Transformer enables existing contrastive learning techniques, often used for image classification, to benefit dense downstream prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. The scheme performs supervised patch-level contrastive learning, selecting the patches based on the ground truth mask, subsequently used for hard-negative and hard-positive sampling. The scheme applies to all vision-transformer architectures, is easy to implement, and introduces minimal additional memory footprint. Additionally, the scheme removes the need for huge batch sizes, as each patch is treated as an image.   We apply and test Contrastive Transformer for the case of aerial image segmentation, known for low-resolution data, large class imbalance, and similar semantic classes. We perform extensive experiments to show the efficacy of the Contrastive Transformer scheme on the ISPRS Potsdam aerial image segmentation dataset. Additionally, we show the generalizability of our scheme by applying it to multiple inherently different Transformer architectures. Ultimately, the results show a consistent increase in mean IoU across all classes.

- **Summary**: Visual anomaly classification and segmentation are vital for automating industrial quality inspection. The focus of prior research in the field has been on training custom models for each quality inspection task, which requires task-specific images and annotation. In this paper we move away from this regime, addressing zero-shot and few-normal-shot anomaly classification and segmentation. Recently CLIP, a vision-language model, has shown revolutionary generality with competitive zero-/few-shot performance in comparison to full-supervision. But CLIP falls short on anomaly classification and segmentation tasks. Hence, we propose window-based CLIP (WinCLIP) with (1) a compositional ensemble on state words and prompt templates and (2) efficient extraction and aggregation of window/patch/image-level features aligned with text. We also propose its few-normal-shot extension WinCLIP+, which uses complementary information from normal images. In MVTec-AD (and VisA), without further tuning, WinCLIP achieves 91.8%/85.1% (78.1%/79.6%) AUROC in zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation while WinCLIP+ does 93.1%/95.2% (83.8%/96.4%) in 1-normal-shot, surpassing state-of-the-art by large margins.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers have recently shown strong global context modeling capabilities in camouflaged object detection. However, they suffer from two major limitations: less effective locality modeling and insufficient feature aggregation in decoders, which are not conducive to camouflaged object detection that explores subtle cues from indistinguishable backgrounds. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based Feature Shrinkage Pyramid Network (FSPNet), which aims to hierarchically decode locality-enhanced neighboring transformer features through progressive shrinking for camouflaged object detection. Specifically, we propose a nonlocal token enhancement module (NL-TEM) that employs the non-local mechanism to interact neighboring tokens and explore graph-based high-order relations within tokens to enhance local representations of transformers. Moreover, we design a feature shrinkage decoder (FSD) with adjacent interaction modules (AIM), which progressively aggregates adjacent transformer features through a layer-bylayer shrinkage pyramid to accumulate imperceptible but effective cues as much as possible for object information decoding. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing 24 competitors on three challenging COD benchmark datasets under six widely-used evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Existing video recognition algorithms always conduct different training pipelines for inputs with different frame numbers, which requires repetitive training operations and multiplying storage costs. If we evaluate the model using other frames which are not used in training, we observe the performance will drop significantly (see Fig.1), which is summarized as Temporal Frequency Deviation phenomenon. To fix this issue, we propose a general framework, named Frame Flexible Network (FFN), which not only enables the model to be evaluated at different frames to adjust its computation, but also reduces the memory costs of storing multiple models significantly. Concretely, FFN integrates several sets of training sequences, involves Multi-Frequency Alignment (MFAL) to learn temporal frequency invariant representations, and leverages Multi-Frequency Adaptation (MFAD) to further strengthen the representation abilities. Comprehensive empirical validations using various architectures and popular benchmarks solidly demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of FFN (e.g., 7.08/5.15/2.17% performance gain at Frame 4/8/16 on Something-Something V1 dataset over Uniformer).

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Label-efficient and reliable semantic segmentation is essential for many real-life applications, especially for industrial settings with high visual diversity, such as waste sorting. In industrial waste sorting, one of the biggest challenges is the extreme diversity of the input stream depending on factors like the location of the sorting facility, the equipment available in the facility, and the time of year, all of which significantly impact the composition and visual appearance of the waste stream. These changes in the data are called ``visual domains'', and label-efficient adaptation of models to such domains is needed for successful semantic segmentation of industrial waste. To test the abilities of computer vision models on this task, we present the VisDA 2022 Challenge on Domain Adaptation for Industrial Waste Sorting. Our challenge incorporates a fully-annotated waste sorting dataset, ZeroWaste, collected from two real material recovery facilities in different locations and seasons, as well as a novel procedurally generated synthetic waste sorting dataset, SynthWaste. In this competition, we aim to answer two questions: 1) can we leverage domain adaptation techniques to minimize the domain gap? and 2) can synthetic data augmentation improve performance on this task and help adapt to changing data distributions? The results of the competition show that industrial waste detection poses a real domain adaptation problem, that domain generalization techniques such as augmentations, ensembling, etc., improve the overall performance on the unlabeled target domain examples, and that leveraging synthetic data effectively remains an open problem.

- **Summary**: Generating grammatically and semantically correct captions in video captioning is a challenging task. The captions generated from the existing methods are either word-by-word that do not align with grammatical structure or miss key information from the input videos. To address these issues, we introduce a novel global-local fusion network, with a Global-Local Fusion Block (GLFB) that encodes and fuses features from different parts of speech (POS) components with visual-spatial features. We use novel combinations of different POS components - 'determinant + subject', 'auxiliary verb', 'verb', and 'determinant + object' for supervision of the POS blocks - Det + Subject, Aux Verb, Verb, and Det + Object respectively. The novel global-local fusion network together with POS blocks helps align the visual features with language description to generate grammatically and semantically correct captions. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on benchmark MSVD and MSRVTT datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach generates more grammatically and semantically correct captions compared to the existing methods, achieving the new state-of-the-art. Ablations on the POS blocks and the GLFB demonstrate the impact of the contributions on the proposed method.

- **Summary**: 3D hand pose estimation is a long-standing challenge in both robotics and computer vision communities due to its implicit depth ambiguity and often strong self-occlusion. Recently, in addition to the hand skeleton, jointly estimating hand pose and shape has gained more attraction. State-of-the-art methods adopt a model-free approach, estimating the vertices of the hand mesh directly and providing superior accuracy compared to traditional model-based methods directly regressing the parameters of the parametric hand mesh. However, with the large number of mesh vertices to estimate, these methods are often slow in inference. We propose an efficient variation of the previously proposed image-to-lixel approach to efficiently estimate hand meshes from the images. Leveraging recent developments in efficient neural architectures, we significantly reduce the computation complexity without sacrificing the estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce an inverted kinematic(IK) network to translate the estimated hand mesh to a biomechanically feasible set of joint rotation parameters, which is necessary for applications that leverage pose estimation for controlling robotic hands. Finally, an optional post-processing module is proposed to refine the rotation and shape parameters to compensate for the error introduced by the IK net. Our Lite I2L Mesh Net achieves state-of-the-art joint and mesh estimation accuracy with less than $13\%$ of the total computational complexity of the original I2L hand mesh estimator. Adding the IK net and post-optimization modules can improve the accuracy slightly at a small computation cost, but more importantly, provide the kinematic parameters required for robotic applications.

- **Summary**: Learning-based methods to solve dense 3D vision problems typically train on 3D sensor data. The respectively used principle of measuring distances provides advantages and drawbacks. These are typically not compared nor discussed in the literature due to a lack of multi-modal datasets. Texture-less regions are problematic for structure from motion and stereo, reflective material poses issues for active sensing, and distances for translucent objects are intricate to measure with existing hardware. Training on inaccurate or corrupt data induces model bias and hampers generalisation capabilities. These effects remain unnoticed if the sensor measurement is considered as ground truth during the evaluation. This paper investigates the effect of sensor errors for the dense 3D vision tasks of depth estimation and reconstruction. We rigorously show the significant impact of sensor characteristics on the learned predictions and notice generalisation issues arising from various technologies in everyday household environments. For evaluation, we introduce a carefully designed dataset\footnote{dataset available at https://github.com/Junggy/HAMMER-dataset} comprising measurements from commodity sensors, namely D-ToF, I-ToF, passive/active stereo, and monocular RGB+P. Our study quantifies the considerable sensor noise impact and paves the way to improved dense vision estimates and targeted data fusion.

- **Summary**: Most recently, the pathology diagnosis of cancer is shifting to integrating molecular makers with histology features. It is a urgent need for digital pathology methods to effectively integrate molecular markers with histology, which could lead to more accurate diagnosis in the real world scenarios. This paper presents a first attempt to jointly predict molecular markers and histology features and model their interactions for classifying diffuse glioma bases on whole slide images. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical multi-task multi-instance learning framework to jointly predict histology and molecular markers. Moreover, we propose a co-occurrence probability-based label correction graph network to model the co-occurrence of molecular markers. Lastly, we design an inter-omic interaction strategy with the dynamical confidence constraint loss to model the interactions of histology and molecular markers. Our experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying diffuse glioma,as well as related histology and molecular markers on a multi-institutional dataset.

- **Summary**: Automatic Number Plate Recognition System (ANPRS) is a mass surveillance embedded system that recognizes the number plate of the vehicle. This system is generally used for traffic management applications. It should be very efficient in detecting the number plate in noisy as well as in low illumination and also within required time frame. This paper proposes a number plate recognition method by processing vehicle's rear or front image. After image is captured, processing is divided into four steps which are Pre-Processing, Number plate localization, Character segmentation and Character recognition. Pre-Processing enhances the image for further processing, number plate localization extracts the number plate region from the image, character segmentation separates the individual characters from the extracted number plate and character recognition identifies the optical characters by using random forest classification algorithm. Experimental results reveal that the accuracy of this method is 90.9%.

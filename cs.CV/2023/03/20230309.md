- **Summary**: Privacy and memory are two recurring themes in a broad conversation about the societal impact of AI. These concerns arise from the need for huge amounts of data to train deep neural networks. A promise of Generalized Few-shot Object Detection (G-FSOD), a learning paradigm in AI, is to alleviate the need for collecting abundant training samples of novel classes we wish to detect by leveraging prior knowledge from old classes (i.e., base classes). G-FSOD strives to learn these novel classes while alleviating catastrophic forgetting of the base classes. However, existing approaches assume that the base images are accessible, an assumption that does not hold when sharing and storing data is problematic. In this work, we propose the first data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) approach for G-FSOD that leverages the statistics of the region of interest (RoI) features from the base model to forge instance-level features without accessing the base images. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) we design a standalone lightweight generator with (2) class-wise heads (3) to generate and replay diverse instance-level base features to the RoI head while finetuning on the novel data. This stands in contrast to standard DFKD approaches in image classification, which invert the entire network to generate base images. Moreover, we make careful design choices in the novel finetuning pipeline to regularize the model. We show that our approach can dramatically reduce the base memory requirements, all while setting a new standard for G-FSOD on the challenging MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging not only requires higher imaging speed but also needs to address motion artifacts. Especially in the case of free-breathing, more motion artifacts are inevitably introduced. This poses higher demands on the reconstruction performance of the model and its ability to capture temporal information. Previous methods have not effectively utilized the temporal dimension information to compensate for motion artifacts. In order to fully leverage the spatiotemporal information and reduce the impact of motion artifacts, this paper proposes a motion-guided deformable alignment method with second-order bidirectional propagation. Furthermore, aligning adjacent frames may lead to low accuracy or misalignment issues, which are detrimental to subsequent fusion reconstruction. Previous methods have not sufficiently integrated and corrected the aligned feature information. This paper proposes a multi-resolution fusion method to further correct alignment errors or artifacts. Compared to other advanced methods, the proposed approach achieves better image reconstruction quality in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and visual effects.

- **Summary**: It is widely agreed that reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) achieves superior results by referring to similar high quality images, compared to single image super-resolution (SISR). Intuitively, the more references, the better performance. However, previous RefSR methods have all focused on single-reference image training, while multiple reference images are often available in testing or practical applications. The root cause of such training-testing mismatch is the absence of publicly available multi-reference SR training datasets, which greatly hinders research efforts on multi-reference super-resolution. To this end, we construct a large-scale, multi-reference super-resolution dataset, named LMR. It contains 112,142 groups of 300x300 training images, which is 10x of the existing largest RefSR dataset. The image size is also much larger. More importantly, each group is equipped with 5 reference images with different similarity levels. Furthermore, we propose a new baseline method for multi-reference super-resolution: MRefSR, including a Multi-Reference Attention Module (MAM) for feature fusion of an arbitrary number of reference images, and a Spatial Aware Filtering Module (SAFM) for the fused feature selection. The proposed MRefSR achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our code and data would be made available soon.

- **Summary**: Market financial forecasting is a trending area in deep learning. Deep learning models are capable of tackling the classic challenges in stock market data, such as its extremely complicated dynamics as well as long-term temporal correlation. To capture the temporal relationship among these time series, recurrent neural networks are employed. However, it is difficult for recurrent models to learn to keep track of long-term information. Convolutional Neural Networks have been utilized to better capture the dynamics and extract features for both short- and long-term forecasting. However, semantic segmentation and its well-designed fully convolutional networks have never been studied for time-series dense classification. We present a novel approach to predict long-term daily stock price change trends with fully 2D-convolutional encoder-decoders. We generate input frames with daily prices for a time-frame of T days. The aim is to predict future trends by pixel-wise classification of the current price frame. We propose a hierarchical CNN structure to encode multiple price frames to multiscale latent representation in parallel using Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling blocks and take that temporal coarse feature stacks into account in the decoding stages. Our hierarchical structure of CNNs makes it capable of capturing both long and short-term temporal relationships effectively. The effect of increasing the input time horizon via incrementing parallel encoders has been studied with interesting and substantial changes in the output segmentation masks. We achieve overall accuracy and AUC of %78.18 and 0.88 for joint trend prediction over the next 20 days, surpassing other semantic segmentation approaches. We compared our proposed model with several deep models specifically designed for technical analysis and found that for different output horizons, our proposed models outperformed other models.

- **Summary**: Predictive coding (PC) accounts of perception now form one of the dominant computational theories of the brain, where they prescribe a general algorithm for inference and learning over hierarchical latent probabilistic models. Despite this, they have enjoyed little export to the broader field of machine learning, where comparative generative modelling techniques have flourished. In part, this has been due to the poor performance of models trained with PC when evaluated by both sample quality and marginal likelihood. By adopting the perspective of PC as a variational Bayes algorithm under the Laplace approximation, we identify the source of these deficits to lie in the exclusion of an associated Hessian term in the PC objective function, which would otherwise regularise the sharpness of the probability landscape and prevent over-certainty in the approximate posterior. To remedy this, we make three primary contributions: we begin by suggesting a simple Monte Carlo estimated evidence lower bound which relies on sampling from the Hessian-parameterised variational posterior. We then derive a novel block diagonal approximation to the full Hessian matrix that has lower memory requirements and favourable mathematical properties. Lastly, we present an algorithm that combines our method with standard PC to reduce memory complexity further. We evaluate models trained with our approach against the standard PC framework on image benchmark datasets. Our approach produces higher log-likelihoods and qualitatively better samples that more closely capture the diversity of the data-generating distribution.

- **Summary**: The susceptibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples has prompted an increase in the deployment of adversarial attacks. Image-agnostic universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) are much more threatening, but many limitations exist to implementing UAPs in real-world scenarios where only binary decisions are returned. In this research, we propose Decision-BADGE, a novel method to craft universal adversarial perturbations for executing decision-based black-box attacks. To optimize perturbation with decisions, we addressed two challenges, namely the magnitude and the direction of the gradient. First, we use batch loss, differences from distributions of ground truth, and accumulating decisions in batches to determine the magnitude of the gradient. This magnitude is applied in the direction of the revised simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) to update the perturbation. This simple yet efficient method can be easily extended to score-based attacks as well as targeted attacks. Experimental validation across multiple victim models demonstrates that the Decision-BADGE outperforms existing attack methods, even image-specific and score-based attacks. In particular, our proposed method shows a superior success rate with less training time. The research also shows that Decision-BADGE can successfully deceive unseen victim models and accurately target specific classes.

- **Summary**: Existing oriented object detection methods commonly use metric AP$_{50}$ to measure the performance of the model. We argue that AP$_{50}$ is inherently unsuitable for oriented object detection due to its large tolerance in angle deviation. Therefore, we advocate using high-precision metric, e.g. AP$_{75}$, to measure the performance of models. In this paper, we propose an Aspect Ratio Sensitive Oriented Object Detector with Transformer, termed ARS-DETR, which exhibits a competitive performance in high-precision oriented object detection. Specifically, a new angle classification method, calling Aspect Ratio aware Circle Smooth Label (AR-CSL), is proposed to smooth the angle label in a more reasonable way and discard the hyperparameter that introduced by previous work (e.g. CSL). Then, a rotated deformable attention module is designed to rotate the sampling points with the corresponding angles and eliminate the misalignment between region features and sampling points. Moreover, a dynamic weight coefficient according to the aspect ratio is adopted to calculate the angle loss. Comprehensive experiments on several challenging datasets show that our method achieves competitive performance on the high-precision oriented object detection task.



### Deformer: Dynamic Fusion Transformer for Robust Hand Pose Estimation

- **Summary**: Accurately estimating 3D hand pose is crucial for understanding how humans interact with the world. Despite remarkable progress, existing methods often struggle to generate plausible hand poses when the hand is heavily occluded or blurred. In videos, the movements of the hand allow us to observe various parts of the hand that may be occluded or blurred in a single frame. To adaptively leverage the visual clue before and after the occlusion or blurring for robust hand pose estimation, we propose the Deformer: a framework that implicitly reasons about the relationship between hand parts within the same image (spatial dimension) and different timesteps (temporal dimension). We show that a naive application of the transformer self-attention mechanism is not sufficient because motion blur or occlusions in certain frames can lead to heavily distorted hand features and generate imprecise keys and queries. To address this challenge, we incorporate a Dynamic Fusion Module into Deformer, which predicts the deformation of the hand and warps the hand mesh predictions from nearby frames to explicitly support the current frame estimation. Furthermore, we have observed that errors are unevenly distributed across different hand parts, with vertices around fingertips having disproportionately higher errors than those around the palm. We mitigate this issue by introducing a new loss function called maxMSE that automatically adjusts the weight of every vertex to focus the model on critical hand parts. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10%, and is more robust to occlusions (over 14%).

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the problem of temporal video grounding (TVG), which aims to predict the starting/ending time points of moments described by a text sentence within a long untrimmed video. Benefiting from fine-grained 3D visual features, the TVG techniques have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, the high complexity of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) makes extracting dense 3D visual features time-consuming, which calls for intensive memory and computing resources. Towards efficient TVG, we propose a novel text-visual prompting (TVP) framework, which incorporates optimized perturbation patterns (that we call 'prompts') into both visual inputs and textual features of a TVG model. In sharp contrast to 3D CNNs, we show that TVP allows us to effectively co-train vision encoder and language encoder in a 2D TVG model and improves the performance of crossmodal feature fusion using only low-complexity sparse 2D visual features. Further, we propose a Temporal-Distance IoU (TDIoU) loss for efficient learning of TVG. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets, empirically show that the proposed TVP significantly boosts the performance of 2D TVG (e.g., 9.79% improvement on Charades-STA and 30.77% improvement on ActivityNet Captions) and achieves 5x inference acceleration over TVG using 3D visual features.

- **Summary**: Eye tracking is an important tool with a wide range of applications in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR) technologies. State-of-the-art eye tracking methods are either reflection-based and track reflections of sparse point light sources, or image-based and exploit 2D features of the acquired eye image. In this work, we attempt to significantly improve reflection-based methods by utilizing pixel-dense deflectometric surface measurements in combination with optimization-based inverse rendering algorithms. Utilizing the known geometry of our deflectometric setup, we develop a differentiable rendering pipeline based on PyTorch3D that simulates a virtual eye under screen illumination. Eventually, we exploit the image-screen-correspondence information from the captured measurements to find the eye's rotation, translation, and shape parameters with our renderer via gradient descent. In general, our method does not require a specific pattern and can work with ordinary video frames of the main VR/AR/MR screen itself. We demonstrate real-world experiments with evaluated mean relative gaze errors below 0.45 degrees at a precision better than 0.11 degrees. Moreover, we show an improvement of 6X over a representative reflection-based state-of-the-art method in simulation.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning has achieved great success in efficiently exploiting large-scale pre-trained models in natural language processing (NLP). It reformulates the downstream tasks as the generative pre-training ones, thus narrowing down the gap between them and improving the performance stably. However, when transferring it to the vision area, current visual prompt learning methods are all designed on discriminative pre-trained models, and there is also a lack of careful design to unify the forms of pre-training and downstream tasks. To explore prompt learning on the generative pre-trained visual model as well as keeping the task consistency, we propose Visual Prompt learning as masked visual Token Modeling (VPTM) to transform the downstream visual classification into the pre-trained masked visual token prediction. In addition, we develop the prototypical verbalizer for mapping the predicted visual token with implicit semantics to explicit downstream labels. To our best knowledge, VPTM is the first visual prompt method on the generative pre-trained visual model, and the first to achieve consistency between pre-training and downstream visual classification by task reformulation. Experiments show that VPTM outperforms other visual prompt methods and achieves excellent efficiency. Moreover, the task consistency of VPTM contributes to the robustness against prompt location, prompt length and prototype dimension, and could be deployed uniformly.

- **Summary**: The field of steganography has experienced a surge of interest due to the recent advancements in AI-powered techniques, particularly in the context of multimodal setups that enable the concealment of signals within signals of a different nature. The primary objectives of all steganographic methods are to achieve perceptual transparency, robustness, and large embedding capacity - which often present conflicting goals that classical methods have struggled to reconcile. This paper extends and enhances an existing image-in-audio deep steganography method by focusing on improving its robustness. The proposed enhancements include modifications to the loss function, utilization of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), introduction of redundancy in the encoding process for error correction, and buffering of additional information in the pixel subconvolution operation. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing method in terms of robustness and perceptual transparency.

- **Summary**: Distilling the structured information captured in feature maps has contributed to improved results for object detection tasks, but requires careful selection of baseline architectures and substantial pre-training. Self-distillation addresses these limitations and has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance for object detection despite making several simplifying architectural assumptions. Building on this work, we propose Smooth and Stepwise Self-Distillation (SSSD) for object detection. Our SSSD architecture forms an implicit teacher from object labels and a feature pyramid network backbone to distill label-annotated feature maps using Jensen-Shannon distance, which is smoother than distillation losses used in prior work. We additionally add a distillation coefficient that is adaptively configured based on the learning rate. We extensively benchmark SSSD against a baseline and two state-of-the-art object detector architectures on the COCO dataset by varying the coefficients and backbone and detector networks. We demonstrate that SSSD achieves higher average precision in most experimental settings, is robust to a wide range of coefficients, and benefits from our stepwise distillation procedure.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation is a challenging task that predicts the pixel-wise depth from a single 2D image. Current methods typically model this problem as a regression or classification task. We propose DiffusionDepth, a new approach that reformulates monocular depth estimation as a denoising diffusion process. It learns an iterative denoising process to `denoise' random depth distribution into a depth map with the guidance of monocular visual conditions. The process is performed in the latent space encoded by a dedicated depth encoder and decoder. Instead of diffusing ground truth (GT) depth, the model learns to reverse the process of diffusing the refined depth of itself into random depth distribution. This self-diffusion formulation overcomes the difficulty of applying generative models to sparse GT depth scenarios. The proposed approach benefits this task by refining depth estimation step by step, which is superior for generating accurate and highly detailed depth maps. Experimental results on KITTI and NYU-Depth-V2 datasets suggest that a simple yet efficient diffusion approach could reach state-of-the-art performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with acceptable inference time.

- **Summary**: Automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from MRI scans is important to quantify disease progression. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown top performance for this task when a large amount of labeled data is available. However, the accuracy of CNNs suffers when dealing with few and/or sparsely labeled datasets. A potential solution is to leverage the information available in large public datasets in conjunction with a target dataset which only has limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a training framework, SSL2 (self-supervised-semi-supervised), for multi-modality MS lesion segmentation with limited supervision. We adopt self-supervised learning to leverage the knowledge from large public 3T datasets to tackle the limitations of a small 7T target dataset. To leverage the information from unlabeled 7T data, we also evaluate state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods for other limited annotation settings, such as small labeled training size and sparse annotations. We use the shifted-window (Swin) transformer1 as our backbone network. The effectiveness of self-supervised and semi-supervised training strategies is evaluated in our in-house 7T MRI dataset. The results indicate that each strategy improves lesion segmentation for both limited training data size and for sparse labeling scenarios. The combined overall framework further improves the performance substantially compared to either of its components alone. Our proposed framework thus provides a promising solution for future data/label-hungry 7T MS studies.

- **Summary**: We present Unified Contrastive Arbitrary Style Transfer (UCAST), a novel style representation learning and transfer framework, which can fit in most existing arbitrary image style transfer models, e.g., CNN-based, ViT-based, and flow-based methods. As the key component in image style transfer tasks, a suitable style representation is essential to achieve satisfactory results. Existing approaches based on deep neural network typically use second-order statistics to generate the output. However, these hand-crafted features computed from a single image cannot leverage style information sufficiently, which leads to artifacts such as local distortions and style inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose to learn style representation directly from a large amount of images based on contrastive learning, by taking the relationships between specific styles and the holistic style distribution into account. Specifically, we present an adaptive contrastive learning scheme for style transfer by introducing an input-dependent temperature. Our framework consists of three key components, i.e., a parallel contrastive learning scheme for style representation and style transfer, a domain enhancement module for effective learning of style distribution, and a generative network for style transfer. We carry out qualitative and quantitative evaluations to show that our approach produces superior results than those obtained via state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Edit fidelity is a significant issue in open-world controllable generative image editing. Recently, CLIP-based approaches have traded off simplicity to alleviate these problems by introducing spatial attention in a handpicked layer of a StyleGAN. In this paper, we propose CoralStyleCLIP, which incorporates a multi-layer attention-guided blending strategy in the feature space of StyleGAN2 for obtaining high-fidelity edits. We propose multiple forms of our co-optimized region and layer selection strategy to demonstrate the variation of time complexity with the quality of edits over different architectural intricacies while preserving simplicity. We conduct extensive experimental analysis and benchmark our method against state-of-the-art CLIP-based methods. Our findings suggest that CoralStyleCLIP results in high-quality edits while preserving the ease of use.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel generative model-based attack on learnable image encryption methods proposed for privacy-preserving deep learning. Various learnable encryption methods have been studied to protect the sensitive visual information of plain images, and some of them have been investigated to be robust enough against all existing attacks. However, previous attacks on image encryption focus only on traditional cryptanalytic attacks or reverse translation models, so these attacks cannot recover any visual information if a block-scrambling encryption step, which effectively destroys global information, is applied. Accordingly, in this paper, generative models are explored to evaluate whether such models can restore sensitive visual information from encrypted images for the first time. We first point out that encrypted images have some similarity with plain images in the embedding space. By taking advantage of leaked information from encrypted images, we propose a guided generative model as an attack on learnable image encryption to recover personally identifiable visual information. We implement the proposed attack in two ways by utilizing two state-of-the-art generative models: a StyleGAN-based model and latent diffusion-based one. Experiments were carried out on the CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. Results show that images reconstructed by the proposed method have perceptual similarities to plain images.

- **Summary**: We perform a set of experiments to demonstrate that images generated using a Generative Adversarial Network can be modified using 'semiotics.' We show that just as physical attributes such as the hue and saturation of an image can be modified, so too can its non-physical, abstract properties using our method. For example, the design of a flight attendant's uniform may be modified to look more 'alert,' less 'austere,' or more 'practical.' The form of a house can be modified to appear more 'futuristic,' a car more 'friendly' a pair of sneakers, 'evil.' Our method uncovers latent visual iconography associated with the semiotic property of interest, enabling a process of visual form-finding using abstract concepts. Our approach is iterative and allows control over the degree of attribute presence and can be used to aid the design process to yield emergent visual concepts.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction-based anomaly detection models achieve their purpose by suppressing the generalization ability for anomaly. However, diverse normal patterns are consequently not well reconstructed as well. Although some efforts have been made to alleviate this problem by modeling sample diversity, they suffer from shortcut learning due to undesired transmission of abnormal information. In this paper, to better handle the tradeoff problem, we propose Diversity-Measurable Anomaly Detection (DMAD) framework to enhance reconstruction diversity while avoid the undesired generalization on anomalies. To this end, we design Pyramid Deformation Module (PDM), which models diverse normals and measures the severity of anomaly by estimating multi-scale deformation fields from reconstructed reference to original input. Integrated with an information compression module, PDM essentially decouples deformation from prototypical embedding and makes the final anomaly score more reliable. Experimental results on both surveillance videos and industrial images demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, DMAD works equally well in front of contaminated data and anomaly-like normal samples.

- **Summary**: Layout generation aims to synthesize realistic graphic scenes consisting of elements with different attributes including category, size, position, and between-element relation. It is a crucial task for reducing the burden on heavy-duty graphic design works for formatted scenes, e.g., publications, documents, and user interfaces (UIs). Diverse application scenarios impose a big challenge in unifying various layout generation subtasks, including conditional and unconditional generation. In this paper, we propose a Layout Diffusion Generative Model (LDGM) to achieve such unification with a single decoupled diffusion model. LDGM views a layout of arbitrary missing or coarse element attributes as an intermediate diffusion status from a completed layout. Since different attributes have their individual semantics and characteristics, we propose to decouple the diffusion processes for them to improve the diversity of training samples and learn the reverse process jointly to exploit global-scope contexts for facilitating generation. As a result, our LDGM can generate layouts either from scratch or conditional on arbitrary available attributes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our proposed LDGM outperforms existing layout generation models in both functionality and performance.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving and robot navigation, there is a growing demand for lifelong learning models capable of estimating metric (absolute) depth. Lifelong learning approaches potentially offer significant cost savings in terms of model training, data storage, and collection. However, the quality of RGB images and depth maps is sensor-dependent, and depth maps in the real world exhibit domain-specific characteristics, leading to variations in depth ranges. These challenges limit existing methods to lifelong learning scenarios with small domain gaps and relative depth map estimation. To facilitate lifelong metric depth learning, we identify three crucial technical challenges that require attention: i) developing a model capable of addressing the depth scale variation through scale-aware depth learning, ii) devising an effective learning strategy to handle significant domain gaps, and iii) creating an automated solution for domain-aware depth inference in practical applications. Based on the aforementioned considerations, in this paper, we present i) a lightweight multi-head framework that effectively tackles the depth scale imbalance, ii) an uncertainty-aware lifelong learning solution that adeptly handles significant domain gaps, and iii) an online domain-specific predictor selection method for real-time inference. Through extensive numerical studies, we show that the proposed method can achieve good efficiency, stability, and plasticity, leading the benchmarks by 8% to 15%.

- **Summary**: Advancements in graphics technology has increased the use of simulated data for training machine learning models. However, the simulated data often differs from real-world data, creating a distribution gap that can decrease the efficacy of models trained on simulation data in real-world applications. To mitigate this gap, sim-to-real domain transfer modifies simulated images to better match real-world data, enabling the effective use of simulation data in model training.   Sim-to-real transfer utilizes image translation methods, which are divided into two main categories: paired and unpaired image-to-image translation. Paired image translation requires a perfect pixel match, making it difficult to apply in practice due to the lack of pixel-wise correspondence between simulation and real-world data. Unpaired image translation, while more suitable for sim-to-real transfer, is still challenging to learn for complex natural scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a third category: approximately-paired sim-to-real translation, where the source and target images do not need to be exactly paired. Our approximately-paired method, AptSim2Real, exploits the fact that simulators can generate scenes loosely resembling real-world scenes in terms of lighting, environment, and composition. Our novel training strategy results in significant qualitative and quantitative improvements, with up to a 24% improvement in FID score compared to the state-of-the-art unpaired image-translation methods.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning is well known for its remarkable performance in representation learning and various downstream computer vision tasks. Recently, Positive-pair-Only Contrastive Learning (POCL) has achieved reliable performance without the need to construct positive-negative training sets. It reduces memory requirements by lessening the dependency on the batch size. The POCL method typically uses a single loss function to extract the distortion invariant representation (DIR) which describes the proximity of positive-pair representations affected by different distortions. This loss function implicitly enables the model to filter out or ignore the distortion variant representation (DVR) affected by different distortions. However, existing POCL methods do not explicitly enforce the disentanglement and exploitation of the actually valuable DVR. In addition, these POCL methods have been observed to be sensitive to augmentation strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel POCL framework named Distortion-Disentangled Contrastive Learning (DDCL) and a Distortion-Disentangled Loss (DDL). Our approach is the first to explicitly disentangle and exploit the DVR inside the model and feature stream to improve the overall representation utilization efficiency, robustness and representation ability. Experiments carried out demonstrate the superiority of our framework to Barlow Twins and Simsiam in terms of convergence, representation quality, and robustness on several benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: The problem of realistic VQA (RVQA), where a model has to reject unanswerable questions (UQs) and answer answerable ones (AQs), is studied. We first point out 2 drawbacks in current RVQA research, where (1) datasets contain too many unchallenging UQs and (2) a large number of annotated UQs are required for training. To resolve the first drawback, we propose a new testing dataset, RGQA, which combines AQs from an existing VQA dataset with around 29K human-annotated UQs. These UQs consist of both fine-grained and coarse-grained image-question pairs generated with 2 approaches: CLIP-based and Perturbation-based. To address the second drawback, we introduce an unsupervised training approach. This combines pseudo UQs obtained by randomly pairing images and questions, with an RoI Mixup procedure to generate more fine-grained pseudo UQs, and model ensembling to regularize model confidence. Experiments show that using pseudo UQs significantly outperforms RVQA baselines. RoI Mixup and model ensembling further increase the gain. Finally, human evaluation reveals a performance gap between humans and models, showing that more RVQA research is needed.

- **Summary**: 3D single object tracking has been a crucial problem for decades with numerous applications such as autonomous driving. Despite its wide-ranging use, this task remains challenging due to the significant appearance variation caused by occlusion and size differences among tracked targets. To address these issues, we present MBPTrack, which adopts a Memory mechanism to utilize past information and formulates localization in a coarse-to-fine scheme using Box Priors given in the first frame. Specifically, past frames with targetness masks serve as an external memory, and a transformer-based module propagates tracked target cues from the memory to the current frame. To precisely localize objects of all sizes, MBPTrack first predicts the target center via Hough voting. By leveraging box priors given in the first frame, we adaptively sample reference points around the target center that roughly cover the target of different sizes. Then, we obtain dense feature maps by aggregating point features into the reference points, where localization can be performed more effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, while running at 50 FPS on a single RTX3090 GPU.

- **Summary**: Despite excellent average-case performance of many image classifiers, their performance can substantially deteriorate on semantically coherent subgroups of the data that were under-represented in the training data. These systematic errors can impact both fairness for demographic minority groups as well as robustness and safety under domain shift. A major challenge is to identify such subgroups with subpar performance when the subgroups are not annotated and their occurrence is very rare. We leverage recent advances in text-to-image models and search in the space of textual descriptions of subgroups ("prompts") for subgroups where the target model has low performance on the prompt-conditioned synthesized data. To tackle the exponentially growing number of subgroups, we employ combinatorial testing. We denote this procedure as PromptAttack as it can be interpreted as an adversarial attack in a prompt space. We study subgroup coverage and identifiability with PromptAttack in a controlled setting and find that it identifies systematic errors with high accuracy. Thereupon, we apply PromptAttack to ImageNet classifiers and identify novel systematic errors on rare subgroups.

- **Summary**: Food recognition has a wide range of applications, such as health-aware recommendation and self-service restaurants. Most previous methods of food recognition firstly locate informative regions in some weakly-supervised manners and then aggregate their features. However, location errors of informative regions limit the effectiveness of these methods to some extent. Instead of locating multiple regions, we propose a Progressive Self-Distillation (PSD) method, which progressively enhances the ability of network to mine more details for food recognition. The training of PSD simultaneously contains multiple self-distillations, in which a teacher network and a student network share the same embedding network. Since the student network receives a modified image from its teacher network by masking some informative regions, the teacher network outputs stronger semantic representations than the student network. Guided by such teacher network with stronger semantics, the student network is encouraged to mine more useful regions from the modified image by enhancing its own ability. The ability of the teacher network is also enhanced with the shared embedding network. By using progressive training, the teacher network incrementally improves its ability to mine more discriminative regions. In inference phase, only the teacher network is used without the help of the student network. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Gait pattern is a promising biometric for applications, as it can be captured from a distance without requiring individual cooperation. Nevertheless, existing gait datasets typically suffer from limited diversity, with indoor datasets requiring participants to walk along a fixed route in a restricted setting, and outdoor datasets containing only few walking sequences per subject. Prior generative methods have attempted to mitigate these limitations by building virtual gait datasets. They primarily focus on manipulating a single, specific gait attribute (e.g., viewpoint or carrying), and require the supervised data pairs for training, thus lacking the flexibility and diversity for practical usage. In contrast, our GaitEditer can act as an online module to edit a broad range of gait attributes, such as pants, viewpoint, and even age, in an unsupervised manner, which current gait generative methods struggle with. Additionally, GaitEidter also finely preserves both temporal continuity and identity characteristics in generated gait sequences. Experiments show that GaitEditer provides extensive knowledge for clothing-invariant and view-invariant gait representation learning under various challenging scenarios. The source code will be available.

- **Summary**: Many adversarial attacks in NLP perturb inputs to produce visually similar strings ('ergo' $\rightarrow$ '$\epsilon$rgo') which are legible to humans but degrade model performance. Although preserving legibility is a necessary condition for text perturbation, little work has been done to systematically characterize it; instead, legibility is typically loosely enforced via intuitions around the nature and extent of perturbations. Particularly, it is unclear to what extent can inputs be perturbed while preserving legibility, or how to quantify the legibility of a perturbed string. In this work, we address this gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string, and rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we collect and release LEGIT, a human-annotated dataset comprising the legibility of visually perturbed text. Using this dataset, we build both text- and vision-based models which achieve up to $0.91$ F1 score in predicting whether an input is legible, and an accuracy of $0.86$ in predicting which of two given perturbations is more legible. Additionally, we discover that legible perturbations from the LEGIT dataset are more effective at lowering the performance of NLP models than best-known attack strategies, suggesting that current models may be vulnerable to a broad range of perturbations beyond what is captured by existing visual attacks.

- **Summary**: Balancing efficiency and accuracy is a long-standing problem for deploying deep learning models. The trade-off is even more important for real-time safety-critical systems like autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for accelerating transformer-based 3D object detectors by dynamically halting tokens at different layers depending on their contribution to the detection task. Although halting a token is a non-differentiable operation, our method allows for differentiable end-to-end learning by leveraging an equivalent differentiable forward-pass. Furthermore, our framework allows halted tokens to be reused to inform the model's predictions through a straightforward token recycling mechanism. Our method significantly improves the Pareto frontier of efficiency versus accuracy when compared with the existing approaches. By halting tokens and increasing model capacity, we are able to improve the baseline model's performance without increasing the model's latency on the Waymo Open Dataset.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a simple yet effective semi-supervised 3D object detector named DDS3D. Our main contributions have two-fold. On the one hand, different from previous works using Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) or its variants for obtaining the sparse pseudo labels, we propose a dense pseudo-label generation strategy to get dense pseudo-labels, which can retain more potential supervision information for the student network. On the other hand, instead of traditional fixed thresholds, we propose a dynamic threshold manner to generate pseudo-labels, which can guarantee the quality and quantity of pseudo-labels during the whole training process. Benefiting from these two components, our DDS3D outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised 3d object detection with mAP of 3.1% on the pedestrian and 2.1% on the cyclist under the same configuration of 1% samples. Extensive ablation studies on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our DDS3D. The code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/hust-jy/DDS3D

- **Summary**: Video retrieval is becoming increasingly important owing to the rapid emergence of videos on the Internet. The dominant paradigm for video retrieval learns video-text representations by pushing the distance between the similarity of positive pairs and that of negative pairs apart from a fixed margin. However, negative pairs used for training are sampled randomly, which indicates that the semantics between negative pairs may be related or even equivalent, while most methods still enforce dissimilar representations to decrease their similarity. This phenomenon leads to inaccurate supervision and poor performance in learning video-text representations.   While most video retrieval methods overlook that phenomenon, we propose an adaptive margin changed with the distance between positive and negative pairs to solve the aforementioned issue. First, we design the calculation framework of the adaptive margin, including the method of distance measurement and the function between the distance and the margin. Then, we explore a novel implementation called "Cross-Modal Generalized Self-Distillation" (CMGSD), which can be built on the top of most video retrieval models with few modifications. Notably, CMGSD adds few computational overheads at train time and adds no computational overhead at test time. Experimental results on three widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can yield significantly better performance than the corresponding backbone model, and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Deception detection in conversations is a challenging yet important task, having pivotal applications in many fields such as credibility assessment in business, multimedia anti-frauds, and custom security. Despite this, deception detection research is hindered by the lack of high-quality deception datasets, as well as the difficulties of learning multimodal features effectively. To address this issue, we introduce DOLOS\footnote {The name ``DOLOS" comes from Greek mythology.}, the largest gameshow deception detection dataset with rich deceptive conversations. DOLOS includes 1,675 video clips featuring 213 subjects, and it has been labeled with audio-visual feature annotations. We provide train-test, duration, and gender protocols to investigate the impact of different factors. We benchmark our dataset on previously proposed deception detection approaches. To further improve the performance by fine-tuning fewer parameters, we propose Parameter-Efficient Crossmodal Learning (PECL), where a Uniform Temporal Adapter (UT-Adapter) explores temporal attention in transformer-based architectures, and a crossmodal fusion module, Plug-in Audio-Visual Fusion (PAVF), combines crossmodal information from audio-visual features. Based on the rich fine-grained audio-visual annotations on DOLOS, we also exploit multi-task learning to enhance performance by concurrently predicting deception and audio-visual features. Experimental results demonstrate the desired quality of the DOLOS dataset and the effectiveness of the PECL.

- **Summary**: Multi-person pose forecasting remains a challenging problem, especially in modeling fine-grained human body interaction in complex crowd scenarios. Existing methods typically represent the whole pose sequence as a temporal series, yet overlook interactive influences among people based on skeletal body parts. In this paper, we propose a novel Trajectory-Aware Body Interaction Transformer (TBIFormer) for multi-person pose forecasting via effectively modeling body part interactions. Specifically, we construct a Temporal Body Partition Module that transforms all the pose sequences into a Multi-Person Body-Part sequence to retain spatial and temporal information based on body semantics. Then, we devise a Social Body Interaction Self-Attention (SBI-MSA) module, utilizing the transformed sequence to learn body part dynamics for inter- and intra-individual interactions. Furthermore, different from prior Euclidean distance-based spatial encodings, we present a novel and efficient Trajectory-Aware Relative Position Encoding for SBI-MSA to offer discriminative spatial information and additional interactive clues. On both short- and long-term horizons, we empirically evaluate our framework on CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D as well as synthesized datasets (6 ~ 10 persons), and demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: One major challenge in machine learning applications is coping with mismatches between the datasets used in the development and those obtained in real-world applications. These mismatches may lead to inaccurate predictions and errors, resulting in poor product quality and unreliable systems. In this study, we propose StyleDiff to inform developers of the differences between the two datasets for the steady development of machine learning systems. Using disentangled image spaces obtained from recently proposed generative models, StyleDiff compares the two datasets by focusing on attributes in the images and provides an easy-to-understand analysis of the differences between the datasets. The proposed StyleDiff performs in $O (d N\log N)$, where $N$ is the size of the datasets and $d$ is the number of attributes, enabling the application to large datasets. We demonstrate that StyleDiff accurately detects differences between datasets and presents them in an understandable format using, for example, driving scenes datasets.

- **Summary**: Few-shot instance segmentation extends the few-shot learning paradigm to the instance segmentation task, which tries to segment instance objects from a query image with a few annotated examples of novel categories. Conventional approaches have attempted to address the task via prototype learning, known as point estimation. However, this mechanism is susceptible to noise and suffers from bias due to a significant scarcity of data. To overcome the disadvantages of the point estimation mechanism, we propose a novel approach, dubbed MaskDiff, which models the underlying conditional distribution of a binary mask, which is conditioned on an object region and $K$-shot information. Inspired by augmentation approaches that perturb data with Gaussian noise for populating low data density regions, we model the mask distribution with a diffusion probabilistic model. In addition, we propose to utilize classifier-free guided mask sampling to integrate category information into the binary mask generation process. Without bells and whistles, our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both base and novel classes of the COCO dataset while simultaneously being more stable than existing methods.

- **Summary**: When it comes to the optimization of CAD models in the automation domain, neural networks currently play only a minor role. Optimizing abstract features such as automation capability is challenging, since they can be very difficult to simulate, are too complex for rule-based systems, and also have little to no data available for machine-learning methods. On the other hand, image manipulation methods that can manipulate abstract features in images such as StyleCLIP have seen much success. They rely on the latent space of pretrained generative adversarial networks, and could therefore also make use of the vast amount of unlabeled CAD data. In this paper, we show that such an approach is also suitable for optimizing abstract automation-related features of CAD parts. We achieved this by extending StyleCLIP to work with CAD models in the form of voxel models, which includes using a 3D StyleGAN and a custom classifier. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our system for the optimiziation of automation-related features by optimizing the grabability of various CAD models.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection is an essential but challenging task. The prevalent methods mainly investigate the reconstruction difference between normal and abnormal patterns but ignore the semantics consistency between appearance and motion information of behavior patterns, making the results highly dependent on the local context of frame sequences and lacking the understanding of behavior semantics. To address this issue, we propose a framework of Appearance-Motion Semantics Representation Consistency that uses the gap of appearance and motion semantic representation consistency between normal and abnormal data. The two-stream structure is designed to encode the appearance and motion information representation of normal samples, and a novel consistency loss is proposed to enhance the consistency of feature semantics so that anomalies with low consistency can be identified. Moreover, the lower consistency features of anomalies can be used to deteriorate the quality of the predicted frame, which makes anomalies easier to spot. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Many eye diseases like Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), and Glaucoma manifest in the retina, can cause irreversible blindness or severely impair the central version. The Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a 3D scan of the retina with high qualitative information about the retinal morphology, can be used to diagnose and monitor changes in the retinal anatomy. Many Deep Learning (DL) methods have shared the success of developing an automated tool to monitor pathological changes in the retina. However, the success of these methods depend mainly on large datasets. To address the challenge from very small and limited datasets, we proposed a DL architecture termed CoNet (Coherent Network) for joint segmentation of layers and fluids in retinal OCT images on very small datasets (less than a hundred training samples). The proposed model was evaluated on the publicly available Duke DME dataset consisting of 110 B-Scans from 10 patients suffering from DME. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperformed both the human experts' annotation and the current state-of-the-art architectures by a clear margin with a mean Dice Score of 88% when trained on 55 images without any data augmentation.

- **Summary**: Due to the limited availability of anomalous samples for training, video anomaly detection is commonly viewed as a one-class classification problem. Many prevalent methods investigate the reconstruction difference produced by AutoEncoders (AEs) under the assumption that the AEs would reconstruct the normal data well while reconstructing anomalies poorly. However, even with only normal data training, the AEs often reconstruct anomalies well, which depletes their anomaly detection performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient framework for video anomaly detection. The pseudo anomaly samples are introduced, which are synthesized from only normal data by embedding random mask tokens without extra data processing. We also propose a normalcy consistency training strategy that encourages the AEs to better learn the regular knowledge from normal and corresponding pseudo anomaly data. This way, the AEs learn more distinct reconstruction boundaries between normal and abnormal data, resulting in superior anomaly discrimination capability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of cerebral blood vessels from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an open problem that could be solved with deep learning (DL). However, annotated data for training is often scarce. Due to the absence of open-source tools, we aim to develop a classical segmentation method that generates vessel ground truth from Magnetic Resonance Angiography for DL training of segmentation across a variety of modalities. The method combines size-specific Hessian filters, hysteresis thresholding and connected component correction. The optimal choice of processing steps was evaluated with a blinded scoring by a clinician using 24 3D images. The results show that all method steps are necessary to produce the highest (14.2/15) vessel segmentation quality score. Omitting the connected component correction caused the largest quality loss. The method, which is available on GitHub, can be used to train DL models for vessel segmentation.

- **Summary**: Frame prediction based on AutoEncoder plays a significant role in unsupervised video anomaly detection. Ideally, the models trained on the normal data could generate larger prediction errors of anomalies. However, the correlation between appearance and motion information is underutilized, which makes the models lack an understanding of normal patterns. Moreover, the models do not work well due to the uncontrollable generalizability of deep AutoEncoder. To tackle these problems, we propose a multi-level memory-augmented appearance-motion correspondence framework. The latent correspondence between appearance and motion is explored via appearance-motion semantics alignment and semantics replacement training. Besides, we also introduce a Memory-Guided Suppression Module, which utilizes the difference from normal prototype features to suppress the reconstruction capacity caused by skip-connection, achieving the tradeoff between the good reconstruction of normal data and the poor reconstruction of abnormal data. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving AUCs of 99.6\%, 93.8\%, and 76.3\% on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets.

- **Summary**: The goal of continual learning is to improve the performance of recognition models in learning sequentially arrived data. Although most existing works are established on the premise of learning from scratch, growing efforts have been devoted to incorporating the benefits of pre-training. However, how to adaptively exploit the pre-trained knowledge for each incremental task while maintaining its generalizability remains an open question. In this work, we present an extensive analysis for continual learning on a pre-trained model (CLPM), and attribute the key challenge to a progressive overfitting problem. Observing that selectively reducing the learning rate can almost resolve this issue in the representation layer, we propose a simple but extremely effective approach named Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment (SLCA), which further improves the classification layer by modeling the class-wise distributions and aligning the classification layers in a post-hoc fashion. Across a variety of scenarios, our proposal provides substantial improvements for CLPM (e.g., up to 49.76%, 50.05%, 44.69% and 40.16% on Split CIFAR-100, Split ImageNet-R, Split CUB-200 and Split Cars-196, respectively), and thus outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. Based on such a strong baseline, critical factors and promising directions are analyzed in-depth to facilitate subsequent research.

- **Summary**: In realistic open-set scenarios where labels of a part of testing data are totally unknown, current prompt methods on vision-language (VL) models always predict the unknown classes as the downstream training classes. The exhibited label bias causes difficulty in the open set recognition (OSR), by which an image should be correctly predicted as one of the known classes or the unknown one. To learn prompts in open-set scenarios, we propose the Regularized prompt Tuning (R-Tuning) to mitigate the label bias. It introduces open words from the WordNet to extend the range of words forming the prompt texts from only closed-set label words to more. Thus, prompts are tuned in a simulated open-set scenario. Besides, inspired by the observation that classifying directly on large datasets causes a much higher false positive rate than on small datasets, we propose the Combinatorial Tuning and Testing (CTT) strategy for improving performance. CTT decomposes R-Tuning on large datasets as multiple independent group-wise tuning on fewer classes, then makes comprehensive predictions by selecting the optimal sub-prompt. For fair comparisons, we construct new baselines for OSR based on VL models, especially for prompt methods. Our method achieves the best results on datasets with various scales. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an approach for creating a visual place recognition (VPR) database for localization in indoor environments from RGBD scanning sequences. The proposed approach is formulated as a minimization problem in terms of dominating set algorithm for graph, constructed from spatial information, and referred as DominatingSet. Our algorithm shows better scene coverage in comparison to other methodologies that are used for database creation. Also, we demonstrate that using DominatingSet, a database size could be up to 250-1400 times smaller than the original scanning sequence while maintaining a recall rate of more than 80% on testing sequences. We evaluated our algorithm on 7-scenes and BundleFusion datasets and an additionally recorded sequence in a highly repetitive office setting. In addition, the database selection can produce weakly-supervised labels for fine-tuning neural place recognition algorithms to particular settings, improving even more their accuracy. The paper also presents a fully automated pipeline for VPR database creation from RGBD scanning sequences, as well as a set of metrics for VPR database evaluation. The code and released data are available on our web-page~ -- https://prime-slam.github.io/place-recognition-db/

- **Summary**: Human brains respond to semantic features of presented stimuli with different neurons. It is then curious whether modern deep neural networks admit a similar behavior pattern. Specifically, this paper finds a small cluster of neurons in a diffusion model corresponding to a particular subject. We call those neurons the concept neurons. They can be identified by statistics of network gradients to a stimulation connected with the given subject. The concept neurons demonstrate magnetic properties in interpreting and manipulating generation results. Shutting them can directly yield the related subject contextualized in different scenes. Concatenating multiple clusters of concept neurons can vividly generate all related concepts in a single image. A few steps of further fine-tuning can enhance the multi-concept capability, which may be the first to manage to generate up to four different subjects in a single image. For large-scale applications, the concept neurons are environmentally friendly as we only need to store a sparse cluster of int index instead of dense float32 values of the parameters, which reduces storage consumption by 90\% compared with previous subject-driven generation methods. Extensive qualitative and quantitative studies on diverse scenarios show the superiority of our method in interpreting and manipulating diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning has made significant progress in medical image segmentation. However, existing methods primarily utilize information acquired from a single dimensionality (2D/3D), resulting in sub-optimal performance on challenging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with multiple objects and highly anisotropic resolution. To address this issue, we present a Hybrid Dual Mean-Teacher (HD-Teacher) model with hybrid, semi-supervised, and multi-task learning to achieve highly effective semi-supervised segmentation. HD-Teacher employs a 2D and a 3D mean-teacher network to produce segmentation labels and signed distance fields from the hybrid information captured in both dimensionalities. This hybrid learning mechanism allows HD-Teacher to combine the `best of both worlds', utilizing features extracted from either 2D, 3D, or both dimensions to produce outputs as it sees fit. Outputs from 2D and 3D teacher models are also dynamically combined, based on their individual uncertainty scores, into a single hybrid prediction, where the hybrid uncertainty is estimated. We then propose a hybrid regularization module to encourage both student models to produce results close to the uncertainty-weighted hybrid prediction. The hybrid uncertainty suppresses unreliable knowledge in the hybrid prediction, leaving only useful information to improve network performance further. Extensive experiments of binary and multi-class segmentation conducted on three MRI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Most computer vision and machine learning-based approaches for historical document analysis are tailored to grayscale or RGB images and thus, mostly exploit their spatial information. Multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) images contain, next to the spatial information, much richer spectral information than RGB images (usually spreading beyond the visible spectral range) that can facilitate more effective feature extraction, more accurate classification and recognition, and thus, improved analysis. Although utilization of rich spectral information can improve historical document analysis tremendously, there are still some potential limitations of HS imagery such as camera-induced noise and blur that require a carefully designed preprocessing step. Here, we propose novel blind HS image deblurring methods tailored to document images. We exploit a low-rank property of HS images (i.e., by projecting an HS image to a lower dimensional subspace) and utilize a text tailor image prior to performing a PSF estimation and deblurring of subspace components. The preliminary results show that the proposed approach gives good results over all spectral bands, removing successfully image artefacts introduced by blur and noise and significantly increasing the number of bands that can be used in further analysis.

- **Summary**: Training object detection models usually requires instance-level annotations, such as the positions and labels of all objects present in each image. Such supervision is unfortunately not always available and, more often, only image-level information is provided, also known as weak supervision. Recent works have addressed this limitation by leveraging knowledge from a richly annotated domain. However, the scope of weak supervision supported by these approaches has been very restrictive, preventing them to use all available information. In this work, we propose ProbKT, a framework based on probabilistic logical reasoning that allows to train object detection models with arbitrary types of weak supervision. We empirically show on different datasets that using all available information is beneficial as our ProbKT leads to significant improvement on target domain and better generalization compared to existing baselines. We also showcase the ability of our approach to handle complex logic statements as supervision signal.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present an efficient optic flow algorithm for the extraction of vertically resolved 3D atmospheric motion vector (AMV) fields from incomplete hyperspectral image data measures by infrared sounders. The model at the heart of the energy to be minimized is consistent with atmospheric dynamics, incorporating ingredients of thermodynamics, hydrostatic equilibrium and statistical turbulence. Modern optimization techniques are deployed to design a low-complexity solver for the energy minimization problem, which is non-convex, non-differentiable, high-dimensional and subject to physical constraints. In particular, taking advantage of the alternate direction of multipliers methods (ADMM), we show how to split the original high-dimensional problem into a recursion involving a set of standard and tractable optic-flow sub-problems. By comparing with the ground truth provided by the operational numerical simulation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), we show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art optical flow algorithms in the context of real infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI) observations.

- **Summary**: Flow-based methods have demonstrated promising results in addressing the ill-posed nature of super-resolution (SR) by learning the distribution of high-resolution (HR) images with the normalizing flow. However, these methods can only perform a predefined fixed-scale SR, limiting their potential in real-world applications. Meanwhile, arbitrary-scale SR has gained more attention and achieved great progress. Nonetheless, previous arbitrary-scale SR methods ignore the ill-posed problem and train the model with per-pixel L1 loss, leading to blurry SR outputs. In this work, we propose "Local Implicit Normalizing Flow" (LINF) as a unified solution to the above problems. LINF models the distribution of texture details under different scaling factors with normalizing flow. Thus, LINF can generate photo-realistic HR images with rich texture details in arbitrary scale factors. We evaluate LINF with extensive experiments and show that LINF achieves the state-of-the-art perceptual quality compared with prior arbitrary-scale SR methods.

- **Summary**: Lines are interesting geometrical features commonly seen in indoor and urban environments. There is missing a complete benchmark where one can evaluate lines from a sequential stream of images in all its stages: Line detection, Line Association and Pose error. To do so, we present a complete and exhaustive benchmark for visual lines in a SLAM front-end, both for RGB and RGBD, by providing a plethora of complementary metrics. We have also labelled data from well-known SLAM datasets in order to have all in one poses and accurately annotated lines. In particular, we have evaluated 17 line detection algorithms, 5 line associations methods and the resultant pose error for aligning a pair of frames with several combinations of detector-association. We have packaged all methods and evaluations metrics and made them publicly available on web-page https://prime-slam.github.io/evolin/.

- **Summary**: Weakly-supervised point cloud segmentation with extremely limited labels is highly desirable to alleviate the expensive costs of collecting densely annotated 3D points. This paper explores to apply the consistency regularization that is commonly used in weakly-supervised learning, for its point cloud counterpart with multiple data-specific augmentations, which has not been well studied. We observe that the straightforward way of applying consistency constraints to weakly-supervised point cloud segmentation has two major limitations: noisy pseudo labels due to the conventional confidence-based selection and insufficient consistency constraints due to discarding unreliable pseudo labels. Therefore, we propose a novel Reliability-Adaptive Consistency Network (RAC-Net) to use both prediction confidence and model uncertainty to measure the reliability of pseudo labels and apply consistency training on all unlabeled points while with different consistency constraints for different points based on the reliability of corresponding pseudo labels. Experimental results on the S3DIS and ScanNet-v2 benchmark datasets show that our model achieves superior performance in weakly-supervised point cloud segmentation. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: Temporal action segmentation in untrimmed videos has gained increased attention recently. However, annotating action classes and frame-wise boundaries is extremely time consuming and cost intensive, especially on large-scale datasets. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised approach for learning action classes from untrimmed video sequences. In particular, we propose a temporal embedding network that combines relative time prediction, feature reconstruction, and sequence-to-sequence learning, to preserve the spatial layout and sequential nature of the video features. A two-step clustering pipeline on these embedded feature representations then allows us to enforce temporal consistency within, as well as across videos. Based on the identified clusters, we decode the video into coherent temporal segments that correspond to semantically meaningful action classes. Our evaluation on three challenging datasets shows the impact of each component and, furthermore, demonstrates our state-of-the-art unsupervised action segmentation results.

- **Summary**: Recently, more and more people study online for the convenience of access to massive learning materials (e.g. test questions/notes), thus accurately understanding learning materials became a crucial issue, which is essential for many educational applications. Previous studies focus on using language models to represent the question data. However, test questions (TQ) are usually heterogeneous and multi-modal, e.g., some of them may only contain text, while others half contain images with information beyond their literal description. In this context, both supervised and unsupervised methods are difficult to learn a fused representation of questions. Meanwhile, this problem cannot be solved by conventional methods such as image caption, as the images may contain information complementary rather than duplicate to the text. In this paper, we first improve previous text-only representation with a two-stage unsupervised instance level contrastive based pre-training method (MCL: Mixture Unsupervised Contrastive Learning). Then, TQ-Net was proposed to fuse the content of images to the representation of heterogeneous data. Finally, supervised contrastive learning was conducted on relevance prediction-related downstream tasks, which helped the model to learn the representation of questions effectively. We conducted extensive experiments on question-based tasks on large-scale, real-world datasets, which demonstrated the effectiveness of TQ-Net and improve the precision of downstream applications (e.g. similar questions +2.02% and knowledge point prediction +7.20%). Our code will be available, and we will open-source a subset of our data to promote the development of relative studies.

- **Summary**: This work presents RiDDLE, short for Reversible and Diversified De-identification with Latent Encryptor, to protect the identity information of people from being misused. Built upon a pre-learned StyleGAN2 generator, RiDDLE manages to encrypt and decrypt the facial identity within the latent space. The design of RiDDLE has three appealing properties. First, the encryption process is cipher-guided and hence allows diverse anonymization using different passwords. Second, the true identity can only be decrypted with the correct password, otherwise the system will produce another de-identified face to maintain the privacy. Third, both encryption and decryption share an efficient implementation, benefiting from a carefully tailored lightweight encryptor. Comparisons with existing alternatives confirm that our approach accomplishes the de-identification task with better quality, higher diversity, and stronger reversibility. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of RiDDLE in anonymizing videos. Code and models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: In biomedical imaging, deep learning-based methods are state-of-the-art for every modality (virtual slides, MRI, etc.) In histopathology, these methods can be used to detect certain biomarkers or classify lesions. However, such techniques require large amounts of data to train high-performing models which can be intrinsically difficult to acquire, especially when it comes to scarce biomarkers. To address this challenge, we use a single, pre-trained, deep embeddings extractor to convert images into deep features and train small, dedicated classification head on these embeddings for each classification task. This approach offers several benefits such as the ability to reuse a single pre-trained deep network for various tasks; reducing the amount of labeled data needed as classification heads have fewer parameters; and accelerating training time by up to 1000 times, which allows for much more tuning of the classification head. In this work, we perform an extensive comparison of various open-source backbones and assess their fit to the target histological image domain. This is achieved using a novel method based on a proxy classification task. We demonstrate that thanks to this selection method, an optimal feature extractor can be selected for different tasks on the target domain. We also introduce a feature space augmentation strategy which proves to substantially improve the final metrics computed for the different tasks considered. To demonstrate the benefit of such backbone selection and feature-space augmentation, our experiments are carried out on three separate classification tasks and show a clear improvement on each of them: microcalcifications (29.1% F1-score increase), lymph nodes metastasis (12.5% F1-score increase), mitosis (15.0% F1-score increase).

- **Summary**: Self-supervised blind denoising for Poisson-Gaussian noise remains a challenging task. Pseudo-supervised pairs constructed from single noisy images re-corrupt the signal and degrade the performance. The visible blindspots solve the information loss in masked inputs. However, without explicitly noise sensing, mean square error as an objective function cannot adjust denoising intensities for dynamic noise levels, leading to noticeable residual noise. In this paper, we propose Blind2Sound, a simple yet effective approach to overcome residual noise in denoised images. The proposed adaptive re-visible loss senses noise levels and performs personalized denoising without noise residues while retaining the signal lossless. The theoretical analysis of intermediate medium gradients guarantees stable training, while the Cramer Gaussian loss acts as a regularization to facilitate the accurate perception of noise levels and improve the performance of the denoiser. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the superior performance of our method, especially for single-channel images.

- **Summary**: We propose an automatic method for pose and motion estimation against a ground surface for a ground-moving robot-mounted monocular camera. The framework adopts a semi-dense approach that benefits from both a feature-based method and an image-registration-based method by setting multiple patches in the image for displacement computation through a highly accurate image-registration technique. To improve accuracy, we introduce virtual inverse perspective mapping (IPM) in the refinement step to eliminate the perspective effect on image registration. The pose and motion are jointly and robustly estimated by a formulation of geometric bundle adjustment via virtual IPM. Unlike conventional visual odometry methods, the proposed method is free from cumulative error because it directly estimates pose and motion against the ground by taking advantage of a camera configuration mounted on a ground-moving robot where the camera's vertical motion is ignorable compared to its height within the frame interval and the nearby ground surface is approximately flat. We conducted experiments in which the relative mean error of the pitch and roll angles was approximately 1.0 degrees and the absolute mean error of the travel distance was 0.3 mm, even under camera shaking within a short period.

- **Summary**: Standard unsupervised domain adaptation methods adapt models from a source to a target domain using labeled source data and unlabeled target data jointly. In model adaptation, on the other hand, access to the labeled source data is prohibited, i.e., only the source-trained model and unlabeled target data are available. We investigate normal-to-adverse condition model adaptation for semantic segmentation, whereby image-level correspondences are available in the target domain. The target set consists of unlabeled pairs of adverse- and normal-condition street images taken at GPS-matched locations. Our method -- CMA -- leverages such image pairs to learn condition-invariant features via contrastive learning. In particular, CMA encourages features in the embedding space to be grouped according to their condition-invariant semantic content and not according to the condition under which respective inputs are captured. To obtain accurate cross-domain semantic correspondences, we warp the normal image to the viewpoint of the adverse image and leverage warp-confidence scores to create robust, aggregated features. With this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance for model adaptation on several normal-to-adverse adaptation benchmarks, such as ACDC and Dark Zurich. We also evaluate CMA on a newly procured adverse-condition generalization benchmark and report favorable results compared to standard unsupervised domain adaptation methods, despite the comparative handicap of CMA due to source data inaccessibility.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we revisit the rotation averaging problem applied in global Structure-from-Motion pipelines. We argue that the main problem of current methods is the minimized cost function that is only weakly connected with the input data via the estimated epipolar geometries.We propose to better model the underlying noise distributions by directly propagating the uncertainty from the point correspondences into the rotation averaging. Such uncertainties are obtained for free by considering the Jacobians of two-view refinements. Moreover, we explore integrating a variant of the MAGSAC loss into the rotation averaging problem, instead of using classical robust losses employed in current frameworks. The proposed method leads to results superior to baselines, in terms of accuracy, on large-scale public benchmarks. The code is public. https://github.com/zhangganlin/GlobalSfMpy

- **Summary**: More than a thousand 8" silicon sensors will be visually inspected to look for anomalies on their surface during the quality control preceding assembly into the High-Granularity Calorimeter for the CMS experiment at CERN. A deep learning-based algorithm that pre-selects potentially anomalous images of the sensor surface in real time has been developed to automate the visual inspection. The anomaly detection is done by an ensemble of independent deep convolutional neural networks: an autoencoder and a classifier. The performance is evaluated on images acquired in production. The pre-selection reduces the number of images requiring human inspection by 85%, with recall of 97%. Data gathered in production can be used for continuous learning to improve the accuracy incrementally.

- **Summary**: Event cameras have recently gained significant traction since they open up new avenues for low-latency and low-power solutions to complex computer vision problems. To unlock these solutions, it is necessary to develop algorithms that can leverage the unique nature of event data. However, the current state-of-the-art is still highly influenced by the frame-based literature, and usually fails to deliver on these promises. In this work, we take this into consideration and propose a novel self-supervised learning pipeline for the sequential estimation of event-based optical flow that allows for the scaling of the models to high inference frequencies. At its core, we have a continuously-running stateful neural model that is trained using a novel formulation of contrast maximization that makes it robust to nonlinearities and varying statistics in the input events. Results across multiple datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method, which establishes a new state of the art in terms of accuracy for approaches trained or optimized without ground truth.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of tissue in histopathological images can be very beneficial for defining regions of interest (ROI) for streamline of diagnostic and prognostic tasks. Still, adapting to different domains is essential for histopathology image analysis, as the visual characteristics of tissues can vary significantly across datasets. Yet, acquiring sufficient annotated data in the medical domain is cumbersome and time-consuming. The labeling effort can be significantly reduced by leveraging active learning, which enables the selective annotation of the most informative samples. Our proposed method allows for fine-tuning a pre-trained deep neural network using a small set of labeled data from the target domain, while also actively selecting the most informative samples to label next. We demonstrate that our approach performs with significantly fewer labeled samples compared to traditional supervised learning approaches for similar F1-scores, using barely a 59\% of the training set. We also investigate the distribution of class balance to establish annotation guidelines.

- **Summary**: Recent works on pose-based gait recognition have demonstrated the potential of using such simple information to achieve results comparable to silhouette-based methods. However, the generalization ability of pose-based methods on different datasets is undesirably inferior to that of silhouette-based ones, which has received little attention but hinders the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. To improve the generalization ability of pose-based methods across datasets, we propose a \textbf{G}eneralized \textbf{P}ose-based \textbf{Gait} recognition (\textbf{GPGait}) framework. First, a Human-Oriented Transformation (HOT) and a series of Human-Oriented Descriptors (HOD) are proposed to obtain a unified pose representation with discriminative multi-features. Then, given the slight variations in the unified representation after HOT and HOD, it becomes crucial for the network to extract local-global relationships between the keypoints. To this end, a Part-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (PAGCN) is proposed to enable efficient graph partition and local-global spatial feature extraction. Experiments on four public gait recognition datasets, CASIA-B, OUMVLP-Pose, Gait3D and GREW, show that our model demonstrates better and more stable cross-domain capabilities compared to existing skeleton-based methods, achieving comparable recognition results to silhouette-based ones.

- **Summary**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable progress in the natural image field. However, when applying GANs in the remote sensing (RS) image generation task, an extraordinary phenomenon is observed: the GAN model is more sensitive to the size of training data for RS image generation than for natural image generation. In other words, the generation quality of RS images will change significantly with the number of training categories or samples per category. In this paper, we first analyze this phenomenon from two kinds of toy experiments and conclude that the amount of feature information contained in the GAN model decreases with reduced training data. Then we establish a structural causal model (SCM) of the data generation process and interpret the generated data as the counterfactuals. Based on this SCM, we theoretically prove that the quality of generated images is positively correlated with the amount of feature information. This provides insights for enriching the feature information learned by the GAN model during training. Consequently, we propose two innovative adjustment schemes, namely Uniformity Regularization (UR) and Entropy Regularization (ER), to increase the information learned by the GAN model at the distributional and sample levels, respectively. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our methods. Extensive experiments on three RS datasets and two natural datasets show that our methods outperform the well-established models on RS image generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) achieves outstanding success in self-supervised representation learning. Unfortunately, MIM models typically have huge computational burden and slow learning process, which is an inevitable obstacle for their industrial applications. Although the lower layers play the key role in MIM, existing MIM models conduct reconstruction task only at the top layer of encoder. The lower layers are not explicitly guided and the interaction among their patches is only used for calculating new activations. Considering the reconstruction task requires non-trivial inter-patch interactions to reason target signals, we apply it to multiple local layers including lower and upper layers. Further, since the multiple layers expect to learn the information of different scales, we design local multi-scale reconstruction, where the lower and upper layers reconstruct fine-scale and coarse-scale supervision signals respectively. This design not only accelerates the representation learning process by explicitly guiding multiple layers, but also facilitates multi-scale semantical understanding to the input. Extensive experiments show that with significantly less pre-training burden, our model achieves comparable or better performance on classification, detection and segmentation tasks than existing MIM models.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel end-to-end method for cross-view pose estimation. Given a ground-level query image and an aerial image that covers the query's local neighborhood, the 3 Degrees-of-Freedom camera pose of the query is estimated by matching its image descriptor to descriptors of local regions within the aerial image. The orientation-aware descriptors are obtained by using a translational equivariant convolutional ground image encoder and contrastive learning. The Localization Decoder produces a dense probability distribution in a coarse-to-fine manner with a novel Localization Matching Upsampling module. A smaller Orientation Decoder produces a vector field to condition the orientation estimate on the localization. Our method is validated on the VIGOR and KITTI datasets, where it surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline by 72% and 36% in median localization error for comparable orientation estimation accuracy. The predicted probability distribution can represent localization ambiguity, and enables rejecting possible erroneous predictions. Without re-training, the model can infer on ground images with different field of views and utilize orientation priors if available. On the Oxford RobotCar dataset, our method can reliably estimate the ego-vehicle's pose over time, achieving a median localization error under 1 meter and a median orientation error of around 1 degree at 14 FPS.

- **Summary**: Visual prompt learning, as a newly emerged technique, leverages the knowledge learned by a large-scale pre-trained model and adapts it to downstream tasks through the usage of prompts. While previous research has focused on designing effective prompts, in this work, we argue that compared to prompt design, a good mapping strategy matters more. In this sense, we propose SeMap, a more effective mapping using the semantic alignment between the pre-trained model's knowledge and the downstream task. Our experimental results show that SeMap can largely boost the performance of visual prompt learning. Moreover, our experiments show that SeMap is capable of achieving competitive zero-shot transfer, indicating that it can perform the downstream task without any fine-tuning on the corresponding dataset. This demonstrates the potential of our proposed method to be used in a broader range of applications where the zero-shot transfer is desired. Results suggest that our proposed SeMap could lead to significant advancements in both visual prompt learning and zero-shot transfer. We hope with SeMap, we can help the community move forward to more efficient and lightweight utilization of large vision models.

- **Summary**: Cell detection is an important task in biomedical research. Recently, deep learning methods have made it possible to improve the performance of cell detection. However, a detection network trained with training data under a specific condition (source domain) may not work well on data under other conditions (target domains), which is called the domain shift problem. In particular, cells are cultured under different conditions depending on the purpose of the research. Characteristics, e.g., the shapes and density of the cells, change depending on the conditions, and such changes may cause domain shift problems. Here, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method for cell detection using a pseudo-cell-position heatmap, where the cell centroid is at the peak of a Gaussian distribution in the map and selective pseudo-labeling. In the prediction result for the target domain, even if the peak location is correct, the signal distribution around the peak often has a non-Gaussian shape. The pseudo-cell-position heatmap is thus re-generated using the peak positions in the predicted heatmap to have a clear Gaussian shape. Our method selects confident pseudo-cell-position heatmaps based on uncertainty and curriculum learning. We conducted numerous experiments showing that, compared with the existing methods, our method improved detection performance under different conditions.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the task of detecting images generated by text-to-image diffusion models. To evaluate this, we consider images generated from captions in the MSCOCO and Wikimedia datasets using two state-of-the-art models: Stable Diffusion and GLIDE. Our experiments show that it is possible to detect the generated images using simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), starting from features extracted by CLIP, or traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We also observe that models trained on images generated by Stable Diffusion can detect images generated by GLIDE relatively well, however, the reverse is not true. Lastly, we find that incorporating the associated textual information with the images rarely leads to significant improvement in detection results but that the type of subject depicted in the image can have a significant impact on performance. This work provides insights into the feasibility of detecting generated images, and has implications for security and privacy concerns in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is one of the most common imaging techniques used to diagnose various diseases in the medical field. Its high contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution allow the physician to observe details of body parts such as bones, soft tissue, blood vessels, etc. As it involves potentially harmful radiation exposure to patients and surgeons, however, reconstructing 3D CT volume from perpendicular 2D X-ray images is considered a promising alternative, thanks to its lower radiation risk and better accessibility. This is highly challenging though, since it requires reconstruction of 3D anatomical information from 2D images with limited views, where all the information is overlapped. In this paper, we propose PerX2CT, a novel CT reconstruction framework from X-ray that reflects the perspective projection scheme. Our proposed method provides a different combination of features for each coordinate which implicitly allows the model to obtain information about the 3D location. We reveal the potential to reconstruct the selected part of CT with high resolution by properly using the coordinate-wise local and global features. Our approach shows potential for use in clinical applications with low computational complexity and fast inference time, demonstrating superior performance than baselines in multiple evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides complementary information for sub-region analysis of brain tumors. Plenty of methods have been proposed for automatic brain tumor segmentation using four common MRI modalities and achieved remarkable performance. In practice, however, it is common to have one or more modalities missing due to image corruption, artifacts, acquisition protocols, allergy to contrast agents, or simply cost. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework for brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. In the first stage, a multimodal masked autoencoder (M3AE) is proposed, where both random modalities (i.e., modality dropout) and random patches of the remaining modalities are masked for a reconstruction task, for self-supervised learning of robust multimodal representations against missing modalities. To this end, we name our framework M3AE. Meanwhile, we employ model inversion to optimize a representative full-modal image at marginal extra cost, which will be used to substitute for the missing modalities and boost performance during inference. Then in the second stage, a memory-efficient self distillation is proposed to distill knowledge between heterogenous missing-modal situations while fine-tuning the model for supervised segmentation. Our M3AE belongs to the 'catch-all' genre where a single model can be applied to all possible subsets of modalities, thus is economic for both training and deployment. Extensive experiments on BraTS 2018 and 2020 datasets demonstrate its superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods with missing modalities, as well as the efficacy of its components.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, many large-scale land-cover (LC) products have been released, however, current LC products for China either lack a fine resolution or nationwide coverage. With the rapid urbanization of China, there is an urgent need for creating a very-high-resolution (VHR) national-scale LC map for China. In this study, a novel 1-m resolution LC map of China covering $9,600,000 km^2$, called SinoLC-1, was produced by using a deep learning framework and multi-source open-access data. To efficiently generate the VHR national-scale LC map, firstly, the reliable LC labels were collected from three 10-m LC products and Open Street Map data. Secondly, the collected 10-m labels and 1-m Google Earth imagery were utilized in the proposed low-to-high (L2H) framework for training. With weak and self-supervised strategies, the L2H framework resolves the label noise brought by the mismatched resolution between training pairs and produces VHR results. Lastly, we compare the SinoLC-1 with five widely used products and validate it with a sample set including 10,6852 points and a statistical report collected from the government. The results show the SinoLC-1 achieved an OA of 74\% and a Kappa of 0.65. Moreover, as the first 1-m national-scale LC map for China, the SinoLC-1 shows overall acceptable results with the finest landscape details.

- **Summary**: Object pose estimation is a core computer vision problem and often an essential component in robotics. Pose estimation is usually approached by seeking the single best estimate of an object's pose, but this approach is ill-suited for tasks involving visual ambiguity. In such cases it is desirable to estimate the uncertainty as a pose distribution to allow downstream tasks to make informed decisions. Pose distributions can have arbitrary complexity which motivates estimating unparameterized distributions, however, until now they have only been used for orientation estimation on SO(3) due to the difficulty in training on and normalizing over SE(3). We propose a novel method for pose distribution estimation on SE(3). We use a hierarchical grid, a pyramid, which enables efficient importance sampling during training and sparse evaluation of the pyramid at inference, allowing real time 6D pose distribution estimation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SO(3), and to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first quantitative results on pose distribution estimation on SE(3).

- **Summary**: Multi-media communications facilitate global interaction among people. However, despite researchers exploring cross-lingual translation techniques such as machine translation and audio speech translation to overcome language barriers, there is still a shortage of cross-lingual studies on visual speech. This lack of research is mainly due to the absence of datasets containing visual speech and translated text pairs. In this paper, we present \textbf{AVMuST-TED}, the first dataset for \textbf{A}udio-\textbf{V}isual \textbf{Mu}ltilingual \textbf{S}peech \textbf{T}ranslation, derived from \textbf{TED} talks. Nonetheless, visual speech is not as distinguishable as audio speech, making it difficult to develop a mapping from source speech phonemes to the target language text. To address this issue, we propose MixSpeech, a cross-modality self-learning framework that utilizes audio speech to regularize the training of visual speech tasks. To further minimize the cross-modality gap and its impact on knowledge transfer, we suggest adopting mixed speech, which is created by interpolating audio and visual streams, along with a curriculum learning strategy to adjust the mixing ratio as needed. MixSpeech enhances speech translation in noisy environments, improving BLEU scores for four languages on AVMuST-TED by +1.4 to +4.2. Moreover, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in lip reading on CMLR (11.1\%), LRS2 (25.5\%), and LRS3 (28.0\%).

- **Summary**: Looping videos are short video clips that can be looped endlessly without visible seams or artifacts. They provide a very attractive way to capture the dynamism of natural scenes. Existing methods have been mostly limited to 2D representations. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a practical solution that enables an immersive experience on dynamic 3D looping scenes. The key challenge is to consider the per-view looping conditions from asynchronous input while maintaining view consistency for the 3D representation. We propose a novel sparse 3D video representation, namely Multi-Tile Video (MTV), which not only provides a view-consistent prior, but also greatly reduces memory usage, making the optimization of a 4D volume tractable. Then, we introduce a two-stage pipeline to construct the 3D looping MTV from completely asynchronous multi-view videos with no time overlap. A novel looping loss based on video temporal retargeting algorithms is adopted during the optimization to loop the 3D scene. Experiments of our framework have shown promise in successfully generating and rendering photorealistic 3D looping videos in real time even on mobile devices. The code, dataset, and live demos are available in https://limacv.github.io/VideoLoop3D_web/.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained supervision based on object annotations has been widely used for vision and language pre-training (VLP). However, in real-world application scenarios, aligned multi-modal data is usually in the image-caption format, which only provides coarse-grained supervision. It is not only cost-expensive but also compute-expensive to collect object annotations and build object annotation pre-extractor for different scenarios. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained VLP scheme without object annotations from the linguistic perspective. First, we propose a homonym sentence rewriting (HSR) algorithm to provide token-level supervision. The algorithm replaces a verb/noun/adjective/quantifier word of the caption with its homonyms from WordNet. Correspondingly, we propose refined vision-language modeling (RVLM) framework to exploit the token-level supervision. Three refined tasks, i.e., refined image-text contrastive (RITC), refined image-text matching (RITM), and replace language modeling (RLM) are proposed to learn the fine-grained alignment. Extensive experiments on several downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Current Active Speaker Detection (ASD) models achieve great results on AVA-ActiveSpeaker (AVA), using only sound and facial features. Although this approach is applicable in movie setups (AVA), it is not suited for less constrained conditions. To demonstrate this limitation, we propose a Wilder Active Speaker Detection (WASD) dataset, with increased difficulty by targeting the two key components of current ASD: audio and face. Grouped into 5 categories, ranging from optimal conditions to surveillance settings, WASD contains incremental challenges for ASD with tactical impairment of audio and face data. We select state-of-the-art models and assess their performance in two groups of WASD: Easy (cooperative settings) and Hard (audio and/or face are specifically degraded). The results show that: 1) AVA trained models maintain a state-of-the-art performance in WASD Easy group, while underperforming in the Hard one, showing the 2) similarity between AVA and Easy data; and 3) training in WASD does not improve models performance to AVA levels, particularly for audio impairment and surveillance settings. This shows that AVA does not prepare models for wild ASD and current approaches are subpar to deal with such conditions. The proposed dataset also contains body data annotations to provide a new source for ASD, and is available at https://github.com/Tiago-Roxo/WASD.

- **Summary**: Videos depict the change of complex dynamical systems over time in the form of discrete image sequences. Generating controllable videos by learning the dynamical system is an important yet underexplored topic in the computer vision community. This paper presents a novel framework, TiV-ODE, to generate highly controllable videos from a static image and a text caption. Specifically, our framework leverages the ability of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations~(Neural ODEs) to represent complex dynamical systems as a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The resulting framework is capable of generating videos with both desired dynamics and content. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed method in generating highly controllable and visually consistent videos, and its capability of modeling dynamical systems. Overall, this work is a significant step towards developing advanced controllable video generation models that can handle complex and dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: While strides have been made in deep learning based Bengali Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the past decade, the absence of large Document Layout Analysis (DLA) datasets has hindered the application of OCR in document transcription, e.g., transcribing historical documents and newspapers. Moreover, rule-based DLA systems that are currently being employed in practice are not robust to domain variations and out-of-distribution layouts. To this end, we present the first multidomain large Bengali Document Layout Analysis Dataset: BaDLAD. This dataset contains 33,695 human annotated document samples from six domains - i) books and magazines, ii) public domain govt. documents, iii) liberation war documents, iv) newspapers, v) historical newspapers, and vi) property deeds, with 710K polygon annotations for four unit types: text-box, paragraph, image, and table. Through preliminary experiments benchmarking the performance of existing state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for English DLA, we demonstrate the efficacy of our dataset in training deep learning based Bengali document digitization models.

- **Summary**: Object detection on VHR remote sensing images plays a vital role in applications such as urban planning, land resource management, and rescue missions. The large-scale variation of the remote-sensing targets is one of the main challenges in VHR remote-sensing object detection. Existing methods improve the detection accuracy of high-resolution remote sensing objects by improving the structure of feature pyramids and adopting different attention modules. However, for small targets, there still be seriously missed detections due to the loss of key detail features. There is still room for improvement in the way of multiscale feature fusion and balance. To address this issue, this paper proposes two novel modules: Guided Attention and Tucker Bilinear Attention, which are applied to the stages of early fusion and late fusion respectively. The former can effectively retain clean key detail features, and the latter can better balance features through semantic-level correlation mining. Based on two modules, we build a new multi-scale remote sensing object detection framework. No bells and whistles. The proposed method largely improves the average precisions of small objects and achieves the highest mean average precisions compared with 9 state-of-the-art methods on DOTA, DIOR, and NWPU VHR-10.Code and models are available at https://github.com/Shinichict/GTNet.

- **Summary**: Model calibration usually requires optimizing some parameters (e.g., temperature) w.r.t an objective function (e.g., negative log-likelihood). In this paper, we report a plain, important but often neglected fact that the objective function is influenced by calibration set difficulty, i.e., the ratio of the number of incorrectly classified samples to that of correctly classified samples. If a test set has a drastically different difficulty level from the calibration set, the optimal calibration parameters of the two datasets would be different. In other words, a calibrator optimal on the calibration set would be suboptimal on the OOD test set and thus has degraded performance. With this knowledge, we propose a simple and effective method named adaptive calibrator ensemble (ACE) to calibrate OOD datasets whose difficulty is usually higher than the calibration set. Specifically, two calibration functions are trained, one for in-distribution data (low difficulty), and the other for severely OOD data (high difficulty). To achieve desirable calibration on a new OOD dataset, ACE uses an adaptive weighting method that strikes a balance between the two extreme functions. When plugged in, ACE generally improves the performance of a few state-of-the-art calibration schemes on a series of OOD benchmarks. Importantly, such improvement does not come at the cost of the in-distribution calibration accuracy.

- **Summary**: In neural decoding research, one of the most intriguing topics is the reconstruction of perceived natural images based on fMRI signals. Previous studies have succeeded in re-creating different aspects of the visuals, such as low-level properties (shape, texture, layout) or high-level features (category of objects, descriptive semantics of scenes) but have typically failed to reconstruct these properties together for complex scene images. Generative AI has recently made a leap forward with latent diffusion models capable of generating high-complexity images. Here, we investigate how to take advantage of this innovative technology for brain decoding. We present a two-stage scene reconstruction framework called ``Brain-Diffuser''. In the first stage, starting from fMRI signals, we reconstruct images that capture low-level properties and overall layout using a VDVAE (Very Deep Variational Autoencoder) model. In the second stage, we use the image-to-image framework of a latent diffusion model (Versatile Diffusion) conditioned on predicted multimodal (text and visual) features, to generate final reconstructed images. On the publicly available Natural Scenes Dataset benchmark, our method outperforms previous models both qualitatively and quantitatively. When applied to synthetic fMRI patterns generated from individual ROI (region-of-interest) masks, our trained model creates compelling ``ROI-optimal'' scenes consistent with neuroscientific knowledge. Thus, the proposed methodology can have an impact on both applied (e.g. brain-computer interface) and fundamental neuroscience.

- **Summary**: Visual Relation Detection (VRD) aims to detect relationships between objects for image understanding. Most existing VRD methods rely on thousands of training samples of each relationship to achieve satisfactory performance. Some recent papers tackle this problem by few-shot learning with elaborately designed pipelines and pre-trained word vectors. However, the performance of existing few-shot VRD models is severely hampered by the poor generalization capability, as they struggle to handle the vast semantic diversity of visual relationships. Nonetheless, humans have the ability to learn new relationships with just few examples based on their knowledge. Inspired by this, we devise a knowledge-augmented, few-shot VRD framework leveraging both textual knowledge and visual relation knowledge to improve the generalization ability of few-shot VRD. The textual knowledge and visual relation knowledge are acquired from a pre-trained language model and an automatically constructed visual relation knowledge graph, respectively. We extensively validate the effectiveness of our framework. Experiments conducted on three benchmarks from the commonly used Visual Genome dataset show that our performance surpasses existing state-of-the-art models with a large improvement.

- **Summary**: Pansharpening is an essential preprocessing step for remote sensing image processing. Although deep learning (DL) approaches performed well on this task, current upsampling methods used in these approaches only utilize the local information of each pixel in the low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image while neglecting to exploit its global information as well as the cross-modal information of the guiding panchromatic (PAN) image, which limits their performance improvement. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel probability-based global cross-modal upsampling (PGCU) method for pan-sharpening. Precisely, we first formulate the PGCU method from a probabilistic perspective and then design an efficient network module to implement it by fully utilizing the information mentioned above while simultaneously considering the channel specificity. The PGCU module consists of three blocks, i.e., information extraction (IE), distribution and expectation estimation (DEE), and fine adjustment (FA). Extensive experiments verify the superiority of the PGCU method compared with other popular upsampling methods. Additionally, experiments also show that the PGCU module can help improve the performance of existing SOTA deep learning pansharpening methods.

- **Summary**: LiDAR segmentation is crucial for autonomous driving perception. Recent trends favor point- or voxel-based methods as they often yield better performance than the traditional range view representation. In this work, we unveil several key factors in building powerful range view models. We observe that the "many-to-one" mapping, semantic incoherence, and shape deformation are possible impediments against effective learning from range view projections. We present RangeFormer -- a full-cycle framework comprising novel designs across network architecture, data augmentation, and post-processing -- that better handles the learning and processing of LiDAR point clouds from the range view. We further introduce a Scalable Training from Range view (STR) strategy that trains on arbitrary low-resolution 2D range images, while still maintaining satisfactory 3D segmentation accuracy. We show that, for the first time, a range view method is able to surpass the point, voxel, and multi-view fusion counterparts in the competing LiDAR semantic and panoptic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and ScribbleKITTI.

- **Summary**: Recently, a few self-supervised representation learning (SSL) methods have outperformed the ImageNet classification pre-training for vision tasks such as object detection. However, its effects on 3D human body pose and shape estimation (3DHPSE) are open to question, whose target is fixed to a unique class, the human, and has an inherent task gap with SSL. We empirically study and analyze the effects of SSL and further compare it with other pre-training alternatives for 3DHPSE. The alternatives are 2D annotation-based pre-training and synthetic data pre-training, which share the motivation of SSL that aims to reduce the labeling cost. They have been widely utilized as a source of weak-supervision or fine-tuning, but have not been remarked as a pre-training source. SSL methods underperform the conventional ImageNet classification pre-training on multiple 3DHPSE benchmarks by 7.7% on average. In contrast, despite a much less amount of pre-training data, the 2D annotation-based pre-training improves accuracy on all benchmarks and shows faster convergence during fine-tuning. Our observations challenge the naive application of the current SSL pre-training to 3DHPSE and relight the value of other data types in the pre-training aspect.

- **Summary**: Latent diffusion models for image generation have crossed a quality threshold which enabled them to achieve mass adoption. Recently, a series of works have made advancements towards replicating this success in the 3D domain, introducing techniques such as point cloud VAE, triplane representation, neural implicit surfaces and differentiable rendering based training. We take another step along this direction, combining these developments in a two-step pipeline consisting of 1) a triplane VAE which can learn latent representations of textured meshes and 2) a conditional diffusion model which generates the triplane features. For the first time this architecture allows conditional and unconditional generation of high quality textured or untextured 3D meshes across multiple diverse categories in a few seconds on a single GPU. It outperforms previous work substantially on image-conditioned and unconditional generation on mesh quality as well as texture generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our model to large datasets for increased quality and diversity. We will release our code and trained models.

- **Summary**: This paper presents FaceXHuBERT, a text-less speech-driven 3D facial animation generation method that allows to capture personalized and subtle cues in speech (e.g. identity, emotion and hesitation). It is also very robust to background noise and can handle audio recorded in a variety of situations (e.g. multiple people speaking). Recent approaches employ end-to-end deep learning taking into account both audio and text as input to generate facial animation for the whole face. However, scarcity of publicly available expressive audio-3D facial animation datasets poses a major bottleneck. The resulting animations still have issues regarding accurate lip-synching, expressivity, person-specific information and generalizability. We effectively employ self-supervised pretrained HuBERT model in the training process that allows us to incorporate both lexical and non-lexical information in the audio without using a large lexicon. Additionally, guiding the training with a binary emotion condition and speaker identity distinguishes the tiniest subtle facial motion. We carried out extensive objective and subjective evaluation in comparison to ground-truth and state-of-the-art work. A perceptual user study demonstrates that our approach produces superior results with respect to the realism of the animation 78% of the time in comparison to the state-of-the-art. In addition, our method is 4 times faster eliminating the use of complex sequential models such as transformers. We strongly recommend watching the supplementary video before reading the paper. We also provide the implementation and evaluation codes with a GitHub repository link.

- **Summary**: Neural kernels have drastically increased performance on diverse and nonstandard data modalities but require significantly more compute, which previously limited their application to smaller datasets. In this work, we address this by massively parallelizing their computation across many GPUs. We combine this with a distributed, preconditioned conjugate gradients algorithm to enable kernel regression at a large scale (i.e. up to five million examples). Using this approach, we study scaling laws of several neural kernels across many orders of magnitude for the CIFAR-5m dataset. Using data augmentation to expand the original CIFAR-10 training dataset by a factor of 20, we obtain a test accuracy of 91.2\% (SotA for a pure kernel method). Moreover, we explore neural kernels on other data modalities, obtaining results on protein and small molecule prediction tasks that are competitive with SotA methods.

- **Summary**: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one neuro developmental disorder that is now widespread in the world. ASD persists throughout the life of an individual, impacting the way they behave and communicate, resulting to notable deficits consisting of social life retardation, repeated behavioural traits and a restriction in their interests. Early detection of the disorder helps in the onset treatment and helps one to lead a normal life. There are clinical approaches used in detection of autism, relying on behavioural data and in worst cases, neuroimaging. Quantitative methods involving machine learning have been studied and developed to overcome issues with clinical approaches. These quantitative methods rely on machine learning, with some complex methods based on deep learning developed to accelerate detection and diagnosis of ASD. These literature is aimed at exploring most state-of-the-art probabilistic methods in use today, characterizing them with the type of dataset they're most applied on, their accuracy according to their novel research and how well they are suited in ASD classification. The findings will purposely serve as a benchmark in selection of the model to use when performing ASD detection.

- **Summary**: Touch-based fingerprint biometrics is one of the most popular biometric modalities with applications in several fields. Problems associated with touch-based techniques such as the presence of latent fingerprints and hygiene issues due to many people touching the same surface motivated the community to look for non-contact-based solutions. For the last few years, contactless fingerprint systems are on the rise and in demand because of the ability to turn any device with a camera into a fingerprint reader. Yet, before we can fully utilize the benefit of noncontact-based methods, the biometric community needs to resolve a few concerns such as the resiliency of the system against presentation attacks. One of the major obstacles is the limited publicly available data sets with inadequate spoof and live data. In this publication, we have developed a Presentation attack detection (PAD) dataset of more than 7500 four-finger images and more than 14,000 manually segmented single-fingertip images, and 10,000 synthetic fingertips (deepfakes). The PAD dataset was collected from six different Presentation Attack Instruments (PAI) of three different difficulty levels according to FIDO protocols, with five different types of PAI materials, and different smartphone cameras with manual focusing. We have utilized DenseNet-121 and NasNetMobile models and our proposed dataset to develop PAD algorithms and achieved PAD accuracy of Attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) 0.14\% and Bonafide presentation classification error rate (BPCER) 0.18\%. We have also reported the test results of the models against unseen spoof types to replicate uncertain real-world testing scenarios.

- **Summary**: Pose-based anomaly detection is a video-analysis technique for detecting anomalous events or behaviors by examining human pose extracted from the video frames. Utilizing pose data alleviates privacy and ethical issues. Also, computation-wise, the complexity of pose-based models is lower than pixel-based approaches. However, it introduces more challenges, such as noisy skeleton data, losing important pixel information, and not having enriched enough features. These problems are exacerbated by a lack of anomaly detection datasets that are good enough representatives of real-world scenarios. In this work, we analyze and quantify the characteristics of two well-known video anomaly datasets to better understand the difficulties of pose-based anomaly detection. We take a step forward, exploring the discriminating power of pose and trajectory for video anomaly detection and their effectiveness based on context. We believe these experiments are beneficial for a better comprehension of pose-based anomaly detection and the datasets currently available. This will aid researchers in tackling the task of anomaly detection with a more lucid perspective, accelerating the development of robust models with better performance.

- **Summary**: The problem of spurious correlations (SCs) arises when a classifier relies on non-predictive features that happen to be correlated with the labels in the training data. For example, a classifier may misclassify dog breeds based on the background of dog images. This happens when the backgrounds are correlated with other breeds in the training data, leading to misclassifications during test time. Previous SC benchmark datasets suffer from varying issues, e.g., over-saturation or only containing one-to-one (O2O) SCs, but no many-to-many (M2M) SCs arising between groups of spurious attributes and classes. In this paper, we present \benchmark-\{O2O, M2M\}-\{Easy, Medium, Hard\}, an image classification benchmark suite containing spurious correlations between classes and backgrounds. To create this dataset, we employ a text-to-image model to generate photo-realistic images and an image captioning model to filter out unsuitable ones. The resulting dataset is of high quality and contains approximately 152k images. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art group robustness methods struggle with \benchmark, most notably on the Hard-splits with none of them getting over $70\%$ accuracy on the hardest split using a ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet. By examining model misclassifications, we detect reliances on spurious backgrounds, demonstrating that our dataset provides a significant challenge.



### Mimic before Reconstruct: Enhancing Masked Autoencoders with Feature Mimicking

- **Summary**: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have been popular paradigms for large-scale vision representation pre-training. However, MAE solely reconstructs the low-level RGB signals after the decoder and lacks supervision upon high-level semantics for the encoder, thus suffering from sub-optimal learned representations and long pre-training epochs. To alleviate this, previous methods simply replace the pixel reconstruction targets of 75% masked tokens by encoded features from pre-trained image-image (DINO) or image-language (CLIP) contrastive learning. Different from those efforts, we propose to Mimic before Reconstruct for Masked Autoencoders, named as MR-MAE, which jointly learns high-level and low-level representations without interference during pre-training. For high-level semantics, MR-MAE employs a mimic loss over 25% visible tokens from the encoder to capture the pre-trained patterns encoded in CLIP and DINO. For low-level structures, we inherit the reconstruction loss in MAE to predict RGB pixel values for 75% masked tokens after the decoder. As MR-MAE applies high-level and low-level targets respectively at different partitions, the learning conflicts between them can be naturally overcome and contribute to superior visual representations for various downstream tasks. On ImageNet-1K, the MR-MAE base pre-trained for only 400 epochs achieves 85.8% top-1 accuracy after fine-tuning, surpassing the 1600-epoch MAE base by +2.2% and the previous state-of-the-art BEiT V2 base by +0.3%. Code and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/Alpha-VL/ConvMAE.

- **Summary**: The utilization of pre-trained networks, especially those trained on ImageNet, has become a common practice in Computer Vision. However, prior research has indicated that a significant number of images in the ImageNet dataset contain watermarks, making pre-trained networks susceptible to learning artifacts such as watermark patterns within their latent spaces. In this paper, we aim to assess the extent to which popular pre-trained architectures display such behavior and to determine which classes are most affected. Additionally, we examine the impact of watermarks on the extracted features. Contrary to the popular belief that the Chinese logographic watermarks impact the "carton" class only, our analysis reveals that a variety of ImageNet classes, such as "monitor", "broom", "apron" and "safe" rely on spurious correlations. Finally, we propose a simple approach to mitigate this issue in fine-tuned networks by ignoring the encodings from the feature-extractor layer of ImageNet pre-trained networks that are most susceptible to watermark imprints.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present an open-set object detector, called Grounding DINO, by marrying Transformer-based detector DINO with grounded pre-training, which can detect arbitrary objects with human inputs such as category names or referring expressions. The key solution of open-set object detection is introducing language to a closed-set detector for open-set concept generalization. To effectively fuse language and vision modalities, we conceptually divide a closed-set detector into three phases and propose a tight fusion solution, which includes a feature enhancer, a language-guided query selection, and a cross-modality decoder for cross-modality fusion. While previous works mainly evaluate open-set object detection on novel categories, we propose to also perform evaluations on referring expression comprehension for objects specified with attributes. Grounding DINO performs remarkably well on all three settings, including benchmarks on COCO, LVIS, ODinW, and RefCOCO/+/g. Grounding DINO achieves a $52.5$ AP on the COCO detection zero-shot transfer benchmark, i.e., without any training data from COCO. It sets a new record on the ODinW zero-shot benchmark with a mean $26.1$ AP. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO}.

- **Summary**: Many top-down architectures for instance segmentation achieve significant success when trained and tested on pre-defined closed-world taxonomy. However, when deployed in the open world, they exhibit notable bias towards seen classes and suffer from significant performance drop. In this work, we propose a novel approach for open world instance segmentation called bottom-Up and top-Down Open-world Segmentation (UDOS) that combines classical bottom-up segmentation algorithms within a top-down learning framework. UDOS first predicts parts of objects using a top-down network trained with weak supervision from bottom-up segmentations. The bottom-up segmentations are class-agnostic and do not overfit to specific taxonomies. The part-masks are then fed into affinity-based grouping and refinement modules to predict robust instance-level segmentations. UDOS enjoys both the speed and efficiency from the top-down architectures and the generalization ability to unseen categories from bottom-up supervision. We validate the strengths of UDOS on multiple cross-category as well as cross-dataset transfer tasks from 5 challenging datasets including MS-COCO, LVIS, ADE20k, UVO and OpenImages, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art across the board. Our code and models are available on our project page.

- **Summary**: The recent success of text-to-image synthesis has taken the world by storm and captured the general public's imagination. From a technical standpoint, it also marked a drastic change in the favored architecture to design generative image models. GANs used to be the de facto choice, with techniques like StyleGAN. With DALL-E 2, auto-regressive and diffusion models became the new standard for large-scale generative models overnight. This rapid shift raises a fundamental question: can we scale up GANs to benefit from large datasets like LAION? We find that na\"Ively increasing the capacity of the StyleGAN architecture quickly becomes unstable. We introduce GigaGAN, a new GAN architecture that far exceeds this limit, demonstrating GANs as a viable option for text-to-image synthesis. GigaGAN offers three major advantages. First, it is orders of magnitude faster at inference time, taking only 0.13 seconds to synthesize a 512px image. Second, it can synthesize high-resolution images, for example, 16-megapixel pixels in 3.66 seconds. Finally, GigaGAN supports various latent space editing applications such as latent interpolation, style mixing, and vector arithmetic operations.

- **Summary**: Existing approaches to system identification (estimating the physical parameters of an object) from videos assume known object geometries. This precludes their applicability in a vast majority of scenes where object geometries are complex or unknown. In this work, we aim to identify parameters characterizing a physical system from a set of multi-view videos without any assumption on object geometry or topology. To this end, we propose "Physics Augmented Continuum Neural Radiance Fields" (PAC-NeRF), to estimate both the unknown geometry and physical parameters of highly dynamic objects from multi-view videos. We design PAC-NeRF to only ever produce physically plausible states by enforcing the neural radiance field to follow the conservation laws of continuum mechanics. For this, we design a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation of the neural radiance field, i.e., we use the Eulerian grid representation for NeRF density and color fields, while advecting the neural radiance fields via Lagrangian particles. This hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation seamlessly blends efficient neural rendering with the material point method (MPM) for robust differentiable physics simulation. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on geometry and physical parameter estimation over a vast range of materials, including elastic bodies, plasticine, sand, Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, and demonstrate significant performance gain on most tasks.

- **Summary**: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to extract interacting human-object pairs and their interaction categories from a given natural image. Even though the labeling effort required for building HOI detection datasets is inherently more extensive than for many other computer vision tasks, weakly-supervised directions in this area have not been sufficiently explored due to the difficulty of learning human-object interactions with weak supervision, rooted in the combinatorial nature of interactions over the object and predicate space. In this paper, we tackle HOI detection with the weakest supervision setting in the literature, using only image-level interaction labels, with the help of a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) and a large language model (LLM). We first propose an approach to prune non-interacting human and object proposals to increase the quality of positive pairs within the bag, exploiting the grounding capability of the vision-language model. Second, we use a large language model to query which interactions are possible between a human and a given object category, in order to force the model not to put emphasis on unlikely interactions. Lastly, we use an auxiliary weakly-supervised preposition prediction task to make our model explicitly reason about space. Extensive experiments and ablations show that all of our contributions increase HOI detection performance.

- **Summary**: Rainfall data collected by various remote sensing instruments such as radars or satellites has different space-time resolutions. This study aims to improve the temporal resolution of radar rainfall products to help with more accurate climate change modeling and studies. In this direction, we introduce a solution based on EfficientNetV2, namely EfficientTempNet, to increase the temporal resolution of radar-based rainfall products from 10 minutes to 5 minutes. We tested EfficientRainNet over a dataset for the state of Iowa, US, and compared its performance to three different baselines to show that EfficientTempNet presents a viable option for better climate change monitoring.

- **Summary**: Privacy and annotation bottlenecks are two major issues that profoundly affect the practicality of machine learning-based medical image analysis. Although significant progress has been made in these areas, these issues are not yet fully resolved. In this paper, we seek to tackle these concerns head-on and systematically explore the applicability of non-contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms under federated learning (FL) simulations for medical image analysis. We conduct thorough experimentation of recently proposed state-of-the-art non-contrastive frameworks under standard FL setups. With the SoTA Contrastive Learning algorithm, SimCLR as our comparative baseline, we benchmark the performances of our 4 chosen non-contrastive algorithms under non-i.i.d. data conditions and with a varying number of clients. We present a holistic evaluation of these techniques on 6 standardized medical imaging datasets. We further analyse different trends inferred from the findings of our research, with the aim to find directions for further research based on ours. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first to perform such a thorough analysis of federated self-supervised learning for medical imaging. All of our source code will be made public upon acceptance of the paper.

- **Summary**: Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods are a class of efficient iterative methods that aim to combine data fidelity terms and deep denoisers using classical optimization algorithms, such as ISTA or ADMM. Existing provable PnP methods impose heavy restrictions on the denoiser or fidelity function, such as nonexpansiveness or strict convexity. In this work, we propose a provable PnP method that imposes relatively light conditions based on proximal denoisers, and introduce a quasi-Newton step to greatly accelerate convergence. By specially parameterizing the deep denoiser as a gradient step, we further characterize the fixed-points of the quasi-Newton PnP algorithm as critical points of a possibly non-convex function.

- **Summary**: We propose a new 6-DoF grasp pose synthesis approach from 2D/2.5D input based on keypoints. Keypoint-based grasp detector from image input has demonstrated promising results in the previous study, where the additional visual information provided by color images compensates for the noisy depth perception. However, it relies heavily on accurately predicting the location of keypoints in the image space. In this paper, we devise a new grasp generation network that reduces the dependency on precise keypoint estimation. Given an RGB-D input, our network estimates both the grasp pose from keypoint detection as well as scale towards the camera. We further re-design the keypoint output space in order to mitigate the negative impact of keypoint prediction noise to Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline by a large margin, validating the efficacy of our approach. Finally, despite trained on simple synthetic objects, our method demonstrate sim-to-real capacity by showing competitive results in real-world robot experiments.

- **Summary**: The click-based interactive segmentation aims to extract the object of interest from an image with the guidance of user clicks. Recent work has achieved great overall performance by employing the segmentation from the previous output. However, in most state-of-the-art approaches, 1) the inference stage involves inflexible heuristic rules and a separate refinement model; and 2) the training cannot balance the number of user clicks and model performance. To address the challenges, we propose a click-based and mask-guided interactive image segmentation framework containing three novel components: Cascade-Forward Refinement (CFR), Iterative Click Loss (ICL), and SUEM image augmentation. The proposed ICL allows model training to improve segmentation and reduce user interactions simultaneously. The CFR offers a unified inference framework to generate segmentation results in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed SUEM augmentation is a comprehensive way to create large and diverse training sets for interactive image segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach on five public datasets. Remarkably, our model achieves an average of 2.9 and 7.5 clicks of NoC@95 on the Berkeley and DAVIS sets, respectively, improving by 33.2% and 15.5% over the previous state-of-the-art results. The code and trained model are available at https://github.com/TitorX/CFR-ICL-Interactive-Segmentation.

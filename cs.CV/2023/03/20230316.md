- **Summary**: This work focuses on training a single visual relationship detector predicting over the union of label spaces from multiple datasets. Merging labels spanning different datasets could be challenging due to inconsistent taxonomies. The issue is exacerbated in visual relationship detection when second-order visual semantics are introduced between pairs of objects. To address this challenge, we propose UniVRD, a novel bottom-up method for Unified Visual Relationship Detection by leveraging vision and language models (VLMs). VLMs provide well-aligned image and text embeddings, where similar relationships are optimized to be close to each other for semantic unification. Our bottom-up design enables the model to enjoy the benefit of training with both object detection and visual relationship datasets. Empirical results on both human-object interaction detection and scene-graph generation demonstrate the competitive performance of our model. UniVRD achieves 38.07 mAP on HICO-DET, outperforming the current best bottom-up HOI detector by 14.26 mAP. More importantly, we show that our unified detector performs as well as dataset-specific models in mAP, and achieves further improvements when we scale up the model. Our code will be made publicly available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed impressive progress in super-resolution (SR) processing. However, its real-time inference requirement sets a challenge not only for the model design but also for the on-chip implementation. In this paper, we implement a full-stack SR acceleration framework on embedded GPU devices. The special dictionary learning algorithm used in SR models was analyzed in detail and accelerated via a novel dictionary selective strategy. Besides, the hardware programming architecture together with the model structure is analyzed to guide the optimal design of computation kernels to minimize the inference latency under the resource constraints. With these novel techniques, the communication and computation bottlenecks in the deep dictionary learning-based SR models are tackled perfectly. The experiments on the edge embedded NVIDIA NX and 2080Ti show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art NVIDIA TensorRT significantly, and can achieve real-time performance.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been widely investigated for image synthesis based on their powerful representation learning ability. In this work, we explore the StyleGAN and its application of synthetic food image generation. Despite the impressive performance of GAN for natural image generation, food images suffer from high intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity, resulting in overfitting and visual artifacts for synthetic images. Therefore, we aim to explore the capability and improve the performance of GAN methods for food image generation. Specifically, we first choose StyleGAN3 as the baseline method to generate synthetic food images and analyze the performance. Then, we identify two issues that can cause performance degradation on food images during the training phase: (1) inter-class feature entanglement during multi-food classes training and (2) loss of high-resolution detail during image downsampling. To address both issues, we propose to train one food category at a time to avoid feature entanglement and leverage image patches cropped from high-resolution datasets to retain fine details. We evaluate our method on the Food-101 dataset and show improved quality of generated synthetic food images compared with the baseline. Finally, we demonstrate the great potential of improving the performance of downstream tasks, such as food image classification by including high-quality synthetic training samples in the data augmentation.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses fine-grained object detection in scenarios with limited computing resources, such as edge computing. In particular, we focus on a scenario where a single image contains objects of the same category but varying sizes, and we desire an algorithm that can not only recognize the physical class of objects but also detect their size. Deep learning (DL), particularly through the use of deep neural networks (DNNs), has become the primary approach to object detection. However, obtaining accurate fine-grained detection requires a large DNN model and a significant amount of annotated data, presenting a challenge to solve our problem particularly for resource-constrained scenarios. To this end, we propose an approach that utilizes commonsense knowledge to assist a coarse-grained object detector in achieving accurate size-related fine-grained detection results. Specifically, we introduce a commonsense knowledge inference module (CKIM) that processes the coarse-grained labels produced by a benchmark coarse-grained DL detector to generate size-related fine-grained labels. Our CKIM explores both crisp-rule and fuzzy-rule based inference methods, with the latter being employed to handle ambiguity in the target size-related labels. We implement our method based on two modern DL detectors, including Mobilenet-SSD, and YOLOv7-tiny. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves accurate fine-grained detections with a reduced amount of annotated data, and smaller model size.

- **Summary**: Recent research on remote sensing object detection has largely focused on improving the representation of oriented bounding boxes but has overlooked the unique prior knowledge presented in remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because tiny remote sensing objects may be mistakenly detected without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, and the long-range context required by different types of objects can vary. In this paper, we take these priors into account and propose the Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet). LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that large and selective kernel mechanisms have been explored in the field of remote sensing object detection. Without bells and whistles, LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art scores on standard benchmarks, i.e., HRSC2016 (98.46\% mAP), DOTA-v1.0 (81.85\% mAP) and FAIR1M-v1.0 (47.87\% mAP). Based on a similar technique, we rank 2nd place in 2022 the Greater Bay Area International Algorithm Competition. Code is available at https://github.com/zcablii/Large-Selective-Kernel-Network.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates unsupervised representation learning for facial expression analysis. We think Unsupervised Facial Expression Representation (UFER) deserves exploration and has the potential to address some key challenges in facial expression analysis, such as scaling, annotation bias, the discrepancy between discrete labels and continuous emotions, and model pre-training. Such motivated, we propose a UFER method with contrastive local warping (ContraWarping), which leverages the insight that the emotional expression is robust to current global transformation (affine transformation, color jitter, etc.) but can be easily changed by random local warping. Therefore, given a facial image, ContraWarping employs some global transformations and local warping to generate its positive and negative samples and sets up a novel contrastive learning framework. Our in-depth investigation shows that: 1) the positive pairs from global transformations may be exploited with general self-supervised learning (e.g., BYOL) and already bring some informative features, and 2) the negative pairs from local warping explicitly introduce expression-related variation and further bring substantial improvement. Based on ContraWarping, we demonstrate the benefit of UFER under two facial expression analysis scenarios: facial expression recognition and image retrieval. For example, directly using ContraWarping features for linear probing achieves 79.14% accuracy on RAF-DB, significantly reducing the gap towards the full-supervised counterpart (88.92% / 84.81% with/without pre-training).

- **Summary**: Backpropagation-based supervised learning has achieved great success in computer vision tasks. However, its biological plausibility is always controversial. Recently, the bio-inspired Hebbian learning rule (HLR) has received extensive attention. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) uses the competitive HLR to establish connections between neurons, obtaining visual features in an unsupervised way. Although the representation of SOM neurons shows some brain-like characteristics, it is still quite different from the neuron representation in the human visual cortex. This paper proposes an improved SOM with multi-winner, multi-code, and local receptive field, named mlSOM. We observe that the neuron representation of mlSOM is similar to the human visual cortex. Furthermore, mlSOM shows a sparse distributed representation of objects, which has also been found in the human inferior temporal area. In addition, experiments show that mlSOM achieves better classification accuracy than the original SOM and other state-of-the-art HLR-based methods. The code is accessible at https://github.com/JiaHongZ/mlSOM.



### Mimic3D: Thriving 3D-Aware GANs via 3D-to-2D Imitation

- **Summary**: Generating images with both photorealism and multiview 3D consistency is crucial for 3D-aware GANs, yet existing methods struggle to achieve them simultaneously. Improving the photorealism via CNN-based 2D super-resolution can break the strict 3D consistency, while keeping the 3D consistency by learning high-resolution 3D representations for direct rendering often compromises image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel learning strategy, namely 3D-to-2D imitation, which enables a 3D-aware GAN to generate high-quality images while maintaining their strict 3D consistency, by letting the images synthesized by the generator's 3D rendering branch to mimic those generated by its 2D super-resolution branch. We also introduce 3D-aware convolutions into the generator for better 3D representation learning, which further improves the image generation quality. With the above strategies, our method reaches FID scores of 5.4 and 4.3 on FFHQ and AFHQ-v2 Cats, respectively, at 512x512 resolution, largely outperforming existing 3D-aware GANs using direct 3D rendering and coming very close to the previous state-of-the-art method that leverages 2D super-resolution.

### Hybrid Spectral Denoising Transformer with Guided Attention

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a Hybrid Spectral Denoising Transformer (HSDT) for hyperspectral image denoising. Challenges in adapting transformer for HSI arise from the capabilities to tackle existing limitations of CNN-based methods in capturing the global and local spatial-spectral correlations while maintaining efficiency and flexibility. To address these issues, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of both models with a Spatial-Spectral Separable Convolution (S3Conv), Guided Spectral Self-Attention (GSSA), and Self-Modulated Feed-Forward Network (SM-FFN). Our S3Conv works as a lightweight alternative to 3D convolution, which extracts more spatial-spectral correlated features while keeping the flexibility to tackle HSIs with an arbitrary number of bands. These features are then adaptively processed by GSSA which per-forms 3D self-attention across the spectral bands, guided by a set of learnable queries that encode the spectral signatures. This not only enriches our model with powerful capabilities for identifying global spectral correlations but also maintains linear complexity. Moreover, our SM-FFN proposes the self-modulation that intensifies the activations of more informative regions, which further strengthens the aggregated features. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets under both simulated and real-world noise, and it shows that our HSDT significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Weakly-supervised video object localization (WSVOL) methods often rely on visual and motion cues only, making them susceptible to inaccurate localization. Recently, discriminative models via a temporal class activation mapping (CAM) method have been explored. Although results are promising, objects are assumed to have minimal movement leading to degradation in performance for relatively long-term dependencies. In this paper, a novel CoLo-CAM method for object localization is proposed to leverage spatiotemporal information in activation maps without any assumptions about object movement. Over a given sequence of frames, explicit joint learning of localization is produced across these maps based on color cues, by assuming an object has similar color across frames. The CAMs' activations are constrained to activate similarly over pixels with similar colors, achieving co-localization. This joint learning creates direct communication among pixels across all image locations, and over all frames, allowing for transfer, aggregation, and correction of learned localization. This is achieved by minimizing a color term of a CRF loss over joint images/maps. In addition to our multi-frame constraint, we impose per-frame local constraints including pseudo-labels, and CRF loss in combination with a global size constraint to improve per-frame localization. Empirical experiments on two challenging datasets for unconstrained videos, YouTube-Objects, show the merits of our method, and its robustness to long-term dependencies, leading to new state-of-the-art localization performance.

- **Summary**: Food image analysis is the groundwork for image-based dietary assessment, which is the process of monitoring what kinds of food and how much energy is consumed using captured food or eating scene images. Existing deep learning-based methods learn the visual representation for downstream tasks based on human annotation of each food image. However, most food images in real life are obtained without labels, and data annotation requires plenty of time and human effort, which is not feasible for real-world applications. To make use of the vast amount of unlabeled images, many existing works focus on unsupervised or self-supervised learning of visual representations directly from unlabeled data. However, none of these existing works focus on food images, which is more challenging than general objects due to its high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance.   In this paper, we focus on the implementation and analysis of existing representative self-supervised learning methods on food images. Specifically, we first compare the performance of six selected self-supervised learning models on the Food-101 dataset. Then we analyze the pros and cons of each selected model when training on food data to identify the key factors that can help improve the performance. Finally, we propose several ideas for future work on self-supervised visual representation learning for food images.

- **Summary**: We question the current evaluation practice on diffusion-based purification methods. Diffusion-based purification methods aim to remove adversarial effects from an input data point at test time. The approach gains increasing attention as an alternative to adversarial training due to the disentangling between training and testing. Well-known white-box attacks are often employed to measure the robustness of the purification. However, it is unknown whether these attacks are the most effective for the diffusion-based purification since the attacks are often tailored for adversarial training. We analyze the current practices and provide a new guideline for measuring the robustness of purification methods against adversarial attacks. Based on our analysis, we further propose a new purification strategy improving robustness compared to the current diffusion-based purification methods.

- **Summary**: With the increase in demands for service robots and automated inspection, agents need to localize in its surrounding environment to achieve more natural communication with humans by shared contexts. In this work, we propose a novel but straightforward task of precise target view localization for look around agents called the FindView task. This task imitates the movements of PTZ cameras or user interfaces for 360 degree mediums, where the observer must "look around" to find a view that exactly matches the target. To solve this task, we introduce a rule-based agent that heuristically finds the optimal view and a policy learning agent that employs reinforcement learning to learn by interacting with the 360 degree scene. Through extensive evaluations and benchmarks, we conclude that learned methods have many advantages, in particular precise localization that is robust to corruption and can be easily deployed in novel scenes.

- **Summary**: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) is a challenging task in video understanding that aims to identify and localize actions within a video sequence. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of applying long-term temporal context modeling (TCM) blocks to the extracted video clip features such as employing complex self-attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present the simplest method ever to address this task and argue that the extracted video clip features are already informative to achieve outstanding performance without sophisticated architectures. To this end, we introduce TemporalMaxer, which minimizes long-term temporal context modeling while maximizing information from the extracted video clip features with a basic, parameter-free, and local region operating max-pooling block. Picking out only the most critical information for adjacent and local clip embeddings, this block results in a more efficient TAL model. We demonstrate that TemporalMaxer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods that utilize long-term TCM such as self-attention on various TAL datasets while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. The code for our approach is publicly available at https://github.com/TuanTNG/TemporalMaxer

- **Summary**: Scale variation across object instances remains a key challenge in object detection task. Despite the remarkable progress made by modern detection models, this challenge is particularly evident in the semi-supervised case. While existing semi-supervised object detection methods rely on strict conditions to filter high-quality pseudo labels from network predictions, we observe that objects with extreme scale tend to have low confidence, resulting in a lack of positive supervision for these objects. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that addresses the scale variation problem by introducing a mixed scale teacher to improve pseudo label generation and scale-invariant learning. Additionally, we propose mining pseudo labels using score promotion of predictions across scales, which benefits from better predictions from mixed scale features. Our extensive experiments on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks under various semi-supervised settings demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Agriculture plays an important role in the food and economy of Bangladesh. The rapid growth of population over the years also has increased the demand for food production. One of the major reasons behind low crop production is numerous bacteria, virus and fungal plant diseases. Early detection of plant diseases and proper usage of pesticides and fertilizers are vital for preventing the diseases and boost the yield. Most of the farmers use generalized pesticides and fertilizers in the entire fields without specifically knowing the condition of the plants. Thus the production cost oftentimes increases, and, not only that, sometimes this becomes detrimental to the yield. Deep Learning models are found to be very effective to automatically detect plant diseases from images of plants, thereby reducing the need for human specialists. This paper aims at building a lightweight deep learning model for predicting leaf disease in tomato plants. By modifying the region-based convolutional neural network, we design an efficient and effective model that demonstrates satisfactory empirical performance on a benchmark dataset. Our proposed model can easily be deployed in a larger system where drones take images of leaves and these images will be fed into our model to know the health condition.

- **Summary**: The importance of building footprints and their inventory has been recognised as foundational spatial information for multiple societal problems. Extracting complex urban buildings involves the segmentation of very high-resolution (VHR) earth observation (EO) images. U-Net is a common deep learning network and foundation for its new incarnations like ResUnet, U-Net++ and U-Net3+ for such segmentation. The re-incarnations look for efficiency gain by re-designing the skip connection component and exploiting the multi-scale features in U-Net. However, skip connections do not always improve these networks and removing some of them provides efficiency gains and reduced network parameters. In this paper, we propose three dual skip connection mechanisms for U-Net, ResUnet, and U-Net3+. These mechanisms deepen the feature maps forwarded by the skip connections and allow us to study which skip connections need to be denser to yield the highest efficiency gain. The mechanisms are evaluated on feature maps of different scales in the three networks, producing nine new network configurations. The networks are evaluated against their original vanilla versions using four building footprint datasets (three existing and one new) of different spatial resolutions: VHR (0.3m), high-resolution (1m and 1.2m), and multi-resolution (0.3+0.6+1.2m). The proposed mechanisms report efficiency gain on four evaluation measures for U-Net and ResUnet, and up to 17.7% and 18.4% gain in F1 score and Intersection over Union (IoU) for U-Net3+. The codes will be available in a GitHub link after peer review.

- **Summary**: An algorithm based on a deep probabilistic architecture referred to as a tree-structured sum-product network (t-SPN) is considered for cell classification. The t-SPN is constructed such that the unnormalized probability is represented as conditional probabilities of a subset of most similar cell classes. The constructed t-SPN architecture is learned by maximizing the margin, which is the difference in the conditional probability between the true and the most competitive false label. To enhance the generalization ability of the architecture, L2-regularization (REG) is considered along with the maximum margin (MM) criterion in the learning process. To highlight cell features, this paper investigates the effectiveness of two generic high-pass filters: ideal high-pass filtering and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filtering. On both HEp-2 and Feulgen benchmark datasets, the t-SPN architecture learned based on the max-margin criterion with regularization produced the highest accuracy rate compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms that include convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithms. The ideal high-pass filter was more effective on the HEp-2 dataset, which is based on immunofluorescence staining, while the LOG was more effective on the Feulgen dataset, which is based on Feulgen staining.

- **Summary**: For tabular data generated from IIoT devices, traditional machine learning (ML) techniques based on the decision tree algorithm have been employed. However, these methods have limitations in processing tabular data where real number attributes dominate. To address this issue, DeepInsight, REFINED, and IGTD were proposed to convert tabular data into images for utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They gather similar features in some specific spots of an image to make the converted image look like an actual image. Gathering similar features contrasts with traditional ML techniques for tabular data, which drops some highly correlated attributes to avoid overfitting. Also, previous converting methods fixed the image size, and there are wasted or insufficient pixels according to the number of attributes of tabular data. Therefore, this paper proposes a new converting method, Vortex Feature Positioning (VFP). VFP considers the correlation of features and places similar features far away from each. Features are positioned in the vortex shape from the center of an image, and the number of attributes determines the image size. VFP shows better test performance than traditional ML techniques for tabular data and previous converting methods in five datasets: Iris, Wine, Dry Bean, Epileptic Seizure, and SECOM, which have differences in the number of attributes.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: An image processing unit (IPU), or image signal processor (ISP) for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging usually consists of demosaicing, white balancing, lens shading correction, color correction, denoising, and tone-mapping. Besides noise from the imaging sensors, almost every step in the ISP introduces or amplifies noise in different ways, and denoising operators are designed to reduce the noise from these sources. Designed for dynamic range compressing, tone-mapping operators in an ISP can significantly amplify the noise level, especially for images captured in low-light conditions, making denoising very difficult. Therefore, we propose a joint multi-scale denoising and tone-mapping framework that is designed with both operations in mind for HDR images. Our joint network is trained in an end-to-end format that optimizes both operators together, to prevent the tone-mapping operator from overwhelming the denoising operator. Our model outperforms existing HDR denoising and tone-mapping operators both quantitatively and qualitatively on most of our benchmarking datasets.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a commonly used approach to learning and encoding data representations. By using a pre-trained SSL image encoder and training a downstream classifier on top of it, impressive performance can be achieved on various tasks with very little labeled data. The increasing usage of SSL has led to an uptick in security research related to SSL encoders and the development of various Trojan attacks. The danger posed by Trojan attacks inserted in SSL encoders lies in their ability to operate covertly and spread widely among various users and devices. The presence of backdoor behavior in Trojaned encoders can inadvertently be inherited by downstream classifiers, making it even more difficult to detect and mitigate the threat. Although current Trojan detection methods in supervised learning can potentially safeguard SSL downstream classifiers, identifying and addressing triggers in the SSL encoder before its widespread dissemination is a challenging task. This is because downstream tasks are not always known, dataset labels are not available, and even the original training dataset is not accessible during the SSL encoder Trojan detection. This paper presents an innovative technique called SSL-Cleanse that is designed to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks in SSL encoders. We evaluated SSL-Cleanse on various datasets using 300 models, achieving an average detection success rate of 83.7% on ImageNet-100. After mitigating backdoors, on average, backdoored encoders achieve 0.24% attack success rate without great accuracy loss, proving the effectiveness of SSL-Cleanse.

- **Summary**: We study unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation. Currently, a popular UDA framework lies in self-training which endows the model with two-fold abilities: (i) learning reliable semantics from the labeled images in the source domain, and (ii) adapting to the target domain via generating pseudo labels on the unlabeled images. We find that, by decreasing/increasing the proportion of training samples from the target domain, the 'learning ability' is strengthened/weakened while the 'adapting ability' goes in the opposite direction, implying a conflict between these two abilities, especially for a single model. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel dual teacher-student (DTS) framework and equip it with a bidirectional learning strategy. By increasing the proportion of target-domain data, the second teacher-student model learns to 'Focus on Your Target' while the first model is not affected. DTS is easily plugged into existing self-training approaches. In a standard UDA scenario (training on synthetic, labeled data and real, unlabeled data), DTS shows consistent gains over the baselines and sets new state-of-the-art results of 76.5\% and 75.1\% mIoUs on GTAv$\rightarrow$Cityscapes and SYNTHIA$\rightarrow$Cityscapes, respectively.

- **Summary**: Deep learning based methods provide efficient solutions to medical image registration, including the challenging problem of diffeomorphic image registration. However, most methods register normal image pairs, facing difficulty handling those with missing correspondences, e.g., in the presence of pathology like tumors. We desire an efficient solution to jointly account for spatial deformations and appearance changes in the pathological regions where the correspondences are missing, i.e., finding a solution to metamorphic image registration. Some approaches are proposed to tackle this problem, but they cannot properly handle large pathological regions and deformations around pathologies. In this paper, we propose a deep metamorphic image registration network (MetaRegNet), which adopts time-varying flows to drive spatial diffeomorphic deformations and generate intensity variations. We evaluate MetaRegNet on two datasets, i.e., BraTS 2021 with brain tumors and 3D-IRCADb-01 with liver tumors, showing promising results in registering a healthy and tumor image pair.

- **Summary**: We present SLOPER4D, a novel scene-aware dataset collected in large urban environments to facilitate the research of global human pose estimation (GHPE) with human-scene interaction in the wild. Employing a head-mounted device integrated with a LiDAR and camera, we record 12 human subjects' activities over 10 diverse urban scenes from an egocentric view. Frame-wise annotations for 2D key points, 3D pose parameters, and global translations are provided, together with reconstructed scene point clouds. To obtain accurate 3D ground truth in such large dynamic scenes, we propose a joint optimization method to fit local SMPL meshes to the scene and fine-tune the camera calibration during dynamic motions frame by frame, resulting in plausible and scene-natural 3D human poses. Eventually, SLOPER4D consists of 15 sequences of human motions, each of which has a trajectory length of more than 200 meters (up to 1,300 meters) and covers an area of more than 2,000 $m^2$ (up to 13,000 $m^2$), including more than 100K LiDAR frames, 300k video frames, and 500K IMU-based motion frames. With SLOPER4D, we provide a detailed and thorough analysis of two critical tasks, including camera-based 3D HPE and LiDAR-based 3D HPE in urban environments, and benchmark a new task, GHPE. The in-depth analysis demonstrates SLOPER4D poses significant challenges to existing methods and produces great research opportunities.

- **Summary**: AI-driven Action Quality Assessment (AQA) of sports videos can mimic Olympic judges to help score performances as a second opinion or for training. However, these AI methods are uninterpretable and do not justify their scores, which is important for algorithmic accountability. Indeed, to account for their decisions, instead of scoring subjectively, sports judges use a consistent set of criteria - rubric - on multiple actions in each performance sequence. Therefore, we propose IRIS to perform Interpretable Rubric-Informed Segmentation on action sequences for AQA. We investigated IRIS for scoring videos of figure skating performance. IRIS predicts (1) action segments, (2) technical element score differences of each segment relative to base scores, (3) multiple program component scores, and (4) the summed final score. In a modeling study, we found that IRIS performs better than non-interpretable, state-of-the-art models. In a formative user study, practicing figure skaters agreed with the rubric-informed explanations, found them useful, and trusted AI judgments more. This work highlights the importance of using judgment rubrics to account for AI decisions.

- **Summary**: For downstream applications of vision-language pre-trained models, there has been significant interest in constructing effective prompts. Existing works on prompt engineering, which either require laborious manual designs or optimize the prompt tuning as a point estimation problem, may fail to describe diverse characteristics of categories and limit their applications. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic resolution to prompt learning, where the label-specific stochastic prompts are generated hierarchically by first sampling a latent vector from an underlying distribution and then employing a lightweight generative model. Importantly, we semantically regularize prompt learning with the visual knowledge and view images and the corresponding prompts as patch and token sets under optimal transport, which pushes the prompt tokens to faithfully capture the label-specific visual concepts, instead of overfitting the training categories. Moreover, the proposed model can also be straightforwardly extended to the conditional case where the instance-conditional prompts are generated to improve the generalizability. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show promising transferability and generalization performance of our proposed model.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable achievement of recent underwater image restoration techniques, the lack of labeled data has become a major hurdle for further progress. In this work, we propose a mean-teacher based Semi-supervised Underwater Image Restoration (Semi-UIR) framework to incorporate the unlabeled data into network training. However, the naive mean-teacher method suffers from two main problems: (1) The consistency loss used in training might become ineffective when the teacher's prediction is wrong. (2) Using L1 distance may cause the network to overfit wrong labels, resulting in confirmation bias. To address the above problems, we first introduce a reliable bank to store the "best-ever" outputs as pseudo ground truth. To assess the quality of outputs, we conduct an empirical analysis based on the monotonicity property to select the most trustworthy NR-IQA method. Besides, in view of the confirmation bias problem, we incorporate contrastive regularization to prevent the overfitting on wrong labels. Experimental results on both full-reference and non-reference underwater benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm has obvious improvement over SOTA methods quantitatively and qualitatively. Code has been released at https://github.com/Huang-ShiRui/Semi-UIR.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Transfer-based adversarial attacks attract tremendous attention as they can identify the weaknesses of deep learning models in a black-box manner. An effective strategy to improve the transferability of adversarial examples is attacking an ensemble of models. However, previous works simply average the outputs of different models, lacking an in-depth analysis on how and why model ensemble can strongly improve the transferability. In this work, we rethink the ensemble in adversarial attacks and define the common weakness of model ensemble with the properties of the flatness of loss landscape and the closeness to the local optimum of each model. We empirically and theoretically show that these two properties are strongly correlated with the transferability and propose a Common Weakness Attack (CWA) to generate more transferable adversarial examples by promoting these two properties. Experimental results on both image classification and object detection tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach to improve the adversarial transferability, especially when attacking adversarially trained models.

- **Summary**: Automatic Micro-Expression (ME) spotting in long videos is a crucial step in ME analysis but also a challenging task due to the short duration and low intensity of MEs. When solving this problem, previous works generally lack in considering the structures of human faces and the correspondence between expressions and relevant facial muscles. To address this issue for better performance of ME spotting, this paper seeks to extract finer spatial features by modeling the relationships between facial Regions of Interest (ROIs). Specifically, we propose a graph convolutional-based network, called Action-Unit-aWare Graph Convolutional Network (AUW-GCN). Furthermore, to inject prior information and to cope with the problem of small datasets, AU-related statistics are encoded into the network. Comprehensive experiments show that our results outperform baseline methods consistently and achieve new SOTA performance in two benchmark datasets,CAS(ME)^2 and SAMM-LV. Our code is available at https://github.com/xjtupanda/AUW-GCN.

- **Summary**: Transfer learning plays an essential role in Deep Learning, which can remarkably improve the performance of the target domain, whose training data is not sufficient. Our work explores beyond the common practice of transfer learning with a single pre-trained model. We focus on the task of Vietnamese sentiment classification and propose LIFA, a framework to learn a unified embedding from several pre-trained models. We further propose two more LIFA variants that encourage the pre-trained models to either cooperate or compete with one another. Studying these variants sheds light on the success of LIFA by showing that sharing knowledge among the models is more beneficial for transfer learning. Moreover, we construct the AISIA-VN-Review-F dataset, the first large-scale Vietnamese sentiment classification database. We conduct extensive experiments on the AISIA-VN-Review-F and existing benchmarks to demonstrate the efficacy of LIFA compared to other techniques. To contribute to the Vietnamese NLP research, we publish our source code and datasets to the research community upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Medical report generation (MRG) is essential for computer-aided diagnosis and medication guidance, which can relieve the heavy burden of radiologists by automatically generating the corresponding medical reports according to the given radiology image. However, due to the spurious correlations within image-text data induced by visual and linguistic biases, it is challenging to generate accurate reports reliably describing lesion areas. Moreover, the cross-modal confounders are usually unobservable and challenging to be eliminated in an explicit way. In this paper, we aim to mitigate the cross-modal data bias for MRG from a new perspective, i.e., cross-modal causal intervention, and propose a novel Visual-Linguistic Causal Intervention (VLCI) framework for MRG, which consists of a visual deconfounding module (VDM) and a linguistic deconfounding module (LDM), to implicitly mitigate the visual-linguistic confounders by causal front-door intervention. Specifically, due to the absence of a generalized semantic extractor, the VDM explores and disentangles the visual confounders from the patch-based local and global features without expensive fine-grained annotations. Simultaneously, due to the lack of knowledge encompassing the entire medicine, the LDM eliminates the linguistic confounders caused by salient visual features and high-frequency context without constructing a terminology database. Extensive experiments on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets show that our VLCI significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MRG methods.

- **Summary**: Animating virtual avatars to make co-speech gestures facilitates various applications in human-machine interaction. The existing methods mainly rely on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which typically suffer from notorious mode collapse and unstable training, thus making it difficult to learn accurate audio-gesture joint distributions. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework, named Diffusion Co-Speech Gesture (DiffGesture), to effectively capture the cross-modal audio-to-gesture associations and preserve temporal coherence for high-fidelity audio-driven co-speech gesture generation. Specifically, we first establish the diffusion-conditional generation process on clips of skeleton sequences and audio to enable the whole framework. Then, a novel Diffusion Audio-Gesture Transformer is devised to better attend to the information from multiple modalities and model the long-term temporal dependency. Moreover, to eliminate temporal inconsistency, we propose an effective Diffusion Gesture Stabilizer with an annealed noise sampling strategy. Benefiting from the architectural advantages of diffusion models, we further incorporate implicit classifier-free guidance to trade off between diversity and gesture quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffGesture achieves state-of-theart performance, which renders coherent gestures with better mode coverage and stronger audio correlations.

- **Summary**: Neuroimaging measures of the brain's white matter connections can enable the prediction of non-imaging phenotypes, such as demographic and cognitive measures. Existing works have investigated traditional microstructure and connectivity measures from diffusion MRI tractography, without considering the shape of the connections reconstructed by tractography. In this paper, we investigate the potential of fiber tract shape features for predicting non-imaging phenotypes, both individually and in combination with traditional features. We focus on three basic shape features: length, diameter, and elongation. Two different prediction methods are used, including a traditional regression method and a deep-learning-based prediction method. Experiments use an efficient two-stage fusion strategy for prediction using microstructure, connectivity, and shape measures. To reduce predictive bias due to brain size, normalized shape features are also investigated. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) young adult dataset (n=1065) demonstrate that individual shape features are predictive of non-imaging phenotypes. When combined with microstructure and connectivity features, shape features significantly improve performance for predicting the cognitive score TPVT (NIH Toolbox picture vocabulary test). Overall, this study demonstrates that the shape of fiber tracts contains useful information for the description and study of the living human brain using machine learning.

- **Summary**: Facial affective behavior analysis is important for human-computer interaction. 5th ABAW competition includes three challenges from Aff-Wild2 database. Three common facial affective analysis tasks are involved, i.e. valence-arousal estimation, expression classification, action unit recognition. For the three challenges, we construct three different models to solve the corresponding problems to improve the results, such as data unbalance and data noise. For the experiments of three challenges, we train the models on the provided training data and validate the models on the validation data.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural rendering, which uses signed distance function (SDF) representation with geometric priors (such as depth or surface normal), has led to impressive progress in the surface reconstruction of large-scale scenes. However, applying this method to reconstruct a room-level scene from images may miss structures in low-intensity areas or small and thin objects. We conducted experiments on three datasets to identify limitations of the original color rendering loss and priors-embedded SDF scene representation.   We found that the color rendering loss results in optimization bias against low-intensity areas, causing gradient vanishing and leaving these areas unoptimized. To address this issue, we propose a feature-based color rendering loss that utilizes non-zero feature values to bring back optimization signals. Additionally, the SDF representation can be influenced by objects along a ray path, disrupting the monotonic change of SDF values when a single object is present. To counteract this, we explore using the occupancy representation, which encodes each point separately and is unaffected by objects along a querying ray. Our experimental results demonstrate that the joint forces of the feature-based rendering loss and Occ-SDF hybrid representation scheme can provide high-quality reconstruction results, especially in challenging room-level scenarios. The code would be released.

- **Summary**: We present an image dehazing algorithm with high quality, wide application, and no data training or prior needed. We analyze the defects of the original dehazing model, and propose a new and reliable dehazing reconstruction and dehazing model based on the combination of optical scattering model and computer graphics lighting rendering model. Based on the new haze model and the images obtained by the cameras, we can reconstruct the three-dimensional space, accurately calculate the objects and haze in the space, and use the transparency relationship of haze to perform accurate haze removal. To obtain a 3D simulation dataset we used the Unreal 5 computer graphics rendering engine. In order to obtain real shot data in different scenes, we used fog generators, array cameras, mobile phones, underwater cameras and drones to obtain haze data. We use formula derivation, simulation data set and real shot data set result experimental results to prove the feasibility of the new method. Compared with various other methods, we are far ahead in terms of calculation indicators (4 dB higher quality average scene), color remains more natural, and the algorithm is more robust in different scenarios and best in the subjective perception.

The 5th ABAW competition focuses on facial affect recognition utilizing different modalities and datasets. In our work, we extract powerful audio and visual features using a large number of sota models. These features are fused by Transformer Encoder and TEMMA. Besides, to avoid the possible impact of large dimensional differences between various features, we design an Affine Module to align different features to the same dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed method. For the VA Estimation sub-challenge, our method obtains the mean Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.6066. For the Expression Classification sub-challenge, the average F1 Score is 0.4055. For the AU Detection sub-challenge, the average F1 Score is 0.5296. For the Emotional Reaction Intensity Estimation sub-challenge, the average pearson's correlations coefficient on the validation set is 0.3968. All of the results of four sub-challenges outperform the baseline with a large margin.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present our advanced solutions to the two sub-challenges of Affective Behavior Analysis in the wild (ABAW) 2023: the Emotional Reaction Intensity (ERI) Estimation Challenge and Expression (Expr) Classification Challenge. ABAW 2023 aims to tackle the challenge of affective behavior analysis in natural contexts, with the ultimate goal of creating intelligent machines and robots that possess the ability to comprehend human emotions, feelings, and behaviors. For the Expression Classification Challenge, we propose a streamlined approach that handles the challenges of classification effectively. However, our main contribution lies in our use of diverse models and tools to extract multimodal features such as audio and video cues from the Hume-Reaction dataset. By studying, analyzing, and combining these features, we significantly enhance the model's accuracy for sentiment prediction in a multimodal context. Furthermore, our method achieves outstanding results on the Emotional Reaction Intensity (ERI) Estimation Challenge, surpassing the baseline method by an impressive 84\% increase, as measured by the Pearson Coefficient, on the validation dataset.

- **Summary**: Deep learning in computer vision has achieved great success with the price of large-scale labeled training data. However, exhaustive data annotation is impracticable for each task of all domains of interest, due to high labor costs and unguaranteed labeling accuracy. Besides, the uncontrollable data collection process produces non-IID training and test data, where undesired duplication may exist. All these nuisances may hinder the verification of typical theories and exposure to new findings. To circumvent them, an alternative is to generate synthetic data via 3D rendering with domain randomization. We in this work push forward along this line by doing profound and extensive research on bare supervised learning and downstream domain adaptation. Specifically, under the well-controlled, IID data setting enabled by 3D rendering, we systematically verify the typical, important learning insights, e.g., shortcut learning, and discover the new laws of various data regimes and network architectures in generalization. We further investigate the effect of image formation factors on generalization, e.g., object scale, material texture, illumination, camera viewpoint, and background in a 3D scene. Moreover, we use the simulation-to-reality adaptation as a downstream task for comparing the transferability between synthetic and real data when used for pre-training, which demonstrates that synthetic data pre-training is also promising to improve real test results. Lastly, to promote future research, we develop a new large-scale synthetic-to-real benchmark for image classification, termed S2RDA, which provides more significant challenges for transfer from simulation to reality.

- **Summary**: One of the challenges of studying common neurological disorders is disease heterogeneity including differences in causes, neuroimaging characteristics, comorbidities, or genetic variation. Normative modelling has become a popular method for studying such cohorts where the 'normal' behaviour of a physiological system is modelled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. For many heterogeneous diseases, we expect to observe abnormalities across a range of neuroimaging and biological variables. However, thus far, normative models have largely been developed for studying a single imaging modality. We aim to develop a multi-modal normative modelling framework where abnormality is aggregated across variables of multiple modalities and is better able to detect deviations than uni-modal baselines. We propose two multi-modal VAE normative models to detect subject level deviations across T1 and DTI data. Our proposed models were better able to detect diseased individuals, capture disease severity, and correlate with patient cognition than baseline approaches. We also propose a multivariate latent deviation metric, measuring deviations from the joint latent space, which outperformed feature-based metrics.

- **Summary**: Video photorealistic style transfer is desired to generate videos with a similar photorealistic style to the style image while maintaining temporal consistency. However, existing methods obtain stylized video sequences by performing frame-by-frame photorealistic style transfer, which is inefficient and does not ensure the temporal consistency of the stylized video. To address this issue, we use neural network-based 3D Lookup Tables (LUTs) for the photorealistic transfer of videos, achieving a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. We first train a neural network for generating photorealistic stylized 3D LUTs on a large-scale dataset; then, when performing photorealistic style transfer for a specific video, we select a keyframe and style image in the video as the data source and fine-turn the neural network; finally, we query the 3D LUTs generated by the fine-tuned neural network for the colors in the video, resulting in a super-fast photorealistic style transfer, even processing 8K video takes less than 2 millisecond per frame. The experimental results show that our method not only realizes the photorealistic style transfer of arbitrary style images but also outperforms the existing methods in terms of visual quality and consistency.

  shallow and intermediate convolutional layers as well as in the input layer
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recently, explaining CNNs has become a research hotspot. CAM (Class Activation Map)-based methods and LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) method are two common explanation methods. However, due to the small spatial resolution of the last convolutional layer, the CAM-based methods can often only generate coarse-grained visual explanations that provide a coarse location of the target object. LRP and its variants, on the other hand, can generate fine-grained explanations. But the faithfulness of the explanations is too low. In this paper, we propose FG-CAM (fine-grained CAM), which extends the CAM-based methods to generate fine-grained visual explanations with high faithfulness. FG-CAM uses the relationship between two adjacent layers of feature maps with resolution difference to gradually increase the explanation resolution, while finding the contributing pixels and filtering out the pixels that do not contribute at each step. Our method not only solves the shortcoming of CAM-based methods without changing their characteristics, but also generates fine-grained explanations that have higher faithfulness than LRP and its variants. We also present FG-CAM with denoising, which is a variant of FG-CAM and is able to generate less noisy explanations with almost no change in explanation faithfulness. Experimental results show that the performance of FG-CAM is almost unaffected by the explanation resolution. FG-CAM outperforms existing CAM-based methods significantly in the both shallow and intermediate convolutional layers, and outperforms LRP and its variations significantly in the input layer.

- **Summary**: Recently, Table Structure Recognition (TSR) task, aiming at identifying table structure into machine readable formats, has received increasing interest in the community. While impressive success, most single table component-based methods can not perform well on unregularized table cases distracted by not only complicated inner structure but also exterior capture distortion. In this paper, we raise it as Complex TSR problem, where the performance degeneration of existing methods is attributable to their inefficient component usage and redundant post-processing. To mitigate it, we shift our perspective from table component extraction towards the efficient multiple components leverage, which awaits further exploration in the field. Specifically, we propose a seminal method, termed GrabTab, equipped with newly proposed Component Deliberator. Thanks to its progressive deliberation mechanism, our GrabTab can flexibly accommodate to most complex tables with reasonable components selected but without complicated post-processing involved. Quantitative experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts, especially under more challenging scenes.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have enabled the segmentation of arbitrary concepts solely from textual inputs, a process commonly referred to as open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS). However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained classifier tends to overfit on the base classes observed during training, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names. Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve the generalizable knowledge of CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves robust generalization performance across various datasets. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary exploration of open-vocabulary video segmentation and present a benchmark that can facilitate future open-vocabulary research in the video domain.

- **Summary**: Existing methods of multi-person video 3D human Pose and Shape Estimation (PSE) typically adopt a two-stage strategy, which first detects human instances in each frame and then performs single-person PSE with temporal model. However, the global spatio-temporal context among spatial instances can not be captured. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end multi-person 3D Pose and Shape estimation framework with progressive Video Transformer, termed PSVT. In PSVT, a spatio-temporal encoder (STE) captures the global feature dependencies among spatial objects. Then, spatio-temporal pose decoder (STPD) and shape decoder (STSD) capture the global dependencies between pose queries and feature tokens, shape queries and feature tokens, respectively. To handle the variances of objects as time proceeds, a novel scheme of progressive decoding is used to update pose and shape queries at each frame. Besides, we propose a novel pose-guided attention (PGA) for shape decoder to better predict shape parameters. The two components strengthen the decoder of PSVT to improve performance. Extensive experiments on the four datasets show that PSVT achieves stage-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: The Transformer-based method has demonstrated remarkable performance for image super-resolution in comparison to the method based on the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, using the self-attention mechanism like SwinIR (Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer) to extract feature information from images needs a significant amount of computational resources, which limits its application on low computing power platforms. To improve the model feature reuse, this research work proposes the Interval Dense Connection Strategy, which connects different blocks according to the newly designed algorithm. We apply this strategy to SwinIR and present a new model, which named SwinOIR (Object Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer). For image super-resolution, an ablation study is conducted to demonstrate the positive effect of the Interval Dense Connection Strategy on the model performance. Furthermore, we evaluate our model on various popular benchmark datasets, and compare it with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models. For example, SwinOIR obtains a PSNR of 26.62 dB for x4 upscaling image super-resolution on Urban100 dataset, which is 0.15 dB higher than the SOTA model SwinIR. For real-life application, this work applies the lastest version of You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model and the proposed model to perform object detection and real-life image super-resolution on low-quality images. This implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/Rubbbbbbbbby/SwinOIR.

- **Summary**: Noise synthesis is a challenging low-level vision task aiming to generate realistic noise given a clean image along with the camera settings. To this end, we propose an effective generative model which utilizes clean features as guidance followed by noise injections into the network. Specifically, our generator follows a UNet-like structure with skip connections but without downsampling and upsampling layers. Firstly, we extract deep features from a clean image as the guidance and concatenate a Gaussian noise map to the transition point between the encoder and decoder as the noise source. Secondly, we propose noise synthesis blocks in the decoder in each of which we inject Gaussian noise to model the noise characteristics. Thirdly, we propose to utilize an additional Style Loss and demonstrate that this allows better noise characteristics supervision in the generator. Through a number of new experiments, we evaluate the temporal variance and the spatial correlation of the generated noise which we hope can provide meaningful insights for future works. Finally, we show that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods for synthesizing camera noise.

These estimates usually rely on a Geophysical Model Function (GMF) that has difficulties accounting for non-wind processes such as rain events. Convolutional neural network, on the other hand, have the capacity to use contextual information and have demonstrated their ability to delimit rainfall areas. By carefully building a large dataset of SAR observations from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, collocated with both GMF and atmospheric model wind speeds as well as rainfall estimates, we were able to train a wind speed estimator with reduced errors under rain. Collocations with in-situ wind speed measurements from buoys show a root mean square error that is reduced by 27% (resp. 45%) under rainfall estimated at more than 1 mm/h (resp. 3 mm/h). These results demonstrate the capacity of deep learning models to correct rain-related errors in SAR products.

- **Summary**: Airway segmentation, especially bronchioles segmentation, is an important but challenging task because distal bronchus are sparsely distributed and of a fine scale. Existing neural networks usually exploit sparse topology to learn the connectivity of bronchioles and inefficient shallow features to capture such high-frequency information, leading to the breakage or missed detection of individual thin branches. To address these problems, we contribute a new bronchial segmentation method based on Group Deep Dense Supervision (GDDS) that emphasizes fine-scale bronchioles segmentation in a simple-but-effective manner. First, Deep Dense Supervision (DDS) is proposed by constructing local dense topology skillfully and implementing dense topological learning on a specific shallow feature layer. GDDS further empowers the shallow features with better perception ability to detect bronchioles, even the ones that are not easily discernible to the naked eye. Extensive experiments on the BAS benchmark dataset have shown that our method promotes the network to have a high sensitivity in capturing fine-scale branches and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+12.8 % in BD and +8.8 % in TD) while only introducing a small number of extra parameters.

- **Summary**: 3D single object tracking (SOT) is an indispensable part of automated driving. Existing approaches rely heavily on large, densely labeled datasets. However, annotating point clouds is both costly and time-consuming. Inspired by the great success of cycle tracking in unsupervised 2D SOT, we introduce the first semi-supervised approach to 3D SOT. Specifically, we introduce two cycle-consistency strategies for supervision: 1) Self tracking cycles, which leverage labels to help the model converge better in the early stages of training; 2) forward-backward cycles, which strengthen the tracker's robustness to motion variations and the template noise caused by the template update strategy. Furthermore, we propose a data augmentation strategy named SOTMixup to improve the tracker's robustness to point cloud diversity. SOTMixup generates training samples by sampling points in two point clouds with a mixing rate and assigns a reasonable loss weight for training according to the mixing rate. The resulting MixCycle approach generalizes to appearance matching-based trackers. On the KITTI benchmark, based on the P2B tracker, MixCycle trained with $\textbf{10\%}$ labels outperforms P2B trained with $\textbf{100\%}$ labels, and achieves a $\textbf{28.4\%}$ precision improvement when using $\textbf{1\%}$ labels. Our code will be released at \url{https://github.com/Mumuqiao/MixCycle}.

- **Summary**: Previous Knowledge Distillation based efficient image retrieval methods employs a lightweight network as the student model for fast inference. However, the lightweight student model lacks adequate representation capacity for effective knowledge imitation during the most critical early training period, causing final performance degeneration. To tackle this issue, we propose a Capacity Dynamic Distillation framework, which constructs a student model with editable representation capacity. Specifically, the employed student model is initially a heavy model to fruitfully learn distilled knowledge in the early training epochs, and the student model is gradually compressed during the training. To dynamically adjust the model capacity, our dynamic framework inserts a learnable convolutional layer within each residual block in the student model as the channel importance indicator. The indicator is optimized simultaneously by the image retrieval loss and the compression loss, and a retrieval-guided gradient resetting mechanism is proposed to release the gradient conflict. Extensive experiments show that our method has superior inference speed and accuracy, e.g., on the VeRi-776 dataset, given the ResNet101 as a teacher, our method saves 67.13% model parameters and 65.67% FLOPs (around 24.13% and 21.94% higher than state-of-the-arts) without sacrificing accuracy (around 2.11% mAP higher than state-of-the-arts).

- **Summary**: Melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer. Patients are vulnerable to mental health illnesses which can reduce the effectiveness of the cancer treatment and the patients adherence to drug plans. It is crucial to preserve the mental health of patients while they are receiving treatment. However, current art therapy approaches are not personal and unique to the patient. We aim to provide a well-trained image style transfer model that can quickly generate unique art from personal dermoscopic melanoma images as an additional tool for art therapy in disease management of melanoma. Visual art appreciation as a common form of art therapy in disease management that measurably reduces the degree of psychological distress. We developed a network based on the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network for style transfer that generates personalized and unique artworks from dermoscopic melanoma images. We developed a model that converts melanoma images into unique flower-themed artworks that relate to the shape of the lesion and are therefore personal to the patient. Further, we altered the initial framework and made comparisons and evaluations of the results. With this, we increased the options in the toolbox for art therapy in disease management of melanoma. The development of an easy-to-use user interface ensures the availability of the approach to stakeholders. The transformation of melanoma into flower-themed artworks is achieved by the proposed model and the graphical user interface. This contribution opens a new field of GANs in art therapy and could lead to more personalized disease management.

- **Summary**: Accurately segmenting fluid in 3D volumetric optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is a crucial yet challenging task for detecting eye diseases. Traditional autoencoding-based segmentation approaches have limitations in extracting fluid regions due to successive resolution loss in the encoding phase and the inability to recover lost information in the decoding phase. Although current transformer-based models for medical image segmentation addresses this limitation, they are not designed to be applied out-of-the-box for 3D OCT volumes, which have a wide-ranging channel-axis size based on different vendor device and extraction technique. To address these issues, we propose SwinVFTR, a new transformer-based architecture designed for precise fluid segmentation in 3D volumetric OCT images. We first utilize a channel-wise volumetric sampling for training on OCT volumes with varying depths (B-scans). Next, the model uses a novel shifted window transformer block in the encoder to achieve better localization and segmentation of fluid regions. Additionally, we propose a new volumetric attention block for spatial and depth-wise attention, which improves upon traditional residual skip connections. Consequently, utilizing multi-class dice loss, the proposed architecture outperforms other existing architectures on the three publicly available vendor-specific OCT datasets, namely Spectralis, Cirrus, and Topcon, with mean dice scores of 0.72, 0.59, and 0.68, respectively. Additionally, SwinVFTR outperforms other architectures in two additional relevant metrics, mean intersection-over-union (Mean-IOU) and structural similarity measure (SSIM).

- **Summary**: Deep implicit functions (DIFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for many computer vision tasks such as 3D shape reconstruction, generation, registration, completion, editing, and understanding. However, given a set of 3D shapes with associated covariates there is at present no shape representation method which allows to precisely represent the shapes while capturing the individual dependencies on each covariate. Such a method would be of high utility to researchers to discover knowledge hidden in a population of shapes. We propose a 3D Neural Additive Model for Interpretable Shape Representation (NAISR) which describes individual shapes by deforming a shape atlas in accordance to the effect of disentangled covariates. Our approach captures shape population trends and allows for patient-specific predictions through shape transfer. NAISR is the first approach to combine the benefits of deep implicit shape representations with an atlas deforming according to specified covariates. Although our driving problem is the construction of an airway atlas, NAISR is a general approach for modeling, representing, and investigating shape populations. We evaluate NAISR with respect to shape reconstruction, shape disentanglement, shape evolution, and shape transfer for the pediatric upper airway. Our experiments demonstrate that NAISR achieves competitive shape reconstruction performance while retaining interpretability.

- **Summary**: Noisy annotations such as missing annotations and location shifts often exist in crowd counting datasets due to multi-scale head sizes, high occlusion, etc. These noisy annotations severely affect the model training, especially for density map-based methods. To alleviate the negative impact of noisy annotations, we propose a novel crowd counting model with one convolution head and one transformer head, in which these two heads can supervise each other in noisy areas, called Cross-Head Supervision. The resultant model, CHS-Net, can synergize different types of inductive biases for better counting. In addition, we develop a progressive cross-head supervision learning strategy to stabilize the training process and provide more reliable supervision. Extensive experimental results on ShanghaiTech and QNRF datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/RaccoonDML/CHSNet.

- **Summary**: We present a novel real-time capable learning method that jointly perceives a 3D scene's geometry structure and semantic labels. Recent approaches to real-time 3D scene reconstruction mostly adopt a volumetric scheme, where a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) is directly regressed. However, these volumetric approaches tend to focus on the global coherence of their reconstructions, which leads to a lack of local geometrical detail. To overcome this issue, we propose to leverage the latent geometrical prior knowledge in 2D image features by explicit depth prediction and anchored feature generation, to refine the occupancy learning in TSDF volume. Besides, we find that this cross-dimensional feature refinement methodology can also be adopted for the semantic segmentation task. Hence, we proposed an end-to-end cross-dimensional refinement neural network (CDRNet) to extract both 3D mesh and 3D semantic labeling in real time. The experiment results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art 3D perception efficiency on multiple datasets, which indicates the great potential of our method for industrial applications.

- **Summary**: A vision-language foundation model pretrained on very large-scale image-text paired data has the potential to provide generalizable knowledge representation for downstream visual recognition and detection tasks, especially on supplementing the undersampled categories in downstream model training. Recent studies utilizing CLIP for object detection have shown that a two-stage detector design typically outperforms a one-stage detector, while requiring more expensive training resources and longer inference time. In this work, we propose a one-stage detector GridCLIP that narrows its performance gap to those of two-stage detectors, with approximately 43 and 5 times faster than its two-stage counterpart (ViLD) in the training and test process respectively. GridCLIP learns grid-level representations to adapt to the intrinsic principle of one-stage detection learning by expanding the conventional CLIP image-text holistic mapping to a more fine-grained, grid-text alignment. This differs from the region-text mapping in two-stage detectors that apply CLIP directly by treating regions as images. Specifically, GridCLIP performs Grid-level Alignment to adapt the CLIP image-level representations to grid-level representations by aligning to CLIP category representations to learn the annotated (especially frequent) categories. To learn generalizable visual representations of broader categories, especially undersampled ones, we perform Image-level Alignment during training to propagate broad pre-learned categories in the CLIP image encoder from the image-level to the grid-level representations. Experiments show that the learned CLIP-based grid-level representations boost the performance of undersampled (infrequent and novel) categories, reaching comparable detection performance on the LVIS benchmark.

- **Summary**: Few-Shot transfer learning has become a major focus of research as it allows recognition of new classes with limited labeled data. While it is assumed that train and test data have the same data distribution, this is often not the case in real-world applications. This leads to decreased model transfer effects when the new class distribution differs significantly from the learned classes. Research into Cross-Domain Few-Shot (CDFS) has emerged to address this issue, forming a more challenging and realistic setting. In this survey, we provide a detailed taxonomy of CDFS from the problem setting and corresponding solutions view. We summarise the existing CDFS network architectures and discuss the solution ideas for each direction the taxonomy indicates. Furthermore, we introduce various CDFS downstream applications and outline classification, detection, and segmentation benchmarks and corresponding standards for evaluation. We also discuss the challenges of CDFS research and explore potential directions for future investigation. Through this review, we aim to provide comprehensive guidance on CDFS research, enabling researchers to gain insight into the state-of-the-art while allowing them to build upon existing solutions to develop their own CDFS models.

- **Summary**: Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is recently studied under the continual learning setting, where the FAS models are expected to evolve after encountering the data from new domains. However, existing methods need extra replay buffers to store previous data for rehearsal, which becomes infeasible when previous data is unavailable because of privacy issues. In this paper, we propose the first rehearsal-free method for Domain Continual Learning (DCL) of FAS, which deals with catastrophic forgetting and unseen domain generalization problems simultaneously. For better generalization to unseen domains, we design the Dynamic Central Difference Convolutional Adapter (DCDCA) to adapt Vision Transformer (ViT) models during the continual learning sessions. To alleviate the forgetting of previous domains without using previous data, we propose the Proxy Prototype Contrastive Regularization (PPCR) to constrain the continual learning with previous domain knowledge from the proxy prototypes. Simulate practical DCL scenarios, we devise two new protocols which evaluate both generalization and anti-forgetting performance. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method can improve the generalization performance in unseen domains and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting of the previous knowledge. The codes and protocols will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Despite the progress made in the style transfer task, most previous work focus on transferring only relatively simple features like color or texture, while missing more abstract concepts such as overall art expression or painter-specific traits. However, these abstract semantics can be captured by models like DALL-E or CLIP, which have been trained using huge datasets of images and textual documents. In this paper, we propose StylerDALLE, a style transfer method that exploits both of these models and uses natural language to describe abstract art styles. Specifically, we formulate the language-guided style transfer task as a non-autoregressive token sequence translation, i.e., from input content image to output stylized image, in the discrete latent space of a large-scale pretrained vector-quantized tokenizer. To incorporate style information, we propose a Reinforcement Learning strategy with CLIP-based language supervision that ensures stylization and content preservation simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, which can effectively transfer art styles using language instructions at different granularities.

- **Summary**: Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR) tackles the problem of distinguishing highly similar categories. One of the main approaches to FGVR, namely subset learning, tries to leverage information from existing class taxonomies to improve the performance of deep neural networks. However, these methods rely on the existence of handcrafted hierarchies that are not necessarily optimal for the models. In this paper, we propose ELFIS, an expert learning framework for FGVR that clusters categories of the dataset into meta-categories using both dataset-inherent lexical and model-specific information. A set of neural networks-based experts are trained focusing on the meta-categories and are integrated into a multi-task framework. Extensive experimentation shows improvements in the SoTA FGVR benchmarks of up to +1.3% of accuracy using both CNNs and transformer-based networks. Overall, the obtained results evidence that ELFIS can be applied on top of any classification model, enabling the obtention of SoTA results. The source code will be made public soon.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) has refreshed the state of the art for a broad range of vision-language cross-modal tasks. Particularly, it has created an intriguing research line of text-guided image style transfer, dispensing with the need for style reference images as in traditional style transfer methods. However, directly using CLIP to guide the transfer of style leads to undesirable artifacts (mainly written words and unrelated visual entities) spread over the image, partly due to the entanglement of visual and written concepts inherent in CLIP. Inspired by the use of spectral analysis in filtering linguistic information at different granular levels, we analyse the patch embeddings from the last layer of the CLIP vision encoder from the perspective of spectral analysis and find that the presence of undesirable artifacts is highly correlated to some certain frequency components. We propose SpectralCLIP, which implements a spectral filtering layer on top of the CLIP vision encoder, to alleviate the artifact issue. Experimental results show that SpectralCLIP prevents the generation of artifacts effectively in quantitative and qualitative terms, without impairing the stylisation quality. We further apply SpectralCLIP to text-conditioned image generation and show that it prevents written words in the generated images. Code is available at https://github.com/zipengxuc/SpectralCLIP.

- **Summary**: Neural network-based image classifiers are powerful tools for computer vision tasks, but they inadvertently reveal sensitive attribute information about their classes, raising concerns about their privacy. To investigate this privacy leakage, we introduce the first Class Attribute Inference Attack (CAIA), which leverages recent advances in text-to-image synthesis to infer sensitive attributes of individual classes in a black-box setting, while remaining competitive with related white-box attacks. Our extensive experiments in the face recognition domain show that CAIA can accurately infer undisclosed sensitive attributes, such as an individual's hair color, gender, and racial appearance, which are not part of the training labels. Interestingly, we demonstrate that adversarial robust models are even more vulnerable to such privacy leakage than standard models, indicating that a trade-off between robustness and privacy exists.

We find that existing detectors struggle to detect images generated by diffusion models, even if we include generated images from a specific diffusion model in their training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over previous generated-image detectors. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/DIRE.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel multi-stage depth super-resolution network, which progressively reconstructs high-resolution depth maps from explicit and implicit high-frequency features. The former are extracted by an efficient transformer processing both local and global contexts, while the latter are obtained by projecting color images into the frequency domain. Both are combined together with depth features by means of a fusion strategy within a multi-stage and multi-scale framework. Experiments on the main benchmarks, such as NYUv2, Middlebury, DIML and RGBDD, show that our approach outperforms existing methods by a large margin (~20% on NYUv2 and DIML against the contemporary work DADA, with 16x upsampling), establishing a new state-of-the-art in the guided depth super-resolution task.

- **Summary**: Global surface water detection in very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery can directly serve major applications such as refined flood mapping and water resource assessment. Although achievements have been made in detecting surface water in small-size satellite images corresponding to local geographic scales, datasets and methods suitable for mapping and analyzing global surface water have yet to be explored. To encourage the development of this task and facilitate the implementation of relevant applications, we propose the GLH-water dataset that consists of 250 satellite images and manually labeled surface water annotations that are distributed globally and contain water bodies exhibiting a wide variety of types (e.g., rivers, lakes, and ponds in forests, irrigated fields, bare areas, and urban areas). Each image is of the size 12,800 $\times$ 12,800 pixels at 0.3 meter spatial resolution. To build a benchmark for GLH-water, we perform extensive experiments employing representative surface water detection models, popular semantic segmentation models, and ultra-high resolution segmentation models. Furthermore, we also design a strong baseline with the novel pyramid consistency loss (PCL) to initially explore this challenge. Finally, we implement the cross-dataset and pilot area generalization experiments, and the superior performance illustrates the strong generalization and practical application of GLH-water. The dataset is available at https://jack-bo1220.github.io/project/GLH-water.html.

- **Summary**: Facial Action Units detection (FAUs) represents a fine-grained classification problem that involves identifying different units on the human face, as defined by the Facial Action Coding System. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient Vision Transformer-based approach for addressing the task of Action Units (AU) detection in the context of Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition. We employ the Video Vision Transformer(ViViT) Network to capture the temporal facial change in the video. Besides, to reduce massive size of the Vision Transformers model, we replace the ViViT feature extraction layers with the CNN backbone (Regnet). Our model outperform the baseline model of ABAW 2023 challenge, with a notable 14% difference in result. Furthermore, the achieved results are comparable to those of the top three teams in the previous ABAW 2022 challenge.

- **Summary**: Language-guided image generation has achieved great success nowadays by using diffusion models. However, texts can be less detailed to describe highly-specific subjects such as a particular dog or a certain car, which makes pure text-to-image generation not accurate enough to satisfy user requirements. In this work, we present a novel Unified Multi-Modal Latent Diffusion (UMM-Diffusion) which takes joint texts and images containing specified subjects as input sequences and generates customized images with the subjects. To be more specific, both input texts and images are encoded into one unified multi-modal latent space, in which the input images are learned to be projected to pseudo word embedding and can be further combined with text to guide image generation. Besides, to eliminate the irrelevant parts of the input images such as background or illumination, we propose a novel sampling technique of diffusion models used by the image generator which fuses the results guided by multi-modal input and pure text input. By leveraging the large-scale pre-trained text-to-image generator and the designed image encoder, our method is able to generate high-quality images with complex semantics from both aspects of input texts and images.

- **Summary**: Camera motion introduces spatially varying blur due to the depth changes in the 3D world. This work investigates scene configurations where such blur is produced under parallax camera motion. We present a simple, yet accurate, Image Compositing Blur (ICB) model for depth-dependent spatially varying blur. The (forward) model produces realistic motion blur from a single image, depth map, and camera trajectory. Furthermore, we utilize the ICB model, combined with a coordinate-based MLP, to learn a sharp neural representation from the blurred input. Experimental results are reported for synthetic and real examples. The results verify that the ICB forward model is computationally efficient and produces realistic blur, despite the lack of occlusion information. Additionally, our method for restoring a sharp representation proves to be a competitive approach for the deblurring task.

- **Summary**: With the improvement of sensor technology and significant algorithmic advances, the accuracy of remote heart rate monitoring technology has been significantly improved. Despite of the significant algorithmic advances, the performance of rPPG algorithm can degrade in the long-term, high-intensity continuous work occurred in evenings or insufficient light environments. One of the main challenges is that the lost facial details and low contrast cause the failure of detection and tracking. Also, insufficient lighting in video capturing hurts the quality of physiological signal. In this paper, we collect a large-scale dataset that was designed for remote heart rate estimation recorded with various illumination variations to evaluate the performance of the rPPG algorithm (Green, ICA, and POS). We also propose a low-light enhancement solution (technical solution) for remote heart rate estimation under the low-light condition. Using collected dataset, we found 1) face detection algorithm cannot detect faces in video captured in low light conditions; 2) A decrease in the amplitude of the pulsatile signal will lead to the noise signal to be in the dominant position; and 3) the chrominance-based method suffers from the limitation in the assumption about skin-tone will not hold, and Green and ICA method receive less influence than POS in dark illuminance environment. The proposed solution for rPPG process is effective to detect and improve the signal-to-noise ratio and precision of the pulsatile signal.

- **Summary**: Document denoising and binarization are fundamental problems in the document processing space, but current datasets are often too small and lack sufficient complexity to effectively train and benchmark modern data-driven machine learning models. To fill this gap, we introduce ShabbyPages, a new document image dataset designed for training and benchmarking document denoisers and binarizers. ShabbyPages contains over 6,000 clean "born digital" images with synthetically-noised counterparts ("shabby pages") that were augmented using the Augraphy document augmentation tool to appear as if they have been printed and faxed, photocopied, or otherwise altered through physical processes. In this paper, we discuss the creation process of ShabbyPages and demonstrate the utility of ShabbyPages by training convolutional denoisers which remove real noise features with a high degree of human-perceptible fidelity, establishing baseline performance for a new ShabbyPages benchmark.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is an effective way to reduce dose by lowering the total number of views acquired, albeit at the expense of image quality, which, in turn, can impact the ability to detect diseases. We explore deep learning-based artifact reduction in sparse-view cranial CT scans and its impact on automated hemorrhage detection. Methods: We trained a U-Net for artefact reduction on simulated sparse-view cranial CT scans from 3000 patients obtained from a public dataset and reconstructed with varying levels of sub-sampling. Additionally, we trained a convolutional neural network on fully sampled CT data from 17,545 patients for automated hemorrhage detection. We evaluated the classification performance using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC-ROCs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the DeLong test, along with confusion matrices. The performance of the U-Net was compared to an analytical approach based on total variation (TV). Results: The U-Net performed superior compared to unprocessed and TV-processed images with respect to image quality and automated hemorrhage diagnosis. With U-Net post-processing, the number of views can be reduced from 4096 (AUC-ROC: 0.974; 95% CI: 0.972-0.976) views to 512 views (0.973; 0.971-0.975) with minimal decrease in hemorrhage detection (P<.001) and to 256 views (0.967; 0.964-0.969) with a slight performance decrease (P<.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that U-Net based artifact reduction substantially enhances automated hemorrhage detection in sparse-view cranial CTs. Our findings highlight that appropriate post-processing is crucial for optimal image quality and diagnostic accuracy while minimizing radiation dose.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a strong alternative in document analysis. These approaches are now capable of learning high-quality image representations and overcoming the limitations of supervised methods, which require a large amount of labeled data. However, these methods are unable to capture new knowledge in an incremental fashion, where data is presented to the model sequentially, which is closer to the realistic scenario. In this paper, we explore the potential of continual self-supervised learning to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem in handwritten text recognition, as an example of sequence recognition. Our method consists in adding intermediate layers called adapters for each task, and efficiently distilling knowledge from the previous model while learning the current task. Our proposed framework is efficient in both computation and memory complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate our method by transferring the learned model to diverse text recognition downstream tasks, including Latin and non-Latin scripts. As far as we know, this is the first application of continual self-supervised learning for handwritten text recognition. We attain state-of-the-art performance on English, Italian and Russian scripts, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. The code and trained models will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Distance-based classification is frequently used in transductive few-shot learning (FSL). However, due to the high-dimensionality of image representations, FSL classifiers are prone to suffer from the hubness problem, where a few points (hubs) occur frequently in multiple nearest neighbour lists of other points. Hubness negatively impacts distance-based classification when hubs from one class appear often among the nearest neighbors of points from another class, degrading the classifier's performance. To address the hubness problem in FSL, we first prove that hubness can be eliminated by distributing representations uniformly on the hypersphere. We then propose two new approaches to embed representations on the hypersphere, which we prove optimize a tradeoff between uniformity and local similarity preservation -- reducing hubness while retaining class structure. Our experiments show that the proposed methods reduce hubness, and significantly improves transductive FSL accuracy for a wide range of classifiers.

- **Summary**: Background and Objectives: Reproducibility is a major challenge in developing machine learning (ML)-based solutions in computational pathology (CompPath). The NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC) provides >120 cancer image collections according to the FAIR principles and is designed to be used with cloud ML services. Here, we explore its potential to facilitate reproducibility in CompPath research.   Methods: Using the IDC, we implemented two experiments in which a representative ML-based method for classifying lung tumor tissue was trained and/or evaluated on different datasets. To assess reproducibility, the experiments were run multiple times with separate but identically configured instances of common ML services.   Results: The AUC values of different runs of the same experiment were generally consistent. However, we observed small variations in AUC values of up to 0.045, indicating a practical limit to reproducibility.   Conclusions: We conclude that the IDC facilitates approaching the reproducibility limit of CompPath research (i) by enabling researchers to reuse exactly the same datasets and (ii) by integrating with cloud ML services so that experiments can be run in identically configured computing environments.

- **Summary**: Shadow removal in a single image has received increasing attention in recent years. However, removing shadows over dynamic scenes remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we propose the first data-driven video shadow removal model, termed PSTNet, by exploiting three essential characteristics of video shadows, i.e., physical property, spatio relation, and temporal coherence. Specifically, a dedicated physical branch was established to conduct local illumination estimation, which is more applicable for scenes with complex lighting and textures, and then enhance the physical features via a mask-guided attention strategy. Then, we develop a progressive aggregation module to enhance the spatio and temporal characteristics of features maps, and effectively integrate the three kinds of features. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of datasets of paired shadow videos, we synthesize a dataset (SVSRD-85) with aid of the popular game GTAV by controlling the switch of the shadow renderer. Experiments against 9 state-of-the-art models, including image shadow removers and image/video restoration methods, show that our method improves the best SOTA in terms of RMSE error for the shadow area by 14.7. In addition, we develop a lightweight model adaptation strategy to make our synthetic-driven model effective in real world scenes. The visual comparison on the public SBU-TimeLapse dataset verifies the generalization ability of our model in real scenes.

- **Summary**: Robust segmentation of infant brain MRI across multiple ages, modalities, and sites remains challenging due to the intrinsic heterogeneity caused by different MRI scanners, vendors, or acquisition sequences, as well as varying stages of neurodevelopment. To address this challenge, previous studies have explored domain adaptation (DA) algorithms from various perspectives, including feature alignment, entropy minimization, contrast synthesis (style transfer), and pseudo-labeling. This paper introduces a novel framework called MAPSeg (Masked Autoencoding and Pseudo-labelling Segmentation) to address the challenges of cross-age, cross-modality, and cross-site segmentation of subcortical regions in infant brain MRI. Utilizing 3D masked autoencoding as well as masked pseudo-labeling, the model is able to jointly learn from labeled source domain data and unlabeled target domain data. We evaluated our framework on expert-annotated datasets acquired from different ages and sites. MAPSeg consistently outperformed other methods, including previous state-of-the-art supervised baselines, domain generalization, and domain adaptation frameworks in segmenting subcortical regions regardless of age, modality, or acquisition site. The code and pretrained encoder will be publicly available at https://github.com/XuzheZ/MAPSeg

- **Summary**: We present DINAR, an approach for creating realistic rigged fullbody avatars from single RGB images. Similarly to previous works, our method uses neural textures combined with the SMPL-X body model to achieve photo-realistic quality of avatars while keeping them easy to animate and fast to infer. To restore the texture, we use a latent diffusion model and show how such model can be trained in the neural texture space. The use of the diffusion model allows us to realistically reconstruct large unseen regions such as the back of a person given the frontal view. The models in our pipeline are trained using 2D images and videos only. In the experiments, our approach achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and good generalization to new poses and viewpoints. In particular, the approach improves state-of-the-art on the SnapshotPeople public benchmark.

- **Summary**: Most models of visual attention are aimed at predicting either top-down or bottom-up control, as studied using different visual search and free-viewing tasks. We propose Human Attention Transformer (HAT), a single model predicting both forms of attention control. HAT is the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in predicting the scanpath of fixations made during target-present and target-absent search, and matches or exceeds SOTA in the prediction of taskless free-viewing fixation scanpaths. HAT achieves this new SOTA by using a novel transformer-based architecture and a simplified foveated retina that collectively create a spatio-temporal awareness akin to the dynamic visual working memory of humans. Unlike previous methods that rely on a coarse grid of fixation cells and experience information loss due to fixation discretization, HAT features a dense-prediction architecture and outputs a dense heatmap for each fixation, thus avoiding discretizing fixations. HAT sets a new standard in computational attention, which emphasizes both effectiveness and generality. HAT's demonstrated scope and applicability will likely inspire the development of new attention models that can better predict human behavior in various attention-demanding scenarios.

- **Summary**: Naturally controllable human-scene interaction (HSI) generation has an important role in various fields, such as VR/AR content creation and human-centered AI. However, existing methods are unnatural and unintuitive in their controllability, which heavily limits their application in practice. Therefore, we focus on a challenging task of naturally and controllably generating realistic and diverse HSIs from textual descriptions. From human cognition, the ideal generative model should correctly reason about spatial relationships and interactive actions. To that end, we propose Narrator, a novel relationship reasoning-based generative approach using a conditional variation autoencoder for naturally controllable generation given a 3D scene and a textual description. Also, we model global and local spatial relationships in a 3D scene and a textual description respectively based on the scene graph, and introduce a partlevel action mechanism to represent interactions as atomic body part states. In particular, benefiting from our relationship reasoning, we further propose a simple yet effective multi-human generation strategy, which is the first exploration for controllable multi-human scene interaction generation. Our extensive experiments and perceptual studies show that Narrator can controllably generate diverse interactions and significantly outperform existing works. The code and dataset will be available for research purposes.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRF) is the state-of-the-art technique for generating high-quality images from novel viewpoints. Existing methods require a priori knowledge about extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters. This limits their applicability to synthetic scenes, or real-world scenarios with the necessity of a preprocessing step. Current research on the joint optimization of camera parameters and NeRF focuses on refining noisy extrinsic camera parameters and often relies on the preprocessing of intrinsic camera parameters. Further approaches are limited to cover only one single camera intrinsic. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable approach called NeRFtrinsic Four. We utilize Gaussian Fourier features to estimate extrinsic camera parameters and dynamically predict varying intrinsic camera parameters through the supervision of the projection error. Our approach outperforms existing joint optimization methods on LLFF and BLEFF. In addition to these existing datasets, we introduce a new dataset called iFF with varying intrinsic camera parameters.

- **Summary**: We develop a novel framework to assess the risk of misperception in a traffic sign classification task in the presence of exogenous noise. We consider the problem in an autonomous driving setting, where visual input quality gradually improves due to improved resolution, and less noise since the distance to traffic signs decreases. Using the estimated perception statistics obtained using the standard classification algorithms, we aim to quantify the risk of misperception to mitigate the effects of imperfect visual observation. By exploring perception outputs, their expected high-level actions, and potential costs, we show the closed-form representation of the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of misperception. Several case studies support the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

- **Summary**: Nearest neighbour based methods have proved to be one of the most successful self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches due to their high generalization capabilities. However, their computational efficiency decreases when more than one neighbour is used. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive SSL approach, which we call All4One, that reduces the distance between neighbour representations using ''centroids'' created through a self-attention mechanism. We use a Centroid Contrasting objective along with single Neighbour Contrasting and Feature Contrasting objectives. Centroids help in learning contextual information from multiple neighbours whereas the neighbour contrast enables learning representations directly from the neighbours and the feature contrast allows learning representations unique to the features. This combination enables All4One to outperform popular instance discrimination approaches by more than 1% on linear classification evaluation for popular benchmark datasets and obtains state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. Finally, we show that All4One is robust towards embedding dimensionalities and augmentations, surpassing NNCLR and Barlow Twins by more than 5% on low dimensionality and weak augmentation settings. The source code would be made available soon.

- **Summary**: Despite considerable recent progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, inconsistent or contradictory answers continue to cast doubt on their true reasoning capabilities. However, most proposed methods use indirect strategies or strong assumptions on pairs of questions and answers to enforce model consistency. Instead, we propose a novel strategy intended to improve model performance by directly reducing logical inconsistencies. To do this, we introduce a new consistency loss term that can be used by a wide range of the VQA models and which relies on knowing the logical relation between pairs of questions and answers. While such information is typically not available in VQA datasets, we propose to infer these logical relations using a dedicated language model and use these in our proposed consistency loss function. We conduct extensive experiments on the VQA Introspect and DME datasets and show that our method brings improvements to state-of-the-art VQA models, while being robust across different architectures and settings.

- **Summary**: We study the task of Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR), where a query is composed of two modalities, image and text, extending the user's expression ability. Previous methods typically address this task by a separate encoding of each query modality, followed by late fusion of the extracted features. In this paper, we propose a new approach, Cross-Attention driven Shift Encoder (CASE), employing early fusion between modalities through a cross-attention module with an additional auxiliary task. We show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art, on established benchmarks (FashionIQ and CIRR) by a large margin. However, CoIR datasets are a few orders of magnitude smaller compared to other vision and language (V&L) datasets, and some suffer from serious flaws (e.g., queries with a redundant modality). We address these shortcomings by introducing Large Scale Composed Image Retrieval (LaSCo), a new CoIR dataset x10 times larger than current ones. Pre-training on LaSCo yields a further performance boost. We further suggest a new analysis of CoIR datasets and methods, for detecting modality redundancy or necessity, in queries.

- **Summary**: With the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), novel view synthesis has recently made a big leap forward. At the core, NeRF proposes that each 3D point can emit radiance, allowing to conduct view synthesis using differentiable volumetric rendering. While neural radiance fields can accurately represent 3D scenes for computing the image rendering, 3D meshes are still the main scene representation supported by most computer graphics and simulation pipelines, enabling tasks such as real time rendering and physics-based simulations. Obtaining 3D meshes from neural radiance fields still remains an open challenge since NeRFs are optimized for view synthesis, not enforcing an accurate underlying geometry on the radiance field. We thus propose a novel compact and flexible architecture that enables easy 3D surface reconstruction from any NeRF-driven approach. Upon having trained the radiance field, we distill the volumetric 3D representation into a Signed Surface Approximation Network, allowing easy extraction of the 3D mesh and appearance. Our final 3D mesh is physically accurate and can be rendered in real time on an array of devices.

- **Summary**: Improving automated analysis of medical imaging will provide clinicians more options in providing care for patients. The 2023 AI-enabled Medical Image Analysis Workshop and Covid-19 Diagnosis Competition (AI-MIA-COV19D) provides an opportunity to test and refine machine learning methods for detecting the presence and severity of COVID-19 in patients from CT scans. This paper presents version 2 of Cov3d, a deep learning model submitted in the 2022 competition. The model has been improved through a preprocessing step which segments the lungs in the CT scan and crops the input to this region. It results in a validation macro F1 score for predicting the presence of COVID-19 in the CT scans at 93.2% which is significantly above the baseline of 74\%. It gives a macro F1 score for predicting the severity of COVID-19 on the validation set for task 2 as 72.8% which is above the baseline of 38%.

- **Summary**: Prototype, as a representation of class embeddings, has been explored to reduce memory footprint or mitigate forgetting for continual learning scenarios. However, prototype-based methods still suffer from abrupt performance deterioration due to semantic drift and prototype interference. In this study, we propose Contrastive Prototypical Prompt (CPP) and show that task-specific prompt-tuning, when optimized over a contrastive learning objective, can effectively address both obstacles and significantly improve the potency of prototypes. Our experiments demonstrate that CPP excels in four challenging class-incremental learning benchmarks, resulting in 4% to 6% absolute improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, CPP does not require a rehearsal buffer and it largely bridges the performance gap between continual learning and offline joint-learning, showcasing a promising design scheme for continual learning systems under a Transformer architecture.

- **Summary**: Diffusion model (DM) has achieved SOTA performance by modeling the image synthesis process into a sequential application of a denoising network. However, different from image synthesis, image restoration (IR) has a strong constraint to generate results in accordance with ground-truth. Thus, for IR, traditional DMs running massive iterations on a large model to estimate whole images or feature maps is inefficient. To address this issue, we propose an efficient DM for IR (DiffIR), which consists of a compact IR prior extraction network (CPEN), dynamic IR transformer (DIRformer), and denoising network. Specifically, DiffIR has two training stages: pretraining and training DM. In pretraining, we input ground-truth images into CPEN$_{S1}$ to capture a compact IR prior representation (IPR) to guide DIRformer. In the second stage, we train the DM to directly estimate the same IRP as pretrained CPEN$_{S1}$ only using LQ images. We observe that since the IPR is only a compact vector, DiffIR can use fewer iterations than traditional DM to obtain accurate estimations and generate more stable and realistic results. Since the iterations are few, our DiffIR can adopt a joint optimization of CPEN$_{S2}$, DIRformer, and denoising network, which can further reduce the estimation error influence. We conduct extensive experiments on several IR tasks and achieve SOTA performance while consuming less computational costs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Zj-BinXia/DiffIR}.

- **Summary**: In contrast to the natural capabilities of humans to learn new tasks in a sequential fashion, neural networks are known to suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performances on old tasks drop dramatically after being optimized for a new task. Since then, the continual learning (CL) community has proposed several solutions aiming to equip the neural network with the ability to learn the current task (plasticity) while still achieving high accuracy on the previous tasks (stability). Despite remarkable improvements, the plasticity-stability trade-off is still far from being solved and its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this work, we propose Auxiliary Network Continual Learning (ANCL), a novel method that applies an additional auxiliary network which promotes plasticity to the continually learned model which mainly focuses on stability. More concretely, the proposed framework materializes in a regularizer that naturally interpolates between plasticity and stability, surpassing strong baselines on task incremental and class incremental scenarios. Through extensive analyses on ANCL solutions, we identify some essential principles beneath the stability-plasticity trade-off.

- **Summary**: Patient outcome prediction is critical in management of ischemic stroke. In this paper, a novel machine learning model is proposed for stroke outcome prediction using multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The proposed model consists of two serial levels of Autoencoders (AEs), where different AEs at level 1 are used for learning unimodal features from different MRI modalities and a AE at level 2 is used to combine the unimodal features into compressed multimodal features. The sequences of multimodal features of a given patient are then used by an LSTM network for predicting outcome score. The proposed AE2-LSTM model is proved to be an effective approach for better addressing the multimodality and volumetric nature of MRI data. Experimental results show that the proposed AE2-LSTM outperforms the existing state-of-the art models by achieving highest AUC=0.71 and lowest MAE=0.34.

- **Summary**: With numerous medical tasks, the performance of deep models has recently experienced considerable improvements. These models are often adept learners. Yet, their intricate architectural design and high computational complexity make deploying them in clinical settings challenging, particularly with devices with limited resources. To deal with this issue, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been proposed as a compression method and an acceleration technology. KD is an efficient learning strategy that can transfer knowledge from a burdensome model (i.e., teacher model) to a lightweight model (i.e., student model). Hence we can obtain a compact model with low parameters with preserving the teacher's performance. Therefore, we develop a KD-based deep model for prostate MRI segmentation in this work by combining features-based distillation with Kullback-Leibler divergence, Lovasz, and Dice losses. We further demonstrate its effectiveness by applying two compression procedures: 1) distilling knowledge to a student model from a single well-trained teacher, and 2) since most of the medical applications have a small dataset, we train multiple teachers that each one trained with a small set of images to learn an adaptive student model as close to the teachers as possible considering the desired accuracy and fast inference time. Extensive experiments were conducted on a public multi-site prostate tumor dataset, showing that the proposed adaptation KD strategy improves the dice similarity score by 9%, outperforming all tested well-established baseline models.

- **Summary**: Multiple robots could perceive a scene (e.g., detect objects) collaboratively better than individuals, although easily suffer from adversarial attacks when using deep learning. This could be addressed by the adversarial defense, but its training requires the often-unknown attacking mechanism. Differently, we propose ROBOSAC, a novel sampling-based defense strategy generalizable to unseen attackers. Our key idea is that collaborative perception should lead to consensus rather than dissensus in results compared to individual perception. This leads to our hypothesize-and-verify framework: perception results with and without collaboration from a random subset of teammates are compared until reaching a consensus. In such a framework, more teammates in the sampled subset often entail better perception performance but require longer sampling time to reject potential attackers. Thus, we derive how many sampling trials are needed to ensure the desired size of an attacker-free subset, or equivalently, the maximum size of such a subset that we can successfully sample within a given number of trials. We validate our method on the task of collaborative 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.

- **Summary**: Existing works on video frame interpolation (VFI) mostly employ deep neural networks trained to minimize the L1 or L2 distance between their outputs and ground-truth frames. Despite recent advances, existing VFI methods tend to produce perceptually inferior results, particularly for challenging scenarios including large motions and dynamic textures. Towards developing perceptually-oriented VFI methods, we propose latent diffusion model-based VFI, LDMVFI. This approaches the VFI problem from a generative perspective by formulating it as a conditional generation problem. As the first effort to address VFI using latent diffusion models, we rigorously benchmark our method following the common evaluation protocol adopted in the existing VFI literature. Our quantitative experiments and user study indicate that LDMVFI is able to interpolate video content with superior perceptual quality compared to the state of the art, even in the high-resolution regime. Our source code will be made available here.

- **Summary**: In materials research, the task of characterizing hundreds of different materials traditionally requires equally many human hours spent measuring samples one by one. We demonstrate that with the integration of computer vision into this material research workflow, many of these tasks can be automated, significantly accelerating the throughput of the workflow for scientists. We present a framework that uses vision to address specific pain points in the characterization of perovskite semiconductors, a group of materials with the potential to form new types of solar cells. With this approach, we automate the measurement and computation of chemical and optoelectronic properties of perovskites. Our framework proposes the following four key contributions: (i) a computer vision tool for scalable segmentation to arbitrarily many material samples, (ii) a tool to extract the chemical composition of all material samples, (iii) an algorithm capable of automatically computing band gap across arbitrarily many unique samples using vision-segmented hyperspectral reflectance data, and (iv) automating the stability measurement of multi-hour perovskite degradation experiments with vision for spatially non-uniform samples. We demonstrate the key contributions of the proposed framework on eighty samples of unique composition from the formamidinium-methylammonium lead tri-iodide perovskite system and validate the accuracy of each method using human evaluation and X-ray diffraction.

- **Summary**: We propose Masked-Attention Transformers for Surgical Instrument Segmentation (MATIS), a two-stage, fully transformer-based method that leverages modern pixel-wise attention mechanisms for instrument segmentation. MATIS exploits the instance-level nature of the task by employing a masked attention module that generates and classifies a set of fine instrument region proposals. Our method incorporates long-term video-level information through video transformers to improve temporal consistency and enhance mask classification. We validate our approach in the two standard public benchmarks, Endovis 2017 and Endovis 2018. Our experiments demonstrate that MATIS' per-frame baseline outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and that including our temporal consistency module boosts our model's performance further.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in self supervised training have led to a new class of pretrained vision language models. While there have been investigations of bias in multimodal models, they have mostly focused on gender and racial bias, giving much less attention to other relevant groups, such as minorities with regard to religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or disabilities. This is mainly due to lack of suitable benchmarks for such groups. We seek to address this gap by providing a visual and textual bias benchmark called MMBias, consisting of around 3,800 images and phrases covering 14 population subgroups. We utilize this dataset to assess bias in several prominent self supervised multimodal models, including CLIP, ALBEF, and ViLT. Our results show that these models demonstrate meaningful bias favoring certain groups. Finally, we introduce a debiasing method designed specifically for such large pre-trained models that can be applied as a post-processing step to mitigate bias, while preserving the remaining accuracy of the model.

- **Summary**: We introduce an Extended Textual Conditioning space in text-to-image models, referred to as $P+$. This space consists of multiple textual conditions, derived from per-layer prompts, each corresponding to a layer of the denoising U-net of the diffusion model.   We show that the extended space provides greater disentangling and control over image synthesis. We further introduce Extended Textual Inversion (XTI), where the images are inverted into $P+$, and represented by per-layer tokens.   We show that XTI is more expressive and precise, and converges faster than the original Textual Inversion (TI) space. The extended inversion method does not involve any noticeable trade-off between reconstruction and editability and induces more regular inversions.   We conduct a series of extensive experiments to analyze and understand the properties of the new space, and to showcase the effectiveness of our method for personalizing text-to-image models. Furthermore, we utilize the unique properties of this space to achieve previously unattainable results in object-style mixing using text-to-image models.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a technology for non-invasive imaging of anatomical features in detail. It can help in functional analysis of organs of a specimen but it is very costly. In this work, methods for (i) virtual three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single sequence of two-dimensional (2D) slices of MR images of a human spine and brain along a single axis, and (ii) generation of missing inter-slice data are proposed. Our approach helps in preserving the edges, shape, size, as well as the internal tissue structures of the object being captured. The sequence of original 2D slices along a single axis is divided into smaller equal sub-parts which are then reconstructed using edge preserved kriging interpolation to predict the missing slice information. In order to speed up the process of interpolation, we have used multiprocessing by carrying out the initial interpolation on parallel cores. From the 3D matrix thus formed, shearlet transform is applied to estimate the edges considering the 2D blocks along the $Z$ axis, and to minimize the blurring effect using a proposed mean-median logic. Finally, for visualization, the sub-matrices are merged into a final 3D matrix. Next, the newly formed 3D matrix is split up into voxels and marching cubes method is applied to get the approximate 3D image for viewing. To the best of our knowledge it is a first of its kind approach based on kriging interpolation and multiprocessing for 3D reconstruction from 2D slices, and approximately 98.89\% accuracy is achieved with respect to similarity metrics for image comparison. The time required for reconstruction has also been reduced by approximately 70\% with multiprocessing even for a large input data set compared to that with single core processing.

- **Summary**: Radar sensors employed for environment perception, e.g. in autonomous vehicles, output a lot of unwanted clutter. These points, for which no corresponding real objects exist, are a major source of errors in following processing steps like object detection or tracking. We therefore present two novel neural network setups for identifying clutter. The input data, network architectures and training configuration are adjusted specifically for this task. Special attention is paid to the downsampling of point clouds composed of multiple sensor scans. In an extensive evaluation, the new setups display substantially better performance than existing approaches. Because there is no suitable public data set in which clutter is annotated, we design a method to automatically generate the respective labels. By applying it to existing data with object annotations and releasing its code, we effectively create the first freely available radar clutter data set representing real-world driving scenarios.

- **Summary**: We introduce an on-ground Pedestrian World Model, a computational model that can predict how pedestrians move around an observer in the crowd on the ground plane, but from just the egocentric-views of the observer. Our model, InCrowdFormer, fully leverages the Transformer architecture by modeling pedestrian interaction and egocentric to top-down view transformation with attention, and autoregressively predicts on-ground positions of a variable number of people with an encoder-decoder architecture. We encode the uncertainties arising from unknown pedestrian heights with latent codes to predict the posterior distributions of pedestrian positions. We validate the effectiveness of InCrowdFormer on a novel prediction benchmark of real movements. The results show that InCrowdFormer accurately predicts the future coordination of pedestrians. To the best of our knowledge, InCrowdFormer is the first-of-its-kind pedestrian world model which we believe will benefit a wide range of egocentric-view applications including crowd navigation, tracking, and synthesis.

- **Summary**: The diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in text-based image generation. However, since it contains enormous randomness in generation progress, it is still challenging to apply such models for real-world visual content editing, especially in videos. In this paper, we propose FateZero, a zero-shot text-based editing method on real-world videos without per-prompt training or use-specific mask. To edit videos consistently, we propose several techniques based on the pre-trained models. Firstly, in contrast to the straightforward DDIM inversion technique, our approach captures intermediate attention maps during inversion, which effectively retain both structural and motion information. These maps are directly fused in the editing process rather than generated during denoising. To further minimize semantic leakage of the source video, we then fuse self-attentions with a blending mask obtained by cross-attention features from the source prompt. Furthermore, we have implemented a reform of the self-attention mechanism in denoising UNet by introducing spatial-temporal attention to ensure frame consistency. Yet succinct, our method is the first one to show the ability of zero-shot text-driven video style and local attribute editing from the trained text-to-image model. We also have a better zero-shot shape-aware editing ability based on the text-to-video model. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior temporal consistency and editing capability than previous works.

- **Summary**: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RS-CD) aims to detect relevant changes from Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images (MT-RSIs), which aids in various RS applications such as land cover, land use, human development analysis, and disaster response. The performance of existing RS-CD methods is attributed to training on large annotated datasets. Furthermore, most of these models are less transferable in the sense that the trained model often performs very poorly when there is a domain gap between training and test datasets. This paper proposes an unsupervised CD method based on deep metric learning that can deal with both of these issues. Given an MT-RSI, the proposed method generates corresponding change probability map by iteratively optimizing an unsupervised CD loss without training it on a large dataset. Our unsupervised CD method consists of two interconnected deep networks, namely Deep-Change Probability Generator (D-CPG) and Deep-Feature Extractor (D-FE). The D-CPG is designed to predict change and no change probability maps for a given MT-RSI, while D-FE is used to extract deep features of MT-RSI that will be further used in the proposed unsupervised CD loss. We use transfer learning capability to initialize the parameters of D-FE. We iteratively optimize the parameters of D-CPG and D-FE for a given MT-RSI by minimizing the proposed unsupervised ``similarity-dissimilarity loss''. This loss is motivated by the principle of metric learning where we simultaneously maximize the distance between change pair-wise pixels while minimizing the distance between no-change pair-wise pixels in bi-temporal image domain and their deep feature domain. The experiments conducted on three CD datasets show that our unsupervised CD method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised CD methods.

- **Summary**: Progress in machine learning has been driven in large part by massive increases in data. However, large web-scale datasets such as LAION are largely uncurated beyond searches for exact duplicates, potentially leaving much redundancy. Here, we introduce SemDeDup, a method which leverages embeddings from pre-trained models to identify and remove semantic duplicates: data pairs which are semantically similar, but not exactly identical. Removing semantic duplicates preserves performance and speeds up learning. Analyzing a subset of LAION, we show that SemDeDup can remove 50% of the data with minimal performance loss, effectively halving training time. Moreover, performance increases out of distribution. Also, analyzing language models trained on C4, a partially curated dataset, we show that SemDeDup improves over prior approaches while providing efficiency gains. SemDeDup provides an example of how simple ways of leveraging quality embeddings can be used to make models learn faster with less data.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image generative models have exhibited remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity and photo-realistic images. However, despite the visually impressive results, these models often struggle to preserve plausible human structure in the generations. Due to this reason, while generative models have shown promising results in aiding downstream image recognition tasks by generating large volumes of synthetic data, they remain infeasible for improving downstream human pose perception and understanding. In this work, we propose Diffusion model with Human Pose Correction (Diffusion HPC), a text-conditioned method that generates photo-realistic images with plausible posed humans by injecting prior knowledge about human body structure. We show that Diffusion HPC effectively improves the realism of human generations. Furthermore, as the generations are accompanied by 3D meshes that serve as ground truths, Diffusion HPC's generated image-mesh pairs are well-suited for downstream human mesh recovery task, where a shortage of 3D training data has long been an issue.

- **Summary**: 3D scene understanding plays a vital role in vision-based autonomous driving. While most existing methods focus on 3D object detection, they have difficulty describing real-world objects of arbitrary shapes and infinite classes. Towards a more comprehensive perception of a 3D scene, in this paper, we propose a SurroundOcc method to predict the 3D occupancy with multi-camera images. We first extract multi-scale features for each image and adopt spatial 2D-3D attention to lift them to the 3D volume space. Then we apply 3D convolutions to progressively upsample the volume features and impose supervision on multiple levels. To obtain dense occupancy prediction, we design a pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truth without expansive occupancy annotations. Specifically, we fuse multi-frame LiDAR scans of dynamic objects and static scenes separately. Then we adopt Poisson Reconstruction to fill the holes and voxelize the mesh to get dense occupancy labels. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/weiyithu/SurroundOcc

- **Summary**: Humans describe the physical world using natural language to refer to specific 3D locations based on a vast range of properties: visual appearance, semantics, abstract associations, or actionable affordances. In this work we propose Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERFs), a method for grounding language embeddings from off-the-shelf models like CLIP into NeRF, which enable these types of open-ended language queries in 3D. LERF learns a dense, multi-scale language field inside NeRF by volume rendering CLIP embeddings along training rays, supervising these embeddings across training views to provide multi-view consistency and smooth the underlying language field. After optimization, LERF can extract 3D relevancy maps for a broad range of language prompts interactively in real-time, which has potential use cases in robotics, understanding vision-language models, and interacting with 3D scenes. LERF enables pixel-aligned, zero-shot queries on the distilled 3D CLIP embeddings without relying on region proposals or masks, supporting long-tail open-vocabulary queries hierarchically across the volume.

- **Summary**: Impressive progress in generative models and implicit representations gave rise to methods that can generate 3D shapes of high quality. However, being able to locally control and edit shapes is another essential property that can unlock several content creation applications. Local control can be achieved with part-aware models, but existing methods require 3D supervision and cannot produce textures. In this work, we devise PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shape synthesis that does not require any explicit 3D supervision. Our model generates objects as a set of locally defined NeRFs, augmented with an affine transformation. This enables several editing operations such as applying transformations on parts, mixing parts from different objects etc. To ensure distinct, manipulable parts we enforce a hard assignment of rays to parts that makes sure that the color of each ray is only determined by a single NeRF. As a result, altering one part does not affect the appearance of the others. Evaluations on various ShapeNet categories demonstrate the ability of our model to generate editable 3D objects of improved fidelity, compared to previous part-based generative approaches that require 3D supervision or models relying on NeRFs.

- **Summary**: While significant research progress has been made in robot learning for control, unique challenges arise when simultaneously co-optimizing morphology. Existing work has typically been tailored for particular environments or representations. In order to more fully understand inherent design and performance tradeoffs and accelerate the development of new breeds of soft robots, a comprehensive virtual platform with well-established tasks, environments, and evaluation metrics is needed. In this work, we introduce SoftZoo, a soft robot co-design platform for locomotion in diverse environments. SoftZoo supports an extensive, naturally-inspired material set, including the ability to simulate environments such as flat ground, desert, wetland, clay, ice, snow, shallow water, and ocean. Further, it provides a variety of tasks relevant for soft robotics, including fast locomotion, agile turning, and path following, as well as differentiable design representations for morphology and control. Combined, these elements form a feature-rich platform for analysis and development of soft robot co-design algorithms. We benchmark prevalent representations and co-design algorithms, and shed light on 1) the interplay between environment, morphology, and behavior; 2) the importance of design space representations; 3) the ambiguity in muscle formation and controller synthesis; and 4) the value of differentiable physics. We envision that SoftZoo will serve as a standard platform and template an approach toward the development of novel representations and algorithms for co-designing soft robots' behavioral and morphological intelligence.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion models have been a mainstream approach for image generation, however, training these models often suffers from slow convergence. In this paper, we discovered that the slow convergence is partly due to conflicting optimization directions between timesteps. To address this issue, we treat the diffusion training as a multi-task learning problem, and introduce a simple yet effective approach referred to as Min-SNR-$\gamma$. This method adapts loss weights of timesteps based on clamped signal-to-noise ratios, which effectively balances the conflicts among timesteps. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in converging speed, 3.4$\times$ faster than previous weighting strategies. It is also more effective, achieving a new record FID score of 2.06 on the ImageNet $256\times256$ benchmark using smaller architectures than that employed in previous state-of-the-art. The code is available at https://github.com/TiankaiHang/Min-SNR-Diffusion-Training.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel method to automatically generate an artistic typography by stylizing one or more letter fonts to visually convey the semantics of an input word, while ensuring that the output remains readable. To address an assortment of challenges with our task at hand including conflicting goals (artistic stylization vs. legibility), lack of ground truth, and immense search space, our approach utilizes large language models to bridge texts and visual images for stylization and build an unsupervised generative model with a diffusion model backbone. Specifically, we employ the denoising generator in Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), with the key addition of a CNN-based discriminator to adapt the input style onto the input text. The discriminator uses rasterized images of a given letter/word font as real samples and output of the denoising generator as fake samples. Our model is coined DS-Fusion for discriminated and stylized diffusion. We showcase the quality and versatility of our method through numerous examples, qualitative and quantitative evaluation, as well as ablation studies. User studies comparing to strong baselines including CLIPDraw and DALL-E 2, as well as artist-crafted typographies, demonstrate strong performance of DS-Fusion.

- **Summary**: The use of large-scale vision-language datasets is limited for object detection due to the negative impact of label noise on localization. Prior methods have shown how such large-scale datasets can be used for pretraining, which can provide initial signal for localization, but is insufficient without clean bounding-box data for at least some categories. We propose a technique to "vet" labels extracted from noisy captions, and use them for weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD). We conduct analysis of the types of label noise in captions, and train a classifier that predicts if an extracted label is actually present in the image or not. Our classifier generalizes across dataset boundaries and across categories. We compare the classifier to eleven baselines on five datasets, and demonstrate that it can improve WSOD without label vetting by 30% (31.2 to 40.5 mAP when evaluated on PASCAL VOC)

- **Summary**: Incorporating human feedback has been shown to be crucial to align text generated by large language models to human preferences. We hypothesize that state-of-the-art instructional image editing models, where outputs are generated based on an input image and an editing instruction, could similarly benefit from human feedback, as their outputs may not adhere to the correct instructions and preferences of users. In this paper, we present a novel framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE). Specifically, we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences based on the estimated reward. Besides, to mitigate the bias brought by the limitation of data, we contribute a new 1M training dataset, a 3.6K reward dataset for rewards learning, and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the performance of instructional image editing. We conduct extensive empirical experiments quantitatively and qualitatively, showing that HIVE is favored over previous state-of-the-art instructional image editing approaches by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) techniques attempt to increase the visibility of images captured in low-light scenarios. However, as a result of enhancement, a variety of image degradations such as noise and color bias are revealed. Furthermore, each particular LLIE approach may introduce a different form of flaw within its enhanced results. To combat these image degradations, post-processing denoisers have widely been used, which often yield oversmoothed results lacking detail. We propose using a diffusion model as a post-processing approach, and we introduce Low-light Post-processing Diffusion Model (LPDM) in order to model the conditional distribution between under-exposed and normally-exposed images. We apply LPDM in a manner which avoids the computationally expensive generative reverse process of typical diffusion models, and post-process images in one pass through LPDM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing post-processing denoisers by increasing the perceptual quality of enhanced low-light images on a variety of challenging low-light datasets.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) allows for noncontact monitoring of blood volume changes from a camera by detecting minor fluctuations in reflected light. Prior applications of rPPG focused on face videos. In this paper we explored the feasibility of rPPG from non-face body regions such as the arms, legs, and hands. We collected a new dataset titled Multi-Site Physiological Monitoring (MSPM), which will be released with this paper. The dataset consists of 90 frames per second video of exposed arms, legs, and face, along with 10 synchronized PPG recordings. We performed baseline heart rate estimation experiments from non-face regions with several state-of-the-art rPPG approaches, including chrominance-based (CHROM), plane-orthogonal-to-skin (POS) and RemotePulseNet (RPNet). To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of the fidelity of rPPG signals simultaneously obtained from multiple regions of a human body. Our experiments showed that skin pixels from arms, legs, and hands are all potential sources of the blood volume pulse. The best-performing approach, POS, achieved a mean absolute error peaking at 7.11 beats per minute from non-facial body parts compared to 1.38 beats per minute from the face. Additionally, we performed experiments on pulse transit time (PTT) from both the contact PPG and rPPG signals. We found that remote PTT is possible with moderately high frame rate video when distal locations on the body are visible. These findings and the supporting dataset should facilitate new research on non-face rPPG and monitoring blood flow dynamics over the whole body with a camera.

- **Summary**: Many imaging inverse problems$\unicode{x2014}$such as image-dependent in-painting and dehazing$\unicode{x2014}$are challenging because their forward models are unknown or depend on unknown latent parameters. While one can solve such problems by training a neural network with vast quantities of paired training data, such paired training data is often unavailable. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for training image reconstruction networks when paired training data is scarce. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of image denoising algorithms and, by extension, denoising diffusion models to supervise network training in the absence of paired training data.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Microsurgical Aneurysm Clipping Surgery (MACS) carries a high risk for intraoperative aneurysm rupture. Automated recognition of instances when the aneurysm is exposed in the surgical video would be a valuable reference point for neuronavigation, indicating phase transitioning and more importantly designating moments of high risk for rupture. This article introduces the MACS dataset containing 16 surgical videos with frame-level expert annotations and proposes a learning methodology for surgical scene understanding identifying video frames with the aneurysm present in the operating microscope's field-of-view. Methods: Despite the dataset imbalance (80% no presence, 20% presence) and developed without explicit annotations, we demonstrate the applicability of Transformer-based deep learning architectures (MACSSwin-T, vidMACSSwin-T) to detect the aneurysm and classify MACS frames accordingly. We evaluate the proposed models in multiple-fold cross-validation experiments with independent sets and in an unseen set of 15 images against 10 human experts (neurosurgeons). Results: Average (across folds) accuracy of 80.8% (range 78.5%-82.4%) and 87.1% (range 85.1%-91.3%) is obtained for the image- and video-level approach respectively, demonstrating that the models effectively learn the classification task. Qualitative evaluation of the models' class activation maps show these to be localized on the aneurysm's actual location. Depending on the decision threshold, MACSWin-T achieves 66.7% to 86.7% accuracy in the unseen images, compared to 82% of human raters, with moderate to strong correlation.

- **Summary**: Image super-resolution (SR) has witnessed extensive neural network designs from CNN to transformer architectures. However, prevailing SR models suffer from prohibitive memory footprint and intensive computations, which limits further deployment on edge devices. This work investigates the potential of network pruning for super-resolution to take advantage of off-the-shelf network designs and reduce the underlying computational overhead. Two main challenges remain in applying pruning methods for SR. First, the widely-used filter pruning technique reflects limited granularity and restricted adaptability to diverse network structures. Second, existing pruning methods generally operate upon a pre-trained network for the sparse structure determination, hard to get rid of dense model training in the traditional SR paradigm. To address these challenges, we adopt unstructured pruning with sparse models directly trained from scratch. Specifically, we propose a novel Iterative Soft Shrinkage-Percentage (ISS-P) method by optimizing the sparse structure of a randomly initialized network at each iteration and tweaking unimportant weights with a small amount proportional to the magnitude scale on-the-fly. We observe that the proposed ISS-P can dynamically learn sparse structures adapting to the optimization process and preserve the sparse model's trainability by yielding a more regularized gradient throughput. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISS-P over diverse network architectures.

- **Summary**: Improving the interpretability of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) models has become critically important to open the "black box" of complex AI models, such as deep learning. This paper compares popular saliency map generation techniques and their strengths and weaknesses in interpreting GeoAI and deep learning models' reasoning behaviors, particularly when applied to geospatial analysis and image processing tasks. We surveyed two broad classes of model explanation methods: perturbation-based and gradient-based methods. The former identifies important image areas, which help machines make predictions by modifying a localized area of the input image. The latter evaluates the contribution of every single pixel of the input image to the model's prediction results through gradient backpropagation. In this study, three algorithms-the occlusion method, the integrated gradients method, and the class activation map method-are examined for a natural feature detection task using deep learning. The algorithms' strengths and weaknesses are discussed, and the consistency between model-learned and human-understandable concepts for object recognition is also compared. The experiments used two GeoAI-ready datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of the research findings.

- **Summary**: Solving multiple visual tasks using individual models can be resource-intensive, while multi-task learning can conserve resources by sharing knowledge across different tasks. Despite the benefits of multi-task learning, such techniques can struggle with balancing the loss for each task, leading to potential performance degradation. We present a novel computation- and parameter-sharing framework that balances efficiency and accuracy to perform multiple visual tasks utilizing individually-trained single-task transformers. Our method is motivated by transfer learning schemes to reduce computational and parameter storage costs while maintaining the desired performance. Our approach involves splitting the tasks into a base task and the other sub-tasks, and sharing a significant portion of activations and parameters/weights between the base and sub-tasks to decrease inter-task redundancies and enhance knowledge sharing. The evaluation conducted on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-context datasets shows that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art transformer-based multi-task learning techniques with higher accuracy and reduced computational resources. Moreover, our method is extended to video stream inputs, further reducing computational costs by efficiently sharing information across the temporal domain as well as the task domain. Our codes and models will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Humans excel at acquiring knowledge through observation. For example, we can learn to use new tools by watching demonstrations. This skill is fundamental for intelligent systems to interact with the world. A key step to acquire this skill is to identify what part of the object affords each action, which is called affordance grounding. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a framework called LOCATE that can identify matching object parts across images, to transfer knowledge from images where an object is being used (exocentric images used for learning), to images where the object is inactive (egocentric ones used to test). To this end, we first find interaction areas and extract their feature embeddings. Then we learn to aggregate the embeddings into compact prototypes (human, object part, and background), and select the one representing the object part. Finally, we use the selected prototype to guide affordance grounding. We do this in a weakly supervised manner, learning only from image-level affordance and object labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both seen and unseen objects.

- **Summary**: Object tracking is divided into single-object tracking (SOT) and multi-object tracking (MOT). MOT aims to maintain the identities of multiple objects across a series of continuous video sequences. In recent years, MOT has made rapid progress. However, modeling the motion and appearance models of objects in complex scenes still faces various challenging issues. In this paper, we design a novel direction consistency method for smooth trajectory prediction (STP-DC) to increase the modeling of motion information and overcome the lack of robustness in previous methods in complex scenes. Existing methods use pedestrian re-identification (Re-ID) to model appearance, however, they extract more background information which lacks discriminability in occlusion and crowded scenes. We propose a hyper-grain feature embedding network (HG-FEN) to enhance the modeling of appearance models, thus generating robust appearance descriptors. We also proposed other robustness techniques, including CF-ECM for storing robust appearance information and SK-AS for improving association accuracy. To achieve state-of-the-art performance in MOT, we propose a robust tracker named Rt-track, incorporating various tricks and techniques. It achieves 79.5 MOTA, 76.0 IDF1 and 62.1 HOTA on the test set of MOT17.Rt-track also achieves 77.9 MOTA, 78.4 IDF1 and 63.3 HOTA on MOT20, surpassing all published methods.

- **Summary**: Generalized few-shot object detection aims to achieve precise detection on both base classes with abundant annotations and novel classes with limited training data. Existing approaches enhance few-shot generalization with the sacrifice of base-class performance, or maintain high precision in base-class detection with limited improvement in novel-class adaptation. In this paper, we point out the reason is insufficient Discriminative feature learning for all of the classes. As such, we propose a new training framework, DiGeo, to learn Geometry-aware features of inter-class separation and intra-class compactness. To guide the separation of feature clusters, we derive an offline simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) classifier whose weights serve as class centers and are maximally and equally separated. To tighten the cluster for each class, we include adaptive class-specific margins into the classification loss and encourage the features close to the class centers. Experimental studies on two few-shot benchmark datasets (VOC, COCO) and one long-tail dataset (LVIS) demonstrate that, with a single model, our method can effectively improve generalization on novel classes without hurting the detection of base classes.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation has become a crucial component to train state-of-the-art visual representation models. However, handcrafting combinations of transformations that lead to improved performances is a laborious task, which can result in visually unrealistic samples. To overcome these limitations, recent works have explored the use of generative models as learnable data augmentation tools, showing promising results in narrow application domains, e.g., few-shot learning and low-data medical imaging. In this paper, we introduce a data augmentation module, called DA_IC-GAN, which leverages instance-conditioned GAN generations and can be used off-the-shelf in conjunction with most state-of-the-art training recipes. We showcase the benefits of DA_IC-GAN by plugging it out-of-the-box into the supervised training of ResNets and DeiT models on the ImageNet dataset, and achieving accuracy boosts up to between 1%p and 2%p with the highest capacity models. Moreover, the learnt representations are shown to be more robust than the baselines when transferred to a handful of out-of-distribution datasets, and exhibit increased invariance to variations of instance and viewpoints. We additionally couple DA_IC-GAN with a self-supervised training recipe and show that we can also achieve an improvement of 1%p in accuracy in some settings. With this work, we strengthen the evidence on the potential of learnable data augmentations to improve visual representation learning, paving the road towards non-handcrafted augmentations in model training.

- **Summary**: Event camera, as an emerging biologically-inspired vision sensor for capturing motion dynamics, presents new potential for 3D human pose tracking, or video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, existing works in pose tracking either require the presence of additional gray-scale images to establish a solid starting pose, or ignore the temporal dependencies all together by collapsing segments of event streams to form static event frames. Meanwhile, although the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs, a.k.a. dense deep learning) has been showcased in many event-based tasks, the use of ANNs tends to neglect the fact that compared to the dense frame-based image sequences, the occurrence of events from an event camera is spatiotemporally much sparser. Motivated by the above mentioned issues, we present in this paper a dedicated end-to-end sparse deep learning approach for event-based pose tracking: 1) to our knowledge this is the first time that 3D human pose tracking is obtained from events only, thus eliminating the need of accessing to any frame-based images as part of input; 2) our approach is based entirely upon the framework of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which consists of Spike-Element-Wise (SEW) ResNet and a novel Spiking Spatiotemporal Transformer; 3) a large-scale synthetic dataset is constructed that features a broad and diverse set of annotated 3D human motions, as well as longer hours of event stream data, named SynEventHPD. Empirical experiments demonstrate that, with superior performance over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ANNs counterparts, our approach also achieves a significant computation reduction of 80% in FLOPS. Furthermore, our proposed method also outperforms SOTA SNNs in the regression task of human pose tracking. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/JimmyZou/HumanPoseTracking_SNN and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

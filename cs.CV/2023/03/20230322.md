- **Summary**: Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) is an unsupervised approach, among which IMVC via contrastive learning has received attention due to its excellent performance. The previous methods have the following problems: 1) Over-reliance on additional projection heads when solving the dimensional collapse problem in which latent features are only valid in lower-dimensional subspaces during clustering. However, many parameters in the projection heads are unnecessary. 2) The recovered view contain inconsistent private information and useless private information will mislead the learning of common semantics due to consistent learning and reconstruction learning on the same feature. To address the above issues, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view contrastive clustering framework. This framework directly optimizes the latent feature subspace, utilizes the learned feature vectors and their sub-vectors for reconstruction learning and consistency learning, thereby effectively avoiding dimensional collapse without relying on projection heads. Since reconstruction loss and contrastive loss are performed on different features, the adverse effect of useless private information is reduced. For the incomplete data, the missing information is recovered by the cross-view prediction mechanism and the inconsistent information from different views is discarded by the minimum conditional entropy to further avoid the influence of private information. Extensive experimental results of the method on 5 public datasets show that the method achieves state-of-the-art clustering results.

- **Summary**: The two-stage object pose estimation paradigm first detects semantic keypoints on the image and then estimates the 6D pose by minimizing reprojection errors. Despite performing well on standard benchmarks, existing techniques offer no provable guarantees on the quality and uncertainty of the estimation. In this paper, we inject two fundamental changes, namely conformal keypoint detection and geometric uncertainty propagation, into the two-stage paradigm and propose the first pose estimator that endows an estimation with provable and computable worst-case error bounds. On one hand, conformal keypoint detection applies the statistical machinery of inductive conformal prediction to convert heuristic keypoint detections into circular or elliptical prediction sets that cover the groundtruth keypoints with a user-specified marginal probability (e.g., 90%). Geometric uncertainty propagation, on the other, propagates the geometric constraints on the keypoints to the 6D object pose, leading to a Pose UnceRtainty SEt (PURSE) that guarantees coverage of the groundtruth pose with the same probability. The PURSE, however, is a nonconvex set that does not directly lead to estimated poses and uncertainties. Therefore, we develop RANdom SAmple averaGing (RANSAG) to compute an average pose and apply semidefinite relaxation to upper bound the worst-case errors between the average pose and the groundtruth. On the LineMOD Occlusion dataset we demonstrate: (i) the PURSE covers the groundtruth with valid probabilities; (ii) the worst-case error bounds provide correct uncertainty quantification; and (iii) the average pose achieves better or similar accuracy as representative methods based on sparse keypoints.

- **Summary**: Visual Prompting (VP) is an emerging and powerful technique that allows sample-efficient adaptation to downstream tasks by engineering a well-trained frozen source model. In this work, we explore the benefits of VP in constructing compelling neural network classifiers with differential privacy (DP). We explore and integrate VP into canonical DP training methods and demonstrate its simplicity and efficiency. In particular, we discover that VP in tandem with PATE, a state-of-the-art DP training method that leverages the knowledge transfer from an ensemble of teachers, achieves the state-of-the-art privacy-utility trade-off with minimum expenditure of privacy budget. Moreover, we conduct additional experiments on cross-domain image classification with a sufficient domain gap to further unveil the advantage of VP in DP. Lastly, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness and contribution of VP under DP consideration. Our code is available at (https://github.com/EzzzLi/Prompt-PATE).

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks can mislead deep learning models to make false predictions by implanting small perturbations to the original input that are imperceptible to the human eye, which poses a huge security threat to the computer vision systems based on deep learning. Physical adversarial attacks, which is more realistic, as the perturbation is introduced to the input before it is being captured and converted to a binary image inside the vision system, when compared to digital adversarial attacks. In this paper, we focus on physical adversarial attacks and further classify them into invasive and non-invasive. Optical-based physical adversarial attack techniques (e.g. using light irradiation) belong to the non-invasive category. As the perturbations can be easily ignored by humans as the perturbations are very similar to the effects generated by a natural environment in the real world. They are highly invisibility and executable and can pose a significant or even lethal threats to real systems. This paper focuses on optical-based physical adversarial attack techniques for computer vision systems, with emphasis on the introduction and discussion of optical-based physical adversarial attack techniques.

- **Summary**: Binary concepts are empirically used by humans to generalize efficiently. And they are based on Bernoulli distribution which is the building block of information. These concepts span both low-level and high-level features such as "large vs small" and "a neuron is active or inactive". Binary concepts are ubiquitous features and can be used to transfer knowledge to improve model generalization. We propose a novel binarized regularization to facilitate learning of binary concepts to improve the quality of data generation in autoencoders. We introduce a binarizing hyperparameter $r$ in data generation process to disentangle the latent space symmetrically. We demonstrate that this method can be applied easily to existing variational autoencoder (VAE) variants to encourage symmetric disentanglement, improve reconstruction quality, and prevent posterior collapse without computation overhead. We also demonstrate that this method can boost existing models to learn more transferable representations and generate more representative samples for the input distribution which can alleviate catastrophic forgetting using generative replay under continual learning settings.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a crucial aspect of deploying machine learning models in open-world applications. Empirical evidence suggests that training with auxiliary outliers substantially improves OOD detection. However, such outliers typically exhibit a distribution gap compared to the test OOD data and do not cover all possible test OOD scenarios. Additionally, incorporating these outliers introduces additional training burdens. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm called test-time OOD detection, which utilizes unlabeled online data directly at test time to improve OOD detection performance. While this paradigm is efficient, it also presents challenges such as catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose adaptive outlier optimization (AUTO), which consists of an in-out-aware filter, an ID memory bank, and a semantically-consistent objective. AUTO adaptively mines pseudo-ID and pseudo-OOD samples from test data, utilizing them to optimize networks in real time during inference. Extensive results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet benchmarks demonstrate that AUTO significantly enhances OOD detection performance.

- **Summary**: While the performance of deep convolutional neural networks for image super-resolution (SR) has improved significantly, the rapid increase of memory and computation requirements hinders their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Quantized networks, especially binary neural networks (BNN) for SR have been proposed to significantly improve the model inference efficiency but suffer from large performance degradation. We observe the activation distribution of SR networks demonstrates very large pixel-to-pixel, channel-to-channel, and image-to-image variation, which is important for high performance SR but gets lost during binarization. To address the problem, we propose two effective methods, including the spatial re-scaling as well as channel-wise shifting and re-scaling, which augments binary convolutions by retaining more spatial and channel-wise information. Our proposed models, dubbed EBSR, demonstrate superior performance over prior art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively across different datasets and different model sizes. Specifically, for x4 SR on Set5 and Urban100, EBSRlight improves the PSNR by 0.31 dB and 0.28 dB compared to SRResNet-E2FIF, respectively, while EBSR outperforms EDSR-E2FIF by 0.29 dB and 0.32 dB PSNR, respectively.

- **Summary**: Accurate and robust trajectory prediction of neighboring agents is critical for autonomous vehicles traversing in complex scenes. Most methods proposed in recent years are deep learning-based due to their strength in encoding complex interactions. However, unplausible predictions are often generated since they rely heavily on past observations and cannot effectively capture the transient and contingency interactions from sparse samples. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical hybrid framework of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-agent trajectory prediction, to cope with the challenge of predicting motions shaped by multi-scale interactions. In the DL stage, the traffic scene is divided into multiple intermediate-scale heterogenous graphs based on which Transformer-style GNNs are adopted to encode heterogenous interactions at intermediate and global levels. In the RL stage, we divide the traffic scene into local sub-scenes utilizing the key future points predicted in the DL stage. To emulate the motion planning procedure so as to produce trajectory predictions, a Transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) incorporated with a vehicle kinematics model is devised to plan motions under the dominant influence of microscopic interactions. A multi-objective reward is designed to balance between agent-centric accuracy and scene-wise compatibility. Experimental results show that our proposal matches the state-of-the-arts on the Argoverse forecasting benchmark. It's also revealed by the visualized results that the hierarchical learning framework captures the multi-scale interactions and improves the feasibility and compliance of the predicted trajectories.

- **Summary**: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is conducted to infer invisible scenes from indirect light on visible objects. The neural transient field (NeTF) was proposed for representing scenes as neural radiance fields in NLOS scenes. We propose NLOS neural implicit surface (NLOS-NeuS), which extends the NeTF to neural implicit surfaces with a signed distance function (SDF) for reconstructing three-dimensional surfaces in NLOS scenes. We introduce two constraints as loss functions for correctly learning an SDF to avoid non-zero level-set surfaces. We also introduce a lower bound constraint of an SDF based on the geometry of the first-returning photons. The experimental results indicate that these constraints are essential for learning a correct SDF in NLOS scenes. Compared with previous methods with discretized representation, NLOS-NeuS with the neural continuous representation enables us to reconstruct smooth surfaces while preserving fine details in NLOS scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on neural implicit surfaces with volume rendering in NLOS scenes.

- **Summary**: Siamese network based trackers develop rapidly in the field of visual object tracking in recent years. The majority of siamese network based trackers now in use treat each channel in the feature maps generated by the backbone network equally, making the similarity response map sensitive to background influence and hence challenging to focus on the target region. Additionally, there are no structural links between the classification and regression branches in these trackers, and the two branches are optimized separately during training. Therefore, there is a misalignment between the classification and regression branches, which results in less accurate tracking results. In this paper, a Target Highlight Module is proposed to help the generated similarity response maps to be more focused on the target region. To reduce the misalignment and produce more precise tracking results, we propose a corrective loss to train the model. The two branches of the model are jointly tuned with the use of corrective loss to produce more reliable prediction results. Experiments on 5 challenging benchmark datasets reveal that the method outperforms current models in terms of performance, and runs at 38 fps, proving its effectiveness and efficiency.

- **Summary**: To address the challenges of long-tailed classification, researchers have proposed several approaches to reduce model bias, most of which assume that classes with few samples are weak classes. However, recent studies have shown that tail classes are not always hard to learn, and model bias has been observed on sample-balanced datasets, suggesting the existence of other factors that affect model bias. In this work, we systematically propose a series of geometric measurements for perceptual manifolds in deep neural networks, and then explore the effect of the geometric characteristics of perceptual manifolds on classification difficulty and how learning shapes the geometric characteristics of perceptual manifolds. An unanticipated finding is that the correlation between the class accuracy and the separation degree of perceptual manifolds gradually decreases during training, while the negative correlation with the curvature gradually increases, implying that curvature imbalance leads to model bias. Therefore, we propose curvature regularization to facilitate the model to learn curvature-balanced and flatter perceptual manifolds. Evaluations on multiple long-tailed and non-long-tailed datasets show the excellent performance and exciting generality of our approach, especially in achieving significant performance improvements based on current state-of-the-art techniques. Our work opens up a geometric analysis perspective on model bias and reminds researchers to pay attention to model bias on non-long-tailed and even sample-balanced datasets. The code and model will be made public.

- **Summary**: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has emerged as a highly effective generative model in the field of computer vision. Its intermediate latent vectors offer rich semantic information, making it an attractive option for various downstream tasks such as segmentation and detection. In order to explore its potential further, we have taken a step forward and considered a more complex scenario in the medical image domain, specifically, under an unsupervised adaptation condition. To this end, we propose a Diffusion-based and Prototype-guided network (DP-Net) for unsupervised domain adaptive segmentation. Concretely, our DP-Net consists of two stages: 1) Distribution Aligned Diffusion (DADiff), which involves training a domain discriminator to minimize the difference between the intermediate features generated by the DPM, thereby aligning the inter-domain distribution; and 2) Prototype-guided Consistency Learning (PCL), which utilizes feature centroids as prototypes and applies a prototype-guided loss to ensure that the segmentor learns consistent content from both source and target domains. Our approach is evaluated on fundus datasets through a series of experiments, which demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is reliable and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work presents a promising direction for using DPM in complex medical image scenarios, opening up new possibilities for further research in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Although federated learning has made awe-inspiring advances, most studies have assumed that the client's data are fully labeled. However, in a real-world scenario, every client may have a significant amount of unlabeled instances. Among the various approaches to utilizing unlabeled data, a federated active learning framework has emerged as a promising solution. In the decentralized setting, there are two types of available query selector models, namely 'global' and 'local-only' models, but little literature discusses their performance dominance and its causes. In this work, we first demonstrate that the superiority of two selector models depends on the global and local inter-class diversity. Furthermore, we observe that the global and local-only models are the keys to resolving the imbalance of each side. Based on our findings, we propose LoGo, a FAL sampling strategy robust to varying local heterogeneity levels and global imbalance ratio, that integrates both models by two steps of active selection scheme. LoGo consistently outperforms six active learning strategies in the total number of 38 experimental settings.

- **Summary**: 3D GAN inversion aims to achieve high reconstruction fidelity and reasonable 3D geometry simultaneously from a single image input. However, existing 3D GAN inversion methods rely on time-consuming optimization for each individual case. In this work, we introduce a novel encoder-based inversion framework based on EG3D, one of the most widely-used 3D GAN models. We leverage the inherent properties of EG3D's latent space to design a discriminator and a background depth regularization. This enables us to train a geometry-aware encoder capable of converting the input image into corresponding latent code. Additionally, we explore the feature space of EG3D and develop an adaptive refinement stage that improves the representation ability of features in EG3D to enhance the recovery of fine-grained textural details. Finally, we propose an occlusion-aware fusion operation to prevent distortion in unobserved regions. Our method achieves impressive results comparable to optimization-based methods while operating up to 500 times faster. Our framework is well-suited for applications such as semantic editing.

- **Summary**: Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to locate action regions and identify action categories in untrimmed videos, only taking video-level labels as the supervised information. Pseudo label generation is a promising strategy to solve the challenging problem, but most existing methods are limited to employing snippet-wise classification results to guide the generation, and they ignore that the natural temporal structure of the video can also provide rich information to assist such a generation process. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised temporal action localization method by inferring snippet-feature affinity. First, we design an affinity inference module that exploits the affinity relationship between temporal neighbor snippets to generate initial coarse pseudo labels. Then, we introduce an information interaction module that refines the coarse labels by enhancing the discriminative nature of snippet-features through exploring intra- and inter-video relationships. Finally, the high-fidelity pseudo labels generated from the information interaction module are used to supervise the training of the action localization network. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets, i.e., THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3, demonstrate our proposed method achieves significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Music-driven choreography is a challenging problem with a wide variety of industrial applications. Recently, many methods have been proposed to synthesize dance motions from music for a single dancer. However, generating dance motion for a group remains an open problem. In this paper, we present $\rm AIOZ-GDANCE$, a new large-scale dataset for music-driven group dance generation. Unlike existing datasets that only support single dance, our new dataset contains group dance videos, hence supporting the study of group choreography. We propose a semi-autonomous labeling method with humans in the loop to obtain the 3D ground truth for our dataset. The proposed dataset consists of 16.7 hours of paired music and 3D motion from in-the-wild videos, covering 7 dance styles and 16 music genres. We show that naively applying single dance generation technique to creating group dance motion may lead to unsatisfactory results, such as inconsistent movements and collisions between dancers. Based on our new dataset, we propose a new method that takes an input music sequence and a set of 3D positions of dancers to efficiently produce multiple group-coherent choreographies. We propose new evaluation metrics for measuring group dance quality and perform intensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our project facilitates future research on group dance generation and is available at: https://aioz-ai.github.io/AIOZ-GDANCE/

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) involves identifying the targets that deviate spectrally from their surroundings, without prior knowledge. Recently, deep learning based methods have become the mainstream HAD methods, due to their powerful spatial-spectral feature extraction ability. However, the current deep detection models are optimized to complete a proxy task (two-step paradigm), such as background reconstruction or generation, rather than achieving anomaly detection directly. This leads to suboptimal results and poor transferability, which means that the deep model is trained and tested on the same image. In this paper, an unsupervised transferred direct detection (TDD) model is proposed, which is optimized directly for the anomaly detection task (one-step paradigm) and has transferability. Specially, the TDD model is optimized to identify the spectral deviation relationship according to the anomaly definition. Compared to learning the specific background distribution as most models do, the spectral deviation relationship is universal for different images and guarantees the model transferability. To train the TDD model in an unsupervised manner, an anomaly sample simulation strategy is proposed to generate numerous pairs of anomaly samples. Furthermore, a global self-attention module and a local self-attention module are designed to help the model focus on the "spectrally deviating" relationship. The TDD model was validated on four public HAD datasets. The results show that the proposed TDD model can successfully overcome the limitation of traditional model training and testing on a single image, and the model has a powerful detection ability and excellent transferability.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-training tasks like image classification, captioning, or self-supervised techniques do not incentivize learning the semantic boundaries of objects. However, recent generative foundation models built using text-based latent diffusion techniques may learn semantic boundaries. This is because they have to synthesize intricate details about all objects in an image based on a text description. Therefore, we present a technique for segmenting real and AI-generated images using latent diffusion models (LDMs) trained on internet-scale datasets. First, we show that the latent space of LDMs (z-space) is a better input representation compared to other feature representations like RGB images or CLIP encodings for text-based image segmentation. By training the segmentation models on the latent z-space, which creates a compressed representation across several domains like different forms of art, cartoons, illustrations, and photographs, we are also able to bridge the domain gap between real and AI-generated images. We show that the internal features of LDMs contain rich semantic information and present a technique in the form of LD-ZNet to further boost the performance of text-based segmentation. Overall, we show up to 6% improvement over standard baselines for text-to-image segmentation on natural images. For AI-generated imagery, we show close to 20% improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The project is available at https://koutilya-pnvr.github.io/LD-ZNet/.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose NUWA-XL, a novel Diffusion over Diffusion architecture for eXtremely Long video generation. Most current work generates long videos segment by segment sequentially, which normally leads to the gap between training on short videos and inferring long videos, and the sequential generation is inefficient. Instead, our approach adopts a ``coarse-to-fine'' process, in which the video can be generated in parallel at the same granularity. A global diffusion model is applied to generate the keyframes across the entire time range, and then local diffusion models recursively fill in the content between nearby frames. This simple yet effective strategy allows us to directly train on long videos (3376 frames) to reduce the training-inference gap, and makes it possible to generate all segments in parallel. To evaluate our model, we build FlintstonesHD dataset, a new benchmark for long video generation. Experiments show that our model not only generates high-quality long videos with both global and local coherence, but also decreases the average inference time from 7.55min to 26s (by 94.26\%) at the same hardware setting when generating 1024 frames.

- **Summary**: Many material properties are manifested in the morphological appearance and characterized with microscopic image, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Polymer miscibility is a key physical quantity of polymer material and commonly and intuitively judged by SEM images. However, human observation and judgement for the images is time-consuming, labor-intensive and hard to be quantified. Computer image recognition with machine learning method can make up the defects of artificial judging, giving accurate and quantitative judgement. We achieve automatic miscibility recognition utilizing convolution neural network and transfer learning method, and the model obtains up to 94% accuracy. We also put forward a quantitative criterion for polymer miscibility with this model. The proposed method can be widely applied to the quantitative characterization of the microstructure and properties of various materials.

- **Summary**: We propose a scene-level inverse rendering framework that uses multi-view images to decompose the scene into geometry, a SVBRDF, and 3D spatially-varying lighting. Because multi-view images provide a variety of information about the scene, multi-view images in object-level inverse rendering have been taken for granted. However, owing to the absence of multi-view HDR synthetic dataset, scene-level inverse rendering has mainly been studied using single-view image. We were able to successfully perform scene-level inverse rendering using multi-view images by expanding OpenRooms dataset and designing efficient pipelines to handle multi-view images, and splitting spatially-varying lighting. Our experiments show that the proposed method not only achieves better performance than single-view-based methods, but also achieves robust performance on unseen real-world scene. Also, our sophisticated 3D spatially-varying lighting volume allows for photorealistic object insertion in any 3D location.

- **Summary**: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) is challenging because the binary anomaly label is only given on the video level, but the output requires snippet-level predictions. So, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is prevailing in WSVAD. However, MIL is notoriously known to suffer from many false alarms because the snippet-level detector is easily biased towards the abnormal snippets with simple context, confused by the normality with the same bias, and missing the anomaly with a different pattern. To this end, we propose a new MIL framework: Unbiased MIL (UMIL), to learn unbiased anomaly features that improve WSVAD. At each MIL training iteration, we use the current detector to divide the samples into two groups with different context biases: the most confident abnormal/normal snippets and the rest ambiguous ones. Then, by seeking the invariant features across the two sample groups, we can remove the variant context biases. Extensive experiments on benchmarks UCF-Crime and TAD demonstrate the effectiveness of our UMIL. Our code is provided at https://github.com/ktr-hubrt/UMIL.

- **Summary**: Sequential video understanding, as an emerging video understanding task, has driven lots of researchers' attention because of its goal-oriented nature. This paper studies weakly supervised sequential video understanding where the accurate time-stamp level text-video alignment is not provided. We solve this task by borrowing ideas from CLIP. Specifically, we use a transformer to aggregate frame-level features for video representation and use a pre-trained text encoder to encode the texts corresponding to each action and the whole video, respectively. To model the correspondence between text and video, we propose a multiple granularity loss, where the video-paragraph contrastive loss enforces matching between the whole video and the complete script, and a fine-grained frame-sentence contrastive loss enforces the matching between each action and its description. As the frame-sentence correspondence is not available, we propose to use the fact that video actions happen sequentially in the temporal domain to generate pseudo frame-sentence correspondence and supervise the network training with the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on video sequence verification and text-to-video matching show that our method outperforms baselines by a large margin, which validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: It is important for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to transfer their learned policies to new environments that have different visual inputs. In this paper, we introduce Prompt based Proximal Policy Optimization ($P^{3}O$), a three-stage DRL algorithm that transfers visual representations from a target to a source environment by applying prompting. The process of $P^{3}O$ consists of three stages: pre-training, prompting, and predicting. In particular, we specify a prompt-transformer for representation conversion and propose a two-step training process to train the prompt-transformer for the target environment, while the rest of the DRL pipeline remains unchanged. We implement $P^{3}O$ and evaluate it on the OpenAI CarRacing video game. The experimental results show that $P^{3}O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art visual transferring schemes. In particular, $P^{3}O$ allows the learned policies to perform well in environments with different visual inputs, which is much more effective than retraining the policies in these environments.

- **Summary**: The latent space of GANs contains rich semantics reflecting the training data. Different methods propose to learn edits in latent space corresponding to semantic attributes, thus allowing to modify generated images. Most supervised methods rely on the guidance of classifiers to produce such edits. However, classifiers can lead to out-of-distribution regions and be fooled by adversarial samples. We propose an alternative formulation based on the Wasserstein loss that avoids such problems, while maintaining performance on-par with classifier-based approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two datasets (digits and faces) using StyleGAN2.

- **Summary**: We propose a content-based system for matching video and background music. The system aims to address the challenges in music recommendation for new users or new music give short-form videos. To this end, we propose a cross-modal framework VMCML that finds a shared embedding space between video and music representations. To ensure the embedding space can be effectively shared by both representations, we leverage CosFace loss based on margin-based cosine similarity loss. Furthermore, we establish a large-scale dataset called MSVD, in which we provide 390 individual music and the corresponding matched 150,000 videos. We conduct extensive experiments on Youtube-8M and our MSVD datasets. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and achieve state-of-the-art video and music matching performance.

- **Summary**: Although point cloud registration has achieved remarkable advances in object-level and indoor scenes, large-scale registration methods are rarely explored. Challenges mainly arise from the huge point number, complex distribution, and outliers of outdoor LiDAR scans. In addition, most existing registration works generally adopt a two-stage paradigm: They first find correspondences by extracting discriminative local features and then leverage estimators (eg. RANSAC) to filter outliers, which are highly dependent on well-designed descriptors and post-processing choices. To address these problems, we propose an end-to-end transformer network (RegFormer) for large-scale point cloud alignment without any further post-processing. Specifically, a projection-aware hierarchical transformer is proposed to capture long-range dependencies and filter outliers by extracting point features globally. Our transformer has linear complexity, which guarantees high efficiency even for large-scale scenes. Furthermore, to effectively reduce mismatches, a bijective association transformer is designed for regressing the initial transformation. Extensive experiments on KITTI and NuScenes datasets demonstrate that our RegFormer achieves competitive performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Road extraction is a process of automatically generating road maps mainly from satellite images. Existing models all target to generate roads from the scratch despite that a large quantity of road maps, though incomplete, are publicly available (e.g. those from OpenStreetMap) and can help with road extraction. In this paper, we propose to conduct road extraction based on satellite images and partial road maps, which is new. We then propose a two-branch Partial to Complete Network (P2CNet) for the task, which has two prominent components: Gated Self-Attention Module (GSAM) and Missing Part (MP) loss. GSAM leverages a channel-wise self-attention module and a gate module to capture long-range semantics, filter out useless information, and better fuse the features from two branches. MP loss is derived from the partial road maps, trying to give more attention to the road pixels that do not exist in partial road maps. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, e.g. P2CNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with the IoU scores of 70.71% and 75.52%, respectively, on the SpaceNet and OSM datasets.

- **Summary**: Most recent 6D object pose estimation methods first use object detection to obtain 2D bounding boxes before actually regressing the pose. However, the general object detection methods they use are ill-suited to handle cluttered scenes, thus producing poor initialization to the subsequent pose network. To address this, we propose a rigidity-aware detection method exploiting the fact that, in 6D pose estimation, the target objects are rigid. This lets us introduce an approach to sampling positive object regions from the entire visible object area during training, instead of naively drawing samples from the bounding box center where the object might be occluded. As such, every visible object part can contribute to the final bounding box prediction, yielding better detection robustness. Key to the success of our approach is a visibility map, which we propose to build using a minimum barrier distance between every pixel in the bounding box and the box boundary. Our results on seven challenging 6D pose estimation datasets evidence that our method outperforms general detection frameworks by a large margin. Furthermore, combined with a pose regression network, we obtain state-of-the-art pose estimation results on the challenging BOP benchmark.

- **Summary**: Transformers have achieved widespread success in computer vision. At their heart, there is a Self-Attention (SA) mechanism, an inductive bias that associates each token in the input with every other token through a weighted basis. The standard SA mechanism has quadratic complexity with the sequence length, which impedes its utility to long sequences appearing in high resolution vision. Recently, inspired by operator learning for PDEs, Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) were introduced for high resolution attention based on global convolution that is efficiently implemented via FFT. However, the AFNO global filtering cannot well represent small and moderate scale structures that commonly appear in natural images. To leverage the coarse-to-fine scale structures we introduce a Multiscale Wavelet Attention (MWA) by leveraging wavelet neural operators which incurs linear complexity in the sequence size. We replace the attention in ViT with MWA and our experiments with CIFAR and Tiny-ImageNet classification demonstrate significant improvement over alternative Fourier-based attentions such as AFNO and Global Filter Network (GFN).

- **Summary**: Multi-agent collaborative perception (MCP) has recently attracted much attention. It includes three key processes: communication for sharing, collaboration for integration, and reconstruction for different downstream tasks. Existing methods pursue designing the collaboration process alone, ignoring their intrinsic interactions and resulting in suboptimal performance. In contrast, we aim to propose a Unified Collaborative perception framework named UMC, optimizing the communication, collaboration, and reconstruction processes with the Multi-resolution technique. The communication introduces a novel trainable multi-resolution and selective-region (MRSR) mechanism, achieving higher quality and lower bandwidth. Then, a graph-based collaboration is proposed, conducting on each resolution to adapt the MRSR. Finally, the reconstruction integrates the multi-resolution collaborative features for downstream tasks. Since the general metric can not reflect the performance enhancement brought by MCP systematically, we introduce a brand-new evaluation metric that evaluates the MCP from different perspectives. To verify our algorithm, we conducted experiments on the V2X-Sim and OPV2V datasets. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments prove that the proposed UMC greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art collaborative perception approaches.

- **Summary**: We present EgoNeRF, a practical solution to reconstruct large-scale real-world environments for VR assets. Given a few seconds of casually captured 360 video, EgoNeRF can efficiently build neural radiance fields which enable high-quality rendering from novel viewpoints. Motivated by the recent acceleration of NeRF using feature grids, we adopt spherical coordinate instead of conventional Cartesian coordinate. Cartesian feature grid is inefficient to represent large-scale unbounded scenes because it has a spatially uniform resolution, regardless of distance from viewers. The spherical parameterization better aligns with the rays of egocentric images, and yet enables factorization for performance enhancement. However, the na\"ive spherical grid suffers from irregularities at two poles, and also cannot represent unbounded scenes. To avoid singularities near poles, we combine two balanced grids, which results in a quasi-uniform angular grid. We also partition the radial grid exponentially and place an environment map at infinity to represent unbounded scenes. Furthermore, with our resampling technique for grid-based methods, we can increase the number of valid samples to train NeRF volume. We extensively evaluate our method in our newly introduced synthetic and real-world egocentric 360 video datasets, and it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, benefiting from large-scale unlabeled text-image pairs, has demonstrated great performance in open-world vision understanding tasks. However, due to the limited Text-3D data pairs, adapting the success of 2D Vision-Language Models (VLM) to the 3D space remains an open problem. Existing works that leverage VLM for 3D understanding generally resort to constructing intermediate 2D representations for the 3D data, but at the cost of losing 3D geometry information. To take a step toward open-world 3D vision understanding, we propose Contrastive Language-Image-Point Cloud Pretraining (CLIP$^2$) to directly learn the transferable 3D point cloud representation in realistic scenarios with a novel proxy alignment mechanism. Specifically, we exploit naturally-existed correspondences in 2D and 3D scenarios, and build well-aligned and instance-based text-image-point proxies from those complex scenarios. On top of that, we propose a cross-modal contrastive objective to learn semantic and instance-level aligned point cloud representation. Experimental results on both indoor and outdoor scenarios show that our learned 3D representation has great transfer ability in downstream tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot 3D recognition, which boosts the state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Furthermore, we provide analyses of the capability of different representations in real scenarios and present the optional ensemble scheme.

- **Summary**: As one of the most fundamental techniques in multimodal learning, cross-modal matching aims to project various sensory modalities into a shared feature space. To achieve this, massive and correctly aligned data pairs are required for model training. However, unlike unimodal datasets, multimodal datasets are extremely harder to collect and annotate precisely. As an alternative, the co-occurred data pairs (e.g., image-text pairs) collected from the Internet have been widely exploited in the area. Unfortunately, the cheaply collected dataset unavoidably contains many mismatched data pairs, which have been proven to be harmful to the model's performance. To address this, we propose a general framework called BiCro (Bidirectional Cross-modal similarity consistency), which can be easily integrated into existing cross-modal matching models and improve their robustness against noisy data. Specifically, BiCro aims to estimate soft labels for noisy data pairs to reflect their true correspondence degree. The basic idea of BiCro is motivated by that -- taking image-text matching as an example -- similar images should have similar textual descriptions and vice versa. Then the consistency of these two similarities can be recast as the estimated soft labels to train the matching model. The experiments on three popular cross-modal matching datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves the noise-robustness of various matching models, and surpass the state-of-the-art by a clear margin.

- **Summary**: Digital image inpainting is an interpolation problem, inferring the content in the missing (unknown) region to agree with the known region data such that the interpolated result fulfills some prior knowledge. Low-rank and nonlocal self-similarity are two important priors for image inpainting. Based on the nonlocal self-similarity assumption, an image is divided into overlapped square target patches (submatrices) and the similar patches of any target patch are reshaped as vectors and stacked into a patch matrix. Such a patch matrix usually enjoys a property of low rank or approximately low rank, and its missing entries are recoveried by low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) algorithms. Traditionally, $n$ nearest neighbor similar patches are searched within a local window centered at a target patch. However, for an image with missing lines, the generated patch matrix is prone to having entirely-missing rows such that the downstream low-rank model fails to reconstruct it well. To address this problem, we propose a region-wise matching (RwM) algorithm by dividing the neighborhood of a target patch into multiple subregions and then search the most similar one within each subregion. A non-convex weighted low-rank decomposition (NC-WLRD) model for LRMA is also proposed to reconstruct all degraded patch matrices grouped by the proposed RwM algorithm. We solve the proposed NC-WLRD model by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and analyze the convergence in detail. Numerous experiments on line inpainting (entire-row/column missing) demonstrate the superiority of our method over other competitive inpainting algorithms. Unlike other low-rank-based matrix completion methods and inpainting algorithms, the proposed model NC-WLRD is also effective for removing random-valued impulse noise and structural noise (stripes).

- **Summary**: Video captioning aims to describe the content of videos using natural language. Although significant progress has been made, there is still much room to improve the performance for real-world applications, mainly due to the long-tail words challenge. In this paper, we propose a text with knowledge graph augmented transformer (TextKG) for video captioning. Notably, TextKG is a two-stream transformer, formed by the external stream and internal stream. The external stream is designed to absorb additional knowledge, which models the interactions between the additional knowledge, e.g., pre-built knowledge graph, and the built-in information of videos, e.g., the salient object regions, speech transcripts, and video captions, to mitigate the long-tail words challenge. Meanwhile, the internal stream is designed to exploit the multi-modality information in videos (e.g., the appearance of video frames, speech transcripts, and video captions) to ensure the quality of caption results. In addition, the cross attention mechanism is also used in between the two streams for sharing information. In this way, the two streams can help each other for more accurate results. Extensive experiments conducted on four challenging video captioning datasets, i.e., YouCookII, ActivityNet Captions, MSRVTT, and MSVD, demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the proposed TextKG method outperforms the best published results by improving 18.7% absolute CIDEr scores on the YouCookII dataset.

- **Summary**: Event-based cameras offer reliable measurements for preforming computer vision tasks in high-dynamic range environments and during fast motion maneuvers. However, adopting deep learning in event-based vision faces the challenge of annotated data scarcity due to recency of event cameras. Transferring the knowledge that can be obtained from conventional camera annotated data offers a practical solution to this challenge. We develop an unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm for training a deep network for event-based data image classification using contrastive learning and uncorrelated conditioning of data. Our solution outperforms the existing algorithms for this purpose.

- **Summary**: Renal transplantation emerges as the most effective solution for end-stage renal disease. Occurring from complex causes, a substantial risk of transplant chronic dysfunction persists and may lead to graft loss. Medical imaging plays a substantial role in renal transplant monitoring in clinical practice. However, graft supervision is multi-disciplinary, notably joining nephrology, urology, and radiology, while identifying robust biomarkers from such high-dimensional and complex data for prognosis is challenging. In this work, taking inspiration from the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose MEDIMP -- Medical Images with clinical Prompts -- a model to learn meaningful multi-modal representations of renal transplant Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE MRI) by incorporating structural clinicobiological data after translating them into text prompts. MEDIMP is based on contrastive learning from joint text-image paired embeddings to perform this challenging task. Moreover, we propose a framework that generates medical prompts using automatic textual data augmentations from LLMs. Our goal is to learn meaningful manifolds of renal transplant DCE MRI, interesting for the prognosis of the transplant or patient status (2, 3, and 4 years after the transplant), fully exploiting the limited available multi-modal data most efficiently. Extensive experiments and comparisons with other renal transplant representation learning methods with limited data prove the effectiveness of MEDIMP in a relevant clinical setting, giving new directions toward medical prompts.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has seen rapid growth in recent years and achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of applications. However, training models typically requires expensive and time-consuming collection of large quantities of labeled data. This is particularly true within the scope of medical imaging analysis (MIA), where data are limited and labels are expensive to be acquired. Thus, label-efficient deep learning methods are developed to make comprehensive use of the labeled data as well as the abundance of unlabeled and weak-labeled data. In this survey, we extensively investigated over 300 recent papers to provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress on label-efficient learning strategies in MIA. We first present the background of label-efficient learning and categorize the approaches into different schemes. Next, we examine the current state-of-the-art methods in detail through each scheme. Specifically, we provide an in-depth investigation, covering not only canonical semi-supervised, self-supervised, and multi-instance learning schemes, but also recently emerged active and annotation-efficient learning strategies. Moreover, as a comprehensive contribution to the field, this survey not only elucidates the commonalities and unique features of the surveyed methods but also presents a detailed analysis of the current challenges in the field and suggests potential avenues for future research.

- **Summary**: Agricultural robots have the prospect to enable more efficient and sustainable agricultural production of food, feed, and fiber. Perception of crops and weeds is a central component of agricultural robots that aim to monitor fields and assess the plants as well as their growth stage in an automatic manner. Semantic perception mostly relies on deep learning using supervised approaches, which require time and qualified workers to label fairly large amounts of data. In this paper, we look into the problem of reducing the amount of labels without compromising the final segmentation performance. For robots operating in the field, pre-training networks in a supervised way is already a popular method to reduce the number of required labeled images. We investigate the possibility of pre-training in a self-supervised fashion using data from the target domain. To better exploit this data, we propose a set of domain-specific augmentation strategies. We evaluate our pre-training on semantic segmentation and leaf instance segmentation, two important tasks in our domain. The experimental results suggest that pre-training with domain-specific data paired with our data augmentation strategy leads to superior performance compared to commonly used pre-trainings. Furthermore, the pre-trained networks obtain similar performance to the fully supervised with less labeled data.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image person retrieval aims to identify the target person based on a given textual description query. The primary challenge is to learn the mapping of visual and textual modalities into a common latent space. Prior works have attempted to address this challenge by leveraging separately pre-trained unimodal models to extract visual and textual features. However, these approaches lack the necessary underlying alignment capabilities required to match multimodal data effectively. Besides, these works use prior information to explore explicit part alignments, which may lead to the distortion of intra-modality information. To alleviate these issues, we present IRRA: a cross-modal Implicit Relation Reasoning and Aligning framework that learns relations between local visual-textual tokens and enhances global image-text matching without requiring additional prior supervision. Specifically, we first design an Implicit Relation Reasoning module in a masked language modeling paradigm. This achieves cross-modal interaction by integrating the visual cues into the textual tokens with a cross-modal multimodal interaction encoder. Secondly, to globally align the visual and textual embeddings, Similarity Distribution Matching is proposed to minimize the KL divergence between image-text similarity distributions and the normalized label matching distributions. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all three public datasets, with a notable margin of about 3%-9% for Rank-1 accuracy compared to prior methods.

- **Summary**: A hard challenge in developing practical face recognition (FR) attacks is due to the black-box nature of the target FR model, i.e., inaccessible gradient and parameter information to attackers. While recent research took an important step towards attacking black-box FR models through leveraging transferability, their performance is still limited, especially against online commercial FR systems that can be pessimistic (e.g., a less than 50% ASR--attack success rate on average). Motivated by this, we present Sibling-Attack, a new FR attack technique for the first time explores a novel multi-task perspective (i.e., leveraging extra information from multi-correlated tasks to boost attacking transferability). Intuitively, Sibling-Attack selects a set of tasks correlated with FR and picks the Attribute Recognition (AR) task as the task used in Sibling-Attack based on theoretical and quantitative analysis. Sibling-Attack then develops an optimization framework that fuses adversarial gradient information through (1) constraining the cross-task features to be under the same space, (2) a joint-task meta optimization framework that enhances the gradient compatibility among tasks, and (3) a cross-task gradient stabilization method which mitigates the oscillation effect during attacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sibling-Attack outperforms state-of-the-art FR attack techniques by a non-trivial margin, boosting ASR by 12.61% and 55.77% on average on state-of-the-art pre-trained FR models and two well-known, widely used commercial FR systems.

- **Summary**: Improvements in Earth observation by satellites allow for imagery of ever higher temporal and spatial resolution. Leveraging this data for agricultural monitoring is key for addressing environmental and economic challenges. Current methods for crop segmentation using temporal data either rely on annotated data or are heavily engineered to compensate the lack of supervision. In this paper, we present and compare datasets and methods for both supervised and unsupervised pixel-wise segmentation of satellite image time series (SITS). We also introduce an approach to add invariance to spectral deformations and temporal shifts to classical prototype-based methods such as K-means and Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC). We show this simple and highly interpretable method leads to meaningful results in both the supervised and unsupervised settings and significantly improves the state of the art for unsupervised classification of agricultural time series on four recent SITS datasets.

- **Summary**: Domain gaps are among the most relevant roadblocks in the clinical translation of machine learning (ML)-based solutions for medical image analysis. While current research focuses on new training paradigms and network architectures, little attention is given to the specific effect of prevalence shifts on an algorithm deployed in practice. Such discrepancies between class frequencies in the data used for a method's development/validation and that in its deployment environment(s) are of great importance, for example in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) democratization, as disease prevalences may vary widely across time and location. Our contribution is twofold. First, we empirically demonstrate the potentially severe consequences of missing prevalence handling by analyzing (i) the extent of miscalibration, (ii) the deviation of the decision threshold from the optimum, and (iii) the ability of validation metrics to reflect neural network performance on the deployment population as a function of the discrepancy between development and deployment prevalence. Second, we propose a workflow for prevalence-aware image classification that uses estimated deployment prevalences to adjust a trained classifier to a new environment, without requiring additional annotated deployment data. Comprehensive experiments based on a diverse set of 30 medical classification tasks showcase the benefit of the proposed workflow in generating better classifier decisions and more reliable performance estimates compared to current practice.

- **Summary**: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have superseded convolutional neural networks in numerous applications, including classification, detection, and segmentation. However, the high computational requirements of ViTs hinder their widespread implementation. To address this issue, researchers have proposed efficient hybrid transformer architectures that combine convolutional and transformer layers with optimized attention computation of linear complexity. Additionally, post-training quantization has been proposed as a means of mitigating computational demands. For mobile devices, achieving optimal acceleration for ViTs necessitates the strategic integration of quantization techniques and efficient hybrid transformer structures. However, no prior investigation has applied quantization to efficient hybrid transformers. In this paper, we discover that applying existing PTQ methods for ViTs to efficient hybrid transformers leads to a drastic accuracy drop, attributed to the four following challenges: (i) highly dynamic ranges, (ii) zero-point overflow, (iii) diverse normalization, and (iv) limited model parameters ($<$5M). To overcome these challenges, we propose a new post-training quantization method, which is the first to quantize efficient hybrid ViTs (MobileViTv1, MobileViTv2, Mobile-Former, EfficientFormerV1, EfficientFormerV2) with a significant margin (an average improvement of 8.32\% for 8-bit and 26.02\% for 6-bit) compared to existing PTQ methods (EasyQuant, FQ-ViT, and PTQ4ViT). We plan to release our code at \url{https://github.com/Q-HyViT}.

- **Summary**: Assisting people in efficiently producing visually plausible 3D characters has always been a fundamental research topic in computer vision and computer graphics. Recent learning-based approaches have achieved unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in the area of 3D real human digitization. However, none of the prior works focus on modeling 3D biped cartoon characters, which are also in great demand in gaming and filming. In this paper, we introduce 3DBiCar, the first large-scale dataset of 3D biped cartoon characters, and RaBit, the corresponding parametric model. Our dataset contains 1,500 topologically consistent high-quality 3D textured models which are manually crafted by professional artists. Built upon the data, RaBit is thus designed with a SMPL-like linear blend shape model and a StyleGAN-based neural UV-texture generator, simultaneously expressing the shape, pose, and texture. To demonstrate the practicality of 3DBiCar and RaBit, various applications are conducted, including single-view reconstruction, sketch-based modeling, and 3D cartoon animation. For the single-view reconstruction setting, we find a straightforward global mapping from input images to the output UV-based texture maps tends to lose detailed appearances of some local parts (e.g., nose, ears). Thus, a part-sensitive texture reasoner is adopted to make all important local areas perceived. Experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively. 3DBiCar and RaBit are available at gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/projects/RaBit.

- **Summary**: Multi-view feature extraction is an efficient approach for alleviating the issue of dimensionality in highdimensional multi-view data. Contrastive learning (CL), which is a popular self-supervised learning method, has recently attracted considerable attention. In this study, we propose a novel multi-view feature extraction method based on triple contrastive heads, which combines the sample-, recovery- , and feature-level contrastive losses to extract the sufficient yet minimal subspace discriminative information in compliance with information bottleneck principle. In MFETCH, we construct the feature-level contrastive loss, which removes the redundent information in the consistency information to achieve the minimality of the subspace discriminative information. Moreover, the recovery-level contrastive loss is also constructed in MFETCH, which captures the view-specific discriminative information to achieve the sufficiency of the subspace discriminative information.The numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method offers a strong advantage for multi-view feature extraction.

- **Summary**: \underline{AI} \underline{G}enerated \underline{C}ontent (\textbf{AIGC}) has gained widespread attention with the increasing efficiency of deep learning in content creation. AIGC, created with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology, includes various forms of content, among which the AI-generated images (AGIs) have brought significant impact to society and have been applied to various fields such as entertainment, education, social media, etc. However, due to hardware limitations and technical proficiency, the quality of AIGC images (AGIs) varies, necessitating refinement and filtering before practical use. Consequently, there is an urgent need for developing objective models to assess the quality of AGIs. Unfortunately, no research has been carried out to investigate the perceptual quality assessment for AGIs specifically. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the major evaluation aspects such as technical issues, AI artifacts, unnaturalness, discrepancy, and aesthetics for AGI quality assessment. Then we present the first perceptual AGI quality assessment database, AGIQA-1K, which consists of 1,080 AGIs generated from diffusion models. A well-organized subjective experiment is followed to collect the quality labels of the AGIs. Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of current image quality assessment (IQA) models.

- **Summary**: A key challenge for LiDAR-based 3D object detection is to capture sufficient features from large scale 3D scenes especially for distant or/and occluded objects. Albeit recent efforts made by Transformers with the long sequence modeling capability, they fail to properly balance the accuracy and efficiency, suffering from inadequate receptive fields or coarse-grained holistic correlations. In this paper, we propose an Octree-based Transformer, named OcTr, to address this issue. It first constructs a dynamic octree on the hierarchical feature pyramid through conducting self-attention on the top level and then recursively propagates to the level below restricted by the octants, which captures rich global context in a coarse-to-fine manner while maintaining the computational complexity under control. Furthermore, for enhanced foreground perception, we propose a hybrid positional embedding, composed of the semantic-aware positional embedding and attention mask, to fully exploit semantic and geometry clues. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI Dataset, and OcTr reaches newly state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art machine learning models often learn spurious correlations embedded in the training data. This poses risks when deploying these models for high-stake decision-making, such as in medical applications like skin cancer detection. To tackle this problem, we propose Reveal to Revise (R2R), a framework entailing the entire eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) life cycle, enabling practitioners to iteratively identify, mitigate, and (re-)evaluate spurious model behavior with a minimal amount of human interaction. In the first step (1), R2R reveals model weaknesses by finding outliers in attributions or through inspection of latent concepts learned by the model. Secondly (2), the responsible artifacts are detected and spatially localized in the input data, which is then leveraged to (3) revise the model behavior. Concretely, we apply the methods of RRR, CDEP and ClArC for model correction, and (4) (re-)evaluate the model's performance and remaining sensitivity towards the artifact. Using two medical benchmark datasets for Melanoma detection and bone age estimation, we apply our R2R framework to VGG, ResNet and EfficientNet architectures and thereby reveal and correct real dataset-intrinsic artifacts, as well as synthetic variants in a controlled setting. Completing the XAI life cycle, we demonstrate multiple R2R iterations to mitigate different biases. Code is available on https://github.com/maxdreyer/Reveal2Revise.

- **Summary**: Image synthesis is expected to provide value for the translation of machine learning methods into clinical practice. Fundamental problems like model robustness, domain transfer, causal modelling, and operator training become approachable through synthetic data. Especially, heavily operator-dependant modalities like Ultrasound imaging require robust frameworks for image and video generation. So far, video generation has only been possible by providing input data that is as rich as the output data, e.g., image sequence plus conditioning in, video out. However, clinical documentation is usually scarce and only single images are reported and stored, thus retrospective patient-specific analysis or the generation of rich training data becomes impossible with current approaches. In this paper, we extend elucidated diffusion models for video modelling to generate plausible video sequences from single images and arbitrary conditioning with clinical parameters. We explore this idea within the context of echocardiograms by looking into the variation of the Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction, the most essential clinical metric gained from these examinations. We use the publicly available EchoNet-Dynamic dataset for all our experiments. Our image to sequence approach achieves an $R^2$ score of 93%, which is 38 points higher than recently proposed sequence to sequence generation methods.

- **Summary**: Generalization capabilities of learning-based medical image segmentation across domains are currently limited by the performance degradation caused by the domain shift, particularly for ultrasound (US) imaging. The quality of US images heavily relies on carefully tuned acoustic parameters, which vary across sonographers, machines, and settings. To improve the generalizability on US images across domains, we propose MI-SegNet, a novel mutual information (MI) based framework to explicitly disentangle the anatomical and domain feature representations; therefore, robust domain-independent segmentation can be expected. Two encoders are employed to extract the relevant features for the disentanglement. The segmentation only uses the anatomical feature map for its prediction. In order to force the encoders to learn meaningful feature representations a cross-reconstruction method is used during training. Transformations, specific to either domain or anatomy are applied to guide the encoders in their respective feature extraction task. Additionally, any MI present in both feature maps is punished to further promote separate feature spaces. We validate the generalizability of the proposed domain-independent segmentation approach on several datasets with varying parameters and machines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MI-SegNet serving as a pre-trained model by comparing it with state-of-the-art networks.

- **Summary**: Deep hashing has been extensively applied to massive image retrieval due to its efficiency and effectiveness. Recently, several adversarial attacks have been presented to reveal the vulnerability of deep hashing models against adversarial examples. However, existing attack methods suffer from degraded performance or inefficiency because they underutilize the semantic relations between original samples or spend a lot of time learning these relations with a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose a novel Pharos-guided Attack, dubbed PgA, to evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep hashing networks reliably and efficiently. Specifically, we design pharos code to represent the semantics of the benign image, which preserves the similarity to semantically relevant samples and dissimilarity to irrelevant ones. It is proven that we can quickly calculate the pharos code via a simple math formula. Accordingly, PgA can directly conduct a reliable and efficient attack on deep hashing-based retrieval by maximizing the similarity between the hash code of the adversarial example and the pharos code. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms the prior state-of-the-arts in both attack strength and speed.

- **Summary**: Neural networks have a number of shortcomings. Amongst the severest ones is the sensitivity to distribution shifts which allows models to be easily fooled into wrong predictions by small perturbations to inputs that are often imperceivable to humans and do not have to carry semantic meaning. Adversarial training poses a partial solution to address this issue by training models on worst-case perturbations. Yet, recent work has also pointed out that the reasoning in neural networks is different from humans. Humans identify objects by shape, while neural nets mainly employ texture cues. Exemplarily, a model trained on photographs will likely fail to generalize to datasets containing sketches. Interestingly, it was also shown that adversarial training seems to favorably increase the shift toward shape bias. In this work, we revisit this observation and provide an extensive analysis of this effect on various architectures, the common $\ell_2$- and $\ell_\infty$-training, and Transformer-based models. Further, we provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon from a frequency perspective.

- **Summary**: We introduce Correlational Image Modeling (CIM), a novel and surprisingly effective approach to self-supervised visual pre-training. Our CIM performs a simple pretext task: we randomly crop image regions (exemplars) from an input image (context) and predict correlation maps between the exemplars and the context. Three key designs enable correlational image modeling as a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. First, to generate useful exemplar-context pairs, we consider cropping image regions with various scales, shapes, rotations, and transformations. Second, we employ a bootstrap learning framework that involves online and target encoders. During pre-training, the former takes exemplars as inputs while the latter converts the context. Third, we model the output correlation maps via a simple cross-attention block, within which the context serves as queries and the exemplars offer values and keys. We show that CIM performs on par or better than the current state of the art on self-supervised and transfer benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a task that requires computers to give correct answers for the input questions based on the images. This task can be solved by humans with ease but is a challenge for computers. The VLSP2022-EVJVQA shared task carries the Visual Question Answering task in the multilingual domain on a newly released dataset: UIT-EVJVQA, in which the questions and answers are written in three different languages: English, Vietnamese and Japanese. We approached the challenge as a sequence-to-sequence learning task, in which we integrated hints from pre-trained state-of-the-art VQA models and image features with Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence network to generate the desired answers. Our results obtained up to 0.3442 by F1 score on the public test set, 0.4210 on the private test set, and placed 3rd in the competition.

- **Summary**: Font design is of vital importance in the digital content design and modern printing industry. Developing algorithms capable of automatically synthesizing vector fonts can significantly facilitate the font design process. However, existing methods mainly concentrate on raster image generation, and only a few approaches can directly synthesize vector fonts. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable method, VecFontSDF, to reconstruct and synthesize high-quality vector fonts using signed distance functions (SDFs). Specifically, based on the proposed SDF-based implicit shape representation, VecFontSDF learns to model each glyph as shape primitives enclosed by several parabolic curves, which can be precisely converted to quadratic B\'ezier curves that are widely used in vector font products. In this manner, most image generation methods can be easily extended to synthesize vector fonts. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method obtains high-quality results on several tasks, including vector font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis, markedly outperforming the state of the art.

- **Summary**: We present Uni-Fusion, a universal continuous mapping framework for surfaces, surface properties (color, infrared, etc.) and more (latent features in CLIP embedding space, etc.). We propose the first universal implicit encoding model that supports encoding of both geometry and different types of properties (RGB, infrared, features, etc.) without requiring any training. Based on this, our framework divides the point cloud into regular grid voxels and generates a latent feature in each voxel to form a Latent Implicit Map (LIM) for geometries and arbitrary properties. Then, by fusing a local LIM frame-wisely into a global LIM, an incremental reconstruction is achieved. Encoded with corresponding types of data, our Latent Implicit Map is capable of generating continuous surfaces, surface property fields, surface feature fields, and all other possible options. To demonstrate the capabilities of our model, we implement three applications: (1) incremental reconstruction for surfaces and color (2) 2D-to-3D transfer of fabricated properties (3) open-vocabulary scene understanding by creating a text CLIP feature field on surfaces. We evaluate Uni-Fusion by comparing it in corresponding applications, from which Uni-Fusion shows high-flexibility in various applications while performing best or being competitive.

- **Summary**: Image diffusion models, trained on massive image collections, have emerged as the most versatile image generator model in terms of quality and diversity. They support inverting real images and conditional (e.g., text) generation, making them attractive for high-quality image editing applications. We investigate how to use such pre-trained image models for text-guided video editing. The critical challenge is to achieve the target edits while still preserving the content of the source video. Our method works in two simple steps: first, we use a pre-trained structure-guided (e.g., depth) image diffusion model to perform text-guided edits on an anchor frame; then, in the key step, we progressively propagate the changes to the future frames via self-attention feature injection to adapt the core denoising step of the diffusion model. We then consolidate the changes by adjusting the latent code for the frame before continuing the process. Our approach is training-free and generalizes to a wide range of edits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by extensive experimentation and compare it against four different prior and parallel efforts (on ArXiv). We demonstrate that realistic text-guided video edits are possible, without any compute-intensive preprocessing or video-specific finetuning.

- **Summary**: The problem of class incremental learning (CIL) is considered. State-of-the-art approaches use a dynamic architecture based on network expansion (NE), in which a task expert is added per task. While effective from a computational standpoint, these methods lead to models that grow quickly with the number of tasks. A new NE method, dense network expansion (DNE), is proposed to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and model complexity. This is accomplished by the introduction of dense connections between the intermediate layers of the task expert networks, that enable the transfer of knowledge from old to new tasks via feature sharing and reusing. This sharing is implemented with a cross-task attention mechanism, based on a new task attention block (TAB), that fuses information across tasks. Unlike traditional attention mechanisms, TAB operates at the level of the feature mixing and is decoupled with spatial attentions. This is shown more effective than a joint spatial-and-task attention for CIL. The proposed DNE approach can strictly maintain the feature space of old classes while growing the network and feature scale at a much slower rate than previous methods. In result, it outperforms the previous SOTA methods by a margin of 4\% in terms of accuracy, with similar or even smaller model scale.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has achieved great success in recent years with the aid of advanced neural network structures and large-scale human-annotated datasets. However, it is often costly and difficult to accurately and efficiently annotate large-scale datasets, especially for some specialized domains where fine-grained labels are required. In this setting, coarse labels are much easier to acquire as they do not require expert knowledge. In this work, we propose a contrastive learning method, called $\textbf{Mask}$ed $\textbf{Con}$trastive learning~($\textbf{MaskCon}$) to address the under-explored problem setting, where we learn with a coarse-labelled dataset in order to address a finer labelling problem. More specifically, within the contrastive learning framework, for each sample our method generates soft-labels with the aid of coarse labels against other samples and another augmented view of the sample in question. By contrast to self-supervised contrastive learning where only the sample's augmentations are considered hard positives, and in supervised contrastive learning where only samples with the same coarse labels are considered hard positives, we propose soft labels based on sample distances, that are masked by the coarse labels. This allows us to utilize both inter-sample relations and coarse labels. We demonstrate that our method can obtain as special cases many existing state-of-the-art works and that it provides tighter bounds on the generalization error. Experimentally, our method achieves significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art in various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1K, Standford Online Products and Stanford Cars196 datasets.

- **Summary**: Object detection is one of the most important and fundamental aspects of computer vision tasks, which has been broadly utilized in pose estimation, object tracking and instance segmentation models. To obtain training data for object detection model efficiently, many datasets opt to obtain their unannotated data in video format and the annotator needs to draw a bounding box around each object in the images. Annotating every frame from a video is costly and inefficient since many frames contain very similar information for the model to learn from. How to select the most informative frames from a video to annotate has become a highly practical task to solve but attracted little attention in research. In this paper, we proposed a novel active learning algorithm for object detection models to tackle this problem. In the proposed active learning algorithm, both classification and localization informativeness of unlabelled data are measured and aggregated. Utilizing the temporal information from video frames, two novel localization informativeness measurements are proposed. Furthermore, a weight curve is proposed to avoid querying adjacent frames. Proposed active learning algorithm with multiple configurations was evaluated on the MuPoTS dataset and FootballPD dataset.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based 3D point cloud recognition has benefited various applications. Without specially considering the LiDAR point distribution, most current methods suffer from information disconnection and limited receptive field, especially for the sparse distant points. In this work, we study the varying-sparsity distribution of LiDAR points and present SphereFormer to directly aggregate information from dense close points to the sparse distant ones. We design radial window self-attention that partitions the space into multiple non-overlapping narrow and long windows. It overcomes the disconnection issue and enlarges the receptive field smoothly and dramatically, which significantly boosts the performance of sparse distant points. Moreover, to fit the narrow and long windows, we propose exponential splitting to yield fine-grained position encoding and dynamic feature selection to increase model representation ability. Notably, our method ranks 1st on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI semantic segmentation benchmarks with 81.9% and 74.8% mIoU, respectively. Also, we achieve the 3rd place on nuScenes object detection benchmark with 72.8% NDS and 68.5% mAP. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/SphereFormer.git.

- **Summary**: One-to-one label assignment in object detection has successfully obviated the need for non-maximum suppression (NMS) as postprocessing and makes the pipeline end-to-end. However, it triggers a new dilemma as the widely used sparse queries cannot guarantee a high recall, while dense queries inevitably bring more similar queries and encounter optimization difficulties. As both sparse and dense queries are problematic, then what are the expected queries in end-to-end object detection? This paper shows that the solution should be Dense Distinct Queries (DDQ). Concretely, we first lay dense queries like traditional detectors and then select distinct ones for one-to-one assignments. DDQ blends the advantages of traditional and recent end-to-end detectors and significantly improves the performance of various detectors including FCN, R-CNN, and DETRs. Most impressively, DDQ-DETR achieves 52.1 AP on MS-COCO dataset within 12 epochs using a ResNet-50 backbone, outperforming all existing detectors in the same setting. DDQ also shares the benefit of end-to-end detectors in crowded scenes and achieves 93.8 AP on CrowdHuman. We hope DDQ can inspire researchers to consider the complementarity between traditional methods and end-to-end detectors. The source code can be found at \url{https://github.com/jshilong/DDQ}.

- **Summary**: Finding localized correspondences across different images of the same object is crucial to understand its geometry. In recent years, this problem has seen remarkable progress with the advent of deep learning-based local image features and learnable matchers. Still, learnable matchers often underperform when there exists only small regions of co-visibility between image pairs (i.e. wide camera baselines). To address this problem, we leverage recent progress in coarse single-view geometry estimation methods. We propose LFM-3D, a Learnable Feature Matching framework that uses models based on graph neural networks and enhances their capabilities by integrating noisy, estimated 3D signals to boost correspondence estimation. When integrating 3D signals into the matcher model, we show that a suitable positional encoding is critical to effectively make use of the low-dimensional 3D information. We experiment with two different 3D signals - normalized object coordinates and monocular depth estimates - and evaluate our method on large-scale (synthetic and real) datasets containing object-centric image pairs across wide baselines. We observe strong feature matching improvements compared to 2D-only methods, with up to +6% total recall and +28% precision at fixed recall. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resulting improved correspondences lead to much higher relative posing accuracy for in-the-wild image pairs - up to 8.6% compared to the 2D-only approach.

- **Summary**: Video segmentation aims to segment and track every pixel in diverse scenarios accurately. In this paper, we present Tube-Link, a versatile framework that addresses multiple core tasks of video segmentation with a unified architecture. Our framework is a near-online approach that takes a short subclip as input and outputs the corresponding spatial-temporal tube masks. To enhance the modeling of cross-tube relationships, we propose an effective way to perform tube-level linking via attention along the queries. In addition, we introduce temporal contrastive learning to instance-wise discriminative features for tube-level association. Our approach offers flexibility and efficiency for both short and long video inputs, as the length of each subclip can be varied according to the needs of datasets or scenarios. Tube-Link outperforms existing specialized architectures by a significant margin on five video segmentation datasets. Specifically, it achieves almost 13% relative improvements on VIPSeg and 4% improvements on KITTI-STEP over the strong baseline Video K-Net. When using a ResNet50 backbone on Youtube-VIS-2019 and 2021, Tube-Link boosts IDOL by 3% and 4%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Recent works on generalizable NeRFs have shown promising results on novel view synthesis from single or few images. However, such models have rarely been applied on other downstream tasks beyond synthesis such as semantic understanding and parsing. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named FeatureNeRF to learn generalizable NeRFs by distilling pre-trained vision foundation models (e.g., DINO, Latent Diffusion). FeatureNeRF leverages 2D pre-trained foundation models to 3D space via neural rendering, and then extract deep features for 3D query points from NeRF MLPs. Consequently, it allows to map 2D images to continuous 3D semantic feature volumes, which can be used for various downstream tasks. We evaluate FeatureNeRF on tasks of 2D/3D semantic keypoint transfer and 2D/3D object part segmentation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FeatureNeRF as a generalizable 3D semantic feature extractor. Our project page is available at https://jianglongye.com/featurenerf/ .

- **Summary**: Locating 3D objects from a single RGB image via Perspective-n-Point (PnP) is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Driven by end-to-end deep learning, recent studies suggest interpreting PnP as a differentiable layer, allowing for partial learning of 2D-3D point correspondences by backpropagating the gradients of pose loss. Yet, learning the entire correspondences from scratch is highly challenging, particularly for ambiguous pose solutions, where the globally optimal pose is theoretically non-differentiable w.r.t. the points. In this paper, we propose the EPro-PnP, a probabilistic PnP layer for general end-to-end pose estimation, which outputs a distribution of pose with differentiable probability density on the SE(3) manifold. The 2D-3D coordinates and corresponding weights are treated as intermediate variables learned by minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and target pose distribution. The underlying principle generalizes previous approaches, and resembles the attention mechanism. EPro-PnP can enhance existing correspondence networks, closing the gap between PnP-based method and the task-specific leaders on the LineMOD 6DoF pose estimation benchmark. Furthermore, EPro-PnP helps to explore new possibilities of network design, as we demonstrate a novel deformable correspondence network with the state-of-the-art pose accuracy on the nuScenes 3D object detection benchmark.

- **Summary**: We propose a method for editing NeRF scenes with text-instructions. Given a NeRF of a scene and the collection of images used to reconstruct it, our method uses an image-conditioned diffusion model (InstructPix2Pix) to iteratively edit the input images while optimizing the underlying scene, resulting in an optimized 3D scene that respects the edit instruction. We demonstrate that our proposed method is able to edit large-scale, real-world scenes, and is able to accomplish more realistic, targeted edits than prior work.

- **Summary**: Crowd counting is a key aspect of crowd analysis and has been typically accomplished by estimating a crowd-density map and summing over the density values. However, this approach suffers from background noise accumulation and loss of density due to the use of broad Gaussian kernels to create the ground truth density maps. This issue can be overcome by narrowing the Gaussian kernel. However, existing approaches perform poorly when trained with such ground truth density maps. To overcome this limitation, we propose using conditional diffusion models to predict density maps, as diffusion models are known to model complex distributions well and show high fidelity to training data during crowd-density map generation. Furthermore, as the intermediate time steps of the diffusion process are noisy, we incorporate a regression branch for direct crowd estimation only during training to improve the feature learning. In addition, owing to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model, we introduce producing multiple density maps to improve the counting performance contrary to the existing crowd counting pipelines. Further, we also differ from the density summation and introduce contour detection followed by summation as the counting operation, which is more immune to background noise. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, our novel crowd-counting pipeline improves the error of crowd-counting by up to $6\%$ on JHU-CROWD++ and up to $7\%$ on UCF-QNRF.

- **Summary**: Existing Human NeRF methods for reconstructing 3D humans typically rely on multiple 2D images from multi-view cameras or monocular videos captured from fixed camera views. However, in real-world scenarios, human images are often captured from random camera angles, presenting challenges for high-quality 3D human reconstruction. In this paper, we propose SHERF, the first generalizable Human NeRF model for recovering animatable 3D humans from a single input image. SHERF extracts and encodes 3D human representations in canonical space, enabling rendering and animation from free views and poses. To achieve high-fidelity novel view and pose synthesis, the encoded 3D human representations should capture both global appearance and local fine-grained textures. To this end, we propose a bank of 3D-aware hierarchical features, including global, point-level, and pixel-aligned features, to facilitate informative encoding. Global features enhance the information extracted from the single input image and complement the information missing from the partial 2D observation. Point-level features provide strong clues of 3D human structure, while pixel-aligned features preserve more fine-grained details. To effectively integrate the 3D-aware hierarchical feature bank, we design a feature fusion transformer. Extensive experiments on THuman, RenderPeople, ZJU_MoCap, and HuMMan datasets demonstrate that SHERF achieves state-of-the-art performance, with better generalizability for novel view and pose synthesis.

- **Summary**: This work focuses on sign language retrieval-a recently proposed task for sign language understanding. Sign language retrieval consists of two sub-tasks: text-to-sign-video (T2V) retrieval and sign-video-to-text (V2T) retrieval. Different from traditional video-text retrieval, sign language videos, not only contain visual signals but also carry abundant semantic meanings by themselves due to the fact that sign languages are also natural languages. Considering this character, we formulate sign language retrieval as a cross-lingual retrieval problem as well as a video-text retrieval task. Concretely, we take into account the linguistic properties of both sign languages and natural languages, and simultaneously identify the fine-grained cross-lingual (i.e., sign-to-word) mappings while contrasting the texts and the sign videos in a joint embedding space. This process is termed as cross-lingual contrastive learning. Another challenge is raised by the data scarcity issue-sign language datasets are orders of magnitude smaller in scale than that of speech recognition. We alleviate this issue by adopting a domain-agnostic sign encoder pre-trained on large-scale sign videos into the target domain via pseudo-labeling. Our framework, termed as domain-aware sign language retrieval via Cross-lingual Contrastive learning or CiCo for short, outperforms the pioneering method by large margins on various datasets, e.g., +22.4 T2V and +28.0 V2T R@1 improvements on How2Sign dataset, and +13.7 T2V and +17.1 V2T R@1 improvements on PHOENIX-2014T dataset.

- **Summary**: Training-time defenses, known as adversarial training, incur high training costs and do not generalize to unseen attacks. Test-time defenses solve these issues but most existing test-time defenses require adapting the model weights, therefore they do not work on frozen models and complicate model memory management. The only test-time defense that does not adapt model weights aims to adapt the input with self-supervision tasks. However, we empirically found these self-supervision tasks are not sensitive enough to detect adversarial attacks accurately. In this paper, we propose DRAM, a novel defense method to detect and repair adversarial samples at test time via Masked autoencoder (MAE). We demonstrate how to use MAE losses to build a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to detect adversarial samples. Moreover, we use the MAE losses to calculate input reversal vectors that repair adversarial samples resulting from previously unseen attacks. Results on large-scale ImageNet dataset show that, compared to all detection baselines evaluated, DRAM achieves the best detection rate (82% on average) on all eight adversarial attacks evaluated. For attack repair, DRAM improves the robust accuracy by 6% ~ 41% for standard ResNet50 and 3% ~ 8% for robust ResNet50 compared with the baselines that use contrastive learning and rotation prediction.

- **Summary**: Document shadow removal is an integral task in document enhancement pipelines, as it improves visibility, readability and thus the overall quality. Assuming that the majority of practical document shadow removal scenarios require real-time, accurate models that can produce high-resolution outputs in-the-wild, we propose Laplacian Pyramid with Input/Output Attention Network (LP-IOANet), a novel pipeline with a lightweight architecture and an upsampling module. Furthermore, we propose three new datasets which cover a wide range of lighting conditions, images, shadow shapes and viewpoints. Our results show that we outperform the state-of-the-art by a 35% relative improvement in mean average error (MAE), while running real-time in four times the resolution (of the state-of-the-art method) on a mobile device.

- **Summary**: Pose-conditioned convolutional generative models struggle with high-quality 3D-consistent image generation from single-view datasets, due to their lack of sufficient 3D priors. Recently, the integration of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has transformed 3D-aware generation from single-view images. NeRF-GANs exploit the strong inductive bias of neural 3D representations and volumetric rendering at the cost of higher computational complexity. This study aims at revisiting pose-conditioned 2D GANs for efficient 3D-aware generation at inference time by distilling 3D knowledge from pretrained NeRF-GANs. We propose a simple and effective method, based on re-using the well-disentangled latent space of a pre-trained NeRF-GAN in a pose-conditioned convolutional network to directly generate 3D-consistent images corresponding to the underlying 3D representations. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains results comparable with volumetric rendering in terms of quality and 3D consistency while benefiting from the computational advantage of convolutional networks.

- **Summary**: Inertia Axes are involved in many techniques for image content measurement when involving information obtained from lines, angles, centroids... etc. We investigate, here, the estimation of the main axis of inertia of an object in the image. We identify the coincidence conditions of the Scale Space Radon Transform (SSRT) maximum and the inertia main axis. We show, that by choosing the appropriate scale parameter, it is possible to match the SSRT maximum and the main axis of inertia location and orientation of the embedded object in the image. Furthermore, an example of use case is presented where binary objects central symmetry computation is derived by means of SSRT projections and the axis of inertia orientation. To this end, some SSRT characteristics have been highlighted and exploited. The experimentations show the SSRT-based main axis of inertia computation effectiveness. Concerning the central symmetry, results are very satisfying as experimentations carried out on randomly created images dataset and existing datasets have permitted to divide successfully these images bases into centrally symmetric and non-centrally symmetric objects.

- **Summary**: Surgical scene understanding is a key prerequisite for contextaware decision support in the operating room. While deep learning-based approaches have already reached or even surpassed human performance in various fields, the task of surgical action recognition remains a major challenge. With this contribution, we are the first to investigate the concept of self-distillation as a means of addressing class imbalance and potential label ambiguity in surgical video analysis. Our proposed method is a heterogeneous ensemble of three models that use Swin Transfomers as backbone and the concepts of self-distillation and multi-task learning as core design choices. According to ablation studies performed with the CholecT45 challenge data via cross-validation, the biggest performance boost is achieved by the usage of soft labels obtained by self-distillation. External validation of our method on an independent test set was achieved by providing a Docker container of our inference model to the challenge organizers. According to their analysis, our method outperforms all other solutions submitted to the latest challenge in the field. Our approach thus shows the potential of self-distillation for becoming an important tool in medical image analysis applications.

- **Summary**: Stereo vision is essential for many applications. Currently, the synchronization of the streams coming from two cameras is done using mostly hardware. A software-based synchronization method would reduce the cost, weight and size of the entire system and allow for more flexibility when building such systems. With this goal in mind, we present here a comparison of different deep learning-based systems and prove that some are efficient and generalizable enough for such a task. This study paves the way to a production ready software-based video synchronization system.

- **Summary**: Existing audio-visual event localization (AVE) handles manually trimmed videos with only a single instance in each of them. However, this setting is unrealistic as natural videos often contain numerous audio-visual events with different categories. To better adapt to real-life applications, in this paper we focus on the task of dense-localizing audio-visual events, which aims to jointly localize and recognize all audio-visual events occurring in an untrimmed video. The problem is challenging as it requires fine-grained audio-visual scene and context understanding. To tackle this problem, we introduce the first Untrimmed Audio-Visual (UnAV-100) dataset, which contains 10K untrimmed videos with over 30K audio-visual events. Each video has 2.8 audio-visual events on average, and the events are usually related to each other and might co-occur as in real-life scenes. Next, we formulate the task using a new learning-based framework, which is capable of fully integrating audio and visual modalities to localize audio-visual events with various lengths and capture dependencies between them in a single pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as well as the significance of multi-scale cross-modal perception and dependency modeling for this task.

- **Summary**: Smart Video surveillance systems have become important recently for ensuring public safety and security, especially in smart cities. However, applying real-time artificial intelligence technologies combined with low-latency notification and alarming has made deploying these systems quite challenging. This paper presents a case study for designing and deploying smart video surveillance systems based on a real-world testbed at a community college. We primarily focus on a smart camera-based system that can identify suspicious/abnormal activities and alert the stakeholders and residents immediately. The paper highlights and addresses different algorithmic and system design challenges to guarantee real-time high-accuracy video analytics processing in the testbed. It also presents an example of cloud system infrastructure and a mobile application for real-time notification to keep students, faculty/staff, and responsible security personnel in the loop. At the same time, it covers the design decision to maintain communities' privacy and ethical requirements as well as hardware configuration and setups. We evaluate the system's performance using throughput and end-to-end latency. The experiment results show that, on average, our system's end-to-end latency to notify the end users in case of detecting suspicious objects is 5.3, 5.78, and 11.11 seconds when running 1, 4, and 8 cameras, respectively. On the other hand, in case of detecting anomalous behaviors, the system could notify the end users with 7.3, 7.63, and 20.78 seconds average latency. These results demonstrate that the system effectively detects and notifies abnormal behaviors and suspicious objects to the end users within a reasonable period. The system can run eight cameras simultaneously at a 32.41 Frame Per Second (FPS) rate.

- **Summary**: Recent portrait relighting methods have achieved realistic results of portrait lighting effects given a desired lighting representation such as an environment map. However, these methods are not intuitive for user interaction and lack precise lighting control. We introduce LightPainter, a scribble-based relighting system that allows users to interactively manipulate portrait lighting effect with ease. This is achieved by two conditional neural networks, a delighting module that recovers geometry and albedo optionally conditioned on skin tone, and a scribble-based module for relighting. To train the relighting module, we propose a novel scribble simulation procedure to mimic real user scribbles, which allows our pipeline to be trained without any human annotations. We demonstrate high-quality and flexible portrait lighting editing capability with both quantitative and qualitative experiments. User study comparisons with commercial lighting editing tools also demonstrate consistent user preference for our method.

- **Summary**: Confidence-based pseudo-labeling is among the dominant approaches in semi-supervised learning (SSL). It relies on including high-confidence predictions made on unlabeled data as additional targets to train the model. We propose ProtoCon, a novel SSL method aimed at the less-explored label-scarce SSL where such methods usually underperform. ProtoCon refines the pseudo-labels by leveraging their nearest neighbours' information. The neighbours are identified as the training proceeds using an online clustering approach operating in an embedding space trained via a prototypical loss to encourage well-formed clusters. The online nature of ProtoCon allows it to utilise the label history of the entire dataset in one training cycle to refine labels in the following cycle without the need to store image embeddings. Hence, it can seamlessly scale to larger datasets at a low cost. Finally, ProtoCon addresses the poor training signal in the initial phase of training (due to fewer confident predictions) by introducing an auxiliary self-supervised loss. It delivers significant gains and faster convergence over state-of-the-art across 5 datasets, including CIFARs, ImageNet and DomainNet.

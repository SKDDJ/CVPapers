- **Summary**: Real-world applications with multiple sensors observing an event are expected to make continuously-available predictions, even in cases where information may be intermittently missing. We explore methods in ensemble learning and sensor fusion to make use of redundancy and information shared between four camera views, applied to the task of hand activity classification for autonomous driving. In particular, we show that a late-fusion approach between parallel convolutional neural networks can outperform even the best-placed single camera model. To enable this approach, we propose a scheme for handling missing information, and then provide comparative analysis of this late-fusion approach to additional methods such as weighted majority voting and model combination schemes.

- **Summary**: The cost of vision-and-language pre-training has become increasingly prohibitive due to end-to-end training of large-scale models. This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.

- **Summary**: Spatial audio, which focuses on immersive 3D sound rendering, is widely applied in the acoustic industry. One of the key problems of current spatial audio rendering methods is the lack of personalization based on different anatomies of individuals, which is essential to produce accurate sound source positions. In this work, we address this problem from an interdisciplinary perspective. The rendering of spatial audio is strongly correlated with the 3D shape of human bodies, particularly ears. To this end, we propose to achieve personalized spatial audio by reconstructing 3D human ears with single-view images. First, to benchmark the ear reconstruction task, we introduce AudioEar3D, a high-quality 3D ear dataset consisting of 112 point cloud ear scans with RGB images. To self-supervisedly train a reconstruction model, we further collect a 2D ear dataset composed of 2,000 images, each one with manual annotation of occlusion and 55 landmarks, named AudioEar2D. To our knowledge, both datasets have the largest scale and best quality of their kinds for public use. Further, we propose AudioEarM, a reconstruction method guided by a depth estimation network that is trained on synthetic data, with two loss functions tailored for ear data. Lastly, to fill the gap between the vision and acoustics community, we develop a pipeline to integrate the reconstructed ear mesh with an off-the-shelf 3D human body and simulate a personalized Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF), which is the core of spatial audio rendering. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/seanywang0408/AudioEar.

- **Summary**: Household robots operate in the same space for years. Such robots incrementally build dynamic maps that can be used for tasks requiring remote object localization. However, benchmarks in robot learning often test generalization through inference on tasks in unobserved environments. In an observed environment, locating an object is reduced to choosing from among all object proposals in the environment, which may number in the 100,000s. Armed with this intuition, using only a generic vision-language scoring model with minor modifications for 3d encoding and operating in an embodied environment, we demonstrate an absolute performance gain of 9.84% on remote object grounding above state of the art models for REVERIE and of 5.04% on FAO. When allowed to pre-explore an environment, we also exceed the previous state of the art pre-exploration method on REVERIE. Additionally, we demonstrate our model on a real-world TurtleBot platform, highlighting the simplicity and usefulness of the approach. Our analysis outlines a "bag of tricks" essential for accomplishing this task, from utilizing 3d coordinates and context, to generalizing vision-language models to large 3d search spaces.

- **Summary**: Image augmentations are quintessential for effective visual representation learning across self-supervised learning techniques. While augmentation strategies for natural imaging have been studied extensively, medical images are vastly different from their natural counterparts. Thus, it is unknown whether common augmentation strategies employed in Siamese representation learning generalize to medical images and to what extent. To address this challenge, in this study, we systematically assess the effect of various augmentations on the quality and robustness of the learned representations. We train and evaluate Siamese Networks for abnormality detection on chest X-Rays across three large datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert and VinDR-CXR). We investigate the efficacy of the learned representations through experiments involving linear probing, fine-tuning, zero-shot transfer, and data efficiency. Finally, we identify a set of augmentations that yield robust representations that generalize well to both out-of-distribution data and diseases, while outperforming supervised baselines using just zero-shot transfer and linear probes by up to 20%.

- **Summary**: The majority of computer vision algorithms fail to find higher-order (abstract) patterns in an image so are not robust against adversarial attacks, unlike human lateralized vision. Deep learning considers each input pixel in a homogeneous manner such that different parts of a ``locality-sensitive hashing table'' are often not connected, meaning higher-order patterns are not discovered. Hence these systems are not robust against noisy, irrelevant, and redundant data, resulting in the wrong prediction being made with high confidence. Conversely, vertebrate brains afford heterogeneous knowledge representation through lateralization, enabling modular learning at different levels of abstraction. This work aims to verify the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of a lateralized approach to real-world problems that contain noisy, irrelevant, and redundant data. The experimental results of multi-class (200 classes) image classification show that the novel system effectively learns knowledge representation at multiple levels of abstraction making it more robust than other state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, the novel lateralized system outperformed all the state-of-the-art deep learning-based systems for the classification of normal and adversarial images by 19.05% - 41.02% and 1.36% - 49.22%, respectively. Findings demonstrate the value of heterogeneous and lateralized learning for computer vision applications.

- **Summary**: It is well-known that the performance of well-trained deep neural networks may degrade significantly when they are applied to data with even slightly shifted distributions. Recent studies have shown that introducing certain perturbation on feature statistics (\eg, mean and standard deviation) during training can enhance the cross-domain generalization ability. Existing methods typically conduct such perturbation by utilizing the feature statistics within a mini-batch, limiting their representation capability. Inspired by the domain generalization objective, we introduce a novel Adversarial Style Augmentation (ASA) method, which explores broader style spaces by generating more effective statistics perturbation via adversarial training. Specifically, we first search for the most sensitive direction and intensity for statistics perturbation by maximizing the task loss. By updating the model against the adversarial statistics perturbation during training, we allow the model to explore the worst-case domain and hence improve its generalization performance. To facilitate the application of ASA, we design a simple yet effective module, namely AdvStyle, which instantiates the ASA method in a plug-and-play manner. We justify the efficacy of AdvStyle on tasks of cross-domain classification and instance retrieval. It achieves higher mean accuracy and lower performance fluctuation. Especially, our method significantly outperforms its competitors on the PACS dataset under the single source generalization setting, \eg, boosting the classification accuracy from 61.2\% to 67.1\% with a ResNet50 backbone. Our code will be available at \url{https://github.com/YBZh/AdvStyle}.

- **Summary**: Vision-language alignment learning for video-text retrieval arouses a lot of attention in recent years. Most of the existing methods either transfer the knowledge of image-text pretraining model to video-text retrieval task without fully exploring the multi-modal information of videos, or simply fuse multi-modal features in a brute force manner without explicit guidance. In this paper, we integrate multi-modal information in an explicit manner by tagging, and use the tags as the anchors for better video-text alignment. Various pretrained experts are utilized for extracting the information of multiple modalities, including object, person, motion, audio, etc. To take full advantage of these information, we propose the TABLE (TAgging Before aLignmEnt) network, which consists of a visual encoder, a tag encoder, a text encoder, and a tag-guiding cross-modal encoder for jointly encoding multi-frame visual features and multi-modal tags information. Furthermore, to strengthen the interaction between video and text, we build a joint cross-modal encoder with the triplet input of [vision, tag, text] and perform two additional supervised tasks, Video Text Matching (VTM) and Masked Language Modeling (MLM). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the TABLE model is capable of achieving State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance on various video-text retrieval benchmarks, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC and DiDeMo.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models such as CNNs have surpassed human performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification. However, despite their sophistication, these models lack interpretability which can lead to biased outcomes reflecting existing prejudices in the data. We aim to make predictions made by a CNN interpretable. Hence, we present a novel framework called NeSyFOLD to create a neurosymbolic (NeSy) model for image classification tasks. The model is a CNN with all layers following the last convolutional layer replaced by a stratified answer set program (ASP). A rule-based machine learning algorithm called FOLD-SE-M is used to derive the stratified answer set program from binarized filter activations of the last convolutional layer. The answer set program can be viewed as a rule-set, wherein the truth value of each predicate depends on the activation of the corresponding kernel in the CNN. The rule-set serves as a global explanation for the model and is interpretable. A justification for the predictions made by the NeSy model can be obtained using an ASP interpreter. We also use our NeSyFOLD framework with a CNN that is trained using a sparse kernel learning technique called Elite BackProp (EBP). This leads to a significant reduction in rule-set size without compromising accuracy or fidelity thus improving scalability of the NeSy model and interpretability of its rule-set. Evaluation is done on datasets with varied complexity and sizes. To make the rule-set more intuitive to understand, we propose a novel algorithm for labelling each kernel's corresponding predicate in the rule-set with the semantic concept(s) it learns. We evaluate the performance of our "semantic labelling algorithm" to quantify the efficacy of the semantic labelling for both the NeSy model and the NeSy-EBP model.

- **Summary**: In this work, we have presented a way to increase the contrast of an image. Our target is to find a transformation that will be image specific. We have used a fuzzy system as our transformation function. To tune the system according to an image, we have used Genetic Algorithm and Hill Climbing in multiple ways to evolve the fuzzy system and conducted several experiments. Different variants of the method are tested on several images and two variants that are superior to others in terms of fitness are selected. We have also conducted a survey to assess the visual improvement of the enhancements made by the two variants. The survey indicates that one of the methods can enhance the contrast of the images visually.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained diffusion models have been successfully used as priors in a variety of linear inverse problems, where the goal is to reconstruct a signal from noisy linear measurements. However, existing approaches require knowledge of the linear operator. In this paper, we propose GibbsDDRM, an extension of Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) to a blind setting in which the linear measurement operator is unknown. GibbsDDRM constructs a joint distribution of the data, measurements, and linear operator by using a pre-trained diffusion model for the data prior, and it solves the problem by posterior sampling with an efficient variant of a Gibbs sampler. The proposed method is problem-agnostic, meaning that a pre-trained diffusion model can be applied to various inverse problems without fine-tuning. In experiments, it achieved high performance on both blind image deblurring and vocal dereverberation tasks, despite the use of simple generic priors for the underlying linear operators.

- **Summary**: Amateurs working on mini-films and short-form videos usually spend lots of time and effort on the multi-round complicated process of setting and adjusting scenes, plots, and cameras to deliver satisfying video shots. We present Virtual Dynamic Storyboard (VDS) to allow users storyboarding shots in virtual environments, where the filming staff can easily test the settings of shots before the actual filming. VDS runs on a "propose-simulate-discriminate" mode: Given a formatted story script and a camera script as input, it generates several character animation and camera movement proposals following predefined story and cinematic rules to allow an off-the-shelf simulation engine to render videos. To pick up the top-quality dynamic storyboard from the candidates, we equip it with a shot ranking discriminator based on shot quality criteria learned from professional manual-created data. VDS is comprehensively validated via extensive experiments and user studies, demonstrating its efficiency, effectiveness, and great potential in assisting amateur video production.

- **Summary**: The insufficient number of annotated thermal infrared (TIR) image datasets not only hinders TIR image-based deep learning networks to have comparable performances to that of RGB but it also limits the supervised learning of TIR image-based tasks with challenging labels. As a remedy, we propose a modified multidomain RGB to TIR image translation model focused on edge preservation to employ annotated RGB images with challenging labels. Our proposed method not only preserves key details in the original image but also leverages the optimal TIR style code to portray accurate TIR characteristics in the translated image, when applied on both synthetic and real world RGB images. Using our translation model, we have enabled the supervised learning of deep TIR image-based optical flow estimation and object detection that ameliorated in deep TIR optical flow estimation by reduction in end point error by 56.5\% on average and the best object detection mAP of 23.9\% respectively. Our code and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/rpmsnu/sRGB-TIR.

- **Summary**: A machine learning model that generalizes well should obtain low errors on unseen test examples. Thus, if we learn an optimal model in training data, it could have better generalization performance in testing tasks. However, learning such a model is not possible in standard machine learning frameworks as the distribution of the test data is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel robust meta-learning method, which is more robust to the image-based testing tasks which is unknown and has distribution shifts with training tasks. Our robust meta-learning method can provide robust optimal models even when data from each distribution are scarce. In experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm not only has better generalization performance but also robust to different unknown testing tasks.

- **Summary**: Although industrial anomaly detection (AD) technology has made significant progress in recent years, generating realistic anomalies and learning priors of normal remain challenging tasks. In this study, we propose an end-to-end industrial anomaly detection method called FractalAD. Training samples are obtained by synthesizing fractal images and patches from normal samples. This fractal anomaly generation method is designed to sample the full morphology of anomalies. Moreover, we designed a backbone knowledge distillation structure to extract prior knowledge contained in normal samples. The differences between a teacher and a student model are converted into anomaly attention using a cosine similarity attention module. The proposed method enables an end-to-end semantic segmentation network to be used for anomaly detection without adding any trainable parameters to the backbone and segmentation head, and has obvious advantages over other methods in training and inference speed.. The results of ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of fractal anomaly generation and backbone knowledge distillation. The results of performance experiments showed that FractalAD achieved competitive results on the MVTec AD dataset and MVTec 3D-AD dataset compared with other state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning is attracting wide attention in point cloud processing. However, it is still not well-solved to gain discriminative and transferable features of point clouds for efficient training on downstream tasks, due to their natural sparsity and irregularity. We propose PointSmile, a reconstruction-free self-supervised learning paradigm by maximizing curriculum mutual information (CMI) across the replicas of point cloud objects. From the perspective of how-and-what-to-learn, PointSmile is designed to imitate human curriculum learning, i.e., starting with an easy curriculum and gradually increasing the difficulty of that curriculum. To solve "how-to-learn", we introduce curriculum data augmentation (CDA) of point clouds. CDA encourages PointSmile to learn from easy samples to hard ones, such that the latent space can be dynamically affected to create better embeddings. To solve "what-to-learn", we propose to maximize both feature- and class-wise CMI, for better extracting discriminative features of point clouds. Unlike most of existing methods, PointSmile does not require a pretext task, nor does it require cross-modal data to yield rich latent representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PointSmile in downstream tasks including object classification and segmentation. Extensive results show that our PointSmile outperforms existing self-supervised methods, and compares favorably with popular fully-supervised methods on various standard architectures.

- **Summary**: Dense real-time tracking and mapping from RGB-D images is an important tool for many robotic applications, such as navigation and manipulation. The recently presented Directional Truncated Signed Distance Function (DTSDF) is an augmentation of the regular TSDF that shows potential for more coherent maps and improved tracking performance. In this work, we present methods for rendering depth- and color images from the DTSDF, making it a true drop-in replacement for the regular TSDF in established trackers. We evaluate the algorithm on well-established datasets and observe that our method improves tracking performance and increases re-usability of mapped scenes. Furthermore, we add color integration which notably improves color-correctness at adjacent surfaces. Our novel formulation of combined ICP with frame-to-keyframe photometric error minimization further improves tracking results. Lastly, we introduce Sim3 point-to-plane ICP for refining pose priors in a multi-sensor scenario with different scale factors.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL), as an effective decentralized distributed learning approach, enables multiple institutions to jointly train a model without sharing their local data. However, the domain feature shift caused by different acquisition devices/clients substantially degrades the performance of the FL model. Furthermore, most existing FL approaches aim to improve accuracy without considering reliability (e.g., confidence or uncertainty). The predictions are thus unreliable when deployed in safety-critical applications. Therefore, aiming at improving the performance of FL in non-Domain feature issues while enabling the model more reliable. In this paper, we propose a novel trusted federated disentangling network, termed TrFedDis, which utilizes feature disentangling to enable the ability to capture the global domain-invariant cross-client representation and preserve local client-specific feature learning. Meanwhile, to effectively integrate the decoupled features, an uncertainty-aware decision fusion is also introduced to guide the network for dynamically integrating the decoupled features at the evidence level, while producing a reliable prediction with an estimated uncertainty. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed TrFedDis is the first work to develop an FL approach based on evidential uncertainty combined with feature disentangling, which enhances the performance and reliability of FL in non-IID domain features. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed TrFedDis provides outstanding performance with a high degree of reliability as compared to other state-of-the-art FL approaches.

- **Summary**: The current research work has developed two novel algorithms for image-based measurement of Percentage Closure of Eyes-PERCLOS and Saccadic Ratio-SR. The PERCLOS is estimated by correlation filter-based technique. An innovative combination of gray scale and Near Infrared sensitive camera with passive NIR illuminator helps to achieve higher accuracy than the existing art. Two novel techniques have been developed for the detection of iris centre and eye corners. We propose an index called Form Factor to find the iris position. The saccadic velocity profile can be estimated from the temporal information of the iris positions using standard tracking algorithm such as Extended Kalman filter. Experimental results indicate that the estimation of both SR and PERCLOS can predict the level of alertness of an operator from onset of diminished alertness to fatigue.

- **Summary**: In this paper we extensively explore the suitability of YOLO architectures to monitor the process flow across a Fischertechnik industry 4.0 application. Specifically, different YOLO architectures in terms of size and complexity design along with different prior-shapes assignment strategies are adopted. To simulate the real world factory environment, we prepared a rich dataset augmented with different distortions that highly enhance and in some cases degrade our image qualities. The degradation is performed to account for environmental variations and enhancements opt to compensate the color correlations that we face while preparing our dataset. The analysis of our conducted experiments shows the effectiveness of the presented approach evaluated using different measures along with the training and validation strategies that we tailored to tackle the unavoidable color correlations that the problem at hand inherits by nature.

- **Summary**: Face presentation attacks (FPA), also known as face spoofing, have brought increasing concerns to the public through various malicious applications, such as financial fraud and privacy leakage. Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to overcome the issues above. The innovation of this work mainly lies in the following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and auditory modalities using three pervasively available sensors: camera, speaker, and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion; (3). We propose a multi-head training strategy. The model outputs three predictions from the vision, acoustic, and fusion heads, enabling a more flexible PAD. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the accuracy, robustness, and flexibility of M3FAS under various challenging experimental settings.

- **Summary**: Deep networks have demonstrated promising results in the field of Image Quality Assessment (IQA). However, there has been limited research on understanding how deep models in IQA work. This study introduces a novel positional masked transformer for IQA and provides insights into the contribution of different regions of an image towards its overall quality. Results indicate that half of an image may play a trivial role in determining image quality, while the other half is critical. This observation is extended to several other CNN-based IQA models, revealing that half of the image regions can significantly impact the overall image quality. To further enhance our understanding, three semantic measures (saliency, frequency, and objectness) were derived and found to have high correlation with the importance of image regions in IQA.

- **Summary**: Structural pruning enables model acceleration by removing structurally-grouped parameters from neural networks. However, the parameter-grouping patterns vary widely across different models, making architecture-specific pruners, which rely on manually-designed grouping schemes, non-generalizable to new architectures. In this work, we study a highly-challenging yet barely-explored task, any structural pruning, to tackle general structural pruning of arbitrary architecture like CNNs, RNNs, GNNs and Transformers. The most prominent obstacle towards this goal lies in the structural coupling, which not only forces different layers to be pruned simultaneously, but also expects all removed parameters to be consistently unimportant, thereby avoiding structural issues and significant performance degradation after pruning. To address this problem, we propose a general and {fully automatic} method, \emph{Dependency Graph} (DepGraph), to explicitly model the dependency between layers and comprehensively group coupled parameters for pruning. In this work, we extensively evaluate our method on several architectures and tasks, including ResNe(X)t, DenseNet, MobileNet and Vision transformer for images, GAT for graph, DGCNN for 3D point cloud, alongside LSTM for language, and demonstrate that, even with a simple norm-based criterion, the proposed method consistently yields gratifying performances.

- **Summary**: Many deep learning tasks require annotations that are too time consuming for human operators, resulting in small dataset sizes. This is especially true for dense regression problems such as crowd counting which requires the location of every person in the image to be annotated. Techniques such as data augmentation and synthetic data generation based on simulations can help in such cases. In this paper, we introduce PromptMix, a method for artificially boosting the size of existing datasets, that can be used to improve the performance of lightweight networks. First, synthetic images are generated in an end-to-end data-driven manner, where text prompts are extracted from existing datasets via an image captioning deep network, and subsequently introduced to text-to-image diffusion models. The generated images are then annotated using one or more high-performing deep networks, and mixed with the real dataset for training the lightweight network. By extensive experiments on five datasets and two tasks, we show that PromptMix can significantly increase the performance of lightweight networks by up to 26%.

- **Summary**: Though denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable generation results, the low sampling efficiency of DDPMs still limits further applications. Since DDPMs can be formulated as diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs), various fast sampling methods can be derived from solving diffusion ODEs. However, we notice that previous sampling methods with fixed analytical form are not robust with the error in the noise estimated from pretrained diffusion models. In this work, we construct an error-robust Adams solver (ERA-Solver), which utilizes the implicit Adams numerical method that consists of a predictor and a corrector. Different from the traditional predictor based on explicit Adams methods, we leverage a Lagrange interpolation function as the predictor, which is further enhanced with an error-robust strategy to adaptively select the Lagrange bases with lower error in the estimated noise. Experiments on Cifar10, LSUN-Church, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets demonstrate that our proposed ERA-Solver achieves 5.14, 9.42, and 9.69 Fenchel Inception Distance (FID) for image generation, with only 10 network evaluations.

- **Summary**: Soiling is the accumulation of dirt in solar panels which leads to a decreasing trend in solar energy yield and may be the cause of vast revenue losses. The effect of soiling can be reduced by washing the panels, which is, however, a procedure of non-negligible cost. Moreover, soiling monitoring systems are often unreliable or very costly. We study the problem of estimating the soiling ratio in photo-voltaic (PV) modules, i.e., the ratio of the real power output to the power output that would be produced if solar panels were clean. A key advantage of our algorithms is that they estimate soiling, without needing to train on labelled data, i.e., periods of explicitly monitoring the soiling in each park, and without relying on generic analytical formulas which do not take into account the peculiarities of each installation. We consider as input a time series comprising a minimum set of measurements, that are available to most PV park operators. Our experimental evaluation shows that we significantly outperform current state-of-the-art methods for estimating soiling ratio.

- **Summary**: The reliability of the results of self monitoring of the vitals in the wild using medical devices or wearables or camera based smart phone solutions is subject to variabilities such as position of placement, hardware of the device and environmental factors. In this first of its kind study, we demonstrate that this variability in self monitoring of Blood Pressure (BP), Blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2) and Heart rate (HR) is statistically significant (p<0.05) on 203 healthy subjects by quantifying positional and hardware variability. We also establish the existence of this variability in camera based solutions for self-monitoring of vitals in smart phones and thus prove that the use of camera based smart phone solutions is similar to the use of medical devices or wearables for self-monitoring in the wild.

- **Summary**: Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is the preferred modality for capturing real-time and high resolution cross-sectional images of the coronary arteries, and evaluating the stenosis. Accurate and real-time segmentation of IVUS images involves the delineation of lumen and external elastic membrane borders. In this paper, we propose a two-stream framework for efficient segmentation of 60 MHz high resolution IVUS images. It combines shallow and deep networks, namely, CSDN. The shallow network with thick channels focuses to extract low-level details. The deep network with thin channels takes charge of learning high-level semantics. Treating the above information separately enables learning a model to achieve high accuracy and high efficiency for accurate real-time segmentation. To further improve the segmentation performance, mutual guided fusion module is used to enhance and fuse both different types of feature representation. The experimental results show that our CSDN accomplishes a good trade-off between analysis speed and segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing high-fidelity complex images from text is challenging. Based on large pretraining, the autoregressive and diffusion models can synthesize photo-realistic images. Although these large models have shown notable progress, there remain three flaws. 1) These models require tremendous training data and parameters to achieve good performance. 2) The multi-step generation design slows the image synthesis process heavily. 3) The synthesized visual features are difficult to control and require delicately designed prompts. To enable high-quality, efficient, fast, and controllable text-to-image synthesis, we propose Generative Adversarial CLIPs, namely GALIP. GALIP leverages the powerful pretrained CLIP model both in the discriminator and generator. Specifically, we propose a CLIP-based discriminator. The complex scene understanding ability of CLIP enables the discriminator to accurately assess the image quality. Furthermore, we propose a CLIP-empowered generator that induces the visual concepts from CLIP through bridge features and prompts. The CLIP-integrated generator and discriminator boost training efficiency, and as a result, our model only requires about 3% training data and 6% learnable parameters, achieving comparable results to large pretrained autoregressive and diffusion models. Moreover, our model achieves 120 times faster synthesis speed and inherits the smooth latent space from GAN. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our GALIP.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes EyeNet, a novel semantic segmentation network for point clouds that addresses the critical yet often overlooked parameter of coverage area size. Inspired by human peripheral vision, EyeNet overcomes the limitations of conventional networks by introducing a simple but efficient multi-contour input and a parallel processing network with connection blocks between parallel streams. The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of dense point clouds, as demonstrated by our ablation studies and state-of-the-art performance on Large-Scale Outdoor datasets.

- **Summary**: Automated content filtering and moderation is an important tool that allows online platforms to build striving user communities that facilitate cooperation and prevent abuse. Unfortunately, resourceful actors try to bypass automated filters in a bid to post content that violate platform policies and codes of conduct. To reach this goal, these malicious actors may obfuscate policy violating images (e.g. overlay harmful images by carefully selected benign images or visual patterns) to prevent machine learning models from reaching the correct decision. In this paper, we invite researchers to tackle this specific issue and present a new image benchmark. This benchmark, based on ImageNet, simulates the type of obfuscations created by malicious actors. It goes beyond ImageNet-$\textrm{C}$ and ImageNet-$\bar{\textrm{C}}$ by proposing general, drastic, adversarial modifications that preserve the original content intent. It aims to tackle a more common adversarial threat than the one considered by $\ell_p$-norm bounded adversaries. We evaluate 33 pretrained models on the benchmark and train models with different augmentations, architectures and training methods on subsets of the obfuscations to measure generalization. We hope this benchmark will encourage researchers to test their models and methods and try to find new approaches that are more robust to these obfuscations.

- **Summary**: Federated learning is a distributed paradigm that allows multiple parties to collaboratively train deep models without exchanging the raw data. However, the data distribution among clients is naturally non-i.i.d., which leads to severe degradation of the learnt model. The primary goal of this paper is to develop a robust federated learning algorithm to address feature shift in clients' samples, which can be caused by various factors, e.g., acquisition differences in medical imaging. To reach this goal, we propose FedFA to tackle federated learning from a distinct perspective of federated feature augmentation. FedFA is based on a major insight that each client's data distribution can be characterized by statistics (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of latent features; and it is likely to manipulate these local statistics globally, i.e., based on information in the entire federation, to let clients have a better sense of the underlying distribution and therefore alleviate local data bias. Based on this insight, we propose to augment each local feature statistic probabilistically based on a normal distribution, whose mean is the original statistic and variance quantifies the augmentation scope. Key to our approach is the determination of a meaningful Gaussian variance, which is accomplished by taking into account not only biased data of each individual client, but also underlying feature statistics characterized by all participating clients. We offer both theoretical and empirical justifications to verify the effectiveness of FedFA. Our code is available at https://github.com/tfzhou/FedFA.

- **Summary**: Fully test-time adaptation aims at adapting a pre-trained model to the test stream during real-time inference, which is urgently required when the test distribution differs from the training distribution. Several efforts have been devoted to improving adaptation performance. However, we find that two unfavorable defects are concealed in the prevalent adaptation methodologies like test-time batch normalization (BN) and self-learning. First, we reveal that the normalization statistics in test-time BN are completely affected by the currently received test samples, resulting in inaccurate estimates. Second, we show that during test-time adaptation, the parameter update is biased towards some dominant classes. In addition to the extensively studied test stream with independent and class-balanced samples, we further observe that the defects can be exacerbated in more complicated test environments, such as (time) dependent or class-imbalanced data. We observe that previous approaches work well in certain scenarios while show performance degradation in others due to their faults. In this paper, we provide a plug-in solution called DELTA for Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation, which consists of two components: (i) Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR), introduced to improve the estimated normalization statistics. (ii) Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT), designed to address the class bias within optimization. We investigate various test-time adaptation methods on three commonly used datasets with four scenarios, and a newly introduced real-world dataset. DELTA can help them deal with all scenarios simultaneously, leading to SOTA performance.

- **Summary**: Image and text retrieval is one of the foundational tasks in the vision and language domain with multiple real-world applications. State-of-the-art approaches, e.g. CLIP, ALIGN, represent images and texts as dense embeddings and calculate the similarity in the dense embedding space as the matching score. On the other hand, sparse semantic features like bag-of-words models are more interpretable, but believed to suffer from inferior accuracy than dense representations. In this work, we show that it is possible to build a sparse semantic representation that is as powerful as, or even better than, dense presentations. We extend the CLIP model and build a sparse text and image representation (STAIR), where the image and text are mapped to a sparse token space. Each token in the space is a (sub-)word in the vocabulary, which is not only interpretable but also easy to integrate with existing information retrieval systems. STAIR model significantly outperforms a CLIP model with +$4.9\%$ and +$4.3\%$ absolute Recall@1 improvement on COCO-5k text$\rightarrow$image and image$\rightarrow$text retrieval respectively. It also achieved better performance on both of ImageNet zero-shot and linear probing compared to CLIP.

- **Summary**: AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has recently gained a surge in popularity, powered by its high efficiency and consistency in production, and its capability of being customized and diversified. The cross-modality nature of the representation learning mechanism in most AIGC technology allows for more freedom and flexibility in exploring new types of art that would be impossible in the past. Inspired by the pictogram subset of Chinese characters, we proposed PaCaNet, a CycleGAN-based pipeline for producing novel artworks that fuse two different art types, traditional Chinese painting and calligraphy. In an effort to produce stable and diversified output, we adopted three main technical innovations: 1. Using one-shot learning to increase the creativity of pre-trained models and diversify the content of the fused images. 2. Controlling the preference over generated Chinese calligraphy by freezing randomly sampled parameters in pre-trained models. 3. Using a regularization method to encourage the models to produce images similar to Chinese paintings. Furthermore, we conducted a systematic study to explore the performance of PaCaNet in diversifying fused Chinese painting and calligraphy, which showed satisfying results. In conclusion, we provide a new direction of creating arts by fusing the visual information in paintings and the stroke features in Chinese calligraphy. Our approach creates a unique aesthetic experience rooted in the origination of Chinese hieroglyph characters. It is also a unique opportunity to delve deeper into traditional artwork and, in doing so, to create a meaningful impact on preserving and revitalizing traditional heritage.

- **Summary**: Due to the compact and rich high-level representations offered, skeleton-based human action recognition has recently become a highly active research topic. Previous studies have demonstrated that investigating joint relationships in spatial and temporal dimensions provides effective information critical to action recognition. However, effectively encoding global dependencies of joints during spatio-temporal feature extraction is still challenging. In this paper, we introduce Action Capsule which identifies action-related key joints by considering the latent correlation of joints in a skeleton sequence. We show that, during inference, our end-to-end network pays attention to a set of joints specific to each action, whose encoded spatio-temporal features are aggregated to recognize the action. Additionally, the use of multiple stages of action capsules enhances the ability of the network to classify similar actions. Consequently, our network outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the N-UCLA dataset and obtains competitive results on the NTURGBD dataset. This is while our approach has significantly lower computational requirements based on GFLOPs measurements.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we focus on improving adversarial robustness in the challenging zero-shot image classification setting. To address this issue, we propose LAAT, a novel Language-driven, Anchor-based Adversarial Training strategy. LAAT utilizes a text encoder to generate fixed anchors (normalized feature embeddings) for each category and then uses these anchors for adversarial training. By leveraging the semantic consistency of the text encoders, LAAT can enhance the adversarial robustness of the image model on novel categories without additional examples. We identify the large cosine similarity problem of recent text encoders and design several effective techniques to address it. The experimental results demonstrate that LAAT significantly improves zero-shot adversarial performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art adversarially robust one-shot methods. Moreover, our method produces substantial zero-shot adversarial robustness when models are trained on large datasets such as ImageNet-1K and applied to several downstream datasets.

- **Summary**: Two key questions in cardiac image analysis are to assess the anatomy and motion of the heart from images; and to understand how they are associated with non-imaging clinical factors such as gender, age and diseases. While the first question can often be addressed by image segmentation and motion tracking algorithms, our capability to model and to answer the second question is still limited. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model to describe the 4D spatio-temporal anatomy of the heart and its interaction with non-imaging clinical factors. The clinical factors are integrated as the conditions of the generative modelling, which allows us to investigate how these factors influence the cardiac anatomy. We evaluate the model performance in mainly two tasks, anatomical sequence completion and sequence generation. The model achieves a high performance in anatomical sequence completion, comparable to or outperforming other state-of-the-art generative models. In terms of sequence generation, given clinical conditions, the model can generate realistic synthetic 4D sequential anatomies that share similar distributions with the real data.

- **Summary**: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) limits the amount of private information deep learning models can memorize during training. This is achieved by clipping and adding noise to the model's gradients, and thus networks with more parameters require proportionally stronger perturbation. As a result, large models have difficulties learning useful information, rendering training with DP-SGD exceedingly difficult on more challenging training tasks. Recent research has focused on combating this challenge through training adaptations such as heavy data augmentation and large batch sizes. However, these techniques further increase the computational overhead of DP-SGD and reduce its practical applicability. In this work, we propose using the principle of sparse model design to solve precisely such complex tasks with fewer parameters, higher accuracy, and in less time, thus serving as a promising direction for DP-SGD. We achieve such sparsity by design by introducing equivariant convolutional networks for model training with Differential Privacy. Using equivariant networks, we show that small and efficient architecture design can outperform current state-of-the-art models with substantially lower computational requirements. On CIFAR-10, we achieve an increase of up to $9\%$ in accuracy while reducing the computation time by more than $85\%$. Our results are a step towards efficient model architectures that make optimal use of their parameters and bridge the privacy-utility gap between private and non-private deep learning for computer vision.

- **Summary**: Generalization is one of the main challenges of computational pathology. Slide preparation heterogeneity and the diversity of scanners lead to poor model performance when used on data from medical centers not seen during training. In order to achieve stain invariance in breast invasive carcinoma patch classification, we implement a stain translation strategy using cycleGANs for unsupervised image-to-image translation. We compare three cycleGAN-based approaches to a baseline classification model obtained without any stain invariance strategy. Two of the proposed approaches use cycleGAN's translations at inference or training in order to build stain-specific classification models. The last method uses them for stain data augmentation during training. This constrains the classification model to learn stain-invariant features. Baseline metrics are set by training and testing the baseline classification model on a reference stain. We assessed performances using three medical centers with H&E and H&E&S staining. Every approach tested in this study improves baseline metrics without needing labels on target stains. The stain augmentation-based approach produced the best results on every stain. Each method's pros and cons are studied and discussed in this paper. However, training highly performing cycleGANs models in itself represents a challenge. In this work, we introduce a systematical method for optimizing cycleGAN training by setting a novel stopping criterion. This method has the benefit of not requiring any visual inspection of cycleGAN results and proves superiority to methods using a predefined number of training epochs. In addition, we also study the minimal amount of data required for cycleGAN training.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of various tissue and nuclei types in histology images is fundamental to many downstream tasks in the area of computational pathology (CPath). In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) methods have been shown to perform well on segmentation tasks but DL methods generally require a large amount of pixel-wise annotated data. Pixel-wise annotation sometimes requires expert's knowledge and time which is laborious and costly to obtain. In this paper, we present a consistency based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach that can help mitigate this challenge by exploiting a large amount of unlabelled data for model training thus alleviating the need for a large annotated dataset. However, SSL models might also be susceptible to changing context and features perturbations exhibiting poor generalisation due to the limited training data. We propose an SSL method that learns robust features from both labelled and unlabelled images by enforcing consistency against varying contexts and feature perturbations. The proposed method incorporates context-aware consistency by contrasting pairs of overlapping images in a pixel-wise manner from changing contexts resulting in robust and context invariant features. We show that cross-consistency training makes the encoder features invariant to different perturbations and improves the prediction confidence. Finally, entropy minimisation is employed to further boost the confidence of the final prediction maps from unlabelled data. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on two publicly available large datasets (BCSS and MoNuSeg) and show superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Colorectal and prostate cancers are the most common types of cancer in men worldwide. To diagnose colorectal and prostate cancer, a pathologist performs a histological analysis on needle biopsy samples. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, resulting in high intra and interobserver variability, which affects diagnosis reliability. This study aims to develop an automatic computerized system for diagnosing colorectal and prostate tumors by using images of biopsy samples to reduce time and diagnosis error rates associated with human analysis. We propose a CNN model for classifying colorectal and prostate tumors from multispectral images of biopsy samples. The key idea was to remove the last block of the convolutional layers and halve the number of filters per layer. Our results showed excellent performance, with an average test accuracy of 99.8% and 99.5% for the prostate and colorectal data sets, respectively. The system showed excellent performance when compared with pretrained CNNs and other classification methods, as it avoids the preprocessing phase while using a single CNN model for classification. Overall, the proposed CNN architecture was globally the best-performing system for classifying colorectal and prostate tumor images. The proposed CNN was detailed and compared with previously trained network models used as feature extractors. These CNNs were also compared with other classification techniques. As opposed to pretrained CNNs and other classification approaches, the proposed CNN yielded excellent results. The computational complexity of the CNNs was also investigated, it was shown that the proposed CNN is better at classifying images than pretrained networks because it does not require preprocessing. Thus, the overall analysis was that the proposed CNN architecture was globally the best-performing system for classifying colorectal and prostate tumor images.

- **Summary**: Modern studies in radiograph representation learning rely on either self-supervision to encode invariant semantics or associated radiology reports to incorporate medical expertise, while the complementarity between them is barely noticed. To explore this, we formulate the self- and report-completion as two complementary objectives and present a unified framework based on masked record modeling (MRM). In practice, MRM reconstructs masked image patches and masked report tokens following a multi-task scheme to learn knowledge-enhanced semantic representations. With MRM pre-training, we obtain pre-trained models that can be well transferred to various radiography tasks. Specifically, we find that MRM offers superior performance in label-efficient fine-tuning. For instance, MRM achieves 88.5% mean AUC on CheXpert using 1% labeled data, outperforming previous R$^2$L methods with 100% labels. On NIH ChestX-ray, MRM outperforms the best performing counterpart by about 3% under small labeling ratios. Besides, MRM surpasses self- and report-supervised pre-training in identifying the pneumonia type and the pneumothorax area, sometimes by large margins.

- **Summary**: Since the introduction of Vision Transformers, the landscape of many computer vision tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation), which has been overwhelmingly dominated by CNNs, recently has significantly revolutionized. However, the computational cost and memory requirement render these methods unsuitable on the mobile device, especially for the high-resolution per-pixel semantic segmentation task. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial TransFormer (SeaFormer) for mobile semantic segmentation. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobile-friendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification problem, demonstrating the potentials of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone.

- **Summary**: The ability to accurately locate and navigate to a specific object is a crucial capability for embodied agents that operate in the real world and interact with objects to complete tasks. Such object navigation tasks usually require large-scale training in visual environments with labeled objects, which generalizes poorly to novel objects in unknown environments. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot object navigation method, Exploration with Soft Commonsense constraints (ESC), that transfers commonsense knowledge in pre-trained models to open-world object navigation without any navigation experience nor any other training on the visual environments. First, ESC leverages a pre-trained vision and language model for open-world prompt-based grounding and a pre-trained commonsense language model for room and object reasoning. Then ESC converts commonsense knowledge into navigation actions by modeling it as soft logic predicates for efficient exploration. Extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks show that our ESC method improves significantly over baselines, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for zero-shot object navigation (e.g., 288% relative Success Rate improvement than CoW on MP3D).

- **Summary**: Temporal consistency is essential for video editing applications. Existing work on layered representation of videos allows propagating edits consistently to each frame. These methods, however, can only edit object appearance rather than object shape changes due to the limitation of using a fixed UV mapping field for texture atlas. We present a shape-aware, text-driven video editing method to tackle this challenge. To handle shape changes in video editing, we first propagate the deformation field between the input and edited keyframe to all frames. We then leverage a pre-trained text-conditioned diffusion model as guidance for refining shape distortion and completing unseen regions. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve shape-aware consistent video editing and compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Rather than regressing gaze direction directly from images, we show that adding a 3D shape model can: i) improve gaze estimation accuracy, ii) perform well with lower resolution inputs and iii) provide a richer understanding of the eye-region and its constituent gaze system. Specifically, we use an `eyes and nose' 3D morphable model (3DMM) to capture the eye-region 3D facial geometry and appearance and we equip this with a geometric vergence model of gaze to give an `active-gaze 3DMM'. We show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Eyediap dataset and we present an ablation study. Our method can learn with only the ground truth gaze target point and the camera parameters, without access to the ground truth gaze origin points, thus widening the applicability of our approach compared to other methods.

- **Summary**: Image diffusion models such as DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion have attracted significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality synthetic images. In this work, we show that diffusion models memorize individual images from their training data and emit them at generation time. With a generate-and-filter pipeline, we extract over a thousand training examples from state-of-the-art models, ranging from photographs of individual people to trademarked company logos. We also train hundreds of diffusion models in various settings to analyze how different modeling and data decisions affect privacy. Overall, our results show that diffusion models are much less private than prior generative models such as GANs, and that mitigating these vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training.

- **Summary**: We propose a new problem called audio-visual segmentation (AVS), in which the goal is to output a pixel-level map of the object(s) that produce sound at the time of the image frame. To facilitate this research, we construct the first audio-visual segmentation benchmark, i.e., AVSBench, providing pixel-wise annotations for sounding objects in audible videos. It contains three subsets: AVSBench-object (Single-source subset, Multi-sources subset) and AVSBench-semantic (Semantic-labels subset). Accordingly, three settings are studied: 1) semi-supervised audio-visual segmentation with a single sound source; 2) fully-supervised audio-visual segmentation with multiple sound sources, and 3) fully-supervised audio-visual semantic segmentation. The first two settings need to generate binary masks of sounding objects indicating pixels corresponding to the audio, while the third setting further requires generating semantic maps indicating the object category. To deal with these problems, we propose a new baseline method that uses a temporal pixel-wise audio-visual interaction module to inject audio semantics as guidance for the visual segmentation process. We also design a regularization loss to encourage audio-visual mapping during training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on AVSBench compare our approach to several existing methods for related tasks, demonstrating that the proposed method is promising for building a bridge between the audio and pixel-wise visual semantics.

- **Summary**: Humans have the ability to adapt the type of information they use, the procedure they employ, and the amount of time they spend when solving problems. However, most standard neural networks have a fixed function type and computation budget regardless of the sample's nature or difficulty. Adaptivity is a powerful paradigm as it not only imbues practitioners with flexibility pertaining to the downstream usage of these models but can also serve as a powerful inductive bias for solving certain challenging classes of problems. In this work, we introduce a new approach called AdaTape, which allows for dynamic computation in neural networks through adaptive tape tokens. AdaTape utilizes an elastic input sequence by equipping an architecture with a dynamic read-and-write tape. Specifically, we adaptively generate input sequences using tape tokens obtained from a tape bank which can be either trainable or derived from input data. We examine the challenges and requirements to obtain dynamic sequence content and length, and propose the Adaptive Tape Reading (ATR) algorithm to achieve both goals. Through extensive experiments on image recognition tasks, we show that AdaTape can achieve better performance while maintaining the computational cost. To facilitate further research, we have released code at https://github.com/google-research/scenic.

- **Summary**: Slot attention is a powerful method for object-centric modeling in images and videos. However, its set-equivariance limits its ability to handle videos with a dynamic number of objects because it cannot break ties. To overcome this limitation, we first establish a connection between slot attention and optimal transport. Based on this new perspective we propose MESH (Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn): a cross-attention module that combines the tiebreaking properties of unregularized optimal transport with the speed of regularized optimal transport. We evaluate slot attention using MESH on multiple object-centric learning benchmarks and find significant improvements over slot attention in every setting.

We test the proposed system under various challenging scenes and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Hazard detection and avoidance is a key technology for future robotic small body sample return and lander missions. Current state-of-the-practice methods rely on high-fidelity, a priori terrain maps, which require extensive human-in-the-loop verification and expensive reconnaissance campaigns to resolve mapping uncertainties. We propose a novel safety mapping paradigm that leverages deep semantic segmentation techniques to predict landing safety directly from a single monocular image, thus reducing reliance on high-fidelity, a priori data products. We demonstrate precise and accurate safety mapping performance on real in-situ imagery of prospective sample sites from the OSIRIS-REx mission.

- **Summary**: Animal navigation research posits that organisms build and maintain internal spatial representations, or maps, of their environment. We ask if machines -- specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) navigation agents -- also build implicit (or 'mental') maps. A positive answer to this question would (a) explain the surprising phenomenon in recent literature of ostensibly map-free neural-networks achieving strong performance, and (b) strengthen the evidence of mapping as a fundamental mechanism for navigation by intelligent embodied agents, whether they be biological or artificial. Unlike animal navigation, we can judiciously design the agent's perceptual system and control the learning paradigm to nullify alternative navigation mechanisms. Specifically, we train 'blind' agents -- with sensing limited to only egomotion and no other sensing of any kind -- to perform PointGoal navigation ('go to $\Delta$ x, $\Delta$ y') via reinforcement learning. Our agents are composed of navigation-agnostic components (fully-connected and recurrent neural networks), and our experimental setup provides no inductive bias towards mapping. Despite these harsh conditions, we find that blind agents are (1) surprisingly effective navigators in new environments (~95% success); (2) they utilize memory over long horizons (remembering ~1,000 steps of past experience in an episode); (3) this memory enables them to exhibit intelligent behavior (following walls, detecting collisions, taking shortcuts); (4) there is emergence of maps and collision detection neurons in the representations of the environment built by a blind agent as it navigates; and (5) the emergent maps are selective and task dependent (e.g. the agent 'forgets' exploratory detours). Overall, this paper presents no new techniques for the AI audience, but a surprising finding, an insight, and an explanation.

- **Summary**: Minerals are indispensable for a functioning modern society. Yet, their supply is limited causing a need for optimizing their exploration and extraction both from ores and recyclable materials. Typically, these processes must be meticulously adapted to the precise properties of the processed particles, an extensive characterization of their shapes, appearances as well as the overall material composition. Current approaches perform this analysis based on bulk segmentation and characterization of particles imaged with a micro CT, and rely on rudimentary postprocessing techniques to separate touching particles. However, due to their inability to reliably perform this separation as well as the need to retrain or reconfigure methods for each new image, these approaches leave untapped potential to be leveraged. Here, we propose ParticleSeg3D, an instance segmentation method that is able to extract individual particles from large micro CT images taken from mineral samples embedded in an epoxy matrix. Our approach is based on the powerful nnU-Net framework, introduces a particle size normalization, makes use of a border-core representation to enable instance segmentation and is trained with a large dataset containing particles of numerous different materials and minerals. We demonstrate that ParticleSeg3D can be applied out-of-the box to a large variety of particle types, including materials and appearances that have not been part of the training set. Thus, no further manual annotations and retraining are required when applying the method to new mineral samples, enabling substantially higher scalability of experiments than existing methods. Our code and dataset are made publicly available.

- **Summary**: For effective and efficient deep neural network inference, it is desirable to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with the simplest networks requiring the least computation, memory, and power. Quantizing networks to lower precision is a powerful technique for simplifying networks. It is generally desirable to quantize as aggressively as possible without incurring significant accuracy degradation. As each layer of a network may have different sensitivity to quantization, mixed precision quantization methods selectively tune the precision of individual layers of a network to achieve a minimum drop in task performance (e.g., accuracy). To estimate the impact of layer precision choice on task performance two methods are introduced: i) Entropy Approximation Guided Layer selection (EAGL) is fast and uses the entropy of the weight distribution, and ii) Accuracy-aware Layer Precision Selection (ALPS) is straightforward and relies on single epoch fine-tuning after layer precision reduction. Using EAGL and ALPS for layer precision selection, full-precision accuracy is recovered with a mix of 4-bit and 2-bit layers for ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 classification networks, demonstrating improved performance across the entire accuracy-throughput frontier, and equivalent performance for the PSPNet segmentation network in our own commensurate comparison over leading mixed precision layer selection techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute time to reach a solution.

- **Summary**: A framework performing Visual Commonsense Reasoning(VCR) needs to choose an answer and further provide a rationale justifying based on the given image and question, where the image contains all the facts for reasoning and requires to be sufficiently understood. Previous methods use a detector applied on the image to obtain a set of visual objects without considering the exact positions of them in the scene, which is inadequate for properly understanding spatial and semantic relationships between objects. In addition, VCR samples are quite diverse, and parameters of the framework tend to be trained suboptimally based on mini-batches. To address above challenges, pseudo 3D perception Transformer with multi-level confidence optimization named PPTMCO is proposed for VCR in this paper. Specifically, image depth is introduced to represent pseudo 3-dimension(3D) positions of objects along with 2-dimension(2D) coordinates in the image and further enhance visual features. Then, considering that relationships between objects are influenced by depth, depth-aware Transformer is proposed to do attention mechanism guided by depth differences from answer words and objects to objects, where each word is tagged with pseudo depth value according to related objects. To better optimize parameters of the framework, a model parameter estimation method is further proposed to weightedly integrate parameters optimized by mini-batches based on multi-level reasoning confidence. Experiments on the benchmark VCR dataset demonstrate the proposed framework performs better against the state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: A good feature representation is the key to image classification. In practice, image classifiers may be applied in scenarios different from what they have been trained on. This so-called domain shift leads to a significant performance drop in image classification. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) reduces the domain shift by transferring the knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. We perform feature disentanglement for UDA by distilling category-relevant features and excluding category-irrelevant features from the global feature maps. This disentanglement prevents the network from overfitting to category-irrelevant information and makes it focus on information useful for classification. This reduces the difficulty of domain alignment and improves the classification accuracy on the target domain. We propose a coarse-to-fine domain adaptation method called Domain Adaptation via Feature Disentanglement~(DAFD), which has two components: (1)the Category-Relevant Feature Selection (CRFS) module, which disentangles the category-relevant features from the category-irrelevant features, and (2)the Dynamic Local Maximum Mean Discrepancy (DLMMD) module, which achieves fine-grained alignment by reducing the discrepancy within the category-relevant features from different domains. Combined with the CRFS, the DLMMD module can align the category-relevant features properly. We conduct comprehensive experiment on four standard datasets. Our results clearly demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach in domain adaptive image classification tasks and its competitiveness to the state of the art.

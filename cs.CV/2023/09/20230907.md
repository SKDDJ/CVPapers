- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of punctate white matter lesions (PWMLs) are fundamental for the timely diagnosis and treatment of related developmental disorders. Automated PWMLs segmentation from infant brain MR images is challenging, considering that the lesions are typically small and low-contrast, and the number of lesions may dramatically change across subjects. Existing learning-based methods directly apply general network architectures to this challenging task, which may fail to capture detailed positional information of PWMLs, potentially leading to severe under-segmentations. In this paper, we propose to leverage the idea of counterfactual reasoning coupled with the auxiliary task of brain tissue segmentation to learn fine-grained positional and morphological representations of PWMLs for accurate localization and segmentation. A simple and easy-to-implement deep-learning framework (i.e., DeepPWML) is accordingly designed. It combines the lesion counterfactual map with the tissue probability map to train a lightweight PWML segmentation network, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a real-clinical dataset of infant T1w MR images.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present an approach to image enhancement with diffusion model in underwater scenes. Our method adapts conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models to generate the corresponding enhanced images by using the underwater images and the Gaussian noise as the inputs. Additionally, in order to improve the efficiency of the reverse process in the diffusion model, we adopt two different ways. We firstly propose a lightweight transformer-based denoising network, which can effectively promote the time of network forward per iteration. On the other hand, we introduce a skip sampling strategy to reduce the number of iterations. Besides, based on the skip sampling strategy, we propose two different non-uniform sampling methods for the sequence of the time step, namely piecewise sampling and searching with the evolutionary algorithm. Both of them are effective and can further improve performance by using the same steps against the previous uniform sampling. In the end, we conduct a relative evaluation of the widely used underwater enhancement datasets between the recent state-of-the-art methods and the proposed approach. The experimental results prove that our approach can achieve both competitive performance and high efficiency.

- **Summary**: Multimodal models have gained significant success in recent years. Standard multimodal approaches often assume unchanged modalities from training stage to inference stage. In practice, however, many scenarios fail to satisfy such assumptions with missing modalities during inference, leading to limitations on where multimodal models can be applied. While existing methods mitigate the problem through reconstructing the missing modalities, it increases unnecessary computational cost, which could be just as critical, especially for large, deployed systems. To solve the problem from both sides, we propose a novel guidance network that promotes knowledge sharing during training, taking advantage of the multimodal representations to train better single-modality models for inference. Real-life experiment in violence detection shows that our proposed framework trains single-modality models that significantly outperform its traditionally trained counterparts while maintaining the same inference cost.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion model called that generates multiview-consistent images from a single-view image. Using pretrained large-scale 2D diffusion models, recent work Zero123 demonstrates the ability to generate plausible novel views from a single-view image of an object. However, maintaining consistency in geometry and colors for the generated images remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a synchronized multiview diffusion model that models the joint probability distribution of multiview images, enabling the generation of multiview-consistent images in a single reverse process. SyncDreamer synchronizes the intermediate states of all the generated images at every step of the reverse process through a 3D-aware feature attention mechanism that correlates the corresponding features across different views. Experiments show that SyncDreamer generates images with high consistency across different views, thus making it well-suited for various 3D generation tasks such as novel-view-synthesis, text-to-3D, and image-to-3D.



### Autoregressive Omni-Aware Outpainting for Open-Vocabulary 360-Degree Image Generation

- **Summary**: A 360-degree (omni-directional) image provides an all-encompassing spherical view of a scene. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in synthesising 360-degree images from conventional narrow field of view (NFoV) images captured by digital cameras and smartphones, for providing immersive experiences in various scenarios such as virtual reality. Yet, existing methods typically fall short in synthesizing intricate visual details or ensure the generated images align consistently with user-provided prompts. In this study, autoregressive omni-aware generative network (AOG-Net) is proposed for 360-degree image generation by out-painting an incomplete 360-degree image progressively with NFoV and text guidances joinly or individually. This autoregressive scheme not only allows for deriving finer-grained and text-consistent patterns by dynamically generating and adjusting the process but also offers users greater flexibility to edit their conditions throughout the generation process. A global-local conditioning mechanism is devised to comprehensively formulate the outpainting guidance in each autoregressive step. Text guidances, omni-visual cues, NFoV inputs and omni-geometry are encoded and further formulated with cross-attention based transformers into a global stream and a local stream into a conditioned generative backbone model. As AOG-Net is compatible to leverage large-scale models for the conditional encoder and the generative prior, it enables the generation to use extensive open-vocabulary text guidances. Comprehensive experiments on two commonly used 360-degree image datasets for both indoor and outdoor settings demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method. Our code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Current machine learning methods struggle to solve Bongard problems, which are a type of IQ test that requires deriving an abstract "concept" from a set of positive and negative "support" images, and then classifying whether or not a new query image depicts the key concept. On Bongard-HOI, a benchmark for natural-image Bongard problems, existing methods have only reached 66% accuracy (where chance is 50%). Low accuracy is often attributed to neural nets' lack of ability to find human-like symbolic rules. In this work, we point out that many existing methods are forfeiting accuracy due to a much simpler problem: they do not incorporate information contained in the support set as a whole, and rely instead on information extracted from individual supports. This is a critical issue, because unlike in few-shot learning tasks concerning object classification, the "key concept" in a typical Bongard problem can only be distinguished using multiple positives and multiple negatives. We explore a variety of simple methods to take this cross-image context into account, and demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, leading to new state-of-the-art performance on Bongard-LOGO (75.3%) and Bongard-HOI (72.45%) and strong performance on the original Bongard problem set (60.84%).

- **Summary**: Advances in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) have almost entirely closed the gap between SSL and Supervised Learning at a fraction of the number of labels. However, recent performance improvements have often come \textit{at the cost of significantly increased training computation}. To address this, we propose Curriculum Batch Size (CBS), \textit{an unlabeled batch size curriculum which exploits the natural training dynamics of deep neural networks.} A small unlabeled batch size is used in the beginning of training and is gradually increased to the end of training. A fixed curriculum is used regardless of dataset, model or number of epochs, and reduced training computations is demonstrated on all settings. We apply CBS, strong labeled augmentation, Curriculum Pseudo Labeling (CPL) \citep{FlexMatch} to FixMatch \citep{FixMatch} and term the new SSL algorithm Fast FixMatch. We perform an ablation study to show that strong labeled augmentation and/or CPL do not significantly reduce training computations, but, in synergy with CBS, they achieve optimal performance. Fast FixMatch also achieves substantially higher data utilization compared to previous state-of-the-art. Fast FixMatch achieves between $2.1\times$ - $3.4\times$ reduced training computations on CIFAR-10 with all but 40, 250 and 4000 labels removed, compared to vanilla FixMatch, while attaining the same cited state-of-the-art error rate \citep{FixMatch}. Similar results are achieved for CIFAR-100, SVHN and STL-10. Finally, Fast MixMatch achieves between $2.6\times$ - $3.3\times$ reduced training computations in federated SSL tasks and online/streaming learning SSL tasks, which further demonstrate the generializbility of Fast MixMatch to different scenarios and tasks.

- **Summary**: Despite substantial efforts dedicated to the design of heuristic models for omnidirectional (i.e., 360$^\circ$) image quality assessment (OIQA), a conspicuous gap remains due to the lack of consideration for the diversity of viewing behaviors that leads to the varying perceptual quality of 360$^\circ$ images. Two critical aspects underline this oversight: the neglect of viewing conditions that significantly sway user gaze patterns and the overreliance on a single viewport sequence from the 360$^\circ$ image for quality inference. To address these issues, we introduce a unique generative scanpath representation (GSR) for effective quality inference of 360$^\circ$ images, which aggregates varied perceptual experiences of multi-hypothesis users under a predefined viewing condition. More specifically, given a viewing condition characterized by the starting point of viewing and exploration time, a set of scanpaths consisting of dynamic visual fixations can be produced using an apt scanpath generator. Following this vein, we use the scanpaths to convert the 360$^\circ$ image into the unique GSR, which provides a global overview of gazed-focused contents derived from scanpaths. As such, the quality inference of the 360$^\circ$ image is swiftly transformed to that of GSR. We then propose an efficient OIQA computational framework by learning the quality maps of GSR. Comprehensive experimental results validate that the predictions of the proposed framework are highly consistent with human perception in the spatiotemporal domain, especially in the challenging context of locally distorted 360$^\circ$ images under varied viewing conditions.

- **Summary**: Referring video object segmentation aims to segment a referent throughout a video sequence according to a natural language expression. It requires aligning the natural language expression with the objects' motions and their dynamic associations at the global video level but segmenting objects at the frame level. To achieve this goal, we propose to simultaneously maintain a global referent token and a sequence of object queries, where the former is responsible for capturing video-level referent according to the language expression, while the latter serves to better locate and segment objects with each frame. Furthermore, to explicitly capture object motions and spatial-temporal cross-modal reasoning over objects, we propose a novel temporal collection-distribution mechanism for interacting between the global referent token and object queries. Specifically, the temporal collection mechanism collects global information for the referent token from object queries to the temporal motions to the language expression. In turn, the temporal distribution first distributes the referent token to the referent sequence across all frames and then performs efficient cross-frame reasoning between the referent sequence and object queries in every frame. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all benchmarks consistently and significantly.

- **Summary**: Cerebrovascular disease is one of the major diseases facing the world today. Automatic segmentation of intracranial artery (IA) in digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences is an important step in the diagnosis of vascular related diseases and in guiding neurointerventional procedures. While, a single image can only show part of the IA within the contrast medium according to the imaging principle of DSA technology. Therefore, 2D DSA segmentation methods are unable to capture the complete IA information and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. We propose A timing sequence image segmentation network with U-shape, called TSI-Net, which incorporates a bi-directional ConvGRU module (BCM) in the encoder. The network incorporates a bi-directional ConvGRU module (BCM) in the encoder, which can input variable-length DSA sequences, retain past and future information, segment them into 2D images. In addition, we introduce a sensitive detail branch (SDB) at the end for supervising fine vessels. Experimented on the DSA sequence dataset DIAS, the method performs significantly better than state-of-the-art networks in recent years. In particular, it achieves a Sen evaluation metric of 0.797, which is a 3% improvement compared to other methods.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art visual grounding models can achieve high detection accuracy, but they are not designed to distinguish between all objects versus only certain objects of interest. In natural language, in order to specify a particular object or set of objects of interest, humans use determiners such as "my", "either" and "those". Determiners, as an important word class, are a type of schema in natural language about the reference or quantity of the noun. Existing grounded referencing datasets place much less emphasis on determiners, compared to other word classes such as nouns, verbs and adjectives. This makes it difficult to develop models that understand the full variety and complexity of object referencing. Thus, we have developed and released the DetermiNet dataset , which comprises 250,000 synthetically generated images and captions based on 25 determiners. The task is to predict bounding boxes to identify objects of interest, constrained by the semantics of the given determiner. We find that current state-of-the-art visual grounding models do not perform well on the dataset, highlighting the limitations of existing models on reference and quantification tasks.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis, providing valuable information that helps to make an accurate diagnosis. In recent years, deep learning-based automatic image segmentation methods have achieved outstanding results in medical images. In this paper, inspired by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundation model that has received much attention for its impressive accuracy and powerful generalization ability in 2D still image segmentation, we propose a SAM3D that targets at 3D volumetric medical images and utilizes the pre-trained features from the SAM encoder to capture meaningful representations of input images. Different from other existing SAM-based volumetric segmentation methods that perform the segmentation by dividing the volume into a set of 2D slices, our model takes the whole 3D volume image as input and processes it simply and effectively that avoids training a significant number of parameters. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple medical image datasets to demonstrate that our network attains competitive results compared with other state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical segmentation tasks while being significantly efficient in terms of parameters.

- **Summary**: Pathologists routinely use immunohistochemical (IHC)-stained tissue slides against MelanA in addition to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides to improve their accuracy in diagnosing melanomas. The use of diagnostic Deep Learning (DL)-based support systems for automated examination of tissue morphology and cellular composition has been well studied in standard H&E-stained tissue slides. In contrast, there are few studies that analyze IHC slides using DL. Therefore, we investigated the separate and joint performance of ResNets trained on MelanA and corresponding H&E-stained slides. The MelanA classifier achieved an area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.82 and 0.74 on out of distribution (OOD)-datasets, similar to the H&E-based benchmark classification of 0.81 and 0.75, respectively. A combined classifier using MelanA and H&E achieved AUROCs of 0.85 and 0.81 on the OOD datasets. DL MelanA-based assistance systems show the same performance as the benchmark H&E classification and may be improved by multi stain classification to assist pathologists in their clinical routine.

- **Summary**: Quantitative Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during in-situ straining experiment is able to reveal the motion of dislocations -- linear defects in the crystal lattice of metals. In the domain of materials science, the knowledge about the location and movement of dislocations is important for creating novel materials with superior properties. A long-standing problem, however, is to identify the position and extract the shape of dislocations, which would ultimately help to create a digital twin of such materials. In this work, we quantitatively compare state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, including Mask R-CNN and YOLOv8. The dislocation masks as the results of the instance segmentation are converted to mathematical lines, enabling quantitative analysis of dislocation length and geometry -- important information for the domain scientist, which we then propose to include as a novel length-aware quality metric for estimating the network performance. Our segmentation pipeline shows a high accuracy suitable for all domain-specific, further post-processing. Additionally, our physics-based metric turns out to perform much more consistently than typically used pixel-wise metrics.

- **Summary**: Stroke-based rendering aims to recreate an image with a set of strokes. Most existing methods render complex images using an uniform-block-dividing strategy, which leads to boundary inconsistency artifacts. To solve the problem, we propose Compositional Neural Painter, a novel stroke-based rendering framework which dynamically predicts the next painting region based on the current canvas, instead of dividing the image plane uniformly into painting regions. We start from an empty canvas and divide the painting process into several steps. At each step, a compositor network trained with a phasic RL strategy first predicts the next painting region, then a painter network trained with a WGAN discriminator predicts stroke parameters, and a stroke renderer paints the strokes onto the painting region of the current canvas. Moreover, we extend our method to stroke-based style transfer with a novel differentiable distance transform loss, which helps preserve the structure of the input image during stroke-based stylization. Extensive experiments show our model outperforms the existing models in both stroke-based neural painting and stroke-based stylization.

- **Summary**: In recent years, many mammographic image analysis methods have been introduced for improving cancer classification tasks. Two major issues of mammogram classification tasks are leveraging multi-view mammographic information and class-imbalance handling. In the first problem, many multi-view methods have been released for concatenating features of two or more views for the training and inference stage. Having said that, most multi-view existing methods are not explainable in the meaning of feature fusion, and treat many views equally for diagnosing. Our work aims to propose a simple but novel method for enhancing examined view (main view) by leveraging low-level feature information from the auxiliary view (ipsilateral view) before learning the high-level feature that contains the cancerous features. For the second issue, we also propose a simple but novel malignant mammogram synthesis framework for upsampling minor class samples. Our easy-to-implement and no-training framework has eliminated the current limitation of the CutMix algorithm which is unreliable synthesized images with random pasted patches, hard-contour problems, and domain shift problems. Our results on VinDr-Mammo and CMMD datasets show the effectiveness of our two new frameworks for both multi-view training and synthesizing mammographic images, outperforming the previous conventional methods in our experimental settings.

- **Summary**: Video frame interpolation is an important low-level vision task, which can increase frame rate for more fluent visual experience. Existing methods have achieved great success by employing advanced motion models and synthesis networks. However, the spatial redundancy when synthesizing the target frame has not been fully explored, that can result in lots of inefficient computation. On the other hand, the computation compression degree in frame interpolation is highly dependent on both texture distribution and scene motion, which demands to understand the spatial-temporal information of each input frame pair for a better compression degree selection. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage frame interpolation framework termed WaveletVFI to address above problems. It first estimates intermediate optical flow with a lightweight motion perception network, and then a wavelet synthesis network uses flow aligned context features to predict multi-scale wavelet coefficients with sparse convolution for efficient target frame reconstruction, where the sparse valid masks that control computation in each scale are determined by a crucial threshold ratio. Instead of setting a fixed value like previous methods, we find that embedding a classifier in the motion perception network to learn a dynamic threshold for each sample can achieve more computation reduction with almost no loss of accuracy. On the common high resolution and animation frame interpolation benchmarks, proposed WaveletVFI can reduce computation up to 40% while maintaining similar accuracy, making it perform more efficiently against other state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Class activation mapping~(CAM), a visualization technique for interpreting deep learning models, is now commonly used for weakly supervised semantic segmentation~(WSSS) and object localization~(WSOL). It is the weighted aggregation of the feature maps by activating the high class-relevance ones. Current CAM methods achieve it relying on the training outcomes, such as predicted scores~(forward information), gradients~(backward information), etc. However, when with small-scale data, unstable training may lead to less effective model outcomes and generate unreliable weights, finally resulting in incorrect activation and noisy CAM seeds. In this paper, we propose an outcome-agnostic CAM approach, called BroadCAM, for small-scale weakly supervised applications. Since broad learning system (BLS) is independent to the model learning, BroadCAM can avoid the weights being affected by the unreliable model outcomes when with small-scale data. By evaluating BroadCAM on VOC2012 (natural images) and BCSS-WSSS (medical images) for WSSS and OpenImages30k for WSOL, BroadCAM demonstrates superior performance than existing CAM methods with small-scale data (less than 5\%) in different CNN architectures. It also achieves SOTA performance with large-scale training data. Extensive qualitative comparisons are conducted to demonstrate how BroadCAM activates the high class-relevance feature maps and generates reliable CAMs when with small-scale training data.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting objects using mobile robots in the context of the RoboCup Standard Platform League, with a primary focus on detecting the ball. The challenge lies in detecting a dynamic object in varying lighting conditions and blurred images caused by fast movements. To address this challenge, the paper presents a convolutional neural network architecture designed specifically for computationally constrained robotic platforms. The proposed CNN is trained to achieve high precision classification of single objects in image patches and to determine their precise spatial positions. The paper further integrates Early Exits into the existing high-precision CNN architecture to reduce the computational cost of easily rejectable cases in the background class. The training process involves a composite loss function based on confidence and positional losses with dynamic weighting and data augmentation. The proposed approach achieves a precision of 100% on the validation dataset and a recall of almost 87%, while maintaining an execution time of around 170 $\mu$s per hypotheses. By combining the proposed approach with an Early Exit, a runtime optimization of more than 28%, on average, can be achieved compared to the original CNN. Overall, this paper provides an efficient solution for an enhanced detection of objects, especially the ball, in computationally constrained robotic platforms.

- **Summary**: This work proposes a robust Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) framework that mitigates the negative transfer problem by incorporating a robust target-supervision strategy. It leverages ensemble learning and includes diverse, complementary label feedback, alleviating the effect of incorrect feedback and promoting pseudo-label refinement. Rather than relying exclusively on first-order moments for distribution alignment, our approach offers explicit objectives to optimize intra-class compactness and inter-class separation with the inferred source prototypes and highly-confident target samples in a domain-invariant fashion. Notably, we ensure source data privacy by eliminating the need to access the source data during the adaptation phase through a priori inference of source prototypes. We conducted a series of comprehensive experiments, including an ablation analysis, covering a range of partial domain adaptation tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets corroborate our framework's enhanced robustness and generalization, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art PDA approaches.

- **Summary**: Diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration pose a significant risk to vision, highlighting the importance of precise segmentation of retinal vessels for the tracking and diagnosis of progression. However, existing vessel segmentation methods that heavily rely on encoder-decoder structures struggle to capture contextual information about retinal vessel configurations, leading to challenges in reconciling semantic disparities between encoder and decoder features. To address this, we propose a novel feature enhancement segmentation network (FES-Net) that achieves accurate pixel-wise segmentation without requiring additional image enhancement steps. FES-Net directly processes the input image and utilizes four prompt convolutional blocks (PCBs) during downsampling, complemented by a shallow upsampling approach to generate a binary mask for each class. We evaluate the performance of FES-Net on four publicly available state-of-the-art datasets: DRIVE, STARE, CHASE, and HRF. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of FES-Net compared to other competitive approaches documented in the existing literature.

- **Summary**: You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm is a representative target detection algorithm emerging in 2016, which is known for its balance of computing speed and accuracy, and now plays an important role in various fields of human production and life. However, there are still many limitations in the application of YOLO algorithm in underwater environments due to problems such as dim light and turbid water. With limited land area resources, the ocean must have great potential for future human development. In this paper, starting from the actual needs of marine engineering applications, taking underwater structural health monitoring (SHM) and underwater biological detection as examples, we propose improved methods for the application of underwater YOLO algorithms, and point out the problems that still exist.

- **Summary**: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) plays a pivotal role in downstream vision-language tasks. Existing SGG methods typically suffer from poor compositional generalizations on unseen triplets. They are generally trained on incompletely annotated scene graphs that contain dominant triplets and tend to bias toward these seen triplets during inference. To address this issue, we propose a Triplet Calibration and Reduction (T-CAR) framework in this paper. In our framework, a triplet calibration loss is first presented to regularize the representations of diverse triplets and to simultaneously excavate the unseen triplets in incompletely annotated training scene graphs. Moreover, the unseen space of scene graphs is usually several times larger than the seen space since it contains a huge number of unrealistic compositions. Thus, we propose an unseen space reduction loss to shift the attention of excavation to reasonable unseen compositions to facilitate the model training. Finally, we propose a contextual encoder to improve the compositional generalizations of unseen triplets by explicitly modeling the relative spatial relations between subjects and objects. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves consistent improvements for zero-shot SGG over state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/jkli1998/T-CAR.

- **Summary**: Object detection in low-light scenarios has attracted much attention in the past few years. A mainstream and representative scheme introduces enhancers as the pre-processing for regular detectors. However, because of the disparity in task objectives between the enhancer and detector, this paradigm cannot shine at its best ability. In this work, we try to arouse the potential of enhancer + detector. Different from existing works, we extend the illumination-based enhancers (our newly designed or existing) as a scene decomposition module, whose removed illumination is exploited as the auxiliary in the detector for extracting detection-friendly features. A semantic aggregation module is further established for integrating multi-scale scene-related semantic information in the context space. Actually, our built scheme successfully transforms the "trash" (i.e., the ignored illumination in the detector) into the "treasure" for the detector. Plenty of experiments are conducted to reveal our superiority against other state-of-the-art methods. The code will be public if it is accepted.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the remarkable success of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for image synthesis, we study LDM for text-to-video generation, which is a formidable challenge due to the computational and memory constraints during both model training and inference. A single LDM is usually only capable of generating a very limited number of video frames. Some existing works focus on separate prediction models for generating more video frames, which suffer from additional training cost and frame-level jittering, however. In this paper, we propose a framework called "Reuse and Diffuse" dubbed $\textit{VidRD}$ to produce more frames following the frames already generated by an LDM. Conditioned on an initial video clip with a small number of frames, additional frames are iteratively generated by reusing the original latent features and following the previous diffusion process. Besides, for the autoencoder used for translation between pixel space and latent space, we inject temporal layers into its decoder and fine-tune these layers for higher temporal consistency. We also propose a set of strategies for composing video-text data that involve diverse content from multiple existing datasets including video datasets for action recognition and image-text datasets. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves good results in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models such as ControlNet have enabled geometrically controllable, high-fidelity text-to-image generation. However, none of them addresses the question of adding such controllability to text-to-3D generation. In response, we propose Text2Control3D, a controllable text-to-3D avatar generation method whose facial expression is controllable given a monocular video casually captured with hand-held camera. Our main strategy is to construct the 3D avatar in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) optimized with a set of controlled viewpoint-aware images that we generate from ControlNet, whose condition input is the depth map extracted from the input video. When generating the viewpoint-aware images, we utilize cross-reference attention to inject well-controlled, referential facial expression and appearance via cross attention. We also conduct low-pass filtering of Gaussian latent of the diffusion model in order to ameliorate the viewpoint-agnostic texture problem we observed from our empirical analysis, where the viewpoint-aware images contain identical textures on identical pixel positions that are incomprehensible in 3D. Finally, to train NeRF with the images that are viewpoint-aware yet are not strictly consistent in geometry, our approach considers per-image geometric variation as a view of deformation from a shared 3D canonical space. Consequently, we construct the 3D avatar in a canonical space of deformable NeRF by learning a set of per-image deformation via deformation field table. We demonstrate the empirical results and discuss the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Person Re-identification (ReID) plays a more and more crucial role in recent years with a wide range of applications. Existing ReID methods are suffering from the challenges of misalignment and occlusions, which degrade the performance dramatically. Most methods tackle such challenges by utilizing external tools to locate body parts or exploiting matching strategies. Nevertheless, the inevitable domain gap between the datasets utilized for external tools and the ReID datasets and the complicated matching process make these methods unreliable and sensitive to noises. In this paper, we propose a Region Generation and Assessment Network (RGANet) to effectively and efficiently detect the human body regions and highlight the important regions. In the proposed RGANet, we first devise a Region Generation Module (RGM) which utilizes the pre-trained CLIP to locate the human body regions using semantic prototypes extracted from text descriptions. Learnable prompt is designed to eliminate domain gap between CLIP datasets and ReID datasets. Then, to measure the importance of each generated region, we introduce a Region Assessment Module (RAM) that assigns confidence scores to different regions and reduces the negative impact of the occlusion regions by lower scores. The RAM consists of a discrimination-aware indicator and an invariance-aware indicator, where the former indicates the capability to distinguish from different identities and the latter represents consistency among the images of the same class of human body regions. Extensive experimental results for six widely-used benchmarks including three tasks (occluded, partial, and holistic) demonstrate the superiority of RGANet against state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: As an essential component part of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a vital role in alleviating traffic issues. Object detection is one of the key technologies in the IoV, which has been widely used to provide traffic management services by analyzing timely and sensitive vehicle-related information. However, the current object detection methods are mostly based on centralized deep training, that is, the sensitive data obtained by edge devices need to be uploaded to the server, which raises privacy concerns. To mitigate such privacy leakage, we first propose a federated learning-based framework, where well-trained local models are shared in the central server. However, since edge devices usually have limited computing power, plus a strict requirement of low latency in IoVs, we further propose a sparse training process on edge devices, which can effectively lighten the model, and ensure its training efficiency on edge devices, thereby reducing communication overheads. In addition, due to the diverse computing capabilities and dynamic environment, different sparsity rates are applied to edge devices. To further guarantee the performance, we propose, FedWeg, an improved aggregation scheme based on FedAvg, which is designed by the inverse ratio of sparsity rates. Experiments on the real-life dataset using YOLO show that the proposed scheme can achieve the required object detection rate while saving considerable communication costs.

- **Summary**: Face analysis tasks have a wide range of applications, but the universal facial representation has only been explored in a few works. In this paper, we explore high-performance pre-training methods to boost the face analysis tasks such as face alignment and face parsing. We propose a self-supervised pre-training framework, called \textbf{\it Mask Contrastive Face (MCF)}, with mask image modeling and a contrastive strategy specially adjusted for face domain tasks. To improve the facial representation quality, we use feature map of a pre-trained visual backbone as a supervision item and use a partially pre-trained decoder for mask image modeling. To handle the face identity during the pre-training stage, we further use random masks to build contrastive learning pairs. We conduct the pre-training on the LAION-FACE-cropped dataset, a variants of LAION-FACE 20M, which contains more than 20 million face images from Internet websites. For efficiency pre-training, we explore our framework pre-training performance on a small part of LAION-FACE-cropped and verify the superiority with different pre-training settings. Our model pre-trained with the full pre-training dataset outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple downstream tasks. Our model achieves 0.932 NME$_{diag}$ for AFLW-19 face alignment and 93.96 F1 score for LaPa face parsing. Code is available at https://github.com/nomewang/MCF.

- **Summary**: As it is empirically observed that Vision Transformers (ViTs) are quite insensitive to the order of input tokens, the need for an appropriate self-supervised pretext task that enhances the location awareness of ViTs is becoming evident. To address this, we present DropPos, a novel pretext task designed to reconstruct Dropped Positions. The formulation of DropPos is simple: we first drop a large random subset of positional embeddings and then the model classifies the actual position for each non-overlapping patch among all possible positions solely based on their visual appearance. To avoid trivial solutions, we increase the difficulty of this task by keeping only a subset of patches visible. Additionally, considering there may be different patches with similar visual appearances, we propose position smoothing and attentive reconstruction strategies to relax this classification problem, since it is not necessary to reconstruct their exact positions in these cases. Empirical evaluations of DropPos show strong capabilities. DropPos outperforms supervised pre-training and achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art self-supervised alternatives on a wide range of downstream benchmarks. This suggests that explicitly encouraging spatial reasoning abilities, as DropPos does, indeed contributes to the improved location awareness of ViTs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/DropPos.

- **Summary**: Functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used to examine brain functionality by detecting alteration in oxygenated blood flow that arises with brain activity. In this study, complexity specific image categorization across different visual datasets is performed using fMRI time series (TS) to understand differences in neuronal activities related to vision. Publicly available BOLD5000 dataset is used for this purpose, containing fMRI scans while viewing 5254 images of diverse categories, drawn from three standard computer vision datasets: COCO, ImageNet and SUN. To understand vision, it is important to study how brain functions while looking at different images. To achieve this, spatial encoding of fMRI BOLD TS has been performed that uses classical Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and Markov Transition Field (MTF) to obtain 2D BOLD TS, representing images of COCO, Imagenet and SUN. For classification, individual GAF and MTF features are fed into regular CNN. Subsequently, parallel CNN model is employed that uses combined 2D features for classifying images across COCO, Imagenet and SUN. The result of 2D CNN models is also compared with 1D LSTM and Bi-LSTM that utilizes raw fMRI BOLD signal for classification. It is seen that parallel CNN model outperforms other network models with an improvement of 7% for multi-class classification. Clinical relevance- The obtained result of this analysis establishes a baseline in studying how differently human brain functions while looking at images of diverse complexities.

- **Summary**: In semi-supervised learning, unlabeled samples can be utilized through augmentation and consistency regularization. However, we observed certain samples, even undergoing strong augmentation, are still correctly classified with high confidence, resulting in a loss close to zero. It indicates that these samples have been already learned well and do not provide any additional optimization benefits to the model. We refer to these samples as ``naive samples". Unfortunately, existing SSL models overlook the characteristics of naive samples, and they just apply the same learning strategy to all samples. To further optimize the SSL model, we emphasize the importance of giving attention to naive samples and augmenting them in a more diverse manner. Sample adaptive augmentation (SAA) is proposed for this stated purpose and consists of two modules: 1) sample selection module; 2) sample augmentation module. Specifically, the sample selection module picks out {naive samples} based on historical training information at each epoch, then the naive samples will be augmented in a more diverse manner in the sample augmentation module. Thanks to the extreme ease of implementation of the above modules, SAA is advantageous for being simple and lightweight. We add SAA on top of FixMatch and FlexMatch respectively, and experiments demonstrate SAA can significantly improve the models. For example, SAA helped improve the accuracy of FixMatch from 92.50% to 94.76% and that of FlexMatch from 95.01% to 95.31% on CIFAR-10 with 40 labels.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D generation from a single-view image is a popular but challenging task in 3D vision. Although numerous methods have been proposed, existing works still suffer from the inconsistency issues, including 1) semantic inconsistency, 2) geometric inconsistency, and 3) saturation inconsistency, resulting in distorted, overfitted, and over-saturated generations. In light of the above issues, we present Consist3D, a three-stage framework Chasing for semantic-, geometric-, and saturation-Consistent Text-to-3D generation from a single image, in which the first two stages aim to learn parameterized consistency tokens, and the last stage is for optimization. Specifically, the semantic encoding stage learns a token independent of views and estimations, promoting semantic consistency and robustness. Meanwhile, the geometric encoding stage learns another token with comprehensive geometry and reconstruction constraints under novel-view estimations, reducing overfitting and encouraging geometric consistency. Finally, the optimization stage benefits from the semantic and geometric tokens, allowing a low classifier-free guidance scale and therefore preventing oversaturation. Experimental results demonstrate that Consist3D produces more consistent, faithful, and photo-realistic 3D assets compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, Consist3D also allows background and object editing through text prompts.

- **Summary**: Accurately localizing objects in three dimensions (3D) is crucial for various computer vision applications, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. This task finds another important application in sports analytics and, in this work, we present a novel method for 3D basketball localization from a single calibrated image. Our approach predicts the object's height in pixels in image space by estimating its projection onto the ground plane within the image, leveraging the image itself and the object's location as inputs. The 3D coordinates of the ball are then reconstructed by exploiting the known projection matrix. Extensive experiments on the public DeepSport dataset, which provides ground truth annotations for 3D ball location alongside camera calibration information for each image, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, offering substantial accuracy improvements compared to recent work. Our work opens up new possibilities for enhanced ball tracking and understanding, advancing computer vision in diverse domains.

- **Summary**: Speech enhancement seeks to extract clean speech from noisy signals. Traditional deep learning methods face two challenges: efficiently using information in long speech sequences and high computational costs. To address these, we introduce the Spiking Structured State Space Model (Spiking-S4). This approach merges the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) with the long-range sequence modeling capabilities of Structured State Space Models (S4), offering a compelling solution. Evaluation on the DNS Challenge and VoiceBank+Demand Datasets confirms that Spiking-S4 rivals existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods but with fewer computational resources, as evidenced by reduced parameters and Floating Point Operations (FLOPs).

- **Summary**: Data augmentation (DA) is a key factor in medical image analysis, such as in prostate cancer (PCa) detection on magnetic resonance images. State-of-the-art computer-aided diagnosis systems still rely on simplistic spatial transformations to preserve the pathological label post transformation. However, such augmentations do not substantially increase the organ as well as tumor shape variability in the training set, limiting the model's ability to generalize to unseen cases with more diverse localized soft-tissue deformations. We propose a new anatomy-informed transformation that leverages information from adjacent organs to simulate typical physiological deformations of the prostate and generates unique lesion shapes without altering their label. Due to its lightweight computational requirements, it can be easily integrated into common DA frameworks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our augmentation on a dataset of 774 biopsy-confirmed examinations, by evaluating a state-of-the-art method for PCa detection with different augmentation settings.

- **Summary**: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one proposed solution to large model sizes and slow inference speed in semantic segmentation. In our research we identify 25 proposed distillation loss terms from 14 publications in the last 4 years. Unfortunately, a comparison of terms based on published results is often impossible, because of differences in training configurations. A good illustration of this problem is the comparison of two publications from 2022. Using the same models and dataset, Structural and Statistical Texture Distillation (SSTKD) reports an increase of student mIoU of 4.54 and a final performance of 29.19, while Adaptive Perspective Distillation (APD) only improves student performance by 2.06 percentage points, but achieves a final performance of 39.25. The reason for such extreme differences is often a suboptimal choice of hyperparameters and a resulting underperformance of the student model used as reference point. In our work, we reveal problems of insufficient hyperparameter tuning by showing that distillation improvements of two widely accepted frameworks, SKD and IFVD, vanish when hyperparameters are optimized sufficiently. To improve comparability of future research in the field, we establish a solid baseline for three datasets and two student models and provide extensive information on hyperparameter tuning. We find that only two out of eight techniques can compete with our simple baseline on the ADE20K dataset.

- **Summary**: With strong representation capabilities, pretrained vision-language models are widely used in vision and language navigation (VLN). However, most of them are trained on web-crawled general-purpose datasets, which incurs a considerable domain gap when used for VLN tasks. Another challenge for VLN is how the agent understands the contextual relations between actions on a trajectory and performs cross-modal alignment sequentially. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompt-bAsed coNtext- and Domain-Aware (PANDA) pretraining framework to address these problems. It performs prompting in two stages. In the domain-aware stage, we apply a low-cost prompt tuning paradigm to learn soft visual prompts from an in-domain dataset for equipping the pretrained models with object-level and scene-level cross-modal alignment in VLN tasks. Furthermore, in the context-aware stage, we design a set of hard context prompts to capture the sequence-level semantics and instill both out-of-context and contextual knowledge in the instruction into cross-modal representations. They enable further tuning of the pretrained models via contrastive learning. Experimental results on both R2R and REVERIE show the superiority of PANDA compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a bonobo detection and classification pipeline built from the commonly used machine learning methods. Such application is motivated by the need to test bonobos in their enclosure using touch screen devices without human assistance. This work introduces a newly acquired dataset based on bonobo recordings generated semi-automatically. The recordings are weakly labelled and fed to a macaque detector in order to spatially detect the individual present in the video. Handcrafted features coupled with different classification algorithms and deep-learning methods using a ResNet architecture are investigated for bonobo identification. Performance is compared in terms of classification accuracy on the splits of the database using different data separation methods. We demonstrate the importance of data preparation and how a wrong data separation can lead to false good results. Finally, after a meaningful separation of the data, the best classification performance is obtained using a fine-tuned ResNet model and reaches 75% of accuracy.

- **Summary**: Models based on U-like structures have improved the performance of medical image segmentation. However, the single-layer decoder structure of U-Net is too "thin" to exploit enough information, resulting in large semantic differences between the encoder and decoder parts. Things get worse if the number of training sets of data is not sufficiently large, which is common in medical image processing tasks where annotated data are more difficult to obtain than other tasks. Based on this observation, we propose a novel U-Net model named MS-UNet for the medical image segmentation task in this study. Instead of the single-layer U-Net decoder structure used in Swin-UNet and TransUnet, we specifically design a multi-scale nested decoder based on the Swin Transformer for U-Net. The proposed multi-scale nested decoder structure allows the feature mapping between the decoder and encoder to be semantically closer, thus enabling the network to learn more detailed features. In addition, we propose a novel edge loss and a plug-and-play fine-tuning Denoising module, which not only effectively improves the segmentation performance of MS-UNet, but could also be applied to other models individually. Experimental results show that MS-UNet could effectively improve the network performance with more efficient feature learning capability and exhibit more advanced performance, especially in the extreme case with a small amount of training data, and the proposed Edge loss and Denoising module could significantly enhance the segmentation performance of MS-UNet.

- **Summary**: Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize and infer the relationships between a human and an object. Arguably, training supervised models for this task from scratch presents challenges due to the performance drop over rare classes and the high computational cost and time required to handle long-tailed distributions of HOIs in complex HOI scenes in realistic settings. This observation motivates us to design an HOI detector that can be trained even with long-tailed labeled data and can leverage existing knowledge from pre-trained models. Inspired by the powerful generalization ability of the large Vision-Language Models (VLM) on classification and retrieval tasks, we propose an efficient Adaptive HOI Detector with Concept-guided Memory (ADA-CM). ADA-CM has two operating modes. The first mode makes it tunable without learning new parameters in a training-free paradigm. Its second mode incorporates an instance-aware adapter mechanism that can further efficiently boost performance if updating a lightweight set of parameters can be afforded. Our proposed method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets with much less training time. Code can be found at https://github.com/ltttpku/ADA-CM.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel reconstruction method that leverages Diffusion Models to protect machine learning classifiers against adversarial attacks, all without requiring any modifications to the classifiers themselves. The susceptibility of machine learning models to minor input perturbations renders them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While diffusion-based methods are typically disregarded for adversarial defense due to their slow reverse process, this paper demonstrates that our proposed method offers robustness against adversarial threats while preserving clean accuracy, speed, and plug-and-play compatibility.

- **Summary**: Roof plane segmentation from airborne LiDAR point clouds is an important technology for 3D building model reconstruction. One of the key issues of plane segmentation is how to design powerful features that can exactly distinguish adjacent planar patches. The quality of point feature directly determines the accuracy of roof plane segmentation. Most of existing approaches use handcrafted features to extract roof planes. However, the abilities of these features are relatively low, especially in boundary area. To solve this problem, we propose a boundary-aware point clustering approach in Euclidean and embedding spaces constructed by a multi-task deep network for roof plane segmentation. We design a three-branch network to predict semantic labels, point offsets and extract deep embedding features. In the first branch, we classify the input data as non-roof, boundary and plane points. In the second branch, we predict point offsets for shifting each point toward its respective instance center. In the third branch, we constrain that points of the same plane instance should have the similar embeddings. We aim to ensure that points of the same plane instance are close as much as possible in both Euclidean and embedding spaces. However, although deep network has strong feature representative ability, it is still hard to accurately distinguish points near plane instance boundary. Therefore, we first group plane points into many clusters in the two spaces, and then we assign the rest boundary points to their closest clusters to generate final complete roof planes. In this way, we can effectively reduce the influence of unreliable boundary points. In addition, we construct a synthetic dataset and a real dataset to train and evaluate our approach. The experiments results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based architectures have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. However, such models are likely to disregard crucial visual cues and often rely on multimodal shortcuts and inherent biases of the language modality to predict the correct answer, a phenomenon commonly referred to as lack of visual grounding. In this work, we alleviate this shortcoming through a novel architecture for visual question answering that leverages common sense reasoning as a supervisory signal. Reasoning supervision takes the form of a textual justification of the correct answer, with such annotations being already available on large-scale Visual Common Sense Reasoning (VCR) datasets. The model's visual attention is guided toward important elements of the scene through a similarity loss that aligns the learned attention distributions guided by the question and the correct reasoning. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that the proposed approach can boost the model's visual perception capability and lead to performance increase, without requiring training on explicit grounding annotations.

- **Summary**: Training a generative model with limited number of samples is a challenging task. Current methods primarily rely on few-shot model adaption to train the network. However, in scenarios where data is extremely limited (less than 10), the generative network tends to overfit and suffers from content degradation. To address these problems, we propose a novel phasic content fusing few-shot diffusion model with directional distribution consistency loss, which targets different learning objectives at distinct training stages of the diffusion model. Specifically, we design a phasic training strategy with phasic content fusion to help our model learn content and style information when t is large, and learn local details of target domain when t is small, leading to an improvement in the capture of content, style and local details. Furthermore, we introduce a novel directional distribution consistency loss that ensures the consistency between the generated and source distributions more efficiently and stably than the prior methods, preventing our model from overfitting. Finally, we propose a cross-domain structure guidance strategy that enhances structure consistency during domain adaptation. Theoretical analysis, qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in few-shot generative model adaption tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Thanks to the complementary nature of millimeter wave radar and camera, deep learning-based radar-camera 3D object detection methods may reliably produce accurate detections even in low-visibility conditions. This makes them preferable to use in autonomous vehicles' perception systems, especially as the combined cost of both sensors is cheaper than the cost of a lidar. Recent radar-camera methods commonly perform feature-level fusion which often involves projecting the radar points onto the same plane as the image features and fusing the extracted features from both modalities. While performing fusion on the image plane is generally simpler and faster, projecting radar points onto the image plane flattens the depth dimension of the point cloud which might lead to information loss and makes extracting the spatial features of the point cloud harder. We proposed ClusterFusion, an architecture that leverages the local spatial features of the radar point cloud by clustering the point cloud and performing feature extraction directly on the point cloud clusters before projecting the features onto the image plane. ClusterFusion achieved the state-of-the-art performance among all radar-monocular camera methods on the test slice of the nuScenes dataset with 48.7% nuScenes detection score (NDS). We also investigated the performance of different radar feature extraction strategies on point cloud clusters: a handcrafted strategy, a learning-based strategy, and a combination of both, and found that the handcrafted strategy yielded the best performance. The main goal of this work is to explore the use of radar's local spatial and point-wise features by extracting them directly from radar point cloud clusters for a radar-monocular camera 3D object detection method that performs cross-modal feature fusion on the image plane.

- **Summary**: Recently, deep learning-based methods achieved promising performance in nuclei detection and classification applications. However, training deep learning-based methods requires a large amount of pixel-wise annotated data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially in 3D images. An alternative approach is to adapt weak-annotation methods, such as labeling each nucleus with a point, but this method does not extend from 2D histopathology images (for which it was originally developed) to 3D immunofluorescent images. The reason is that 3D images contain multiple channels (z-axis) for nuclei and different markers separately, which makes training using point annotations difficult. To address this challenge, we propose the Label-efficient Contrastive learning-based (LECL) model to detect and classify various types of nuclei in 3D immunofluorescent images. Previous methods use Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) to convert immunofluorescent images with multiple slices to 2D images, which can cause signals from different z-stacks to falsely appear associated with each other. To overcome this, we devised an Extended Maximum Intensity Projection (EMIP) approach that addresses issues using MIP. Furthermore, we performed a Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) approach for weakly supervised settings. We conducted experiments on cardiovascular datasets and found that our proposed framework is effective and efficient in detecting and classifying various types of nuclei in 3D immunofluorescent images.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in the autonomous driving stack by enabling autonomous vehicles to anticipate the motion of surrounding agents. Goal-based prediction models have gained traction in recent years for addressing the multimodal nature of future trajectories. Goal-based prediction models simplify multimodal prediction by first predicting 2D goal locations of agents and then predicting trajectories conditioned on each goal. However, a single 2D goal location serves as a weak inductive bias for predicting the whole trajectory, often leading to poor map compliance, i.e., part of the trajectory going off-road or breaking traffic rules. In this paper, we improve upon goal-based prediction by proposing the Path-based prediction (PBP) approach. PBP predicts a discrete probability distribution over reference paths in the HD map using the path features and predicts trajectories in the path-relative Frenet frame. We applied the PBP trajectory decoder on top of the HiVT scene encoder and report results on the Argoverse dataset. Our experiments show that PBP achieves competitive performance on the standard trajectory prediction metrics, while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of map compliance.

- **Summary**: Early detection of cardiac dysfunction through routine screening is vital for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. An important metric of cardiac function is the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), where lower EF is associated with cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography is a popular diagnostic tool in cardiology, with ultrasound being a low-cost, real-time, and non-ionizing technology. However, human assessment of echocardiograms for calculating EF is time-consuming and expertise-demanding, raising the need for an automated approach. In this work, we propose using the M(otion)-mode of echocardiograms for estimating the EF and classifying cardiomyopathy. We generate multiple artificial M-mode images from a single echocardiogram and combine them using off-the-shelf model architectures. Additionally, we extend contrastive learning (CL) to cardiac imaging to learn meaningful representations from exploiting structures in unlabeled data allowing the model to achieve high accuracy, even with limited annotations. Our experiments show that the supervised setting converges with only ten modes and is comparable to the baseline method while bypassing its cumbersome training process and being computationally much more efficient. Furthermore, CL using M-mode images is helpful for limited data scenarios, such as having labels for only 200 patients, which is common in medical applications.

- **Summary**: Recognising reinforced concrete defects (RCDs) is a crucial element for determining the structural integrity, traffic safety and durability of bridges. However, most of the existing datasets in the RCD domain are derived from a small number of bridges acquired in specific camera poses, lighting conditions and with fixed hardware. These limitations question the usability of models trained on such open-source data in real-world scenarios. We address this problem by testing such models on our "dacl1k" dataset, a highly diverse RCD dataset for multi-label classification based on building inspections including 1,474 images. Thereby, we trained the models on different combinations of open-source data (meta datasets) which were subsequently evaluated both extrinsically and intrinsically. During extrinsic evaluation, we report metrics on dacl1k and the meta datasets. The performance analysis on dacl1k shows practical usability of the meta data, where the best model shows an Exact Match Ratio of 32%. Additionally, we conduct an intrinsic evaluation by clustering the bottleneck features of the best model derived from the extrinsic evaluation in order to find out, if the model has learned distinguishing datasets or the classes (RCDs) which is the aspired goal.

- **Summary**: Color image completion is a challenging problem in computer vision, but recent research has shown that quaternion representations of color images perform well in many areas. These representations consider the entire color image and effectively utilize coupling information between the three color channels. Consequently, low-rank quaternion matrix completion (LRQMC) algorithms have gained significant attention. We propose a method based on quaternion Qatar Riyal decomposition (QQR) and quaternion $L_{2,1}$-norm called QLNM-QQR. This new approach reduces computational complexity by avoiding the need to calculate the QSVD of large quaternion matrices. We also present two improvements to the QLNM-QQR method: an enhanced version called IRQLNM-QQR that uses iteratively reweighted quaternion $L_{2,1}$-norm minimization and a method called QLNM-QQR-SR that integrates sparse regularization. Our experiments on natural color images and color medical images show that IRQLNM-QQR outperforms QLNM-QQR and that the proposed QLNM-QQR-SR method is superior to several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in the field of deep learning and impressive performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) for perception have resulted in an increased demand for their use in automated driving (AD) systems. The safety of such systems is of utmost importance and thus requires to consider the unique properties of DNNs.   In order to achieve safety of AD systems with DNN-based perception components in a systematic and comprehensive approach, so-called safety concerns have been introduced as a suitable structuring element. On the one hand, the concept of safety concerns is -- by design -- well aligned to existing standards relevant for safety of AD systems such as ISO 21448 (SOTIF). On the other hand, it has already inspired several academic publications and upcoming standards on AI safety such as ISO PAS 8800.   While the concept of safety concerns has been previously introduced, this paper extends and refines it, leveraging feedback from various domain and safety experts in the field. In particular, this paper introduces an additional categorization for a better understanding as well as enabling cross-functional teams to jointly address the concerns.

- **Summary**: In many parts of the world, the use of vast amounts of data collected on public roadways for autonomous driving has increased. In order to detect and anonymize pedestrian faces and nearby car license plates in actual road-driving scenarios, there is an urgent need for effective solutions. As more data is collected, privacy concerns regarding it increase, including but not limited to pedestrian faces and surrounding vehicle license plates. Normal and fisheye cameras are the two common camera types that are typically mounted on collection vehicles. With complex camera distortion models, fisheye camera images were deformed in contrast to regular images. It causes computer vision tasks to perform poorly when using numerous deep learning models. In this work, we pay particular attention to protecting privacy while yet adhering to several laws for fisheye camera photos taken by driverless vehicles. First, we suggest a framework for extracting face and plate identification knowledge from several teacher models. Our second suggestion is to transform both the image and the label from a regular image to fisheye-like data using a varied and realistic fisheye transformation. Finally, we run a test using the open-source PP4AV dataset. The experimental findings demonstrated that our model outperformed baseline methods when trained on data from autonomous vehicles, even when the data were softly labeled.

- **Summary**: Existing neural field representations for 3D object reconstruction either (1) utilize object-level representations, but suffer from low-quality details due to conditioning on a global latent code, or (2) are able to perfectly reconstruct the observations, but fail to utilize object-level prior knowledge to infer unobserved regions. We present SimNP, a method to learn category-level self-similarities, which combines the advantages of both worlds by connecting neural point radiance fields with a category-level self-similarity representation. Our contribution is two-fold. (1) We design the first neural point representation on a category level by utilizing the concept of coherent point clouds. The resulting neural point radiance fields store a high level of detail for locally supported object regions. (2) We learn how information is shared between neural points in an unconstrained and unsupervised fashion, which allows to derive unobserved regions of an object during the reconstruction process from given observations. We show that SimNP is able to outperform previous methods in reconstructing symmetric unseen object regions, surpassing methods that build upon category-level or pixel-aligned radiance fields, while providing semantic correspondences between instances

- **Summary**: Scene reconstruction in the presence of high-speed motion and low illumination is important in many applications such as augmented and virtual reality, drone navigation, and autonomous robotics. Traditional motion estimation techniques fail in such conditions, suffering from too much blur in the presence of high-speed motion and strong noise in low-light conditions. Single-photon cameras have recently emerged as a promising technology capable of capturing hundreds of thousands of photon frames per second thanks to their high speed and extreme sensitivity. Unfortunately, traditional computer vision techniques are not well suited for dealing with the binary-valued photon data captured by these cameras because these are corrupted by extreme Poisson noise. Here we present a method capable of estimating extreme scene motion under challenging conditions, such as low light or high dynamic range, from a sequence of high-speed image frames such as those captured by a single-photon camera. Our method relies on iteratively improving a motion estimate by grouping and aggregating frames after-the-fact, in a stratified manner. We demonstrate the creation of high-quality panoramas under fast motion and extremely low light, and super-resolution results using a custom single-photon camera prototype.

- **Summary**: We present a novel human body model formulated by an extensive set of anthropocentric measurements, which is capable of generating a wide range of human body shapes and poses. The proposed model enables direct modeling of specific human identities through a deep generative architecture, which can produce humans in any arbitrary pose. It is the first of its kind to have been trained end-to-end using only synthetically generated data, which not only provides highly accurate human mesh representations but also allows for precise anthropometry of the body. Moreover, using a highly diverse animation library, we articulated our synthetic humans' body and hands to maximize the diversity of the learnable priors for model training. Our model was trained on a dataset of $100k$ procedurally-generated posed human meshes and their corresponding anthropometric measurements. Our synthetic data generator can be used to generate millions of unique human identities and poses for non-commercial academic research purposes.

- **Summary**: Recent developments in text-conditioned image generative models have revolutionized the production of realistic results. Unfortunately, this has also led to an increase in privacy violations and the spread of false information, which requires the need for traceability, privacy protection, and other security measures. However, existing text-to-image paradigms lack the technical capabilities to link traceable messages with image generation. In this study, we introduce a novel task for the joint generation of text to image and watermark (T2IW). This T2IW scheme ensures minimal damage to image quality when generating a compound image by forcing the semantic feature and the watermark signal to be compatible in pixels. Additionally, by utilizing principles from Shannon information theory and non-cooperative game theory, we are able to separate the revealed image and the revealed watermark from the compound image. Furthermore, we strengthen the watermark robustness of our approach by subjecting the compound image to various post-processing attacks, with minimal pixel distortion observed in the revealed watermark. Extensive experiments have demonstrated remarkable achievements in image quality, watermark invisibility, and watermark robustness, supported by our proposed set of evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: High Dynamic Range (HDR) content creation has become an important topic for modern media and entertainment sectors, gaming and Augmented/Virtual Reality industries. Many methods have been proposed to recreate the HDR counterparts of input Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images/videos given a single exposure or multi-exposure LDRs. The state-of-the-art methods focus primarily on the preservation of the reconstruction's structural similarity and the pixel-wise accuracy. However, these conventional approaches do not emphasize preserving the artistic intent of the images in terms of human visual perception, which is an essential element in media, entertainment and gaming. In this paper, we attempt to study and fill this gap. We propose an architecture called ArtHDR-Net based on a Convolutional Neural Network that uses multi-exposed LDR features as input. Experimental results show that ArtHDR-Net can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of the HDR-VDP-2 score (i.e., mean opinion score index) while reaching competitive performance in terms of PSNR and SSIM.

- **Summary**: Multi-task learning (MTL) is a powerful approach in deep learning that leverages the information from multiple tasks during training to improve model performance. In medical imaging, MTL has shown great potential to solve various tasks. However, existing MTL architectures in medical imaging are limited in sharing information across tasks, reducing the potential performance improvements of MTL. In this study, we introduce a novel attention-based MTL framework to better leverage inter-task interactions for various tasks from pixel-level to image-level predictions. Specifically, we propose a Cross-Task Attention Network (CTAN) which utilizes cross-task attention mechanisms to incorporate information by interacting across tasks. We validated CTAN on four medical imaging datasets that span different domains and tasks including: radiation treatment planning prediction using planning CT images of two different target cancers (Prostate, OpenKBP); pigmented skin lesion segmentation and diagnosis using dermatoscopic images (HAM10000); and COVID-19 diagnosis and severity prediction using chest CT scans (STOIC). Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of CTAN in improving the accuracy of medical imaging tasks. Compared to standard single-task learning (STL), CTAN demonstrated a 4.67% improvement in performance and outperformed both widely used MTL baselines: hard parameter sharing (HPS) with an average performance improvement of 3.22%; and multi-task attention network (MTAN) with a relative decrease of 5.38%. These findings highlight the significance of our proposed MTL framework in solving medical imaging tasks and its potential to improve their accuracy across domains.

- **Summary**: Survival analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the time until specific events, such as death or cancer recurrence, based on baseline observations. This is particularly useful in healthcare to prognostically predict clinically important events based on patient data. However, existing approaches often have limitations; some focus only on ranking patients by survivability, neglecting to estimate the actual event time, while others treat the problem as a classification task, ignoring the inherent time-ordered structure of the events. Furthermore, the effective utilization of censored samples - training data points where the exact event time is unknown - is essential for improving the predictive accuracy of the model. In this paper, we introduce CenTime, a novel approach to survival analysis that directly estimates the time to event. Our method features an innovative event-conditional censoring mechanism that performs robustly even when uncensored data is scarce. We demonstrate that our approach forms a consistent estimator for the event model parameters, even in the absence of uncensored data. Furthermore, CenTime is easily integrated with deep learning models with no restrictions on batch size or the number of uncensored samples. We compare our approach with standard survival analysis methods, including the Cox proportional-hazard model and DeepHit. Our results indicate that CenTime offers state-of-the-art performance in predicting time-to-death while maintaining comparable ranking performance. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ahmedhshahin/CenTime.

- **Summary**: Training deep learning models for video classification from audio-visual data commonly requires immense amounts of labeled training data collected via a costly process. A challenging and underexplored, yet much cheaper, setup is few-shot learning from video data. In particular, the inherently multi-modal nature of video data with sound and visual information has not been leveraged extensively for the few-shot video classification task. Therefore, we introduce a unified audio-visual few-shot video classification benchmark on three datasets, i.e. the VGGSound-FSL, UCF-FSL, ActivityNet-FSL datasets, where we adapt and compare ten methods. In addition, we propose AV-DIFF, a text-to-feature diffusion framework, which first fuses the temporal and audio-visual features via cross-modal attention and then generates multi-modal features for the novel classes. We show that AV-DIFF obtains state-of-the-art performance on our proposed benchmark for audio-visual (generalised) few-shot learning. Our benchmark paves the way for effective audio-visual classification when only limited labeled data is available. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/AVDIFF-GFSL.

- **Summary**: It has been established that training a box-based detector network can enhance the localization performance of weakly supervised and unsupervised methods. Moreover, we extend this understanding by demonstrating that these detectors can be utilized to improve the original network, paving the way for further advancements. To accomplish this, we train the detectors on top of the network output instead of the image data and apply suitable loss backpropagation. Our findings reveal a significant improvement in phrase grounding for the ``what is where by looking'' task, as well as various methods of unsupervised object discovery.

- **Summary**: Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machine learning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various frameworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels. However, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the difficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation algorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation protocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performing HPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are not available. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progress compared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using good evaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteria and using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there are challenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology including Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), and Test Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically achievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using proper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously unexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, our improved practices covering data, training, validation and hyperparameter optimisation form a new rigorous pipeline to improve benchmarking, and hence research progress, within this important field going forward.

- **Summary**: We present ArtiGrasp, a novel method to synthesize bi-manual hand-object interactions that include grasping and articulation. This task is challenging due to the diversity of the global wrist motions and the precise finger control that are necessary to articulate objects. ArtiGrasp leverages reinforcement learning and physics simulations to train a policy that controls the global and local hand pose. Our framework unifies grasping and articulation within a single policy guided by a single hand pose reference. Moreover, to facilitate the training of the precise finger control required for articulation, we present a learning curriculum with increasing difficulty. It starts with single-hand manipulation of stationary objects and continues with multi-agent training including both hands and non-stationary objects. To evaluate our method, we introduce Dynamic Object Grasping and Articulation, a task that involves bringing an object into a target articulated pose. This task requires grasping, relocation, and articulation. We show our method's efficacy towards this task. We further demonstrate that our method can generate motions with noisy hand-object pose estimates from an off-the-shelf image-based regressor.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Data is the cornerstone of deep learning. This paper reveals that the recently developed Diffusion Model is a scalable data engine for object detection. Existing methods for scaling up detection-oriented data often require manual collection or generative models to obtain target images, followed by data augmentation and labeling to produce training pairs, which are costly, complex, or lacking diversity. To address these issues, we presentDiffusionEngine (DE), a data scaling-up engine that provides high-quality detection-oriented training pairs in a single stage. DE consists of a pre-trained diffusion model and an effective Detection-Adapter, contributing to generating scalable, diverse and generalizable detection data in a plug-and-play manner. Detection-Adapter is learned to align the implicit semantic and location knowledge in off-the-shelf diffusion models with detection-aware signals to make better bounding-box predictions. Additionally, we contribute two datasets, i.e., COCO-DE and VOC-DE, to scale up existing detection benchmarks for facilitating follow-up research. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data scaling-up via DE can achieve significant improvements in diverse scenarios, such as various detection algorithms, self-supervised pre-training, data-sparse, label-scarce, cross-domain, and semi-supervised learning. For example, when using DE with a DINO-based adapter to scale up data, mAP is improved by 3.1% on COCO, 7.6% on VOC, and 11.5% on Clipart.

- **Summary**: We present InstructDiffusion, a unifying and generic framework for aligning computer vision tasks with human instructions. Unlike existing approaches that integrate prior knowledge and pre-define the output space (e.g., categories and coordinates) for each vision task, we cast diverse vision tasks into a human-intuitive image-manipulating process whose output space is a flexible and interactive pixel space. Concretely, the model is built upon the diffusion process and is trained to predict pixels according to user instructions, such as encircling the man's left shoulder in red or applying a blue mask to the left car. InstructDiffusion could handle a variety of vision tasks, including understanding tasks (such as segmentation and keypoint detection) and generative tasks (such as editing and enhancement). It even exhibits the ability to handle unseen tasks and outperforms prior methods on novel datasets. This represents a significant step towards a generalist modeling interface for vision tasks, advancing artificial general intelligence in the field of computer vision.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Flow-based propagation and spatiotemporal Transformer are two mainstream mechanisms in video inpainting (VI). Despite the effectiveness of these components, they still suffer from some limitations that affect their performance. Previous propagation-based approaches are performed separately either in the image or feature domain. Global image propagation isolated from learning may cause spatial misalignment due to inaccurate optical flow. Moreover, memory or computational constraints limit the temporal range of feature propagation and video Transformer, preventing exploration of correspondence information from distant frames. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework, called ProPainter, which involves enhanced ProPagation and an efficient Transformer. Specifically, we introduce dual-domain propagation that combines the advantages of image and feature warping, exploiting global correspondences reliably. We also propose a mask-guided sparse video Transformer, which achieves high efficiency by discarding unnecessary and redundant tokens. With these components, ProPainter outperforms prior arts by a large margin of 1.46 dB in PSNR while maintaining appealing efficiency.

- **Summary**: Not all camouflages are equally effective, as even a partially visible contour or a slight color difference can make the animal stand out and break its camouflage. In this paper, we address the question of what makes a camouflage successful, by proposing three scores for automatically assessing its effectiveness. In particular, we show that camouflage can be measured by the similarity between background and foreground features and boundary visibility. We use these camouflage scores to assess and compare all available camouflage datasets. We also incorporate the proposed camouflage score into a generative model as an auxiliary loss and show that effective camouflage images or videos can be synthesised in a scalable manner. The generated synthetic dataset is used to train a transformer-based model for segmenting camouflaged animals in videos. Experimentally, we demonstrate state-of-the-art camouflage breaking performance on the public MoCA-Mask benchmark.

- **Summary**: Deep learning is commonly used to reconstruct HDR images from LDR images. LDR stack-based methods are used for single-image HDR reconstruction, generating an HDR image from a deep learning-generated LDR stack. However, current methods generate the stack with predetermined exposure values (EVs), which may limit the quality of HDR reconstruction. To address this, we propose the continuous exposure value representation (CEVR), which uses an implicit function to generate LDR images with arbitrary EVs, including those unseen during training. Our approach generates a continuous stack with more images containing diverse EVs, significantly improving HDR reconstruction. We use a cycle training strategy to supervise the model in generating continuous EV LDR images without corresponding ground truths. Our CEVR model outperforms existing methods, as demonstrated by experimental results.

- **Summary**: Training data for video segmentation are expensive to annotate. This impedes extensions of end-to-end algorithms to new video segmentation tasks, especially in large-vocabulary settings. To 'track anything' without training on video data for every individual task, we develop a decoupled video segmentation approach (DEVA), composed of task-specific image-level segmentation and class/task-agnostic bi-directional temporal propagation. Due to this design, we only need an image-level model for the target task (which is cheaper to train) and a universal temporal propagation model which is trained once and generalizes across tasks. To effectively combine these two modules, we use bi-directional propagation for (semi-)online fusion of segmentation hypotheses from different frames to generate a coherent segmentation. We show that this decoupled formulation compares favorably to end-to-end approaches in several data-scarce tasks including large-vocabulary video panoptic segmentation, open-world video segmentation, referring video segmentation, and unsupervised video object segmentation.

- **Summary**: Due to the difficulty in scaling up, generative adversarial networks (GANs) seem to be falling from grace on the task of text-conditioned image synthesis. Sparsely-activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has recently been demonstrated as a valid solution to training large-scale models with limited computational resources. Inspired by such a philosophy, we present Aurora, a GAN-based text-to-image generator that employs a collection of experts to learn feature processing, together with a sparse router to help select the most suitable expert for each feature point. To faithfully decode the sampling stochasticity and the text condition to the final synthesis, our router adaptively makes its decision by taking into account the text-integrated global latent code. At 64x64 image resolution, our model trained on LAION2B-en and COYO-700M achieves 6.2 zero-shot FID on MS COCO. We release the code and checkpoints to facilitate the community for further development.

- **Summary**: We present ImageBind-LLM, a multi-modality instruction tuning method of large language models (LLMs) via ImageBind. Existing works mainly focus on language and image instruction tuning, different from which, our ImageBind-LLM can respond to multi-modality conditions, including audio, 3D point clouds, video, and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training. During training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space between LLaMA and ImageBind's image encoder. Then, the image features transformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers in LLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-free and zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of ImageBind, the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superior multi-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference, the multi-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders, and processed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding enhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million image features extracted by ImageBind, which effectively mitigates the training-inference modality discrepancy. Notably, with our approach, ImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstrate significant language generation quality.

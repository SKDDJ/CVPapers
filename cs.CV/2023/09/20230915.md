- **Summary**: Loop closing and relocalization are crucial techniques to establish reliable and robust long-term SLAM by addressing pose estimation drift and degeneration. This article begins by formulating loop closing and relocalization within a unified framework. Then, we propose a novel multi-head network LCR-Net to tackle both tasks effectively. It exploits novel feature extraction and pose-aware attention mechanism to precisely estimate similarities and 6-DoF poses between pairs of LiDAR scans. In the end, we integrate our LCR-Net into a SLAM system and achieve robust and accurate online LiDAR SLAM in outdoor driving environments. We thoroughly evaluate our LCR-Net through three setups derived from loop closing and relocalization, including candidate retrieval, closed-loop point cloud registration, and continuous relocalization using multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that LCR-Net excels in all three tasks, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and exhibiting a remarkable generalization ability. Notably, our LCR-Net outperforms baseline methods without using a time-consuming robust pose estimator, rendering it suitable for online SLAM applications. To our best knowledge, the integration of LCR-Net yields the first LiDAR SLAM with the capability of deep loop closing and relocalization. The implementation of our methods will be made open-source.

- **Summary**: Action recognition is a key technology for many industrial applications. Methods using visual information such as images are very popular. However, privacy issues prevent widespread usage due to the inclusion of private information, such as visible faces and scene backgrounds, which are not necessary for recognizing user action. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving action recognition by ultrasound active sensing. As action recognition from ultrasound active sensing in a non-invasive manner is not well investigated, we create a new dataset for action recognition and conduct a comparison of features for classification. We calculated feature values by focusing on the temporal variation of the amplitude of ultrasound reflected waves and performed classification using a support vector machine and VGG for eight fundamental action classes. We confirmed that our method achieved an accuracy of 97.9% when trained and evaluated on the same person and in the same environment. Additionally, our method achieved an accuracy of 89.5% even when trained and evaluated on different people. We also report the analyses of accuracies in various conditions and limitations.

- **Summary**: The challenge in fine-grained visual categorization lies in how to explore the subtle differences between different subclasses and achieve accurate discrimination. Previous research has relied on large-scale annotated data and pre-trained deep models to achieve the objective. However, when only a limited amount of samples is available, similar methods may become less effective. Diffusion models have been widely adopted in data augmentation due to their outstanding diversity in data generation. However, the high level of detail required for fine-grained images makes it challenging for existing methods to be directly employed. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach termed the detail reinforcement diffusion model~(DRDM), which leverages the rich knowledge of large models for fine-grained data augmentation and comprises two key components including discriminative semantic recombination (DSR) and spatial knowledge reference~(SKR). Specifically, DSR is designed to extract implicit similarity relationships from the labels and reconstruct the semantic mapping between labels and instances, which enables better discrimination of subtle differences between different subclasses. Furthermore, we introduce the SKR module, which incorporates the distributions of different datasets as references in the feature space. This allows the SKR to aggregate the high-dimensional distribution of subclass features in few-shot FGVC tasks, thus expanding the decision boundary. Through these two critical components, we effectively utilize the knowledge from large models to address the issue of data scarcity, resulting in improved performance for fine-grained visual recognition tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent performance gain offered by our DRDM.

- **Summary**: A transhumeral prosthesis restores missing anatomical segments below the shoulder, including the hand. Active prostheses utilize real-valued, continuous sensor data to recognize patient target poses, or goals, and proactively move the artificial limb. Previous studies have examined how well the data collected in stationary poses, without considering the time steps, can help discriminate the goals. In this case study paper, we focus on using time series data from surface electromyography electrodes and kinematic sensors to sequentially recognize patients' goals. Our approach involves transforming the data into discrete events and training an existing process mining-based goal recognition system. Results from data collected in a virtual reality setting with ten subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed goal recognition approach, which achieves significantly better precision and recall than the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and is less confident when wrong, which is beneficial when approximating smoother movements of prostheses.



### MetaF2N: Blind Image Super-Resolution by Learning Efficient Model Adaptation from Faces

- **Summary**: Due to their highly structured characteristics, faces are easier to recover than natural scenes for blind image super-resolution. Therefore, we can extract the degradation representation of an image from the low-quality and recovered face pairs. Using the degradation representation, realistic low-quality images can then be synthesized to fine-tune the super-resolution model for the real-world low-quality image. However, such a procedure is time-consuming and laborious, and the gaps between recovered faces and the ground-truths further increase the optimization uncertainty. To facilitate efficient model adaptation towards image-specific degradations, we propose a method dubbed MetaF2N, which leverages the contained Faces to fine-tune model parameters for adapting to the whole Natural image in a Meta-learning framework. The degradation extraction and low-quality image synthesis steps are thus circumvented in our MetaF2N, and it requires only one fine-tuning step to get decent performance. Considering the gaps between the recovered faces and ground-truths, we further deploy a MaskNet for adaptively predicting loss weights at different positions to reduce the impact of low-confidence areas. To evaluate our proposed MetaF2N, we have collected a real-world low-quality dataset with one or multiple faces in each image, and our MetaF2N achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Source code, pre-trained models, and collected datasets are available at https://github.com/yinzhicun/MetaF2N.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel approach to generating omni-directional images from a single snapshot picture. The previous method has relied on the generative adversarial networks based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). Although this method has successfully generated omni-directional images, CNN has two drawbacks for this task. First, since a convolutional layer only processes a local area, it is difficult to propagate the information of an input snapshot picture embedded in the center of the omni-directional image to the edges of the image. Thus, the omni-directional images created by the CNN-based generator tend to have less diversity at the edges of the generated images, creating similar scene images. Second, the CNN-based model requires large video memory in graphics processing units due to the nature of the deep structure in CNN since shallow-layer networks only receives signals from a limited range of the receptive field. To solve these problems, MLPMixer-based method was proposed in this paper. The MLPMixer has been proposed as an alternative to the self-attention in the transformer, which captures long-range dependencies and contextual information. This enables to propagate information efficiently in the omni-directional image generation task. As a result, competitive performance has been achieved with reduced memory consumption and computational cost, in addition to increasing diversity of the generated omni-directional images.

- **Summary**: Towards flexible object-centric visual perception, we propose a one-shot instance-aware object keypoint (OKP) extraction approach, AnyOKP, which leverages the powerful representation ability of pretrained vision transformer (ViT), and can obtain keypoints on multiple object instances of arbitrary category after learning from a support image. An off-the-shelf petrained ViT is directly deployed for generalizable and transferable feature extraction, which is followed by training-free feature enhancement. The best-prototype pairs (BPPs) are searched for in support and query images based on appearance similarity, to yield instance-unaware candidate keypoints.Then, the entire graph with all candidate keypoints as vertices are divided to sub-graphs according to the feature distributions on the graph edges. Finally, each sub-graph represents an object instance. AnyOKP is evaluated on real object images collected with the cameras of a robot arm, a mobile robot, and a surgical robot, which not only demonstrates the cross-category flexibility and instance awareness, but also show remarkable robustness to domain shift and viewpoint change.

- **Summary**: Computer vision (CV) pipelines are typically evaluated on datasets processed by image signal processing (ISP) pipelines even though, for resource-constrained applications, an important research goal is to avoid as many ISP steps as possible. In particular, most CV datasets consist of global shutter (GS) images even though most cameras today use a rolling shutter (RS). This paper studies the impact of different shutter mechanisms on machine learning (ML) object detection models on a synthetic dataset that we generate using the advanced simulation capabilities of Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). In particular, we train and evaluate mainstream detection models with our synthetically-generated paired GS and RS datasets to ascertain whether there exists a significant difference in detection accuracy between these two shutter modalities, especially when capturing low-speed objects (e.g., pedestrians). The results of this emulation framework indicate the performance between them are remarkably congruent for coarse-grained detection (mean average precision (mAP) for IOU=0.5), but have significant differences for fine-grained measures of detection accuracy (mAP for IOU=0.5:0.95). This implies that ML pipelines might not need explicit correction for RS for many object detection applications, but mitigating RS effects in ISP-less ML pipelines that target fine-grained location of the objects may need additional research.

- **Summary**: Omni-directional images have been used in wide range of applications. For the applications, it would be useful to estimate saliency maps representing probability distributions of gazing points with a head-mounted display, to detect important regions in the omni-directional images. This paper proposes a novel saliency-map estimation model for the omni-directional images by extracting overlapping 2-dimensional (2D) plane images from omni-directional images at various directions and angles of view. While 2D saliency maps tend to have high probability at the center of images (center bias), the high-probability region appears at horizontal directions in omni-directional saliency maps when a head-mounted display is used (equator bias). Therefore, the 2D saliency model with a center-bias layer was fine-tuned with an omni-directional dataset by replacing the center-bias layer to an equator-bias layer conditioned on the elevation angle for the extraction of the 2D plane image. The limited availability of omni-directional images in saliency datasets can be compensated by using the well-established 2D saliency model pretrained by a large number of training images with the ground truth of 2D saliency maps. In addition, this paper proposes a multi-scale estimation method by extracting 2D images in multiple angles of view to detect objects of various sizes with variable receptive fields. The saliency maps estimated from the multiple angles of view were integrated by using pixel-wise attention weights calculated in an integration layer for weighting the optimal scale to each object. The proposed method was evaluated using a publicly available dataset with evaluation metrics for omni-directional saliency maps. It was confirmed that the accuracy of the saliency maps was improved by the proposed method.

- **Summary**: With the huge technological advances introduced by deep learning in audio & speech processing, many novel synthetic speech techniques achieved incredible realistic results. As these methods generate realistic fake human voices, they can be used in malicious acts such as people imitation, fake news, spreading, spoofing, media manipulations, etc. Hence, the ability to detect synthetic or natural speech has become an urgent necessity. Moreover, being able to tell which algorithm has been used to generate a synthetic speech track can be of preeminent importance to track down the culprit. In this paper, a novel strategy is proposed to attribute a synthetic speech track to the generator that is used to synthesize it. The proposed detector transforms the audio into log-mel spectrogram, extracts features using CNN, and classifies it between five known and unknown algorithms, utilizing semi-supervision and ensemble to improve its robustness and generalizability significantly. The proposed detector is validated on two evaluation datasets consisting of a total of 18,000 weakly perturbed (Eval 1) & 10,000 strongly perturbed (Eval 2) synthetic speeches. The proposed method outperforms other top teams in accuracy by 12-13% on Eval 2 and 1-2% on Eval 1, in the IEEE SP Cup challenge at ICASSP 2022.

- **Summary**: Despite the success of deep learning-based object detection methods in recent years, it is still challenging to make the object detector reliable in adverse weather conditions such as rain and snow. For the robust performance of object detectors, unsupervised domain adaptation has been utilized to adapt the detection network trained on clear weather images to adverse weather images. While previous methods do not explicitly address weather corruption during adaptation, the domain gap between clear and adverse weather can be decomposed into two factors with distinct characteristics: a style gap and a weather gap. In this paper, we present an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for object detection that can more effectively adapt to real-world environments with adverse weather conditions by addressing these two gaps separately. Our method resolves the style gap by concentrating on style-related information of high-level features using an attention module. Using self-supervised contrastive learning, our framework then reduces the weather gap and acquires instance features that are robust to weather corruption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods for object detection in adverse weather conditions.

- **Summary**: The key challenge in image-text retrieval is effectively leveraging semantic information to measure the similarity between vision and language data. However, using instance-level binary labels, where each image is paired with a single text, fails to capture multiple correspondences between different semantic units, leading to uncertainty in multi-modal semantic understanding. Although recent research has captured fine-grained information through more complex model structures or pre-training techniques, few studies have directly modeled uncertainty of correspondence to fully exploit binary labels. To address this issue, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-View Visual Semantic Embedding (UAMVSE)} framework that decomposes the overall image-text matching into multiple view-text matchings. Our framework introduce an uncertainty-aware loss function (UALoss) to compute the weighting of each view-text loss by adaptively modeling the uncertainty in each view-text correspondence. Different weightings guide the model to focus on different semantic information, enhancing the model's ability to comprehend the correspondence of images and texts. We also design an optimized image-text matching strategy by normalizing the similarity matrix to improve model performance. Experimental results on the Flicker30k and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that UAMVSE outperforms state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Online advertisements are important elements in e-commerce sites, social media platforms, and search engines. With the increasing popularity of mobile browsing, many online ads are displayed with visual information in the form of a cover image in addition to text descriptions to grab the attention of users. Various recent studies have focused on predicting the click rates of online advertisements aware of visual features or composing optimal advertisement elements to enhance visibility. In this paper, we propose Advertisement Style Editing and Attractiveness Enhancement (AdSEE), which explores whether semantic editing to ads images can affect or alter the popularity of online advertisements. We introduce StyleGAN-based facial semantic editing and inversion to ads images and train a click rate predictor attributing GAN-based face latent representations in addition to traditional visual and textual features to click rates. Through a large collected dataset named QQ-AD, containing 20,527 online ads, we perform extensive offline tests to study how different semantic directions and their edit coefficients may impact click rates. We further design a Genetic Advertisement Editor to efficiently search for the optimal edit directions and intensity given an input ad cover image to enhance its projected click rates. Online A/B tests performed over a period of 5 days have verified the increased click-through rates of AdSEE-edited samples as compared to a control group of original ads, verifying the relation between image styles and ad popularity. We open source the code for AdSEE research at https://github.com/LiyaoJiang1998/adsee.

- **Summary**: The cross-modal synthesis between structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional network connectivity (FNC) is a relatively unexplored area in medical imaging, especially with respect to schizophrenia. This study employs conditional Vision Transformer Generative Adversarial Networks (cViT-GANs) to generate FNC data based on sMRI inputs. After training on a comprehensive dataset that included both individuals with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects, our cViT-GAN model effectively synthesized the FNC matrix for each subject, and then formed a group difference FNC matrix, obtaining a Pearson correlation of 0.73 with the actual FNC matrix. In addition, our FNC visualization results demonstrate significant correlations in particular subcortical brain regions, highlighting the model's capability of capturing detailed structural-functional associations. This performance distinguishes our model from conditional CNN-based GAN alternatives such as Pix2Pix. Our research is one of the first attempts to link sMRI and FNC synthesis, setting it apart from other cross-modal studies that concentrate on T1- and T2-weighted MR images or the fusion of MRI and CT scans.

- **Summary**: Ground segmentation, as the basic task of unmanned intelligent perception, provides an important support for the target detection task. Unstructured road scenes represented by open-pit mines have irregular boundary lines and uneven road surfaces, which lead to segmentation errors in current ground segmentation methods. To solve this problem, a ground segmentation method based on point cloud map is proposed, which involves three parts: region of interest extraction, point cloud registration and background subtraction. Firstly, establishing boundary semantic associations to obtain regions of interest in unstructured roads. Secondly, establishing the location association between point cloud map and the real-time point cloud of region of interest by semantics information. Thirdly, establishing a background model based on Gaussian distribution according to location association, and segments the ground in real-time point cloud by the background substraction method. Experimental results show that the correct segmentation rate of ground points is 99.95%, and the running time is 26ms. Compared with state of the art ground segmentation algorithm Patchwork++, the average accuracy of ground point segmentation is increased by 7.43%, and the running time is increased by 17ms. Furthermore, the proposed method is practically applied to unstructured road scenarios represented by open pit mines.

- **Summary**: Optimizing video inference efficiency has become increasingly important with the growing demand for video analysis in various fields. Some existing methods achieve high efficiency by explicit discard of spatial or temporal information, which poses challenges in fast-changing and fine-grained scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an efficient video representation network with Differentiable Resolution Compression and Alignment mechanism, which compresses non-essential information in the early stage of the network to reduce computational costs while maintaining consistent temporal correlations. Specifically, we leverage a Differentiable Context-aware Compression Module to encode the saliency and non-saliency frame features, refining and updating the features into a high-low resolution video sequence. To process the new sequence, we introduce a new Resolution-Align Transformer Layer to capture global temporal correlations among frame features with different resolutions, while reducing spatial computation costs quadratically by utilizing fewer spatial tokens in low-resolution non-saliency frames. The entire network can be end-to-end optimized via the integration of the differentiable compression module. Experimental results show that our method achieves the best trade-off between efficiency and performance on near-duplicate video retrieval and competitive results on dynamic video classification compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Most of existing methods, however, are often thwarted by the intricate dynamics of background complexity, which limits their ability to fully decode the inherent topological information of the environment. Additionally, the wealth of contextual information encapsulated within depth cues is often left untapped, rendering existing approaches less effective. To address these shortcomings, we present STDG, an avant-garde Depth-Guided One-Stage Scene Graph Generation methodology. The innovative architecture of STDG is a triad of custom-built modules: The Depth Guided HHA Representation Generation Module, the Depth Guided Semi-Teaching Network Learning Module, and the Depth Guided Scene Graph Generation Module. This trifecta of modules synergistically harnesses depth information, covering all aspects from depth signal generation and depth feature utilization, to the final scene graph prediction. Importantly, this is achieved without imposing additional computational burden during the inference phase. Experimental results confirm that our method significantly enhances the performance of one-stage scene graph generation baselines.

- **Summary**: 3D pose estimation is an invaluable task in computer vision with various practical applications. Especially, 3D pose estimation for multi-person from a monocular video (3DMPPE) is particularly challenging and is still largely uncharted, far from applying to in-the-wild scenarios yet. We pose three unresolved issues with the existing methods: lack of robustness on unseen views during training, vulnerability to occlusion, and severe jittering in the output. As a remedy, we propose POTR-3D, the first realization of a sequence-to-sequence 2D-to-3D lifting model for 3DMPPE, powered by a novel geometry-aware data augmentation strategy, capable of generating unbounded data with a variety of views while caring about the ground plane and occlusions. Through extensive experiments, we verify that the proposed model and data augmentation robustly generalizes to diverse unseen views, robustly recovers the poses against heavy occlusions, and reliably generates more natural and smoother outputs. The effectiveness of our approach is verified not only by achieving the state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, but also by qualitative results on more challenging in-the-wild videos.

- **Summary**: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) identifies objects from extremely few annotated samples. Most existing FSOD methods, recently, apply the two-stage learning paradigm, which transfers the knowledge learned from abundant base classes to assist the few-shot detectors by learning the global features. However, such existing FSOD approaches seldom consider the localization of objects from local to global. Limited by the scarce training data in FSOD, the training samples of novel classes typically capture part of objects, resulting in such FSOD methods cannot detect the completely unseen object during testing. To tackle this problem, we propose an Extensible Co-Existing Attention (ECEA) module to enable the model to infer the global object according to the local parts. Essentially, the proposed module continuously learns the extensible ability on the base stage with abundant samples and transfers it to the novel stage, which can assist the few-shot model to quickly adapt in extending local regions to co-existing regions. Specifically, we first devise an extensible attention mechanism that starts with a local region and extends attention to co-existing regions that are similar and adjacent to the given local region. We then implement the extensible attention mechanism in different feature scales to progressively discover the full object in various receptive fields. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets show that our ECEA module can assist the few-shot detector to completely predict the object despite some regions failing to appear in the training samples and achieve the new state of the art compared with existing FSOD methods.

- **Summary**: Compared to natural images, hyperspectral images (HSIs) consist of a large number of bands, with each band capturing different spectral information from a certain wavelength, even some beyond the visible spectrum. These characteristics of HSIs make them highly effective for remote sensing applications. That said, the existing hyperspectral imaging devices introduce severe degradation in HSIs. Hence, hyperspectral image denoising has attracted lots of attention by the community lately. While recent deep HSI denoising methods have provided effective solutions, their performance under real-life complex noise remains suboptimal, as they lack adaptability to new data. To overcome these limitations, in our work, we introduce a self-modulating convolutional neural network which we refer to as SM-CNN, which utilizes correlated spectral and spatial information. At the core of the model lies a novel block, which we call spectral self-modulating residual block (SSMRB), that allows the network to transform the features in an adaptive manner based on the adjacent spectral data, enhancing the network's ability to handle complex noise. In particular, the introduction of SSMRB transforms our denoising network into a dynamic network that adapts its predicted features while denoising every input HSI with respect to its spatio-spectral characteristics. Experimental analysis on both synthetic and real data shows that the proposed SM-CNN outperforms other state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on public benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Learning based on multimodal data has attracted increasing interest recently. While a variety of sensory modalities can be collected for training, not all of them are always available in development scenarios, which raises the challenge to infer with incomplete modality. To address this issue, this paper presents a one-stage modality distillation framework that unifies the privileged knowledge transfer and modality information fusion into a single optimization procedure via multi-task learning. Compared with the conventional modality distillation that performs them independently, this helps to capture the valuable representation that can assist the final model inference directly. Specifically, we propose the joint adaptation network for the modality transfer task to preserve the privileged information. This addresses the representation heterogeneity caused by input discrepancy via the joint distribution adaptation. Then, we introduce the cross translation network for the modality fusion task to aggregate the restored and available modality features. It leverages the parameters-sharing strategy to capture the cross-modal cues explicitly. Extensive experiments on RGB-D classification and segmentation tasks demonstrate the proposed multimodal inheritance framework can overcome the problem of incomplete modality input in various scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Existing methods for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images (ORSI-SOD) mainly adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the backbone, such as VGG and ResNet. Since CNNs can only extract features within certain receptive fields, most ORSI-SOD methods generally follow the local-to-contextual paradigm. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Extraction Local Exploration Network (GeleNet) for ORSI-SOD following the global-to-local paradigm. Specifically, GeleNet first adopts a transformer backbone to generate four-level feature embeddings with global long-range dependencies. Then, GeleNet employs a Direction-aware Shuffle Weighted Spatial Attention Module (D-SWSAM) and its simplified version (SWSAM) to enhance local interactions, and a Knowledge Transfer Module (KTM) to further enhance cross-level contextual interactions. D-SWSAM comprehensively perceives the orientation information in the lowest-level features through directional convolutions to adapt to various orientations of salient objects in ORSIs, and effectively enhances the details of salient objects with an improved attention mechanism. SWSAM discards the direction-aware part of D-SWSAM to focus on localizing salient objects in the highest-level features. KTM models the contextual correlation knowledge of two middle-level features of different scales based on the self-attention mechanism, and transfers the knowledge to the raw features to generate more discriminative features. Finally, a saliency predictor is used to generate the saliency map based on the outputs of the above three modules. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed GeleNet outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods. The code and results of our method are available at https://github.com/MathLee/GeleNet.

- **Summary**: Video saliency prediction and detection are thriving research domains that enable computers to simulate the distribution of visual attention akin to how humans perceiving dynamic scenes. While many approaches have crafted task-specific training paradigms for either video saliency prediction or video salient object detection tasks, few attention has been devoted to devising a generalized saliency modeling framework that seamlessly bridges both these distinct tasks. In this study, we introduce the Unified Saliency Transformer (UniST) framework, which comprehensively utilizes the essential attributes of video saliency prediction and video salient object detection. In addition to extracting representations of frame sequences, a saliency-aware transformer is designed to learn the spatio-temporal representations at progressively increased resolutions, while incorporating effective cross-scale saliency information to produce a robust representation. Furthermore, a task-specific decoder is proposed to perform the final prediction for each task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores designing a transformer structure for both saliency modeling tasks. Convincible experiments demonstrate that the proposed UniST achieves superior performance across seven challenging benchmarks for two tasks, and significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Lifelong learning, also referred to as continual learning, is the problem of training an AI agent continuously while also preventing it from forgetting its previously acquired knowledge. Most of the existing methods primarily focus on lifelong learning within a static environment and lack the ability to mitigate forgetting in a quickly-changing dynamic environment. Streaming lifelong learning is a challenging setting of lifelong learning with the goal of continuous learning in a dynamic non-stationary environment without forgetting. We introduce a novel approach to lifelong learning, which is streaming, requires a single pass over the data, can learn in a class-incremental manner, and can be evaluated on-the-fly (anytime inference). To accomplish these, we propose virtual gradients for continual representation learning to prevent catastrophic forgetting and leverage an exponential-moving-average-based semantic memory to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate our method's efficacy and superior performance over existing methods.

- **Summary**: Accurate polyp delineation in colonoscopy is crucial for assisting in diagnosis, guiding interventions, and treatments. However, current deep-learning approaches fall short due to integrity deficiency, which often manifests as missing lesion parts. This paper introduces the integrity concept in polyp segmentation at both macro and micro levels, aiming to alleviate integrity deficiency. Specifically, the model should distinguish entire polyps at the macro level and identify all components within polyps at the micro level. Our Integrity Capturing Polyp Segmentation (IC-PolypSeg) network utilizes lightweight backbones and 3 key components for integrity ameliorating: 1) Pixel-wise feature redistribution (PFR) module captures global spatial correlations across channels in the final semantic-rich encoder features. 2) Cross-stage pixel-wise feature redistribution (CPFR) module dynamically fuses high-level semantics and low-level spatial features to capture contextual information. 3) Coarse-to-fine calibration module combines PFR and CPFR modules to achieve precise boundary detection. Extensive experiments on 5 public datasets demonstrate that the proposed IC-PolypSeg outperforms 8 state-of-the-art methods in terms of higher precision and significantly improved computational efficiency with lower computational consumption. IC-PolypSeg-EF0 employs 300 times fewer parameters than PraNet while achieving a real-time processing speed of 235 FPS. Importantly, IC-PolypSeg reduces the false negative ratio on five datasets, meeting clinical requirements.

- **Summary**: Visual object recognition in unseen and cluttered indoor environments is a challenging problem for mobile robots. Toward this goal, we extend our previous work to propose the TOPS2 descriptor, and an accompanying recognition framework, THOR2, inspired by a human reasoning mechanism known as object unity. We interleave color embeddings obtained using the Mapper algorithm for topological soft clustering with the shape-based TOPS descriptor to obtain the TOPS2 descriptor. THOR2, trained using synthetic data, achieves substantially higher recognition accuracy than the shape-based THOR framework and outperforms RGB-D ViT on two real-world datasets: the benchmark OCID dataset and the UW-IS Occluded dataset. Therefore, THOR2 is a promising step toward achieving robust recognition in low-cost robots.

- **Summary**: With the development of aerospace technology, the increasing population of space debris has posed a great threat to the safety of spacecraft. However, the low intensity of reflected light and high angular velocity of space debris impede the extraction. Besides, due to the limitations of the ground observation methods, small space debris can hardly be detected, making it necessary to enhance the spacecraft's capacity for space situational awareness (SSA). Considering that traditional methods have some defects in low-SNR target detection, such as low effectiveness and large time consumption, this paper proposes a method for low-SNR streak extraction based on local contrast and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which can detect space objects with SNR 2.0 efficiently. In the proposed algorithm, local contrast will be applied for crude classifications, which will return connected components as preliminary results, and then MLE will be performed to reconstruct the connected components of targets via orientated growth, further improving the precision. The algorithm has been verified with both simulated streaks and real star tracker images, and the average centroid error of the proposed algorithm is close to the state-of-the-art method like ODCC. At the same time, the algorithm in this paper has significant advantages in efficiency compared with ODCC. In conclusion, the algorithm in this paper is of high speed and precision, which guarantees its promising applications in the extraction of high dynamic targets.

- **Summary**: In image retrieval, standard evaluation metrics rely on score ranking, \eg average precision (AP), recall at k (R@k), normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). In this work we introduce a general framework for robust and decomposable rank losses optimization. It addresses two major challenges for end-to-end training of deep neural networks with rank losses: non-differentiability and non-decomposability. Firstly we propose a general surrogate for ranking operator, SupRank, that is amenable to stochastic gradient descent. It provides an upperbound for rank losses and ensures robust training. Secondly, we use a simple yet effective loss function to reduce the decomposability gap between the averaged batch approximation of ranking losses and their values on the whole training set. We apply our framework to two standard metrics for image retrieval: AP and R@k. Additionally we apply our framework to hierarchical image retrieval. We introduce an extension of AP, the hierarchical average precision $\mathcal{H}$-AP, and optimize it as well as the NDCG. Finally we create the first hierarchical landmarks retrieval dataset. We use a semi-automatic pipeline to create hierarchical labels, extending the large scale Google Landmarks v2 dataset. The hierarchical dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/cvdfoundation/google-landmark. Code will be released at https://github.com/elias-ramzi/SupRank.

- **Summary**: Image cartoonization has attracted significant interest in the field of image generation. However, most of the existing image cartoonization techniques require re-training models using images of cartoon style. In this paper, we present CartoonDiff, a novel training-free sampling approach which generates image cartoonization using diffusion transformer models. Specifically, we decompose the reverse process of diffusion models into the semantic generation phase and the detail generation phase. Furthermore, we implement the image cartoonization process by normalizing high-frequency signal of the noisy image in specific denoising steps. CartoonDiff doesn't require any additional reference images, complex model designs, or the tedious adjustment of multiple parameters. Extensive experimental results show the powerful ability of our CartoonDiff. The project page is available at: https://cartoondiff.github.io/

- **Summary**: Whole slide image (WSI) processing is becoming part of the key components of standard clinical diagnosis for various diseases. However, the direct application of conventional image processing algorithms to WSI faces certain obstacles because of WSIs' distinct property: the super-high resolution. The performance of most WSI-related tasks relies on the efficacy of the backbone which extracts WSI patch feature representations. Hence, we proposed BROW, a foundation model for extracting better feature representations for WSIs, which can be conveniently adapted to downstream tasks without or with slight fine-tuning. The model takes transformer architecture, pretrained using self-distillation framework. To improve model's robustness, techniques such as patch shuffling have been employed. Additionally, the model leverages the unique properties of WSIs, utilizing WSI's multi-scale pyramid to incorporate an additional global view, thereby further enhancing its performance. We used both private and public data to make up a large pretraining dataset, containing more than 11000 slides, over 180M extracted patches, encompassing WSIs related to various organs and tissues. To assess the effectiveness of \ourmodel, we run a wide range of downstream tasks, including slide-level subtyping, patch-level classification and nuclei instance segmentation. The results confirmed the efficacy, robustness and good generalization ability of the proposed model. This substantiates its potential as foundation model for WSI feature extraction and highlights promising prospects for its application in WSI processing.

- **Summary**: Due to long-distance correlation and powerful pretrained models, transformer-based methods have initiated a breakthrough in visual object tracking performance. Previous works focus on designing effective architectures suited for tracking, but ignore that data augmentation is equally crucial for training a well-performing model. In this paper, we first explore the impact of general data augmentations on transformer-based trackers via systematic experiments, and reveal the limited effectiveness of these common strategies. Motivated by experimental observations, we then propose two data augmentation methods customized for tracking. First, we optimize existing random cropping via a dynamic search radius mechanism and simulation for boundary samples. Second, we propose a token-level feature mixing augmentation strategy, which enables the model against challenges like background interference. Extensive experiments on two transformer-based trackers and six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of our methods, especially under challenging settings, like one-shot tracking and small image resolutions.

- **Summary**: In the field of remote sensing, we often utilize oriented bounding boxes (OBB) to bound the objects. This approach significantly reduces the overlap among dense detection boxes and minimizes the inclusion of background content within the bounding boxes. To enhance the detection accuracy of oriented objects, we propose a unique loss function based on edge gradients, inspired by the similarity measurement function used in template matching task. During this process, we address the issues of non-differentiability of the function and the semantic alignment between gradient vectors in ground truth (GT) boxes and predicted boxes (PB). Experimental results show that our proposed loss function achieves $0.6\%$ mAP improvement compared to the commonly used Smooth L1 loss in the baseline algorithm. Additionally, we design an edge-based self-attention module to encourage the detection network to focus more on the object edges. Leveraging these two innovations, we achieve a mAP increase of 1.3% on the DOTA dataset.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised learning of facial representations has gained increasing attention for face understanding ability without heavily relying on large-scale annotated datasets. However, it remains unsolved due to the coupling of facial identities, expressions, and external factors like pose and light. Prior methods primarily focus on 2D factors and pixel-level consistency, leading to incomplete disentangling and suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose LatentFace, a novel unsupervised disentangling framework for facial expression and identity representation. We suggest the disentangling problem should be performed in latent space and propose the solution using a 3D-ware latent diffusion model. First, we introduce a 3D-aware autoencoder to encode face images into 3D latent embeddings. Second, we propose a novel representation diffusion model (RDM) to disentangle 3D latent into facial identity and expression. Consequently, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in facial expression recognition and face verification among unsupervised facial representation learning models.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D modeling of human organs plays a crucial role in building computational phantoms for virtual imaging trials. However, generating anatomically plausible reconstructions of organ surfaces from computed tomography scans remains challenging for many structures in the human body. This challenge is particularly evident when dealing with the large intestine. In this study, we leverage recent advancements in geometric deep learning and denoising diffusion probabilistic models to refine the segmentation results of the large intestine. We begin by representing the organ as point clouds sampled from the surface of the 3D segmentation mask. Subsequently, we employ a hierarchical variational autoencoder to obtain global and local latent representations of the organ's shape. We train two conditional denoising diffusion models in the hierarchical latent space to perform shape refinement. To further enhance our method, we incorporate a state-of-the-art surface reconstruction model, allowing us to generate smooth meshes from the obtained complete point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing both the global distribution of the organ's shape and its fine details. Our complete refinement pipeline demonstrates remarkable enhancements in surface representation compared to the initial segmentation, reducing the Chamfer distance by 70%, the Hausdorff distance by 32%, and the Earth Mover's distance by 6%. By combining geometric deep learning, denoising diffusion models, and advanced surface reconstruction techniques, our proposed method offers a promising solution for accurately modeling the large intestine's surface and can easily be extended to other anatomical structures.

- **Summary**: We introduce a distinctive real-time, causal, neural network-based active speaker detection system optimized for low-power edge computing. This system drives a virtual cinematography module and is deployed on a commercial device. The system uses data originating from a microphone array and a 360-degree camera. Our network requires only 127 MFLOPs per participant, for a meeting with 14 participants. Unlike previous work, we examine the error rate of our network when the computational budget is exhausted, and find that it exhibits graceful degradation, allowing the system to operate reasonably well even in this case. Departing from conventional DOA estimation approaches, our network learns to query the available acoustic data, considering the detected head locations. We train and evaluate our algorithm on a realistic meetings dataset featuring up to 14 participants in the same meeting, overlapped speech, and other challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Deep perception models have to reliably cope with an open-world setting of domain shifts induced by different geographic regions, sensor properties, mounting positions, and several other reasons. Since covering all domains with annotated data is technically intractable due to the endless possible variations, researchers focus on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods that adapt models trained on one (source) domain with annotations available to another (target) domain for which only unannotated data are available. Current predominant methods either leverage semi-supervised approaches, e.g., teacher-student setup, or exploit privileged data, such as other sensor modalities or temporal data consistency. We introduce a novel domain adaptation method that leverages the best of both trends. Our approach combines input data's temporal and cross-sensor geometric consistency with the mean teacher method. Dubbed T-UDA for "temporal UDA", such a combination yields massive performance gains for the task of 3D semantic segmentation of driving scenes. Experiments are conducted on Waymo Open Dataset, nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, for two popular 3D point cloud architectures, Cylinder3D and MinkowskiNet.

- **Summary**: Continual learning is increasingly sought after in real world machine learning applications, as it enables learning in a more human-like manner. Conventional machine learning approaches fail to achieve this, as incrementally updating the model with non-identically distributed data leads to catastrophic forgetting, where existing representations are overwritten. Although traditional continual learning methods have mostly focused on batch learning, which involves learning from large collections of labeled data sequentially, this approach is not well-suited for real-world applications where we would like new data to be integrated directly. This necessitates a paradigm shift towards streaming learning. In this paper, we propose a streaming version of regularized discriminant analysis as a solution to this challenge. We combine our algorithm with a convolutional neural network and demonstrate that it outperforms both batch learning and existing streaming learning algorithms on the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset.

- **Summary**: Most existing salient object detection methods mostly use U-Net or feature pyramid structure, which simply aggregates feature maps of different scales, ignoring the uniqueness and interdependence of them and their respective contributions to the final prediction. To overcome these, we propose the M$^3$Net, i.e., the Multilevel, Mixed and Multistage attention network for Salient Object Detection (SOD). Firstly, we propose Multiscale Interaction Block which innovatively introduces the cross-attention approach to achieve the interaction between multilevel features, allowing high-level features to guide low-level feature learning and thus enhancing salient regions. Secondly, considering the fact that previous Transformer based SOD methods locate salient regions only using global self-attention while inevitably overlooking the details of complex objects, we propose the Mixed Attention Block. This block combines global self-attention and window self-attention, aiming at modeling context at both global and local levels to further improve the accuracy of the prediction map. Finally, we proposed a multilevel supervision strategy to optimize the aggregated feature stage-by-stage. Experiments on six challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed M$^3$Net surpasses recent CNN and Transformer-based SOD arts in terms of four metrics.

- **Summary**: In recent years, wildfires have posed a significant challenge due to their increasing frequency and severity. For this reason, accurate delineation of burned areas is crucial for environmental monitoring and post-fire assessment. However, traditional approaches relying on binary segmentation models often struggle to achieve robust and accurate results, especially when trained from scratch, due to limited resources and the inherent imbalance of this segmentation task. We propose to address these limitations in two ways: first, we construct an ad-hoc dataset to cope with the limited resources, combining information from Sentinel-2 feeds with Copernicus activations and other data sources. In this dataset, we provide annotations for multiple tasks, including burned area delineation and land cover segmentation. Second, we propose a multitask learning framework that incorporates land cover classification as an auxiliary task to enhance the robustness and performance of the burned area segmentation models. We compare the performance of different models, including UPerNet and SegFormer, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to standard binary segmentation.

- **Summary**: Wide-range and fine-grained vehicle detection plays a critical role in enabling active safety features in intelligent driving systems. However, existing vehicle detection methods based on rectangular bounding boxes (BBox) often struggle with perceiving wide-range objects, especially small objects at long distances. And BBox expression cannot provide detailed geometric shape and pose information of vehicles. This paper proposes a novel wide-range Pseudo-3D Vehicle Detection method based on images from a single camera and incorporates efficient learning methods. This model takes a spliced image as input, which is obtained by combining two sub-window images from a high-resolution image. This image format maximizes the utilization of limited image resolution to retain essential information about wide-range vehicle objects. To detect pseudo-3D objects, our model adopts specifically designed detection heads. These heads simultaneously output extended BBox and Side Projection Line (SPL) representations, which capture vehicle shapes and poses, enabling high-precision detection. To further enhance the performance of detection, a joint constraint loss combining both the object box and SPL is designed during model training, improving the efficiency, stability, and prediction accuracy of the model. Experimental results on our self-built dataset demonstrate that our model achieves favorable performance in wide-range pseudo-3D vehicle detection across multiple evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (re-ID) requires densely distributed cameras. In practice, the person of interest may not be captured by cameras and, therefore, needs to be retrieved using subjective information (e.g., sketches from witnesses). Previous research defines this case using the sketch as sketch re-identification (Sketch re-ID) and focuses on eliminating the domain gap. Actually, subjectivity is another significant challenge. We model and investigate it by posing a new dataset with multi-witness descriptions. It features two aspects. 1) Large-scale. It contains over 4,763 sketches and 32,668 photos, making it the largest Sketch re-ID dataset. 2) Multi-perspective and multi-style. Our dataset offers multiple sketches for each identity. Witnesses' subjective cognition provides multiple perspectives on the same individual, while different artists' drawing styles provide variation in sketch styles. We further have two novel designs to alleviate the challenge of subjectivity. 1) Fusing subjectivity. We propose a non-local (NL) fusion module that gathers sketches from different witnesses for the same identity. 2) Introducing objectivity. An AttrAlign module utilizes attributes as an implicit mask to align cross-domain features. To push forward the advance of Sketch re-ID, we set three benchmarks (large-scale, multi-style, cross-style). Extensive experiments demonstrate our leading performance in these benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging has evolved as a key component for prostate cancer (PCa) detection, substantially increasing the radiologist workload. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can support radiological assessment by segmenting and classifying lesions in clinically significant (csPCa) and non-clinically significant (ncsPCa). Commonly, AI systems for PCa detection involve an automatic prostate segmentation followed by the lesion detection using the extracted prostate. However, evaluation reports are typically presented in terms of detection under the assumption of the availability of a highly accurate segmentation and an idealistic scenario, omitting the propagation of errors between modules. For that purpose, we evaluate the effect of two different segmentation networks (s1 and s2) with heterogeneous performances in the detection stage and compare it with an idealistic setting (s1:89.90+-2.23 vs 88.97+-3.06 ncsPCa, P<.001, 89.30+-4.07 and 88.12+-2.71 csPCa, P<.001). Our results depict the relevance of a holistic evaluation, accounting for all the sub-modules involved in the system.

- **Summary**: Real-time transportation surveillance is an essential part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS). However, images captured under low-light conditions often suffer the poor visibility with types of degradation, such as noise interference and vague edge features, etc. With the development of imaging devices, the quality of the visual surveillance data is continually increasing, like 2K and 4K, which has more strict requirements on the efficiency of image processing. To satisfy the requirements on both enhancement quality and computational speed, this paper proposes a double domain guided real-time low-light image enhancement network (DDNet) for ultra-high-definition (UHD) transportation surveillance. Specifically, we design an encoder-decoder structure as the main architecture of the learning network. In particular, the enhancement processing is divided into two subtasks (i.e., color enhancement and gradient enhancement) via the proposed coarse enhancement module (CEM) and LoG-based gradient enhancement module (GEM), which are embedded in the encoder-decoder structure. It enables the network to enhance the color and edge features simultaneously. Through the decomposition and reconstruction on both color and gradient domains, our DDNet can restore the detailed feature information concealed by the darkness with better visual quality and efficiency. The evaluation experiments on standard and transportation-related datasets demonstrate that our DDNet provides superior enhancement quality and efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the object detection and scene segmentation experiments indicate the practical benefits for higher-level image analysis under low-light environments in ITS.

- **Summary**: Fine holes are an important structural component of industrial components, and their inner surface quality is closely related to their function.In order to detect the quality of the inner surface of the fine hole,a special optical measurement system was investigated in this paper. A sight pipe is employed to guide the external illumination light into the fine hole and output the relevant images simultaneously. A flexible light array is introduced to suit the narrow space, and the effective field of view is analyzed. Besides, the arc surface projection error and manufacturing assembly error of the device are analyzed, then compensated or ignored if small enough. In the test of prefabricated circular defects with the diameter {\phi}0.1mm, {\phi}0.2mm, 0.4mm distance distribution and the fissure defects with the width 0.3mm, the maximum measurement error standard deviation are all about 10{\mu}m. The minimum diameter of the measured fine hole is 4mm and the depth can reach 47mm.

- **Summary**: White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) is an imaging feature related to various diseases such as dementia and stroke. Accurately segmenting WMH using computer technology is crucial for early disease diagnosis. However, this task remains challenging due to the small lesions with low contrast and high discontinuity in the images, which contain limited contextual and spatial information. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning model called 3D Spatial Attention U-Net (3D SA-UNet) for automatic WMH segmentation using only Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) scans. The 3D SA-UNet introduces a 3D Spatial Attention Module that highlights important lesion features, such as WMH, while suppressing unimportant regions. Additionally, to capture features at different scales, we extend the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to a 3D version, enhancing the segmentation performance of the network. We evaluate our method on publicly available dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D spatial attention module and 3D ASPP in WMH segmentation. Through experimental results, it has been demonstrated that our proposed 3D SA-UNet model achieves higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art 3D convolutional neural networks.

- **Summary**: Modeling Neural Radiance Fields for fast-moving deformable objects from visual data alone is a challenging problem. A major issue arises due to the high deformation and low acquisition rates. To address this problem, we propose to use event cameras that offer very fast acquisition of visual change in an asynchronous manner. In this work, we develop a novel method to model the deformable neural radiance fields using RGB and event cameras. The proposed method uses the asynchronous stream of events and calibrated sparse RGB frames. In our setup, the camera pose at the individual events required to integrate them into the radiance fields remains unknown. Our method jointly optimizes these poses and the radiance field. This happens efficiently by leveraging the collection of events at once and actively sampling the events during learning. Experiments conducted on both realistically rendered graphics and real-world datasets demonstrate a significant benefit of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art and the compared baseline.   This shows a promising direction for modeling deformable neural radiance fields in real-world dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: Label-free cell classification is advantageous for supplying pristine cells for further use or examination, yet existing techniques frequently fall short in terms of specificity and speed. In this study, we address these limitations through the development of a novel machine learning framework, Multiplex Image Machine Learning (MIML). This architecture uniquely combines label-free cell images with biomechanical property data, harnessing the vast, often underutilized morphological information intrinsic to each cell. By integrating both types of data, our model offers a more holistic understanding of the cellular properties, utilizing morphological information typically discarded in traditional machine learning models. This approach has led to a remarkable 98.3\% accuracy in cell classification, a substantial improvement over models that only consider a single data type. MIML has been proven effective in classifying white blood cells and tumor cells, with potential for broader application due to its inherent flexibility and transfer learning capability. It's particularly effective for cells with similar morphology but distinct biomechanical properties. This innovative approach has significant implications across various fields, from advancing disease diagnostics to understanding cellular behavior.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of planar regions from a single RGB image is a particularly important task in the perception of complex scenes. To utilize both visual and geometric properties in images, recent approaches often formulate the problem as a joint estimation of planar instances and dense depth through feature fusion mechanisms and geometric constraint losses. Despite promising results, these methods do not consider cross-task feature distillation and perform poorly in boundary regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose X-PDNet, a framework for the multitask learning of plane instance segmentation and depth estimation with improvements in the following two aspects. Firstly, we construct the cross-task distillation design which promotes early information sharing between dual-tasks for specific task improvements. Secondly, we highlight the current limitations of using the ground truth boundary to develop boundary regression loss, and propose a novel method that exploits depth information to support precise boundary region segmentation. Finally, we manually annotate more than 3000 images from Stanford 2D-3D-Semantics dataset and make available for evaluation of plane instance segmentation. Through the experiments, our proposed methods prove the advantages, outperforming the baseline with large improvement margins in the quantitative results on the ScanNet and the Stanford 2D-3D-S dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposals.

- **Summary**: Glioma is a prevalent brain tumor that poses a significant health risk to individuals. Accurate segmentation of brain tumor is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The Segment Anything Model(SAM), released by Meta AI, is a fundamental model in image segmentation and has excellent zero-sample generalization capabilities. Thus, it is interesting to apply SAM to the task of brain tumor segmentation. In this study, we evaluated the performance of SAM on brain tumor segmentation and found that without any model fine-tuning, there is still a gap between SAM and the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) model.

- **Summary**: Recently, it has been exposed that some modern facial recognition systems could discriminate specific demographic groups and may lead to unfair attention with respect to various facial attributes such as gender and origin. The main reason are the biases inside datasets, unbalanced demographics, used to train theses models. Unfortunately, collecting a large-scale balanced dataset with respect to various demographics is impracticable.   In this paper, we investigate as an alternative the generation of a balanced and possibly bias-free synthetic dataset that could be used to train, to regularize or to evaluate deep learning-based facial recognition models. We propose to use a simple method for modeling and sampling a disentangled projection of a StyleGAN latent space to generate any combination of demographic groups (e.g. $hispanic-female$). Our experiments show that we can synthesis any combination of demographic groups effectively and the identities are different from the original training dataset. We also released the source code.

- **Summary**: Laser-scanned point clouds of forests make it possible to extract valuable information for forest management. To consider single trees, a forest point cloud needs to be segmented into individual tree point clouds. Existing segmentation methods are usually based on hand-crafted algorithms, such as identifying trunks and growing trees from them, and face difficulties in dense forests with overlapping tree crowns. In this study, we propose \mbox{TreeLearn}, a deep learning-based approach for semantic and instance segmentation of forest point clouds. Unlike previous methods, TreeLearn is trained on already segmented point clouds in a data-driven manner, making it less reliant on predefined features and algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a new manually segmented benchmark forest dataset containing 156 full trees, and 79 partial trees, that have been cleanly segmented by hand. This enables the evaluation of instance segmentation performance going beyond just evaluating the detection of individual trees. We trained TreeLearn on forest point clouds of 6665 trees, labeled using the Lidar360 software. An evaluation on the benchmark dataset shows that TreeLearn performs equally well or better than the algorithm used to generate its training data. Furthermore, the method's performance can be vastly improved by fine-tuning on the cleanly labeled benchmark dataset. The TreeLearn code is availabe from https://github.com/ecker-lab/TreeLearn. The data as well as trained models can be found at https://doi.org/10.25625/VPMPID.

- **Summary**: Automatically producing instructions to modify one's posture could open the door to endless applications, such as personalized coaching and in-home physical therapy. Tackling the reverse problem (i.e., refining a 3D pose based on some natural language feedback) could help for assisted 3D character animation or robot teaching, for instance. Although a few recent works explore the connections between natural language and 3D human pose, none focus on describing 3D body pose differences. In this paper, we tackle the problem of correcting 3D human poses with natural language. To this end, we introduce the PoseFix dataset, which consists of several thousand paired 3D poses and their corresponding text feedback, that describe how the source pose needs to be modified to obtain the target pose. We demonstrate the potential of this dataset on two tasks: (1) text-based pose editing, that aims at generating corrected 3D body poses given a query pose and a text modifier; and (2) correctional text generation, where instructions are generated based on the differences between two body poses.

- **Summary**: Automated segmentation of the blood vessels in 3D volumes is an essential step for the quantitative diagnosis and treatment of many vascular diseases. 3D vessel segmentation is being actively investigated in existing works, mostly in deep learning approaches. However, training 3D deep networks requires large amounts of manual 3D annotations from experts, which are laborious to obtain. This is especially the case for 3D vessel segmentation, as vessels are sparse yet spread out over many slices and disconnected when visualized in 2D slices. In this work, we propose a novel method to segment the 3D peripancreatic arteries solely from one annotated 2D projection per training image with depth supervision. We perform extensive experiments on the segmentation of peripancreatic arteries on 3D contrast-enhanced CT images and demonstrate how well we capture the rich depth information from 2D projections. We demonstrate that by annotating a single, randomly chosen projection for each training sample, we obtain comparable performance to annotating multiple 2D projections, thereby reducing the annotation effort. Furthermore, by mapping the 2D labels to the 3D space using depth information and incorporating this into training, we almost close the performance gap between 3D supervision and 2D supervision.

- **Summary**: Our work introduces the YCB-Ev dataset, which contains synchronized RGB-D frames and event data that enables evaluating 6DoF object pose estimation algorithms using these modalities.   This dataset provides ground truth 6DoF object poses for the same 21 YCB objects \cite{calli2017yale} that were used in the YCB-Video (YCB-V) dataset, enabling the evaluation of algorithm performance when transferred across datasets.   The dataset consists of 21 synchronized event and RGB-D sequences, amounting to a total of 7:43 minutes of video. Notably, 12 of these sequences feature the same object arrangement as the YCB-V subset used in the BOP challenge.   Our dataset is the first to provide ground truth 6DoF pose data for event streams. Furthermore, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of two state-of-the-art algorithms, which were pre-trained for the BOP challenge, using our novel YCB-V sequences.   The proposed dataset is available at https://github.com/paroj/ycbev.

- **Summary**: Visual-based 3D semantic occupancy perception (also known as 3D semantic scene completion) is a new perception paradigm for robotic applications like autonomous driving. Compared with Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception, it extends the vertical dimension, significantly enhancing the ability of robots to understand their surroundings. However, due to this very reason, the computational demand for current 3D semantic occupancy perception methods generally surpasses that of BEV perception methods and 2D perception methods. We propose a novel 3D semantic occupancy perception method, OccupancyDETR, which consists of a DETR-like object detection module and a 3D occupancy decoder module. The integration of object detection simplifies our method structurally - instead of predicting the semantics of each voxels, it identifies objects in the scene and their respective 3D occupancy grids. This speeds up our method, reduces required resources, and leverages object detection algorithm, giving our approach notable performance on small objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the SemanticKITTI dataset, showcasing an mIoU of 23 and a processing speed of 6 frames per second, thereby presenting a promising solution for real-time 3D semantic scene completion.

- **Summary**: Probabilistic diffusion models excel at sampling new images from learned distributions. Originally motivated by drift-diffusion concepts from physics, they apply image perturbations such as noise and blur in a forward process that results in a tractable probability distribution. A corresponding learned reverse process generates images and can be conditioned on side information, which leads to a wide variety of practical applications. Most of the research focus currently lies on practice-oriented extensions. In contrast, the theoretical background remains largely unexplored, in particular the relations to drift-diffusion. In order to shed light on these connections to classical image filtering, we propose a generalised scale-space theory for probabilistic diffusion models. Moreover, we show conceptual and empirical connections to diffusion and osmosis filters.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained vision transformers have strong representation benefits to various downstream tasks. Recently, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed, and their experiments demonstrate that tuning only 1% of extra parameters could surpass full fine-tuning in low-data resource scenarios. However, these methods overlook the task-specific information when fine-tuning diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called "Salient Channel Tuning" (SCT) to leverage the task-specific information by forwarding the model with the task images to select partial channels in a feature map that enables us to tune only 1/8 channels leading to significantly lower parameter costs. Experiments outperform full fine-tuning on 18 out of 19 tasks in the VTAB-1K benchmark by adding only 0.11M parameters of the ViT-B, which is 780$\times$ fewer than its full fine-tuning counterpart. Furthermore, experiments on domain generalization and few-shot learning surpass other PEFT methods with lower parameter costs, demonstrating our proposed tuning technique's strong capability and effectiveness in the low-data regime.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image models ignited immense attention from the vision community, artists, and content creators. Broad adoption of these models is due to significant improvement in the quality of generations and efficient conditioning on various modalities, not just text. However, lifting the rich generative priors of these 2D models into 3D is challenging. Recent works have proposed various pipelines powered by the entanglement of diffusion models and neural fields. We explore the power of pretrained 2D diffusion models and standard 3D neural radiance fields as independent, standalone tools and demonstrate their ability to work together in a non-learned fashion. Such modularity has the intrinsic advantage of eased partial upgrades, which became an important property in such a fast-paced domain. Our pipeline accepts any legacy renderable geometry, such as textured or untextured meshes, orchestrates the interaction between 2D generative refinement and 3D consistency enforcement tools, and outputs a painted input geometry in several formats. We conduct a large-scale study on a wide range of objects and categories from the ShapeNetSem dataset and demonstrate the advantages of our approach, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose methods to build a powerful and efficient Image-to-Speech captioning (Im2Sp) model. To this end, we start with importing the rich knowledge related to image comprehension and language modeling from a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model into Im2Sp. We set the output of the proposed Im2Sp as discretized speech units, i.e., the quantized speech features of a self-supervised speech model. The speech units mainly contain linguistic information while suppressing other characteristics of speech. This allows us to incorporate the language modeling capability of the pre-trained vision-language model into the spoken language modeling of Im2Sp. With the vision-language pre-training strategy, we set new state-of-the-art Im2Sp performances on two widely used benchmark databases, COCO and Flickr8k. Then, we further improve the efficiency of the Im2Sp model. Similar to the speech unit case, we convert the original image into image units, which are derived through vector quantization of the raw image. With these image units, we can drastically reduce the required data storage for saving image data to just 0.8% when compared to the original image data in terms of bits.

- **Summary**: Background: As available medical image datasets increase in size, it becomes infeasible for clinicians to review content manually for knowledge extraction. The objective of this study was to create an automated clustering resulting in human-interpretable pattern discovery.   Methods: Images from the public HAM10000 dataset, including 7 common pigmented skin lesion diagnoses, were tiled into 29420 tiles and clustered via k-means using neural network-extracted image features. The final number of clusters per diagnosis was chosen by either the elbow method or a compactness metric balancing intra-lesion variance and cluster numbers. The amount of resulting non-informative clusters, defined as those containing less than six image tiles, was compared between the two methods.   Results: Applying k-means, the optimal elbow cutoff resulted in a mean of 24.7 (95%-CI: 16.4-33) clusters for every included diagnosis, including 14.9% (95% CI: 0.8-29.0) non-informative clusters. The optimal cutoff, as estimated by the compactness metric, resulted in significantly fewer clusters (13.4; 95%-CI 11.8-15.1; p=0.03) and less non-informative ones (7.5%; 95% CI: 0-19.5; p=0.017). The majority of clusters (93.6%) from the compactness metric could be manually mapped to previously described dermatoscopic diagnostic patterns.   Conclusions: Automatically constraining unsupervised clustering can produce an automated extraction of diagnostically relevant and human-interpretable clusters of visual patterns from a large image dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a powerful Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) method for multiple languages, especially for low-resource languages that have a limited number of labeled data. Different from previous methods that tried to improve the VSR performance for the target language by using knowledge learned from other languages, we explore whether we can increase the amount of training data itself for the different languages without human intervention. To this end, we employ a Whisper model which can conduct both language identification and audio-based speech recognition. It serves to filter data of the desired languages and transcribe labels from the unannotated, multilingual audio-visual data pool. By comparing the performances of VSR models trained on automatic labels and the human-annotated labels, we show that we can achieve similar VSR performance to that of human-annotated labels even without utilizing human annotations. Through the automated labeling process, we label large-scale unlabeled multilingual databases, VoxCeleb2 and AVSpeech, producing 1,002 hours of data for four low VSR resource languages, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. With the automatic labels, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on mTEDx in four languages, significantly surpassing the previous methods. The automatic labels are available online: https://github.com/JeongHun0716/Visual-Speech-Recognition-for-Low-Resource-Languages

- **Summary**: Object detection is a crucial component of autonomous driving, and many detection applications have been developed to address this task. These applications often rely on backbone architectures, which extract representation features from inputs to perform the object detection task. The quality of the features extracted by the backbone architecture can have a significant impact on the overall detection performance. Many researchers have focused on developing new and improved backbone architectures to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of object detection applications. While these backbone architectures have shown state-of-the-art performance on generic object detection datasets like MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC, evaluating their performance under an autonomous driving environment has not been previously explored. To address this, our study evaluates three well-known autonomous vehicle datasets, namely KITTI, NuScenes, and BDD, to compare the performance of different backbone architectures on object detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Recently, the development of pre-trained vision language foundation models (VLFMs) has led to remarkable performance in many tasks. However, these models tend to have strong single-image understanding capability but lack the ability to understand multiple images. Therefore, they cannot be directly applied to cope with image change understanding (ICU), which requires models to capture actual changes between multiple images and describe them in language. In this paper, we discover that existing VLFMs perform poorly when applied directly to ICU because of the following problems: (1) VLFMs generally learn the global representation of a single image, while ICU requires capturing nuances between multiple images. (2) The ICU performance of VLFMs is significantly affected by viewpoint variations, which is caused by the altered relationships between objects when viewpoint changes. To address these problems, we propose a Viewpoint Integration and Registration method. Concretely, we introduce a fused adapter image encoder that fine-tunes pre-trained encoders by inserting designed trainable adapters and fused adapters, to effectively capture nuances between image pairs. Additionally, a viewpoint registration flow and a semantic emphasizing module are designed to reduce the performance degradation caused by viewpoint variations in the visual and semantic space, respectively. Experimental results on CLEVR-Change and Spot-the-Diff demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in all metrics.

In the context of vision transformers, we find that this degradation is mitigated when dividing by sequence length. Our experiments training small to large vision transformers on ImageNet-21k indicate that ReLU-attention can approach or match the performance of softmax-attention in terms of scaling behavior as a function of compute.

- **Summary**: We present an approach to estimating camera rotation in crowded, real-world scenes from handheld monocular video. While camera rotation estimation is a well-studied problem, no previous methods exhibit both high accuracy and acceptable speed in this setting. Because the setting is not addressed well by other datasets, we provide a new dataset and benchmark, with high-accuracy, rigorously verified ground truth, on 17 video sequences. Methods developed for wide baseline stereo (e.g., 5-point methods) perform poorly on monocular video. On the other hand, methods used in autonomous driving (e.g., SLAM) leverage specific sensor setups, specific motion models, or local optimization strategies (lagging batch processing) and do not generalize well to handheld video. Finally, for dynamic scenes, commonly used robustification techniques like RANSAC require large numbers of iterations, and become prohibitively slow. We introduce a novel generalization of the Hough transform on SO(3) to efficiently and robustly find the camera rotation most compatible with optical flow. Among comparably fast methods, ours reduces error by almost 50\% over the next best, and is more accurate than any method, irrespective of speed. This represents a strong new performance point for crowded scenes, an important setting for computer vision.

- **Summary**: Event cameras offer many advantages over standard cameras due to their distinctive principle of operation: low power, low latency, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, the success of many downstream visual applications also hinges on an efficient and effective scene representation, where Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is seen as the leading candidate. Such promise and potential of event cameras and NeRF inspired recent works to investigate on the reconstruction of NeRF from moving event cameras. However, these works are mainly limited in terms of the dependence on dense and low-noise event streams, as well as generalization to arbitrary contrast threshold values and camera speed profiles. In this work, we propose Robust e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and robustly reconstruct NeRFs from moving event cameras under various real-world conditions, especially from sparse and noisy events generated under non-uniform motion. It consists of two key components: a realistic event generation model that accounts for various intrinsic parameters (e.g. time-independent, asymmetric threshold and refractory period) and non-idealities (e.g. pixel-to-pixel threshold variation), as well as a complementary pair of normalized reconstruction losses that can effectively generalize to arbitrary speed profiles and intrinsic parameter values without such prior knowledge. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, synthetic dataset and improved event simulator are public.

- **Summary**: RANSAC-based algorithms are the standard techniques for robust estimation in computer vision. These algorithms are iterative and computationally expensive; they alternate between random sampling of data, computing hypotheses, and running inlier counting. Many authors tried different approaches to improve efficiency. One of the major improvements is having a guided sampling, letting the RANSAC cycle stop sooner. This paper presents a new adaptive sampling process for RANSAC. Previous methods either assume no prior information about the inlier/outlier classification of data points or use some previously computed scores in the sampling. In this paper, we derive a dynamic Bayesian network that updates individual data points' inlier scores while iterating RANSAC. At each iteration, we apply weighted sampling using the updated scores. Our method works with or without prior data point scorings. In addition, we use the updated inlier/outlier scoring for deriving a new stopping criterion for the RANSAC loop. We test our method in multiple real-world datasets for several applications and obtain state-of-the-art results. Our method outperforms the baselines in accuracy while needing less computational time.

- **Summary**: Ordinal classification models assign higher penalties to predictions further away from the true class. As a result, they are appropriate for relevant diagnostic tasks like disease progression prediction or medical image grading. The consensus for assessing their categorical predictions dictates the use of distance-sensitive metrics like the Quadratic-Weighted Kappa score or the Expected Cost. However, there has been little discussion regarding how to measure performance of probabilistic predictions for ordinal classifiers. In conventional classification, common measures for probabilistic predictions are Proper Scoring Rules (PSR) like the Brier score, or Calibration Errors like the ECE, yet these are not optimal choices for ordinal classification. A PSR named Ranked Probability Score (RPS), widely popular in the forecasting field, is more suitable for this task, but it has received no attention in the image analysis community. This paper advocates the use of the RPS for image grading tasks. In addition, we demonstrate a counter-intuitive and questionable behavior of this score, and propose a simple fix for it. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale biomedical image grading problems over three different datasets show that the RPS is a more suitable performance metric for probabilistic ordinal predictions.

- **Summary**: We propose a minimal path method to simultaneously compute segmentation masks and extract centerlines of tubular structures with line-topology. Minimal path methods are commonly used for the segmentation of tubular structures in a wide variety of applications. Recent methods use features extracted by CNNs, and often outperform methods using hand-tuned features. However, for CNN-based methods, the samples used for training may be generated inappropriately, so that they can be very different from samples encountered during inference. We approach this discrepancy by introducing a novel iterative training scheme, which enables generating better training samples specifically tailored for the minimal path methods without changing existing annotations. In our method, segmentation masks and centerlines are not determined after one another by post-processing, but obtained using the same steps. Our method requires only very few annotated training images. Comparison with seven previous approaches on three public datasets, including satellite images and medical images, shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art results both for segmentation masks and centerlines.

- **Summary**: Learning high-quality video representation has shown significant applications in computer vision and remains challenging. Previous work based on mask autoencoders such as ImageMAE and VideoMAE has proven the effectiveness of learning representations in images and videos through reconstruction strategy in the visual modality. However, these models exhibit inherent limitations, particularly in scenarios where extracting features solely from the visual modality proves challenging, such as when dealing with low-resolution and blurry original videos. Based on this, we propose AV-MaskEnhancer for learning high-quality video representation by combining visual and audio information. Our approach addresses the challenge by demonstrating the complementary nature of audio and video features in cross-modality content. Moreover, our result of the video classification task on the UCF101 dataset outperforms the existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art, with a top-1 accuracy of 98.8% and a top-5 accuracy of 99.9%.

- **Summary**: Plant diseases remain a considerable threat to food security and agricultural sustainability. Rapid and early identification of these diseases has become a significant concern motivating several studies to rely on the increasing global digitalization and the recent advances in computer vision based on deep learning. In fact, plant disease classification based on deep convolutional neural networks has shown impressive performance. However, these methods have yet to be adopted globally due to concerns regarding their robustness, transparency, and the lack of explainability compared with their human experts counterparts. Methods such as saliency-based approaches associating the network output to perturbations of the input pixels have been proposed to give insights into these algorithms. Still, they are not easily comprehensible and not intuitive for human users and are threatened by bias. In this work, we deploy a method called Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) that shifts the focus from pixels to user-defined concepts. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to employ this method in the field of plant disease classification. Important concepts such as color, texture and disease related concepts were analyzed. The results suggest that concept-based explanation methods can significantly benefit automated plant disease identification.

- **Summary**: The ability to retrieve a photo by mere free-hand sketching highlights the immense potential of Fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR). However, its rapid practical adoption, as well as scalability, is limited by the expense of acquiring faithful sketches for easily available photo counterparts. A solution to this problem is Active Learning, which could minimise the need for labeled sketches while maximising performance. Despite extensive studies in the field, there exists no work that utilises it for reducing sketching effort in FG-SBIR tasks. To this end, we propose a novel active learning sampling technique that drastically minimises the need for drawing photo sketches. Our proposed approach tackles the trade-off between uncertainty and diversity by utilising the relationship between the existing photo-sketch pair to a photo that does not have its sketch and augmenting this relation with its intermediate representations. Since our approach relies only on the underlying data distribution, it is agnostic of the modelling approach and hence is applicable to other cross-modal instance-level retrieval tasks as well. With experimentation over two publicly available fine-grained SBIR datasets ChairV2 and ShoeV2, we validate our approach and reveal its superiority over adapted baselines.

- **Summary**: Food image classification is a fundamental step of image-based dietary assessment, enabling automated nutrient analysis from food images. Many current methods employ deep neural networks to train on generic food image datasets that do not reflect the dynamism of real-life food consumption patterns, in which food images appear sequentially over time, reflecting the progression of what an individual consumes. Personalized food classification aims to address this problem by training a deep neural network using food images that reflect the consumption pattern of each individual. However, this problem is under-explored and there is a lack of benchmark datasets with individualized food consumption patterns due to the difficulty in data collection. In this work, we first introduce two benchmark personalized datasets including the Food101-Personal, which is created based on surveys of daily dietary patterns from participants in the real world, and the VFNPersonal, which is developed based on a dietary study. In addition, we propose a new framework for personalized food image classification by leveraging self-supervised learning and temporal image feature information. Our method is evaluated on both benchmark datasets and shows improved performance compared to existing works. The dataset has been made available at: https://skynet.ecn.purdue.edu/~pan161/dataset_personal.html

- **Summary**: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death for women worldwide. Early screening is essential for early identification, but the chance of survival declines as the cancer progresses into advanced stages. For this study, the most recent BRACS dataset of histological (H\&E) stained images was used to classify breast cancer tumours, which contains both the whole-slide images (WSI) and region-of-interest (ROI) images, however, for our study we have considered ROI images. We have experimented using different pre-trained deep learning models, such as Xception, EfficientNet, ResNet50, and InceptionResNet, pre-trained on the ImageNet weights. We pre-processed the BRACS ROI along with image augmentation, upsampling, and dataset split strategies. For the default dataset split, the best results were obtained by ResNet50 achieving 66\% f1-score. For the custom dataset split, the best results were obtained by performing upsampling and image augmentation which results in 96.2\% f1-score. Our second approach also reduced the number of false positive and false negative classifications to less than 3\% for each class. We believe that our study significantly impacts the early diagnosis and identification of breast cancer tumors and their subtypes, especially atypical and malignant tumors, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing patient mortality rates. Overall, this study has primarily focused on identifying seven (7) breast cancer tumor subtypes, and we believe that the experimental models can be fine-tuned further to generalize over previous breast cancer histology datasets as well.

- **Summary**: We introduce MHVAE, a deep hierarchical variational auto-encoder (VAE) that synthesizes missing images from various modalities. Extending multi-modal VAEs with a hierarchical latent structure, we introduce a probabilistic formulation for fusing multi-modal images in a common latent representation while having the flexibility to handle incomplete image sets as input. Moreover, adversarial learning is employed to generate sharper images. Extensive experiments are performed on the challenging problem of joint intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) and Magnetic Resonance (MR) synthesis. Our model outperformed multi-modal VAEs, conditional GANs, and the current state-of-the-art unified method (ResViT) for synthesizing missing images, demonstrating the advantage of using a hierarchical latent representation and a principled probabilistic fusion operation. Our code is publicly available \url{https://github.com/ReubenDo/MHVAE}.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks used in computer vision have been shown to exhibit many social biases such as gender bias. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become increasingly popular in computer vision applications, outperforming Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in many tasks such as image classification. However, given that research on mitigating bias in computer vision has primarily focused on CNNs, it is important to evaluate the effect of a different network architecture on the potential for bias amplification. In this paper we therefore introduce a novel metric to measure bias in architectures, Accuracy Difference. We examine bias amplification when models belonging to these two architectures are used as a part of large multimodal models, evaluating the different image encoders of Contrastive Language Image Pretraining which is an important model used in many generative models such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. Our experiments demonstrate that architecture can play a role in amplifying social biases due to the different techniques employed by the models for feature extraction and embedding as well as their different learning properties. This research found that ViTs amplified gender bias to a greater extent than CNNs

- **Summary**: This paper quantifies the impact of adverse environmental conditions on the detection of fiducial markers (i.e., artificial landmarks) by color cameras mounted on rotorcraft. We restrict our attention to square markers with a black-and-white pattern of grid cells that can be nested to allow detection at multiple scales. These markers have the potential to enhance the reliability of precision takeoff and landing at vertiports by flying vehicles in urban settings. Prior work has shown, in particular, that these markers can be detected with high precision (i.e., few false positives) and high recall (i.e., few false negatives). However, most of this prior work has been based on image sequences collected indoors with hand-held cameras. Our work is based on image sequences collected outdoors with cameras mounted on a quadrotor during semi-autonomous takeoff and landing operations under adverse environmental conditions that include variations in temperature, illumination, wind speed, humidity, visibility, and precipitation. In addition to precision and recall, performance measures include continuity, availability, robustness, resiliency, and coverage volume. We release both our dataset and the code we used for analysis to the public as open source.

- **Summary**: Cross-domain pedestrian detection aims to generalize pedestrian detectors from one label-rich domain to another label-scarce domain, which is crucial for various real-world applications. Most recent works focus on domain alignment to train domain-adaptive detectors either at the instance level or image level. From a practical point of view, one-stage detectors are faster. Therefore, we concentrate on designing a cross-domain algorithm for rapid one-stage detectors that lacks instance-level proposals and can only perform image-level feature alignment. However, pure image-level feature alignment causes the foreground-background misalignment issue to arise, i.e., the foreground features in the source domain image are falsely aligned with background features in the target domain image. To address this issue, we systematically analyze the importance of foreground and background in image-level cross-domain alignment, and learn that background plays a more critical role in image-level cross-domain alignment. Therefore, we focus on cross-domain background feature alignment while minimizing the influence of foreground features on the cross-domain alignment stage. This paper proposes a novel framework, namely, background-focused distribution alignment (BFDA), to train domain adaptive onestage pedestrian detectors. Specifically, BFDA first decouples the background features from the whole image feature maps and then aligns them via a novel long-short-range discriminator.

- **Summary**: In this work, we contribute towards the development of video-based epileptic seizure classification by introducing a novel framework (SETR-PKD), which could achieve privacy-preserved early detection of seizures in videos. Specifically, our framework has two significant components - (1) It is built upon optical flow features extracted from the video of a seizure, which encodes the seizure motion semiotics while preserving the privacy of the patient; (2) It utilizes a transformer based progressive knowledge distillation, where the knowledge is gradually distilled from networks trained on a longer portion of video samples to the ones which will operate on shorter portions. Thus, our proposed framework addresses the limitations of the current approaches which compromise the privacy of the patients by directly operating on the RGB video of a seizure as well as impede real-time detection of a seizure by utilizing the full video sample to make a prediction. Our SETR-PKD framework could detect tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs) in a privacy-preserving manner with an accuracy of 83.9% while they are only half-way into their progression.

- **Summary**: Systematic generalization is a crucial aspect of intelligence, which refers to the ability to generalize to novel tasks by combining known subtasks and concepts. One critical factor that has been shown to influence systematic generalization is the diversity of training data. However, diversity can be defined in various ways, as data have many factors of variation. A more granular understanding of how different aspects of data diversity affect systematic generalization is lacking. We present new evidence in the problem of Visual Question Answering (VQA) that reveals that the diversity of simple tasks (i.e. tasks formed by a few subtasks and concepts) plays a key role in achieving systematic generalization. This implies that it may not be essential to gather a large and varied number of complex tasks, which could be costly to obtain. We demonstrate that this result is independent of the similarity between the training and testing data and applies to well-known families of neural network architectures for VQA (i.e. monolithic architectures and neural module networks). Additionally, we observe that neural module networks leverage all forms of data diversity we evaluated, while monolithic architectures require more extensive amounts of data to do so. These findings provide a first step towards understanding the interactions between data diversity design, neural network architectures, and systematic generalization capabilities.

- **Summary**: Object understanding in egocentric visual data is arguably a fundamental research topic in egocentric vision. However, existing object datasets are either non-egocentric or have limitations in object categories, visual content, and annotation granularities. In this work, we introduce EgoObjects, a large-scale egocentric dataset for fine-grained object understanding. Its Pilot version contains over 9K videos collected by 250 participants from 50+ countries using 4 wearable devices, and over 650K object annotations from 368 object categories. Unlike prior datasets containing only object category labels, EgoObjects also annotates each object with an instance-level identifier, and includes over 14K unique object instances. EgoObjects was designed to capture the same object under diverse background complexities, surrounding objects, distance, lighting and camera motion. In parallel to the data collection, we conducted data annotation by developing a multi-stage federated annotation process to accommodate the growing nature of the dataset. To bootstrap the research on EgoObjects, we present a suite of 4 benchmark tasks around the egocentric object understanding, including a novel instance level- and the classical category level object detection. Moreover, we also introduce 2 novel continual learning object detection tasks. The dataset and API are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/EgoObjects.

- **Summary**: This paper considers contrastive training for cross-modal 0-shot transfer wherein a pre-trained model in one modality is used for representation learning in another domain using pairwise data. The learnt models in the latter domain can then be used for a diverse set of tasks in a zero-shot way, similar to ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)'' and ``Locked-image Tuning (LiT)'' that have recently gained considerable attention. Most existing works for cross-modal representation alignment (including CLIP and LiT) use the standard contrastive training objective, which employs sets of positive and negative examples to align similar and repel dissimilar training data samples. However, similarity amongst training examples has a more continuous nature, thus calling for a more `non-binary' treatment. To address this, we propose a novel loss function called Continuously Weighted Contrastive Loss (CWCL) that employs a continuous measure of similarity. With CWCL, we seek to align the embedding space of one modality with another. Owing to the continuous nature of similarity in the proposed loss function, these models outperform existing methods for 0-shot transfer across multiple models, datasets and modalities. Particularly, we consider the modality pairs of image-text and speech-text and our models achieve 5-8% (absolute) improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods in 0-shot image classification and 20-30% (absolute) improvement in 0-shot speech-to-intent classification and keyword classification.

- **Summary**: This work investigates efficient score-based black-box adversarial attacks with a high Attack Success Rate (ASR) and good generalizability. We design a novel attack method based on a Disentangled Feature space, called DifAttack, which differs significantly from the existing ones operating over the entire feature space. Specifically, DifAttack firstly disentangles an image's latent feature into an adversarial feature and a visual feature, where the former dominates the adversarial capability of an image, while the latter largely determines its visual appearance. We train an autoencoder for the disentanglement by using pairs of clean images and their Adversarial Examples (AEs) generated from available surrogate models via white-box attack methods. Eventually, DifAttack iteratively optimizes the adversarial feature according to the query feedback from the victim model until a successful AE is generated, while keeping the visual feature unaltered. In addition, due to the avoidance of using surrogate models' gradient information when optimizing AEs for black-box models, our proposed DifAttack inherently possesses better attack capability in the open-set scenario, where the training dataset of the victim model is unknown. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in ASR and query efficiency simultaneously, especially in the targeted attack and open-set scenarios. The code will be available at https://github.com/csjunjun/DifAttack.git soon.

- **Summary**: The tongue's intricate 3D structure, comprising localized functional units, plays a crucial role in the production of speech. When measured using tagged MRI, these functional units exhibit cohesive displacements and derived quantities that facilitate the complex process of speech production. Non-negative matrix factorization-based approaches have been shown to estimate the functional units through motion features, yielding a set of building blocks and a corresponding weighting map. Investigating the link between weighting maps and speech acoustics can offer significant insights into the intricate process of speech production. To this end, in this work, we utilize two-dimensional spectrograms as a proxy representation, and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for translating weighting maps to their corresponding audio waveforms. Our proposed plastic light transformer (PLT) framework is based on directional product relative position bias and single-level spatial pyramid pooling, thus enabling flexible processing of weighting maps with variable size to fixed-size spectrograms, without input information loss or dimension expansion. Additionally, our PLT framework efficiently models the global correlation of wide matrix input. To improve the realism of our generated spectrograms with relatively limited training samples, we apply pair-wise utterance consistency with Maximum Mean Discrepancy constraint and adversarial training. Experimental results on a dataset of 29 subjects speaking two utterances demonstrated that our framework is able to synthesize speech audio waveforms from weighting maps, outperforming conventional convolution and transformer models.

- **Summary**: Purpose: The aim of this work is to develop a neural network training framework for continual training of small amounts of medical imaging data and create heuristics to assess training in the absence of a hold-out validation or test set.   Materials and Methods: We formulated a retrospective sequential learning approach that would train and consistently update a model on mini-batches of medical images over time. We address problems that impede sequential learning such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and concept drift through PyTorch convolutional neural networks (CNN) and publicly available Medical MNIST and NIH Chest X-Ray imaging datasets. We begin by comparing two methods for a sequentially trained CNN with and without base pre-training. We then transition to two methods of unique training and validation data recruitment to estimate full information extraction without overfitting. Lastly, we consider an example of real-life data that shows how our approach would see mainstream research implementation.   Results: For the first experiment, both approaches successfully reach a ~95% accuracy threshold, although the short pre-training step enables sequential accuracy to plateau in fewer steps. The second experiment comparing two methods showed better performance with the second method which crosses the ~90% accuracy threshold much sooner. The final experiment showed a slight advantage with a pre-training step that allows the CNN to cross ~60% threshold much sooner than without pre-training.   Conclusion: We have displayed sequential learning as a serviceable multi-classification technique statistically comparable to traditional CNNs that can acquire data in small increments feasible for clinically realistic scenarios.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D generation is to craft a 3D object according to a natural language description. This can significantly reduce the workload for manually designing 3D models and provide a more natural way of interaction for users. However, this problem remains challenging in recovering the fine-grained details effectively and optimizing a large-size 3D output efficiently. Inspired by the success of progressive learning, we propose a Multi-Scale Triplane Network (MTN) and a new progressive learning strategy. As the name implies, the Multi-Scale Triplane Network consists of four triplanes transitioning from low to high resolution. The low-resolution triplane could serve as an initial shape for the high-resolution ones, easing the optimization difficulty. To further enable the fine-grained details, we also introduce the progressive learning strategy, which explicitly demands the network to shift its focus of attention from simple coarse-grained patterns to difficult fine-grained patterns. Our experiment verifies that the proposed method performs favorably against existing methods. For even the most challenging descriptions, where most existing methods struggle to produce a viable shape, our proposed method consistently delivers. We aspire for our work to pave the way for automatic 3D prototyping via natural language descriptions.

- **Summary**: Tracking using bio-inspired event cameras has drawn more and more attention in recent years. Existing works either utilize aligned RGB and event data for accurate tracking or directly learn an event-based tracker. The first category needs more cost for inference and the second one may be easily influenced by noisy events or sparse spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework that can fully utilize multi-modal / multi-view information during training to facilitate knowledge transfer, enabling us to achieve high-speed and low-latency visual tracking during testing by using only event signals. Specifically, a teacher Transformer-based multi-modal tracking framework is first trained by feeding the RGB frame and event stream simultaneously. Then, we design a new hierarchical knowledge distillation strategy which includes pairwise similarity, feature representation, and response maps-based knowledge distillation to guide the learning of the student Transformer network. Moreover, since existing event-based tracking datasets are all low-resolution ($346 \times 260$), we propose the first large-scale high-resolution ($1280 \times 720$) dataset named EventVOT. It contains 1141 videos and covers a wide range of categories such as pedestrians, vehicles, UAVs, ping pongs, etc. Extensive experiments on both low-resolution (FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT), and our newly proposed high-resolution EventVOT dataset fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed method. The dataset, evaluation toolkit, and source code are available on \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/EventVOT_Benchmark}

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to predict complex semantics and geometry shapes from a single image, requiring no 3D inputs. In this paper, we identify several critical issues in current state-of-the-art methods, including the Feature Ambiguity of projected 2D features in the ray to the 3D space, the Pose Ambiguity of the 3D convolution, and the Computation Imbalance in the 3D convolution across different depth levels. To address these problems, we devise a novel Normalized Device Coordinates scene completion network (NDC-Scene) that directly extends the 2D feature map to a Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC) space, rather than to the world space directly, through progressive restoration of the dimension of depth with deconvolution operations. Experiment results demonstrate that transferring the majority of computation from the target 3D space to the proposed normalized device coordinates space benefits monocular SSC tasks. Additionally, we design a Depth-Adaptive Dual Decoder to simultaneously upsample and fuse the 2D and 3D feature maps, further improving overall performance. Our extensive experiments confirm that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both outdoor SemanticKITTI and indoor NYUv2 datasets.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection is a complex task, and the principle of "divide and conquer" is often regarded as an effective approach to tackling intricate issues. It's noteworthy that recent methods in video anomaly detection have revealed the application of the divide and conquer philosophy (albeit with distinct perspectives from traditional usage), yielding impressive outcomes. This paper systematically reviews these literatures from six dimensions, aiming to enhance the use of the divide and conquer strategy in video anomaly detection. Furthermore, based on the insights gained from this review, a novel approach is presented, which integrates human skeletal frameworks with video data analysis techniques. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset, surpassing all existing advanced methods.



### Text-to-Image Generation for Abstract Concepts

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed the substantial progress of large-scale models across various domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision, facilitating the expression of concrete concepts. Unlike concrete concepts that are usually directly associated with physical objects, expressing abstract concepts through natural language requires considerable effort, which results from their intricate semantics and connotations. An alternative approach is to leverage images to convey rich visual information as a supplement. Nevertheless, existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models are primarily trained on concrete physical objects and tend to fail to visualize abstract concepts. Inspired by the three-layer artwork theory that identifies critical factors, intent, object and form during artistic creation, we propose a framework of Text-to-Image generation for Abstract Concepts (TIAC). The abstract concept is clarified into a clear intent with a detailed definition to avoid ambiguity. LLMs then transform it into semantic-related physical objects, and the concept-dependent form is retrieved from an LLM-extracted form pattern set. Information from these three aspects will be integrated to generate prompts for T2I models via LLM. Evaluation results from human assessments and our newly designed metric concept score demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in creating images that can sufficiently express abstract concepts.

- **Summary**: Thresholds in treatment assignments can produce discontinuities in outcomes, revealing causal insights. In many contexts, like geographic settings, these thresholds are unknown and multivariate. We propose a non-parametric method to estimate the resulting discontinuities by segmenting the regression surface into smooth and discontinuous parts. This estimator uses a convex relaxation of the Mumford-Shah functional, for which we establish identification and convergence. Using our method, we estimate that an internet shutdown in India resulted in a reduction of economic activity by over 50%, greatly surpassing previous estimates and shedding new light on the true cost of such shutdowns for digital economies globally.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art autonomous driving vehicles mainly rely on each individual sensor system to perform perception tasks. Such a framework's reliability could be limited by occlusion or sensor failure. To address this issue, more recent research proposes using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to share perception information with others. However, most relevant works focus only on cooperative detection and leave cooperative tracking an underexplored research field. A few recent datasets, such as V2V4Real, provide 3D multi-object cooperative tracking benchmarks. However, their proposed methods mainly use cooperative detection results as input to a standard single-sensor Kalman Filter-based tracking algorithm. In their approach, the measurement uncertainty of different sensors from different connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) may not be properly estimated to utilize the theoretical optimality property of Kalman Filter-based tracking algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D multi-object cooperative tracking algorithm for autonomous driving via a differentiable multi-sensor Kalman Filter. Our algorithm learns to estimate measurement uncertainty for each detection that can better utilize the theoretical property of Kalman Filter-based tracking methods. The experiment results show that our algorithm improves the tracking accuracy by 17% with only 0.037x communication costs compared with the state-of-the-art method in V2V4Real.

- **Summary**: Image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental task in the fields of robot navigation and mobile mapping. Existing I2P registration works estimate correspondences at the point-to-pixel level, neglecting the global alignment. However, I2P matching without high-level guidance from global constraints may converge to the local optimum easily. To solve the problem, this paper proposes CoFiI2P, a novel I2P registration network that extracts correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner for the global optimal solution. First, the image and point cloud are fed into a Siamese encoder-decoder network for hierarchical feature extraction. Then, a coarse-to-fine matching module is designed to exploit features and establish resilient feature correspondences. Specifically, in the coarse matching block, a novel I2P transformer module is employed to capture the homogeneous and heterogeneous global information from image and point cloud. With the discriminate descriptors, coarse super-point-to-super-pixel matching pairs are estimated. In the fine matching module, point-to-pixel pairs are established with the super-point-to-super-pixel correspondence supervision. Finally, based on matching pairs, the transform matrix is estimated with the EPnP-RANSAC algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset have demonstrated that CoFiI2P achieves a relative rotation error (RRE) of 2.25 degrees and a relative translation error (RTE) of 0.61 meters. These results represent a significant improvement of 14% in RRE and 52% in RTE compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. The demo video for the experiments is available at https://youtu.be/TG2GBrJTuW4. The source code will be public at https://github.com/kang-1-2-3/CoFiI2P.

- **Summary**: Zero-Shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches propose novel training-free metrics called zero-shot proxies to substantially reduce the search time compared to the traditional training-based NAS. Despite the success on image classification, the effectiveness of zero-shot proxies is rarely evaluated on complex vision tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. Moreover, existing zero-shot proxies are shown to be biased towards certain model characteristics which restricts their broad applicability. In this paper, we empirically study the bias of state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot proxy ZiCo across multiple vision tasks and observe that ZiCo is biased towards thinner and deeper networks, leading to sub-optimal architectures. To solve the problem, we propose a novel bias correction on ZiCo, called ZiCo-BC. Our extensive experiments across various vision tasks (image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation) show that our approach can successfully search for architectures with higher accuracy and significantly lower latency on Samsung Galaxy S10 devices.

- **Summary**: With the growing demand for vision applications and deployment across edge devices, the development of hardware-friendly architectures that maintain performance during device deployment becomes crucial. Neural architecture search (NAS) techniques explore various approaches to discover efficient architectures for diverse learning tasks in a computationally efficient manner. In this paper, we present the next-generation neural architecture design for computationally efficient neural architecture distillation - DONNAv2 . Conventional NAS algorithms rely on a computationally extensive stage where an accuracy predictor is learned to estimate model performance within search space. This building of accuracy predictors helps them predict the performance of models that are not being finetuned. Here, we have developed an elegant approach to eliminate building the accuracy predictor and extend DONNA to a computationally efficient setting. The loss metric of individual blocks forming the network serves as the surrogate performance measure for the sampled models in the NAS search stage. To validate the performance of DONNAv2 we have performed extensive experiments involving a range of diverse vision tasks including classification, object detection, image denoising, super-resolution, and panoptic perception network (YOLOP). The hardware-in-the-loop experiments were carried out using the Samsung Galaxy S10 mobile platform. Notably, DONNAv2 reduces the computational cost of DONNA by 10x for the larger datasets. Furthermore, to improve the quality of NAS search space, DONNAv2 leverages a block knowledge distillation filter to remove blocks with high inference costs.

- **Summary**: We present a general and simple text to video model based on Transformer. Since both text and video are sequential data, we encode both texts and images into the same hidden space, which are further fed into Transformer to capture the temporal consistency and then decoder to generate either text or images. Considering the image signal may become weak in the long sequence, we introduce the U-Net to reconstruct image from its noised version. Specifically, we increase the noise level to the original image in the long sequence, then use the $down$ module from U-Net to encode noised images, which are further input to transformer to predict next clear images. We also add a constraint to promote motion between any generated image pair in the video. We use GPT2 and test our approach on UCF101 dataset and show it can generate promising videos.

- **Summary**: Realistic and diverse traffic scenarios in large quantities are crucial for the development and validation of autonomous driving systems. However, owing to numerous difficulties in the data collection process and the reliance on intensive annotations, real-world datasets lack sufficient quantity and diversity to support the increasing demand for data. This work introduces DriveSceneGen, a data-driven driving scenario generation method that learns from the real-world driving dataset and generates entire dynamic driving scenarios from scratch. DriveSceneGen is able to generate novel driving scenarios that align with real-world data distributions with high fidelity and diversity. Experimental results on 5k generated scenarios highlight the generation quality, diversity, and scalability compared to real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, DriveSceneGen is the first method that generates novel driving scenarios involving both static map elements and dynamic traffic participants from scratch.

- **Summary**: Given the severe vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against adversarial examples, there is an urgent need for an effective adversarial attack to identify the deficiencies of DNNs in security-sensitive applications. As one of the prevalent black-box adversarial attacks, the existing transfer-based attacks still cannot achieve comparable performance with the white-box attacks. Among these, input transformation based attacks have shown remarkable effectiveness in boosting transferability. In this work, we find that the existing input transformation based attacks transform the input image globally, resulting in limited diversity of the transformed images. We postulate that the more diverse transformed images result in better transferability. Thus, we investigate how to locally apply various transformations onto the input image to improve such diversity while preserving the structure of image. To this end, we propose a novel input transformation based attack, called Structure Invariant Attack (SIA), which applies a random image transformation onto each image block to craft a set of diverse images for gradient calculation. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that SIA exhibits much better transferability than the existing SOTA input transformation based attacks on CNN-based and transformer-based models, showing its generality and superiority in boosting transferability.

- **Summary**: Viewport prediction is a crucial aspect of tile-based 360 video streaming system. However, existing trajectory based methods lack of robustness, also oversimplify the process of information construction and fusion between different modality inputs, leading to the error accumulation problem. In this paper, we propose a tile classification based viewport prediction method with Multi-modal Fusion Transformer, namely MFTR. Specifically, MFTR utilizes transformer-based networks to extract the long-range dependencies within each modality, then mine intra- and inter-modality relations to capture the combined impact of user historical inputs and video contents on future viewport selection. In addition, MFTR categorizes future tiles into two categories: user interested or not, and selects future viewport as the region that contains most user interested tiles. Comparing with predicting head trajectories, choosing future viewport based on tile's binary classification results exhibits better robustness and interpretability. To evaluate our proposed MFTR, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used PVS-HM and Xu-Gaze dataset. MFTR shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of average prediction accuracy and overlap ratio, also presents competitive computation efficiency.

- **Summary**: Learning-based methods have attracted a lot of research attention and led to significant improvements in low-light image enhancement. However, most of them still suffer from two main problems: expensive computational cost in high resolution images and unsatisfactory performance in simultaneous enhancement and denoising. To address these problems, we propose BDCE, a bootstrap diffusion model that exploits the learning of the distribution of the curve parameters instead of the normal-light image itself. Specifically, we adopt the curve estimation method to handle the high-resolution images, where the curve parameters are estimated by our bootstrap diffusion model. In addition, a denoise module is applied in each iteration of curve adjustment to denoise the intermediate enhanced result of each iteration. We evaluate BDCE on commonly used benchmark datasets, and extensive experiments show that it achieves state-of-the-art qualitative and quantitative performance.

- **Summary**: Although current deep models for face tasks surpass human performance on some benchmarks, we do not understand how they work. Thus, we cannot predict how it will react to novel inputs, resulting in catastrophic failures and unwanted biases in the algorithms. Explainable AI helps bridge the gap, but currently, there are very few visualization algorithms designed for faces. This work undertakes a first-of-its-kind meta-analysis of explainability algorithms in the face domain. We explore the nuances and caveats of adapting general-purpose visualization algorithms to the face domain, illustrated by computing visualizations on popular face models. We review existing face explainability works and reveal valuable insights into the structure and hierarchy of face networks. We also determine the design considerations for practical face visualizations accessible to AI practitioners by conducting a user study on the utility of various explainability algorithms.

- **Summary**: Inspired by Federated Learning, in this paper, we propose personal large models that are distilled from traditional large language models but more adaptive to local users' personal information such as education background and hobbies. We classify the large language models into three levels: the personal level, expert level and traditional level. The personal level models are adaptive to users' personal information. They encrypt the users' input and protect their privacy. The expert level models focus on merging specific knowledge such as finance, IT and art. The traditional models focus on the universal knowledge discovery and upgrading the expert models. In such classifications, the personal models directly interact with the user. For the whole system, the personal models have users' (encrypted) personal information. Moreover, such models must be small enough to be performed on personal computers or mobile devices. Finally, they also have to response in real-time for better user experience and produce high quality results. The proposed personal large models can be applied in a wide range of applications such as language and vision tasks.

- **Summary**: We introduce an online 2D-to-3D semantic instance mapping algorithm aimed at generating comprehensive, accurate, and efficient semantic 3D maps suitable for autonomous agents in unstructured environments. The proposed approach is based on a Voxel-TSDF representation used in recent algorithms. It introduces novel ways of integrating semantic prediction confidence during mapping, producing semantic and instance-consistent 3D regions. Further improvements are achieved by graph optimization-based semantic labeling and instance refinement. The proposed method achieves accuracy superior to the state of the art on public large-scale datasets, improving on a number of widely used metrics. We also highlight a downfall in the evaluation of recent studies: using the ground truth trajectory as input instead of a SLAM-estimated one substantially affects the accuracy, creating a large gap between the reported results and the actual performance on real-world data.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation is challenging due to its inherent ambiguity and ill-posed nature, yet it is quite important to many applications. While recent works achieve limited accuracy by designing increasingly complicated networks to extract features with limited spatial geometric cues from a single RGB image, we intend to introduce spatial cues by training a teacher network that leverages left-right image pairs as inputs and transferring the learned 3D geometry-aware knowledge to the monocular student network. Specifically, we present a novel knowledge distillation framework, named ADU-Depth, with the goal of leveraging the well-trained teacher network to guide the learning of the student network, thus boosting the precise depth estimation with the help of extra spatial scene information. To enable domain adaptation and ensure effective and smooth knowledge transfer from teacher to student, we apply both attention-adapted feature distillation and focal-depth-adapted response distillation in the training stage. In addition, we explicitly model the uncertainty of depth estimation to guide distillation in both feature space and result space to better produce 3D-aware knowledge from monocular observations and thus enhance the learning for hard-to-predict image regions. Our extensive experiments on the real depth estimation datasets KITTI and DrivingStereo demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which ranked 1st on the challenging KITTI online benchmark.

- **Summary**: Most existing learning-based infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) methods exhibit massive redundant information in the fusion images, i.e., yielding edge-blurring effect or unrecognizable for object detectors. To alleviate these issues, we propose a semantic structure-preserving approach for IVIF, namely SSPFusion. At first, we design a Structural Feature Extractor (SFE) to extract the structural features of infrared and visible images. Then, we introduce a multi-scale Structure-Preserving Fusion (SPF) module to fuse the structural features of infrared and visible images, while maintaining the consistency of semantic structures between the fusion and source images. Owing to these two effective modules, our method is able to generate high-quality fusion images from pairs of infrared and visible images, which can boost the performance of downstream computer-vision tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms eight state-of-the-art image fusion methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code for our method, along with additional comparison results, will be made available at: https://github.com/QiaoYang-CV/SSPFUSION.

- **Summary**: Deepfake images are fast becoming a serious concern due to their realism. Diffusion models have recently demonstrated highly realistic visual content generation, which makes them an excellent potential tool for Deepfake generation. To curb their exploitation for Deepfakes, it is imperative to first explore the extent to which diffusion models can be used to generate realistic content that is controllable with convenient prompts. This paper devises and explores a novel method in that regard. Our technique alters the popular stable diffusion model to generate a controllable high-quality Deepfake image with text and image prompts. In addition, the original stable model lacks severely in generating quality images that contain multiple persons. The modified diffusion model is able to address this problem, it add input anchor image's latent at the beginning of inferencing rather than Gaussian random latent as input. Hence, we focus on generating forged content for celebrity interactions, which may be used to spread rumors. We also apply Dreambooth to enhance the realism of our fake images. Dreambooth trains the pairing of center words and specific features to produce more refined and personalized output images. Our results show that with the devised scheme, it is possible to create fake visual content with alarming realism, such that the content can serve as believable evidence of meetings between powerful political figures.

- **Summary**: This paper presents PathFinder and PathFinderPlus, two novel end-to-end computer vision frameworks designed specifically for advanced setting strategy classification in volleyball matches from a single camera view. Our frameworks combine setting ball trajectory recognition with a novel set trajectory classifier to generate comprehensive and advanced statistical data. This approach offers a fresh perspective for in-game analysis and surpasses the current level of granularity in volleyball statistics. In comparison to existing methods used in our baseline PathFinder framework, our proposed ball trajectory detection methodology in PathFinderPlus exhibits superior performance for classifying setting tactics under various game conditions. This robustness is particularly advantageous in handling complex game situations and accommodating different camera angles. Additionally, our study introduces an innovative algorithm for automatic identification of the opposing team's right-side (opposite) hitter's current row (front or back) during gameplay, providing critical insights for tactical analysis. The successful demonstration of our single-camera system's feasibility and benefits makes high-level technical analysis accessible to volleyball enthusiasts of all skill levels and resource availability. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of our system allows for real-time deployment, enabling in-game strategy analysis and on-the-spot gameplan adjustments.

- **Summary**: Image denoising is a fundamental task in low-level computer vision. While recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have achieved impressive performance, they are black-box models and the underlying denoising principle remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image denoising that offers both clear denoising mechanism and good performance. We view noise as a type of image style and remove it by incorporating noise-free styles derived from clean images. To achieve this, we design novel losses and network modules to extract noisy styles from noisy images and noise-free styles from clean images. The noise-free style induces low-response activations for noise features and high-response activations for content features in the feature space. This leads to the separation of clean contents from noise, effectively denoising the image. Unlike disentanglement-based image editing tasks that edit semantic-level attributes using styles, our main contribution lies in editing pixel-level attributes through global noise-free styles. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic noise removal and real-world image denoising datasets (SIDD and DND), demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in terms of both PSNR and SSIM metrics. Moreover, we experimentally validate that our method offers good interpretability.



### On quantifying and improving realism of images generated with diffusion

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have led to a quantum leap in the quality of generative visual content. However, quantification of realism of the content is still challenging. Existing evaluation metrics, such as Inception Score and Fr\'echet inception distance, fall short on benchmarking diffusion models due to the versatility of the generated images. Moreover, they are not designed to quantify realism of an individual image. This restricts their application in forensic image analysis, which is becoming increasingly important in the emerging era of generative models. To address that, we first propose a metric, called Image Realism Score (IRS), computed from five statistical measures of a given image. This non-learning based metric not only efficiently quantifies realism of the generated images, it is readily usable as a measure to classify a given image as real or fake. We experimentally establish the model- and data-agnostic nature of the proposed IRS by successfully detecting fake images generated by Stable Diffusion Model (SDM), Dalle2, Midjourney and BigGAN.   We further leverage this attribute of our metric to minimize an IRS-augmented generative loss of SDM, and demonstrate a convenient yet considerable quality improvement of the SDM-generated content with our modification. Our efforts have also led to Gen-100 dataset, which provides 1,000 samples for 100 classes generated by four high-quality models. We will release the dataset and code.

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework for rectifying occlusions and distortions in degraded texture samples from natural images. Traditional texture synthesis approaches focus on generating textures from pristine samples, which necessitate meticulous preparation by humans and are often unattainable in most natural images. These challenges stem from the frequent occlusions and distortions of texture samples in natural images due to obstructions and variations in object surface geometry. To address these issues, we propose a framework that synthesizes holistic textures from degraded samples in natural images, extending the applicability of exemplar-based texture synthesis techniques. Our framework utilizes a conditional Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with a novel occlusion-aware latent transformer. This latent transformer not only effectively encodes texture features from partially-observed samples necessary for the generation process of the LDM, but also explicitly captures long-range dependencies in samples with large occlusions. To train our model, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data by applying geometric transformations and free-form mask generation to clean textures. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the different components of our proposed framework. Results are corroborated by a perceptual user study which highlights the efficiency of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Most current gait recognition methods suffer from poor interpretability and high computational cost. To improve interpretability, we investigate gait features in the embedding space based on Koopman operator theory. The transition matrix in this space captures complex kinematic features of gait cycles, namely the Koopman operator. The diagonal elements of the operator matrix can represent the overall motion trend, providing a physically meaningful descriptor. To reduce the computational cost of our algorithm, we use a reversible autoencoder to reduce the model size and eliminate convolutional layers to compress its depth, resulting in fewer floating-point operations. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method reduces computational cost to 1% compared to state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive recognition accuracy 98% on non-occlusion datasets.

- **Summary**: Multi-label learning has emerged as a crucial paradigm in data analysis, addressing scenarios where instances are associated with multiple class labels simultaneously. With the growing prevalence of multi-label data across diverse applications, such as text and image classification, the significance of multi-label feature selection has become increasingly evident. This paper presents a novel information-theoretical filter-based multi-label feature selection, called ATR, with a new heuristic function. Incorporating a combinations of algorithm adaptation and problem transformation approaches, ATR ranks features considering individual labels as well as abstract label space discriminative powers. Our experimental studies encompass twelve benchmarks spanning various domains, demonstrating the superiority of our approach over ten state-of-the-art information-theoretical filter-based multi-label feature selection methods across six evaluation metrics. Furthermore, our experiments affirm the scalability of ATR for benchmarks characterized by extensive feature and label spaces. The codes are available at https://github.com/Sadegh28/ATR

- **Summary**: This study aims to explore efficient tuning methods for the screenshot captioning task. Recently, image captioning has seen significant advancements, but research in captioning tasks for mobile screens remains relatively scarce. Current datasets and use cases describing user behaviors within product screenshots are notably limited. Consequently, we sought to fine-tune pre-existing models for the screenshot captioning task. However, fine-tuning large pre-trained models can be resource-intensive, requiring considerable time, computational power, and storage due to the vast number of parameters in image captioning models. To tackle this challenge, this study proposes a combination of adapter methods, which necessitates tuning only the additional modules on the model. These methods are originally designed for vision or language tasks, and our intention is to apply them to address similar challenges in screenshot captioning. By freezing the parameters of the image caption models and training only the weights associated with the methods, performance comparable to fine-tuning the entire model can be achieved, while significantly reducing the number of parameters. This study represents the first comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness of combining adapters within the context of the screenshot captioning task. Through our experiments and analyses, this study aims to provide valuable insights into the application of adapters in vision-language models and contribute to the development of efficient tuning techniques for the screenshot captioning task.

- **Summary**: Change detection in satellite imagery seeks to find occurrences of targeted changes in a given scene taken at different instants. This task has several applications ranging from land-cover mapping, to anthropogenic activity monitory as well as climate change and natural hazard damage assessment. However, change detection is highly challenging due to the acquisition conditions and also to the subjectivity of changes. In this paper, we devise a novel algorithm for change detection based on active learning. The proposed method is based on a question and answer model that probes an oracle (user) about the relevance of changes only on a small set of critical images (referred to as virtual exemplars), and according to oracle's responses updates deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. The main contribution resides in a novel adversarial model that allows learning the most representative, diverse and uncertain virtual exemplars (as inverted preimages of the trained DNNs) that challenge (the most) the trained DNNs, and this leads to a better re-estimate of these networks in the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experiments show the out-performance of our proposed deep-net inversion against the related work.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) is a task that aims to detect the most salient object in a video without external guidance about the object. To leverage the property that salient objects usually have distinctive movements compared to the background, recent methods collaboratively use motion cues extracted from optical flow maps with appearance cues extracted from RGB images. However, as optical flow maps are usually very relevant to segmentation masks, the network is easy to be learned overly dependent on the motion cues during network training. As a result, such two-stream approaches are vulnerable to confusing motion cues, making their prediction unstable. To relieve this issue, we design a novel motion-as-option network by treating motion cues as optional. During network training, RGB images are randomly provided to the motion encoder instead of optical flow maps, to implicitly reduce motion dependency of the network. As the learned motion encoder can deal with both RGB images and optical flow maps, two different predictions can be generated depending on which source information is used as motion input. In order to fully exploit this property, we also propose an adaptive output selection algorithm to adopt optimal prediction result at test time. Our proposed approach affords state-of-the-art performance on all public benchmark datasets, even maintaining real-time inference speed.

- **Summary**: Understanding which traffic light controls which lane is crucial to navigate intersections safely. Autonomous vehicles commonly rely on High Definition (HD) maps that contain information about the assignment of traffic lights to lanes. The manual provisioning of this information is tedious, expensive, and not scalable. To remedy these issues, our novel approach derives the assignments from traffic light states and the corresponding motion patterns of vehicle traffic. This works in an automated way and independently of the geometric arrangement. We show the effectiveness of basic statistical approaches for this task by implementing and evaluating a pattern-based contribution method. In addition, our novel rejection method includes accompanying safety considerations by leveraging statistical hypothesis testing. Finally, we propose a dataset transformation to re-purpose available motion prediction datasets for semantic map learning. Our publicly available API for the Lyft Level 5 dataset enables researchers to develop and evaluate their own approaches.

- **Summary**: Generating geometric 3D reconstructions from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) is of great interest. However, accurate and complete reconstructions based on the density values are challenging. The network output depends on input data, NeRF network configuration and hyperparameter. As a result, the direct usage of density values, e.g. via filtering with global density thresholds, usually requires empirical investigations. Under the assumption that the density increases from non-object to object area, the utilization of density gradients from relative values is evident. As the density represents a position-dependent parameter it can be handled anisotropically, therefore processing of the voxelized 3D density field is justified. In this regard, we address geometric 3D reconstructions based on density gradients, whereas the gradients result from 3D edge detection filters of the first and second derivatives, namely Sobel, Canny and Laplacian of Gaussian. The gradients rely on relative neighboring density values in all directions, thus are independent from absolute magnitudes. Consequently, gradient filters are able to extract edges along a wide density range, almost independent from assumptions and empirical investigations. Our approach demonstrates the capability to achieve geometric 3D reconstructions with high geometric accuracy on object surfaces and remarkable object completeness. Notably, Canny filter effectively eliminates gaps, delivers a uniform point density, and strikes a favorable balance between correctness and completeness across the scenes.

- **Summary**: Finger vein pattern recognition is an emerging biometric with a good resistance to presentation attacks and low error rates. One problem is that it is hard to obtain ground truth finger vein patterns from live fingers. In this paper we propose an advanced method to create finger vein phantoms using 3D printing where we mimic the optical properties of the various tissues inside the fingers, like bone, veins and soft tissues using different printing materials and parameters. We demonstrate that we are able to create finger phantoms that result in realistic finger vein images and precisely known vein patterns. These phantoms can be used to develop and evaluate finger vein extraction and recognition methods. In addition, we show that the finger vein phantoms can be used to spoof a finger vein recognition system. This paper is based on the Master's thesis of Rasmus van der Grift.

- **Summary**: ENIGMA-51 is a new egocentric dataset acquired in a real industrial domain by 19 subjects who followed instructions to complete the repair of electrical boards using industrial tools (e.g., electric screwdriver) and electronic instruments (e.g., oscilloscope). The 51 sequences are densely annotated with a rich set of labels that enable the systematic study of human-object interactions in the industrial domain. We provide benchmarks on four tasks related to human-object interactions: 1) untrimmed action detection, 2) egocentric human-object interaction detection, 3) short-term object interaction anticipation and 4) natural language understanding of intents and entities. Baseline results show that the ENIGMA-51 dataset poses a challenging benchmark to study human-object interactions in industrial scenarios. We publicly release the dataset at: https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/ENIGMA-51/.

- **Summary**: The difference between the chronological and biological brain age of a subject can be an important biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, thus brain age estimation can be crucial in clinical settings. One way to incorporate multimodal information into this estimation is through population graphs, which combine various types of imaging data and capture the associations among individuals within a population. In medical imaging, population graphs have demonstrated promising results, mostly for classification tasks. In most cases, the graph structure is pre-defined and remains static during training. However, extracting population graphs is a non-trivial task and can significantly impact the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are sensitive to the graph structure. In this work, we highlight the importance of a meaningful graph construction and experiment with different population-graph construction methods and their effect on GNN performance on brain age estimation. We use the homophily metric and graph visualizations to gain valuable quantitative and qualitative insights on the extracted graph structures. For the experimental evaluation, we leverage the UK Biobank dataset, which offers many imaging and non-imaging phenotypes. Our results indicate that architectures highly sensitive to the graph structure, such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT), struggle with low homophily graphs, while other architectures, such as GraphSage and Chebyshev, are more robust across different homophily ratios. We conclude that static graph construction approaches are potentially insufficient for the task of brain age estimation and make recommendations for alternative research directions.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been proven beneficial for mitigating the issue of limited labeled data especially on the task of volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike previous SSL methods which focus on exploring highly confident pseudo-labels or developing consistency regularization schemes, our empirical findings suggest that inconsistent decoder features emerge naturally when two decoders strive to generate consistent predictions. Based on the observation, we first analyze the treasure of discrepancy in learning towards consistency, under both pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization settings, and subsequently propose a novel SSL method called LeFeD, which learns the feature-level discrepancy obtained from two decoders, by feeding the discrepancy as a feedback signal to the encoder. The core design of LeFeD is to enlarge the difference by training differentiated decoders, and then learn from the inconsistent information iteratively. We evaluate LeFeD against eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three public datasets. Experiments show LeFeD surpasses competitors without any bells and whistles such as uncertainty estimation and strong constraints, as well as setting a new state-of-the-art for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional tracking of multiple objects from multiple views has a wide range of applications, especially in the study of bio-cluster behavior which requires precise trajectories of research objects. However, there are significant temporal-spatial association uncertainties when the objects are similar to each other, frequently maneuver, and cluster in large numbers. Aiming at such a multi-view multi-object 3D tracking scenario, a current statistical model based Kalman particle filter (CSKPF) method is proposed following the Bayesian tracking-while-reconstruction framework. The CSKPF algorithm predicts the objects' states and estimates the objects' state covariance by the current statistical model to importance particle sampling efficiency, and suppresses the measurement noise by the Kalman filter. The simulation experiments prove that the CSKPF method can improve the tracking integrity, continuity, and precision compared with the existing constant velocity based particle filter (CVPF) method. The real experiment on fruitfly clusters also confirms the effectiveness of the CSKPF method.

- **Summary**: Active stereo technique using single pattern projection, a.k.a. one-shot 3D scan, have drawn a wide attention from industry, medical purposes, etc. One severe drawback of one-shot 3D scan is sparse reconstruction. In addition, since spatial pattern becomes complicated for the purpose of efficient embedding, it is easily affected by noise, which results in unstable decoding. To solve the problems, we propose a pixel-wise interpolation technique for one-shot scan, which is applicable to any types of static pattern if the pattern is regular and periodic. This is achieved by U-net which is pre-trained by CG with efficient data augmentation algorithm. In the paper, to further overcome the decoding instability, we propose a robust correspondence finding algorithm based on Markov random field (MRF) optimization. We also propose a shape refinement algorithm based on b-spline and Gaussian kernel interpolation using explicitly detected laser curves. Experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method using real data with strong noises and textures.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generative models have garnered immense attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity images from text prompts. Among these, Stable Diffusion distinguishes itself as a leading open-source model in this fast-growing field. However, the intricacies of fine-tuning these models pose multiple challenges from new methodology integration to systematic evaluation. Addressing these issues, this paper introduces LyCORIS (Lora beYond Conventional methods, Other Rank adaptation Implementations for Stable diffusion) [https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS], an open-source library that offers a wide selection of fine-tuning methodologies for Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we present a thorough framework for the systematic assessment of varied fine-tuning techniques. This framework employs a diverse suite of metrics and delves into multiple facets of fine-tuning, including hyperparameter adjustments and the evaluation with different prompt types across various concept categories. Through this comprehensive approach, our work provides essential insights into the nuanced effects of fine-tuning parameters, bridging the gap between state-of-the-art research and practical application.

- **Summary**: Current unsupervised 2D-3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods do not work in multi-person scenarios due to perspective ambiguity in monocular images. Therefore, we present one of the first studies investigating the feasibility of unsupervised multi-person 2D-3D HPE from just 2D poses alone, focusing on reconstructing human interactions. To address the issue of perspective ambiguity, we expand upon prior work by predicting the cameras' elevation angle relative to the subjects' pelvis. This allows us to rotate the predicted poses to be level with the ground plane, while obtaining an estimate for the vertical offset in 3D between individuals. Our method involves independently lifting each subject's 2D pose to 3D, before combining them in a shared 3D coordinate system. The poses are then rotated and offset by the predicted elevation angle before being scaled. This by itself enables us to retrieve an accurate 3D reconstruction of their poses. We present our results on the CHI3D dataset, introducing its use for unsupervised 2D-3D pose estimation with three new quantitative metrics, and establishing a benchmark for future research.

- **Summary**: Although many effective models and real-world datasets have been presented for blind image quality assessment (BIQA), recent BIQA models usually tend to fit specific training set. Hence, it is still difficult to accurately and robustly measure the visual quality of an arbitrary real-world image. In this paper, a robust BIQA method, is designed based on three aspects, i.e., robust training strategy, large-scale real-world dataset, and powerful backbone. First, many individual models based on popular and state-of-the-art (SOTA) Swin-Transformer (SwinT) are trained on different real-world BIQA datasets respectively. Then, these biased SwinT-based models are jointly used to generate pseudo-labels, which adopts the probability of relative quality of two random images instead of fixed quality score. A large-scale real-world image dataset with 1,000,000 image pairs and pseudo-labels is then proposed for training the final cross-dataset-robust model. Experimental results on cross-dataset tests show that the performance of the proposed method is even better than some SOTA methods that are directly trained on these datasets, thus verifying the robustness and generalization of our method.

- **Summary**: Texture editing is a crucial task in 3D modeling that allows users to automatically manipulate the surface materials of 3D models. However, the inherent complexity of 3D models and the ambiguous text description lead to the challenge in this task. To address this challenge, we propose ITEM3D, an illumination-aware model for automatic 3D object editing according to the text prompts. Leveraging the diffusion models and the differentiable rendering, ITEM3D takes the rendered images as the bridge of text and 3D representation, and further optimizes the disentangled texture and environment map. Previous methods adopt the absolute editing direction namely score distillation sampling (SDS) as the optimization objective, which unfortunately results in the noisy appearance and text inconsistency. To solve the problem caused by the ambiguous text, we introduce a relative editing direction, an optimization objective defined by the noise difference between the source and target texts, to release the semantic ambiguity between the texts and images. Additionally, we gradually adjust the direction during optimization to further address the unexpected deviation in the texture domain. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our ITEM3D outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various 3D objects. We also perform text-guided relighting to show explicit control over lighting.

- **Summary**: We present a locality-aware method for interpreting the latent space of wavelet-based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), that can well capture the large spatial and spectral variability that is characteristic to satellite imagery. By focusing on preserving locality, the proposed method is able to decompose the weight-space of pre-trained GANs and recover interpretable directions that correspond to high-level semantic concepts (such as urbanization, structure density, flora presence) - that can subsequently be used for guided synthesis of satellite imagery. In contrast to typically used approaches that focus on capturing the variability of the weight-space in a reduced dimensionality space (i.e., based on Principal Component Analysis, PCA), we show that preserving locality leads to vectors with different angles, that are more robust to artifacts and can better preserve class information. Via a set of quantitative and qualitative examples, we further show that the proposed approach can outperform both baseline geometric augmentations, as well as global, PCA-based approaches for data synthesis in the context of data augmentation for satellite scene classification.

- **Summary**: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are crucial for machine learning models deployed in open-world environments. Classifier-based scores are a standard approach for OOD detection due to their fine-grained detection capability. However, these scores often suffer from overconfidence issues, misclassifying OOD samples distant from the in-distribution region. To address this challenge, we propose a method called Nearest Neighbor Guidance (NNGuide) that guides the classifier-based score to respect the boundary geometry of the data manifold. NNGuide reduces the overconfidence of OOD samples while preserving the fine-grained capability of the classifier-based score. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet OOD detection benchmarks under diverse settings, including a scenario where the ID data undergoes natural distribution shift. Our results demonstrate that NNGuide provides a significant performance improvement on the base detection scores, achieving state-of-the-art results on both AUROC, FPR95, and AUPR metrics.

- **Summary**: Visual effects commonly requires both the creation of realistic synthetic humans as well as retargeting actors' performances to humanoid characters such as aliens and monsters. Achieving the expressive performances demanded in entertainment requires manipulating complex models with hundreds of parameters. Full creative control requires the freedom to make edits at any stage of the production, which prohibits the use of a fully automatic ``black box'' solution with uninterpretable parameters. On the other hand, producing realistic animation with these sophisticated models is difficult and laborious. This paper describes FDLS (Facial Deep Learning Solver), which is Weta Digital's solution to these challenges. FDLS adopts a coarse-to-fine and human-in-the-loop strategy, allowing a solved performance to be verified and edited at several stages in the solving process. To train FDLS, we first transform the raw motion-captured data into robust graph features. Secondly, based on the observation that the artists typically finalize the jaw pass animation before proceeding to finer detail, we solve for the jaw motion first and predict fine expressions with region-based networks conditioned on the jaw position. Finally, artists can optionally invoke a non-linear finetuning process on top of the FDLS solution to follow the motion-captured virtual markers as closely as possible. FDLS supports editing if needed to improve the results of the deep learning solution and it can handle small daily changes in the actor's face shape. FDLS permits reliable and production-quality performance solving with minimal training and little or no manual effort in many cases, while also allowing the solve to be guided and edited in unusual and difficult cases. The system has been under development for several years and has been used in major movies.

- **Summary**: Deep Image Manipulation Localization (IML) models suffer from training data insufficiency and thus heavily rely on pre-training. We argue that contrastive learning is more suitable to tackle the data insufficiency problem for IML. Crafting mutually exclusive positives and negatives is the prerequisite for contrastive learning. However, when adopting contrastive learning in IML, we encounter three categories of image patches: tampered, authentic, and contour patches. Tampered and authentic patches are naturally mutually exclusive, but contour patches containing both tampered and authentic pixels are non-mutually exclusive to them. Simply abnegating these contour patches results in a drastic performance loss since contour patches are decisive to the learning outcomes. Hence, we propose the Non-mutually exclusive Contrastive Learning (NCL) framework to rescue conventional contrastive learning from the above dilemma. In NCL, to cope with the non-mutually exclusivity, we first establish a pivot structure with dual branches to constantly switch the role of contour patches between positives and negatives while training. Then, we devise a pivot-consistent loss to avoid spatial corruption caused by the role-switching process. In this manner, NCL both inherits the self-supervised merits to address the data insufficiency and retains a high manipulation localization accuracy. Extensive experiments verify that our NCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on all five benchmarks without any pre-training and is more robust on unseen real-life samples.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an innovative approach to achieve face cartoonisation while preserving the original identity and accommodating various poses. Unlike previous methods in this field that relied on conditional-GANs, which posed challenges related to dataset requirements and pose training, our approach leverages the expressive latent space of StyleGAN. We achieve this by introducing an encoder that captures both pose and identity information from images and generates a corresponding embedding within the StyleGAN latent space. By subsequently passing this embedding through a pre-trained generator, we obtain the desired cartoonised output. While many other approaches based on StyleGAN necessitate a dedicated and fine-tuned StyleGAN model, our method stands out by utilizing an already-trained StyleGAN designed to produce realistic facial images. We show by extensive experimentation how our encoder adapts the StyleGAN output to better preserve identity when the objective is cartoonisation.

- **Summary**: We propose PHRIT, a novel approach for parametric hand mesh modeling with an implicit template that combines the advantages of both parametric meshes and implicit representations. Our method represents deformable hand shapes using signed distance fields (SDFs) with part-based shape priors, utilizing a deformation field to execute the deformation. The model offers efficient high-fidelity hand reconstruction by deforming the canonical template at infinite resolution. Additionally, it is fully differentiable and can be easily used in hand modeling since it can be driven by the skeleton and shape latent codes. We evaluate PHRIT on multiple downstream tasks, including skeleton-driven hand reconstruction, shapes from point clouds, and single-view 3D reconstruction, demonstrating that our approach achieves realistic and immersive hand modeling with state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved very impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target samples, which greatly degrades their scalability while handling various visual recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that allows learning superior target models with few-shot unlabelled target samples. NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted pseudo-labels of the few-shot unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to their prediction confidence. The second is pseudo-label rectification, which corrects both pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across multiple widely adopted benchmarks.

- **Summary**: With the advent of advanced multi-sensor fusion models, there has been a notable enhancement in the performance of perception tasks within in terms of autonomous driving. Despite these advancements, the challenges persist, particularly in the fusion of data from cameras and LiDAR sensors. A critial concern is the accurate alignment of data from these disparate sensors. Our observations indicate that the projected positions of LiDAR points often misalign on the corresponding image. Furthermore, fusion models appear to struggle in accurately segmenting these misaligned points. In this paper, we would like to address this problem carefully, with a specific focus on the nuScenes dataset and the SOTA of fusion models 2DPASS, and providing the possible solutions or potential improvements.

- **Summary**: Text-conditional image editing is a very useful task that has recently emerged with immeasurable potential. Most current real image editing methods first need to complete the reconstruction of the image, and then editing is carried out by various methods based on the reconstruction. Most methods use DDIM Inversion for reconstruction, however, DDIM Inversion often fails to guarantee reconstruction performance, i.e., it fails to produce results that preserve the original image content. To address the problem of reconstruction failure, we propose FEC, which consists of three sampling methods, each designed for different editing types and settings. Our three methods of FEC achieve two important goals in image editing task: 1) ensuring successful reconstruction, i.e., sampling to get a generated result that preserves the texture and features of the original real image. 2) these sampling methods can be paired with many editing methods and greatly improve the performance of these editing methods to accomplish various editing tasks. In addition, none of our sampling methods require fine-tuning of the diffusion model or time-consuming training on large-scale datasets. Hence the cost of time as well as the use of computer memory and computation can be significantly reduced.

- **Summary**: Test-Time Adaptation aims to adapt source domain model to testing data at inference stage with success demonstrated in adapting to unseen corruptions. However, these attempts may fail under more challenging real-world scenarios. Existing works mainly consider real-world test-time adaptation under non-i.i.d. data stream and continual domain shift. In this work, we first complement the existing real-world TTA protocol with a globally class imbalanced testing set. We demonstrate that combining all settings together poses new challenges to existing methods. We argue the failure of state-of-the-art methods is first caused by indiscriminately adapting normalization layers to imbalanced testing data. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose a balanced batchnorm layer to swap out the regular batchnorm at inference stage. The new batchnorm layer is capable of adapting without biasing towards majority classes. We are further inspired by the success of self-training~(ST) in learning from unlabeled data and adapt ST for test-time adaptation. However, ST alone is prone to over adaption which is responsible for the poor performance under continual domain shift. Hence, we propose to improve self-training under continual domain shift by regularizing model updates with an anchored loss. The final TTA model, termed as TRIBE, is built upon a tri-net architecture with balanced batchnorm layers. We evaluate TRIBE on four datasets representing real-world TTA settings. TRIBE consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation protocols. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/TRIBE}.

- **Summary**: Adapting visual object detectors to operational target domains is a challenging task, commonly achieved using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. When the labeled dataset is coming from multiple source domains, treating them as separate domains and performing a multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) improves the accuracy and robustness over mixing these source domains and performing a UDA, as observed by recent studies in MSDA. Existing MSDA methods learn domain invariant and domain-specific parameters (for each source domain) for the adaptation. However, unlike single-source UDA methods, learning domain-specific parameters makes them grow significantly proportional to the number of source domains used. This paper proposes a novel MSDA method called Prototype-based Mean-Teacher (PMT), which uses class prototypes instead of domain-specific subnets to preserve domain-specific information. These prototypes are learned using a contrastive loss, aligning the same categories across domains and separating different categories far apart. Because of the use of prototypes, the parameter size of our method does not increase significantly with the number of source domains, thus reducing memory issues and possible overfitting. Empirical studies show PMT outperforms state-of-the-art MSDA methods on several challenging object detection datasets.

- **Summary**: All tables can be represented as grids. Based on this observation, we propose GridFormer, a novel approach for interpreting unconstrained table structures by predicting the vertex and edge of a grid. First, we propose a flexible table representation in the form of an MXN grid. In this representation, the vertexes and edges of the grid store the localization and adjacency information of the table. Then, we introduce a DETR-style table structure recognizer to efficiently predict this multi-objective information of the grid in a single shot. Specifically, given a set of learned row and column queries, the recognizer directly outputs the vertexes and edges information of the corresponding rows and columns. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks which include wired, wireless, multi-merge-cell, oriented, and distorted tables demonstrate the competitive performance of our model over other methods.

- **Summary**: In preparation for observing holographic 3D content, acquiring a set of RGB color and depth map images per scene is necessary to generate computer-generated holograms (CGHs) when using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. However, in real-world situations, these paired formats of RGB color and depth map images are not always fully available. We propose a deep learning-based method to synthesize the volumetric digital holograms using only the given RGB image, so that we can overcome environments where RGB color and depth map images are partially provided. The proposed method uses only the input of RGB image to estimate its depth map and then generate its CGH sequentially. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the volumetric hologram generated through our proposed model is more accurate than that of competitive models, under the situation that only RGB color data can be provided.

- **Summary**: Programs offer compactness and structure that makes them an attractive representation for visual data. We explore how code rewriting can be used to improve systems for inferring programs from visual data. We first propose Sparse Intermittent Rewrite Injection (SIRI), a framework for unsupervised bootstrapped learning. SIRI sparsely applies code rewrite operations over a dataset of training programs, injecting the improved programs back into the training set. We design a family of rewriters for visual programming domains: parameter optimization, code pruning, and code grafting. For three shape programming languages in 2D and 3D, we show that using SIRI with our family of rewriters improves performance: better reconstructions and faster convergence rates, compared with bootstrapped learning methods that do not use rewriters or use them naively. Finally, we demonstrate that our family of rewriters can be effectively used at test time to improve the output of SIRI predictions. For 2D and 3D CSG, we outperform or match the reconstruction performance of recent domain-specific neural architectures, while producing more parsimonious programs that use significantly fewer primitives.

- **Summary**: We propose an extremely simple and highly effective approach to faithfully combine different object detectors to obtain a Mixture of Experts (MoE) that has a superior accuracy to the individual experts in the mixture. We find that naively combining these experts in a similar way to the well-known Deep Ensembles (DEs), does not result in an effective MoE. We identify the incompatibility between the confidence score distribution of different detectors to be the primary reason for such failure cases. Therefore, to construct the MoE, our proposal is to first calibrate each individual detector against a target calibration function. Then, filter and refine all the predictions from different detectors in the mixture. We term this approach as MoCaE and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on object detection, instance segmentation and rotated object detection tasks. Specifically, MoCaE improves (i) three strong object detectors on COCO test-dev by $2.4$ $\mathrm{AP}$ by reaching $59.0$ $\mathrm{AP}$; (ii) instance segmentation methods on the challenging long-tailed LVIS dataset by $2.3$ $\mathrm{AP}$; and (iii) all existing rotated object detectors by reaching $82.62$ $\mathrm{AP_{50}}$ on DOTA dataset, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Code will be made public.

- **Summary**: Since photorealistic faces can be readily generated by facial manipulation technologies nowadays, potential malicious abuse of these technologies has drawn great concerns. Numerous deepfake detection methods are thus proposed. However, existing methods only focus on detecting one-step facial manipulation. As the emergence of easy-accessible facial editing applications, people can easily manipulate facial components using multi-step operations in a sequential manner. This new threat requires us to detect a sequence of facial manipulations, which is vital for both detecting deepfake media and recovering original faces afterwards. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need and propose a novel research problem called Detecting Sequential DeepFake Manipulation (Seq-DeepFake). Unlike the existing deepfake detection task only demanding a binary label prediction, detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation requires correctly predicting a sequential vector of facial manipulation operations. To support a large-scale investigation, we construct the first Seq-DeepFake dataset, where face images are manipulated sequentially with corresponding annotations of sequential facial manipulation vectors. Based on this new dataset, we cast detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation as a specific image-to-sequence task and propose a concise yet effective Seq-DeepFake Transformer (SeqFakeFormer). To better reflect real-world deepfake data distributions, we further apply various perturbations on the original Seq-DeepFake dataset and construct the more challenging Sequential DeepFake dataset with perturbations (Seq-DeepFake-P). To exploit deeper correlation between images and sequences when facing Seq-DeepFake-P, a dedicated Seq-DeepFake Transformer with Image-Sequence Reasoning (SeqFakeFormer++) is devised, which builds stronger correspondence between image-sequence pairs for more robust Seq-DeepFake detection.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is used to generate fusion images with comprehensive features of both images, which is beneficial for downstream vision tasks. However, current methods rarely consider the illumination condition in low-light environments, and the targets in the fused images are often not prominent. To address the above issues, we propose an Illumination-Aware Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Network, named as IAIFNet. In our framework, an illumination enhancement network first estimates the incident illumination maps of input images. Afterwards, with the help of proposed adaptive differential fusion module (ADFM) and salient target aware module (STAM), an image fusion network effectively integrates the salient features of the illumination-enhanced infrared and visible images into a fusion image of high visual quality. Extensive experimental results verify that our method outperforms five state-of-the-art methods of fusing infrared and visible images.

- **Summary**: Image acquisition conditions and environments can significantly affect high-level tasks in computer vision, and the performance of most computer vision algorithms will be limited when trained on distortion-free datasets. Even with updates in hardware such as sensors and deep learning methods, it will still not work in the face of variable conditions in real-world applications. In this paper, we apply the object detector YOLOv7 to detect distorted images from the dataset CDCOCO. Through carefully designed optimizations including data enhancement, detection box ensemble, denoiser ensemble, super-resolution models, and transfer learning, our model achieves excellent performance on the CDCOCO test set. Our denoising detection model can denoise and repair distorted images, making the model useful in a variety of real-world scenarios and environments.

- **Summary**: The task of open-vocabulary object-centric image retrieval involves the retrieval of images containing a specified object of interest, delineated by an open-set text query. As working on large image datasets becomes standard, solving this task efficiently has gained significant practical importance. Applications include targeted performance analysis of retrieved images using ad-hoc queries and hard example mining during training. Recent advancements in contrastive-based open vocabulary systems have yielded remarkable breakthroughs, facilitating large-scale open vocabulary image retrieval. However, these approaches use a single global embedding per image, thereby constraining the system's ability to retrieve images containing relatively small object instances. Alternatively, incorporating local embeddings from detection pipelines faces scalability challenges, making it unsuitable for retrieval from large databases.   In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach to object-centric open-vocabulary image retrieval. Our approach aggregates dense embeddings extracted from CLIP into a compact representation, essentially combining the scalability of image retrieval pipelines with the object identification capabilities of dense detection methods. We show the effectiveness of our scheme to the task by achieving significantly better results than global feature approaches on three datasets, increasing accuracy by up to 15 mAP points. We further integrate our scheme into a large scale retrieval framework and demonstrate our method's advantages in terms of scalability and interpretability.

- **Summary**: While significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have catalyzed progress across various domains, its full potential in understanding visual perception remains underexplored. We propose an artificial neural network dubbed VISION, an acronym for "Visual Interface System for Imaging Output of Neural activity," to mimic the human brain and show how it can foster neuroscientific inquiries. Using visual and contextual inputs, this multimodal model predicts the brain's functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan response to natural images. VISION successfully predicts human hemodynamic responses as fMRI voxel values to visual inputs with an accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art performance by 45%. We further probe the trained networks to reveal representational biases in different visual areas, generate experimentally testable hypotheses, and formulate an interpretable metric to associate these hypotheses with cortical functions. With both a model and evaluation metric, the cost and time burdens associated with designing and implementing functional analysis on the visual cortex could be reduced. Our work suggests that the evolution of computational models may shed light on our fundamental understanding of the visual cortex and provide a viable approach toward reliable brain-machine interfaces.

- **Summary**: Multi-frame high dynamic range (HDR) imaging aims to reconstruct ghost-free images with photo-realistic details from content-complementary but spatially misaligned low dynamic range (LDR) images. Existing HDR algorithms are prone to producing ghosting artifacts as their methods fail to capture long-range dependencies between LDR frames with large motion in dynamic scenes. To address this issue, we propose a novel image fusion transformer, referred to as IFT, which presents a fast global patch searching (FGPS) module followed by a self-cross fusion module (SCF) for ghost-free HDR imaging. The FGPS searches the patches from supporting frames that have the closest dependency to each patch of the reference frame for long-range dependency modeling, while the SCF conducts intra-frame and inter-frame feature fusion on the patches obtained by the FGPS with linear complexity to input resolution. By matching similar patches between frames, objects with large motion ranges in dynamic scenes can be aligned, which can effectively alleviate the generation of artifacts. In addition, the proposed FGPS and SCF can be integrated into various deep HDR methods as efficient plug-in modules. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Variation in nuclear size and shape is an important criterion of malignancy for many tumor types; however, categorical estimates by pathologists have poor reproducibility. Measurements of nuclear characteristics (morphometry) can improve reproducibility, but manual methods are time consuming. In this study, we evaluated fully automated morphometry using a deep learning-based algorithm in 96 canine cutaneous mast cell tumors with information on patient survival. Algorithmic morphometry was compared with karyomegaly estimates by 11 pathologists, manual nuclear morphometry of 12 cells by 9 pathologists, and the mitotic count as a benchmark. The prognostic value of automated morphometry was high with an area under the ROC curve regarding the tumor-specific survival of 0.943 (95% CI: 0.889 - 0.996) for the standard deviation (SD) of nuclear area, which was higher than manual morphometry of all pathologists combined (0.868, 95% CI: 0.737 - 0.991) and the mitotic count (0.885, 95% CI: 0.765 - 1.00). At the proposed thresholds, the hazard ratio for algorithmic morphometry (SD of nuclear area $\geq 9.0 \mu m^2$) was 18.3 (95% CI: 5.0 - 67.1), for manual morphometry (SD of nuclear area $\geq 10.9 \mu m^2$) 9.0 (95% CI: 6.0 - 13.4), for karyomegaly estimates 7.6 (95% CI: 5.7 - 10.1), and for the mitotic count 30.5 (95% CI: 7.8 - 118.0). Inter-rater reproducibility for karyomegaly estimates was fair ($\kappa$ = 0.226) with highly variable sensitivity/specificity values for the individual pathologists. Reproducibility for manual morphometry (SD of nuclear area) was good (ICC = 0.654). This study supports the use of algorithmic morphometry as a prognostic test to overcome the limitations of estimates and manual measurements.

- **Summary**: Online continual learning (OCL) aims to continuously learn new data from a single pass over the online data stream. It generally suffers from the catastrophic forgetting issue. Existing replay-based methods effectively alleviate this issue by replaying part of old data in a proxy-based or contrastive-based replay manner. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of these two replay manners and find they can be complementary. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel replay-based method called proxy-based contrastive replay (PCR), which replaces anchor-to-sample pairs with anchor-to-proxy pairs in the contrastive-based loss to alleviate the phenomenon of forgetting. Based on PCR, we further develop a more advanced method named holistic proxy-based contrastive replay (HPCR), which consists of three components. The contrastive component conditionally incorporates anchor-to-sample pairs to PCR, learning more fine-grained semantic information with a large training batch. The second is a temperature component that decouples the temperature coefficient into two parts based on their impacts on the gradient and sets different values for them to learn more novel knowledge. The third is a distillation component that constrains the learning process to keep more historical knowledge. Experiments on four datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of HPCR over various state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Class incremental learning (CIL) is a challenging setting of continual learning, which learns a series of tasks sequentially. Each task consists of a set of unique classes. The key feature of CIL is that no task identifier (or task-id) is provided at test time for each test sample. Predicting the task-id for each test sample is a challenging problem. An emerging theoretically justified and effective approach is to train a task-specific model for each task in a shared network for all tasks based on a task-incremental learning (TIL) method to deal with forgetting. The model for each task in this approach is an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector rather than a conventional classifier. The OOD detector can perform both within-task (in-distribution (IND)) class prediction and OOD detection. The OOD detection capability is the key for task-id prediction during inference for each test sample. However, this paper argues that using a traditional OOD detector for task-id prediction is sub-optimal because additional information (e.g., the replay data and the learned tasks) available in CIL can be exploited to design a better and principled method for task-id prediction. We call the new method TPLR (Task-id Prediction based on Likelihood Ratio}). TPLR markedly outperforms strong CIL baselines.

- **Summary**: Versatile and adaptive semantic understanding would enable autonomous systems to comprehend and interact with their surroundings. Existing fixed-class models limit the adaptability of indoor mobile and assistive autonomous systems. In this work, we introduce LEXIS, a real-time indoor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system that harnesses the open-vocabulary nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a unified approach to scene understanding and place recognition. The approach first builds a topological SLAM graph of the environment (using visual-inertial odometry) and embeds Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) features in the graph nodes. We use this representation for flexible room classification and segmentation, serving as a basis for room-centric place recognition. This allows loop closure searches to be directed towards semantically relevant places. Our proposed system is evaluated using both public, simulated data and real-world data, covering office and home environments. It successfully categorizes rooms with varying layouts and dimensions and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA). For place recognition and trajectory estimation tasks we achieve equivalent performance to the SOTA, all also utilizing the same pre-trained model. Lastly, we demonstrate the system's potential for planning.

- **Summary**: Recently, the RGB images and point clouds fusion methods have been proposed to jointly estimate 2D optical flow and 3D scene flow. However, as both conventional RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors adopt a frame-based data acquisition mechanism, their performance is limited by the fixed low sampling rates, especially in highly-dynamic scenes. By contrast, the event camera can asynchronously capture the intensity changes with a very high temporal resolution, providing complementary dynamic information of the observed scenes. In this paper, we incorporate RGB images, Point clouds and Events for joint optical flow and scene flow estimation with our proposed multi-stage multimodal fusion model, RPEFlow. First, we present an attention fusion module with a cross-attention mechanism to implicitly explore the internal cross-modal correlation for 2D and 3D branches, respectively. Second, we introduce a mutual information regularization term to explicitly model the complementary information of three modalities for effective multimodal feature learning. We also contribute a new synthetic dataset to advocate further research. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art by a wide margin. Code and dataset is available at https://npucvr.github.io/RPEFlow.

- **Summary**: A rapidly growing number of voices have argued that AI research, and computer vision in particular, is closely tied to mass surveillance. Yet the direct path from computer vision research to surveillance has remained obscured and difficult to assess. This study reveals the Surveillance AI pipeline. We obtain three decades of computer vision research papers and downstream patents (more than 20,000 documents) and present a rich qualitative and quantitative analysis. This analysis exposes the nature and extent of the Surveillance AI pipeline, its institutional roots and evolution, and ongoing patterns of obfuscation. We first perform an in-depth content analysis of computer vision papers and downstream patents, identifying and quantifying key features and the many, often subtly expressed, forms of surveillance that appear. On the basis of this analysis, we present a topology of Surveillance AI that characterizes the prevalent targeting of human data, practices of data transferal, and institutional data use. We find stark evidence of close ties between computer vision and surveillance. The majority (68%) of annotated computer vision papers and patents self-report their technology enables data extraction about human bodies and body parts and even more (90%) enable data extraction about humans in general.

- **Summary**: Retrieving adverbs that describe an action in a video poses a crucial step towards fine-grained video understanding. We propose a framework for video-to-adverb retrieval (and vice versa) that aligns video embeddings with their matching compositional adverb-action text embedding in a joint embedding space. The compositional adverb-action text embedding is learned using a residual gating mechanism, along with a novel training objective consisting of triplet losses and a regression target. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five recent benchmarks for video-adverb retrieval. Furthermore, we introduce dataset splits to benchmark video-adverb retrieval for unseen adverb-action compositions on subsets of the MSR-VTT Adverbs and ActivityNet Adverbs datasets. Our proposed framework outperforms all prior works for the generalisation task of retrieving adverbs from videos for unseen adverb-action compositions. Code and dataset splits are available at https://hummelth.github.io/ReGaDa/.

- **Summary**: Although recent text-to-video (T2V) generation methods have seen significant advancements, most of these works focus on producing short video clips of a single event with a single background (i.e., single-scene videos). Meanwhile, recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capability in generating layouts and programs to control downstream visual modules such as image generation models. This raises an important question: can we leverage the knowledge embedded in these LLMs for temporally consistent long video generation? In this paper, we propose VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for consistent multi-scene video generation that uses the knowledge of LLMs for video content planning and grounded video generation. Specifically, given a single text prompt, we first ask our video planner LLM (GPT-4) to expand it into a 'video plan', which involves generating the scene descriptions, the entities with their respective layouts, the background for each scene, and consistency groupings of the entities and backgrounds. Next, guided by this output from the video planner, our video generator, Layout2Vid, has explicit control over spatial layouts and can maintain temporal consistency of entities/backgrounds across scenes, while only trained with image-level annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that VideoDirectorGPT framework substantially improves layout and movement control in both single- and multi-scene video generation and can generate multi-scene videos with visual consistency across scenes, while achieving competitive performance with SOTAs in open-domain single-scene T2V generation. We also demonstrate that our framework can dynamically control the strength for layout guidance and can also generate videos with user-provided images. We hope our framework can inspire future work on better integrating the planning ability of LLMs into consistent long video generation.

- **Summary**: This work aims to learn a high-quality text-to-video (T2V) generative model by leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) model as a basis. It is a highly desirable yet challenging task to simultaneously a) accomplish the synthesis of visually realistic and temporally coherent videos while b) preserving the strong creative generation nature of the pre-trained T2I model. To this end, we propose LaVie, an integrated video generation framework that operates on cascaded video latent diffusion models, comprising a base T2V model, a temporal interpolation model, and a video super-resolution model. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) We reveal that the incorporation of simple temporal self-attentions, coupled with rotary positional encoding, adequately captures the temporal correlations inherent in video data. 2) Additionally, we validate that the process of joint image-video fine-tuning plays a pivotal role in producing high-quality and creative outcomes. To enhance the performance of LaVie, we contribute a comprehensive and diverse video dataset named Vimeo25M, consisting of 25 million text-video pairs that prioritize quality, diversity, and aesthetic appeal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaVie achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of pre-trained LaVie models in various long video generation and personalized video synthesis applications.

- **Summary**: 3D perception based on the representations learned from multi-camera bird's-eye-view (BEV) is trending as cameras are cost-effective for mass production in autonomous driving industry. However, there exists a distinct performance gap between multi-camera BEV and LiDAR based 3D object detection. One key reason is that LiDAR captures accurate depth and other geometry measurements, while it is notoriously challenging to infer such 3D information from merely image input. In this work, we propose to boost the representation learning of a multi-camera BEV based student detector by training it to imitate the features of a well-trained LiDAR based teacher detector. We propose effective balancing strategy to enforce the student to focus on learning the crucial features from the teacher, and generalize knowledge transfer to multi-scale layers with temporal fusion. We conduct extensive evaluations on multiple representative models of multi-camera BEV. Experiments reveal that our approach renders significant improvement over the student models, leading to the state-of-the-art performance on the popular benchmark nuScenes.

- **Summary**: Dense visual correspondence plays a vital role in robotic perception. This work focuses on establishing the dense correspondence between a pair of images that captures dynamic scenes undergoing substantial transformations. We introduce Doduo to learn general dense visual correspondence from in-the-wild images and videos without ground truth supervision. Given a pair of images, it estimates the dense flow field encoding the displacement of each pixel in one image to its corresponding pixel in the other image. Doduo uses flow-based warping to acquire supervisory signals for the training. Incorporating semantic priors with self-supervised flow training, Doduo produces accurate dense correspondence robust to the dynamic changes of the scenes. Trained on an in-the-wild video dataset, Doduo illustrates superior performance on point-level correspondence estimation over existing self-supervised correspondence learning baselines. We also apply Doduo to articulation estimation and zero-shot goal-conditioned manipulation, underlining its practical applications in robotics.

- **Summary**: An emerging line of work has sought to generate plausible imagery from touch. Existing approaches, however, tackle only narrow aspects of the visuo-tactile synthesis problem, and lag significantly behind the quality of cross-modal synthesis methods in other domains. We draw on recent advances in latent diffusion to create a model for synthesizing images from tactile signals (and vice versa) and apply it to a number of visuo-tactile synthesis tasks. Using this model, we significantly outperform prior work on the tactile-driven stylization problem, i.e., manipulating an image to match a touch signal, and we are the first to successfully generate images from touch without additional sources of information about the scene. We also successfully use our model to address two novel synthesis problems: generating images that do not contain the touch sensor or the hand holding it, and estimating an image's shading from its reflectance and touch.

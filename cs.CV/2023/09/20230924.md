- **Summary**: Vision-Language Pre-training has demonstrated its remarkable zero-shot recognition ability and potential to learn generalizable visual representations from language supervision. Taking a step ahead, language-supervised semantic segmentation enables spatial localization of textual inputs by learning pixel grouping solely from image-text pairs. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art suffers from clear semantic gaps between visual and textual modality: plenty of visual concepts appeared in images are missing in their paired captions. Such semantic misalignment circulates in pre-training, leading to inferior zero-shot performance in dense predictions due to insufficient visual concepts captured in textual representations. To close such semantic gap, we propose Concept Curation (CoCu), a pipeline that leverages CLIP to compensate for the missing semantics. For each image-text pair, we establish a concept archive that maintains potential visually-matched concepts with our proposed vision-driven expansion and text-to-vision-guided ranking. Relevant concepts can thus be identified via cluster-guided sampling and fed into pre-training, thereby bridging the gap between visual and textual semantics. Extensive experiments over a broad suite of 8 segmentation benchmarks show that CoCu achieves superb zero-shot transfer performance and greatly boosts language-supervised segmentation baseline by a large margin, suggesting the value of bridging semantic gap in pre-training data.

- **Summary**: In the field of object classification, identification based on object variations is a challenge in itself. Variations include shape, size, color, and texture, these can cause problems in recognizing and distinguishing objects accurately. The purpose of this research is to develop a classification method so that objects can be accurately identified. The proposed classification model uses Voting and Combined Classifier, with Random Forest, K-NN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Naive Bayes classification methods. The test results show that the voting method and Combined Classifier obtain quite good results with each of them, ensemble voting with an accuracy value of 92.4%, 78.6% precision, 95.2% recall, and 86.1% F1-score. While the combined classifier with an accuracy value of 99.3%, a precision of 97.6%, a recall of 100%, and a 98.8% F1-score. Based on the test results, it can be concluded that the use of the Combined Classifier and voting methods is proven to increase the accuracy value. The contribution of this research increases the effectiveness of the Ensemble Learning method, especially the voting ensemble method and the Combined Classifier in increasing the accuracy of object classification in image processing.

- **Summary**: Indoor monocular depth estimation has attracted increasing research interest. Most previous works have been focusing on methodology, primarily experimenting with NYU-Depth-V2 (NYUv2) Dataset, and only concentrated on the overall performance over the test set. However, little is known regarding robustness and generalization when it comes to applying monocular depth estimation methods to real-world scenarios where highly varying and diverse functional \textit{space types} are present such as library or kitchen. A study for performance breakdown into space types is essential to realize a pretrained model's performance variance. To facilitate our investigation for robustness and address limitations of previous works, we collect InSpaceType, a high-quality and high-resolution RGBD dataset for general indoor environments. We benchmark 11 recent methods on InSpaceType and find they severely suffer from performance imbalance concerning space types, which reveals their underlying bias. We extend our analysis to 4 other datasets, 3 mitigation approaches, and the ability to generalize to unseen space types. Our work marks the first in-depth investigation of performance imbalance across space types for indoor monocular depth estimation, drawing attention to potential safety concerns for model deployment without considering space types, and further shedding light on potential ways to improve robustness.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce LiDAR-UDA, a novel two-stage self-training-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) method for LiDAR segmentation. Existing self-training methods use a model trained on labeled source data to generate pseudo labels for target data and refine the predictions via fine-tuning the network on the pseudo labels. These methods suffer from domain shifts caused by different LiDAR sensor configurations in the source and target domains. We propose two techniques to reduce sensor discrepancy and improve pseudo label quality: 1) LiDAR beam subsampling, which simulates different LiDAR scanning patterns by randomly dropping beams; 2) cross-frame ensembling, which exploits temporal consistency of consecutive frames to generate more reliable pseudo labels. Our method is simple, generalizable, and does not incur any extra inference cost. We evaluate our method on several public LiDAR datasets and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by more than $3.9\%$ mIoU on average for all scenarios.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D clothed human avatars from single images is a challenging task, especially when encountering complex poses and loose clothing. Current methods exhibit limitations in performance, largely attributable to their dependence on insufficient 2D image features and inconsistent query methods. Owing to this, we present the Global-correlated 3D-decoupling Transformer for clothed Avatar reconstruction (GTA), a novel transformer-based architecture that reconstructs clothed human avatars from monocular images. Our approach leverages transformer architectures by utilizing a Vision Transformer model as an encoder for capturing global-correlated image features. Subsequently, our innovative 3D-decoupling decoder employs cross-attention to decouple tri-plane features, using learnable embeddings as queries for cross-plane generation. To effectively enhance feature fusion with the tri-plane 3D feature and human body prior, we propose a hybrid prior fusion strategy combining spatial and prior-enhanced queries, leveraging the benefits of spatial localization and human body prior knowledge. Comprehensive experiments on CAPE and THuman2.0 datasets illustrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both geometry and texture reconstruction, exhibiting high robustness to challenging poses and loose clothing, and producing higher-resolution textures.

- **Summary**: Existing domain adaptation (DA) and generalization (DG) methods in object detection enforce feature alignment in the visual space but face challenges like object appearance variability and scene complexity, which make it difficult to distinguish between objects and achieve accurate detection. In this paper, we are the first to address the problem of semi-supervised domain generalization by exploring vision-language pre-training and enforcing feature alignment through the language space. We employ a novel Cross-Domain Descriptive Multi-Scale Learning (CDDMSL) aiming to maximize the agreement between descriptions of an image presented with different domain-specific characteristics in the embedding space. CDDMSL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 11.7% and 7.5% improvement in DG and DA settings, respectively. Comprehensive analysis and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our method, positioning CDDMSL as a promising approach for domain generalization in object detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-constrained decentralized machine learning paradigm in which clients enable collaborative training without compromising private data. However, how to learn a robust global model in the data-heterogeneous and model-heterogeneous FL scenarios is challenging. To address it, we resort to data-free knowledge distillation to propose a new FL method (namely DFRD). DFRD equips a conditional generator on the server to approximate the training space of the local models uploaded by clients, and systematically investigates its training in terms of fidelity, transferability} and diversity. To overcome the catastrophic forgetting of the global model caused by the distribution shifts of the generator across communication rounds, we maintain an exponential moving average copy of the generator on the server. Additionally, we propose dynamic weighting and label sampling to accurately extract knowledge from local models. Finally, our extensive experiments on various image classification tasks illustrate that DFRD achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.

- **Summary**: We introduce the UT Campus Object Dataset (CODa), a mobile robot egocentric perception dataset collected on the University of Texas Austin Campus. Our dataset contains 8.5 hours of multimodal sensor data: synchronized 3D point clouds and stereo RGB video from a 128-channel 3D LiDAR and two 1.25MP RGB cameras at 10 fps; RGB-D videos from an additional 0.5MP sensor at 7 fps, and a 9-DOF IMU sensor at 40 Hz. We provide 58 minutes of ground-truth annotations containing 1.3 million 3D bounding boxes with instance IDs for 53 semantic classes, 5000 frames of 3D semantic annotations for urban terrain, and pseudo-ground truth localization. We repeatedly traverse identical geographic locations for a wide range of indoor and outdoor areas, weather conditions, and times of the day. Using CODa, we empirically demonstrate that: 1) 3D object detection performance in urban settings is significantly higher when trained using CODa compared to existing datasets even when employing state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches, 2) sensor-specific fine-tuning improves 3D object detection accuracy and 3) pretraining on CODa improves cross-dataset 3D object detection performance in urban settings compared to pretraining on AV datasets. Using our dataset and annotations, we release benchmarks for 3D object detection and 3D semantic segmentation using established metrics. In the future, the CODa benchmark will include additional tasks like unsupervised object discovery and re-identification. We publicly release CODa on the Texas Data Repository, pre-trained models, dataset development package, and interactive dataset viewer. We expect CODa to be a valuable dataset for research in egocentric 3D perception and planning for autonomous navigation in urban environments.

- **Summary**: In the field of chest X-ray (CXR) diagnosis, existing works often focus solely on determining where a radiologist looks, typically through tasks such as detection, segmentation, or classification. However, these approaches are often designed as black-box models, lacking interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified controllable interpretable pipeline for decoding the intense focus of radiologists in CXR diagnosis. Our approach addresses three key questions: where a radiologist looks, how long they focus on specific areas, and what findings they diagnose. By capturing the intensity of the radiologist's gaze, we provide a unified solution that offers insights into the cognitive process underlying radiological interpretation. Unlike current methods that rely on black-box machine learning models, which can be prone to extracting erroneous information from the entire input image during the diagnosis process, we tackle this issue by effectively masking out irrelevant information. Our approach leverages a vision-language model, allowing for precise control over the interpretation process while ensuring the exclusion of irrelevant features. To train our model, we utilize an eye gaze dataset to extract anatomical gaze information and generate ground truth heatmaps. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We showcase that the attention heatmaps, designed to mimic radiologists' focus, encode sufficient and relevant information, enabling accurate classification tasks using only a portion of CXR.

- **Summary**: Automated segmentation of cancerous lesions in PET/CT images is a vital initial task for quantitative analysis. However, it is often challenging to train deep learning-based segmentation methods to high degree of accuracy due to the diversity of lesions in terms of their shapes, sizes, and radiotracer uptake levels. These lesions can be found in various parts of the body, often close to healthy organs that also show significant uptake. Consequently, developing a comprehensive PET/CT lesion segmentation model is a demanding endeavor for routine quantitative image analysis. In this work, we train a 3D Residual UNet using Generalized Dice Focal Loss function on the AutoPET challenge 2023 training dataset. We develop our models in a 5-fold cross-validation setting and ensemble the five models via average and weighted-average ensembling. On the preliminary test phase, the average ensemble achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), false-positive volume (FPV) and false negative volume (FNV) of 0.5417, 0.8261 ml, and 0.2538 ml, respectively, while the weighted-average ensemble achieved 0.5417, 0.8186 ml, and 0.2538 ml, respectively.

- **Summary**: Current high-performance semantic segmentation models are purely data-driven sub-symbolic approaches and blind to the structured nature of the visual world. This is in stark contrast to human cognition which abstracts visual perceptions at multiple levels and conducts symbolic reasoning with such structured abstraction. To fill these fundamental gaps, we devise LOGICSEG, a holistic visual semantic parser that integrates neural inductive learning and logic reasoning with both rich data and symbolic knowledge. In particular, the semantic concepts of interest are structured as a hierarchy, from which a set of constraints are derived for describing the symbolic relations and formalized as first-order logic rules. After fuzzy logic-based continuous relaxation, logical formulae are grounded onto data and neural computational graphs, hence enabling logic-induced network training. During inference, logical constraints are packaged into an iterative process and injected into the network in a form of several matrix multiplications, so as to achieve hierarchy-coherent prediction with logic reasoning. These designs together make LOGICSEG a general and compact neural-logic machine that is readily integrated into existing segmentation models. Extensive experiments over four datasets with various segmentation models and backbones verify the effectiveness and generality of LOGICSEG. We believe this study opens a new avenue for visual semantic parsing.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when being fine-tuned with samples of new classes. This issue becomes even more pronounced when faced with the domain shift between training and testing data. In this paper, we study the critical and less explored Domain-Generalized Class-Incremental Learning (DGCIL). We design a DGCIL approach that remembers old classes, adapts to new classes, and can classify reliably objects from unseen domains. Specifically, our loss formulation maintains classification boundaries and suppresses the domain-specific information of each class. With no old exemplars stored, we use knowledge distillation and estimate old class prototype drift as incremental training advances. Our prototype representations are based on multivariate Normal distributions whose means and covariances are constantly adapted to changing model features to represent old classes well by adapting to the feature space drift. For old classes, we sample pseudo-features from the adapted Normal distributions with the help of Cholesky decomposition. In contrast to previous pseudo-feature sampling strategies that rely solely on average mean prototypes, our method excels at capturing varying semantic information. Experiments on several benchmarks validate our claims.

- **Summary**: The potential of digital twin technology, involving the creation of precise digital replicas of physical objects, to reshape AR experiences in 3D object tracking and localization scenarios is significant. However, enabling 3D object tracking with subcentimeter accuracy in dynamic mobile AR environments remains a formidable challenge. These scenarios often require a more robust pose estimator capable of handling the inherent sensor-level measurement noise. In this paper, recognizing the absence of comprehensive solutions in existing literature, we build upon our previous work, the Digital Twin Tracking Dataset (DTTD), to address these challenges in mobile AR settings. Specifically, we propose a transformer-based 6DoF pose estimator designed to withstand the challenges posed by noisy depth data. Simultaneously, we introduce a novel RGBD dataset captured using a cutting-edge mobile sensor, the iPhone 14 Pro, expanding the applicability of our approach to iPhone sensor data. Through extensive experimentation and in-depth analysis, we illustrate the effectiveness of our methods in the face of significant depth data errors, surpassing the performance of existing baselines. Code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recently, regularization model-driven deep learning (DL) has gained significant attention due to its ability to leverage the potent representational capabilities of DL while retaining the theoretical guarantees of regularization models. However, most of these methods are tailored for supervised learning scenarios that necessitate fully sampled labels, which can pose challenges in practical MRI applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose a self-supervised DL approach for accelerated MRI that is theoretically guaranteed and does not rely on fully sampled labels. Specifically, we achieve neural network structure regularization by exploiting the inherent structural low-rankness of the $k$-space data. Simultaneously, we constrain the network structure to resemble a nonexpansive mapping, ensuring the network's convergence to a fixed point. Thanks to this well-defined network structure, this fixed point can completely reconstruct the missing $k$-space data based on matrix completion theory, even in situations where full-sampled labels are unavailable. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate its superiority over existing self-supervised approaches and traditional regularization methods, achieving performance comparable to that of supervised learning methods in certain scenarios.

- **Summary**: Panoptic segmentation in agriculture is an advanced computer vision technique that provides a comprehensive understanding of field composition. It facilitates various tasks such as crop and weed segmentation, plant panoptic segmentation, and leaf instance segmentation, all aimed at addressing challenges in agriculture. Exploring the application of panoptic segmentation in agriculture, the 8th Workshop on Computer Vision in Plant Phenotyping and Agriculture (CVPPA) hosted the challenge of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of crops and weeds using the PhenoBench dataset. To tackle the tasks presented in this competition, we propose an approach that combines the effectiveness of the Segment AnyThing Model (SAM) for instance segmentation with prompt input from object detection models. Specifically, we integrated two notable approaches in object detection, namely DINO and YOLO-v8. Our best-performing model achieved a PQ+ score of 81.33 based on the evaluation metrics of the competition.

- **Summary**: The Computed Tomography (CT) for diagnosis of lesions in human internal organs is one of the most fundamental topics in medical imaging. Low-dose CT, which offers reduced radiation exposure, is preferred over standard-dose CT, and therefore its reconstruction approaches have been extensively studied. However, current low-dose CT reconstruction techniques mainly rely on model-based methods or deep-learning-based techniques, which often ignore the coherence and smoothness for sequential CT slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with enhanced local coherence. The proposed method can capture the local coherence of adjacent images by optical flow, which yields significant improvements in the precision and stability of the constructed images. We evaluate our proposed method on real datasets and the experimental results suggest that it can outperform existing state-of-the-art reconstruction approaches significantly.

- **Summary**: Various deep learning models have been proposed for 3D bone shape reconstruction from two orthogonal (biplanar) X-ray images. However, it is unclear how these models compare against each other since they are evaluated on different anatomy, cohort and (often privately held) datasets. Moreover, the impact of the commonly optimized image-based segmentation metrics such as dice score on the estimation of clinical parameters relevant in 2D-3D bone shape reconstruction is not well known. To move closer toward clinical translation, we propose a benchmarking framework that evaluates tasks relevant to real-world clinical scenarios, including reconstruction of fractured bones, bones with implants, robustness to population shift, and error in estimating clinical parameters. Our open-source platform provides reference implementations of 8 models (many of whose implementations were not publicly available), APIs to easily collect and preprocess 6 public datasets, and the implementation of automatic clinical parameter and landmark extraction methods. We present an extensive evaluation of 8 2D-3D models on equal footing using 6 public datasets comprising images for four different anatomies. Our results show that attention-based methods that capture global spatial relationships tend to perform better across all anatomies and datasets; performance on clinically relevant subgroups may be overestimated without disaggregated reporting; ribs are substantially more difficult to reconstruct compared to femur, hip and spine; and the dice score improvement does not always bring a corresponding improvement in the automatic estimation of clinically relevant parameters.

- **Summary**: Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) have successfully integrated learning-based techniques into vehicle perception and decision-making. However, their application in 3D lane detection for effective driving environment perception is hindered by the lack of comprehensive LiDAR datasets. The sparse nature of LiDAR point cloud data prevents an efficient manual annotation process. To solve this problem, we present LiSV-3DLane, a large-scale 3D lane dataset that comprises 20k frames of surround-view LiDAR point clouds with enriched semantic annotation. Unlike existing datasets confined to a frontal perspective, LiSV-3DLane provides a full 360-degree spatial panorama around the ego vehicle, capturing complex lane patterns in both urban and highway environments. We leverage the geometric traits of lane lines and the intrinsic spatial attributes of LiDAR data to design a simple yet effective automatic annotation pipeline for generating finer lane labels. To propel future research, we propose a novel LiDAR-based 3D lane detection model, LiLaDet, incorporating the spatial geometry learning of the LiDAR point cloud into Bird's Eye View (BEV) based lane identification. Experimental results indicate that LiLaDet outperforms existing camera- and LiDAR-based approaches in the 3D lane detection task on the K-Lane dataset and our LiSV-3DLane.

- **Summary**: Denoisers play a central role in many applications, from noise suppression in low-grade imaging sensors, to empowering score-based generative models. The latter category of methods makes use of Tweedie's formula, which links the posterior mean in Gaussian denoising (i.e., the minimum MSE denoiser) with the score of the data distribution. Here, we derive a fundamental relation between the higher-order central moments of the posterior distribution, and the higher-order derivatives of the posterior mean. We harness this result for uncertainty quantification of pre-trained denoisers. Particularly, we show how to efficiently compute the principal components of the posterior distribution for any desired region of an image, as well as to approximate the full marginal distribution along those (or any other) one-dimensional directions. Our method is fast and memory efficient, as it does not explicitly compute or store the high-order moment tensors and it requires no training or fine tuning of the denoiser.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Vision Transformers have attracted increasing interest from computer vision researchers. However, the advantage of these transformers over CNNs is only fully manifested when trained over a large dataset, mainly due to the reduced inductive bias towards spatial locality within the transformer's self-attention mechanism. In this work, we present a data-efficient vision transformer that does not rely on self-attention. Instead, it employs a novel generalization to multiple axes of the very recent Hyena layer. We propose several alternative approaches for obtaining this generalization and delve into their unique distinctions and considerations from both empirical and theoretical perspectives.   Our empirical findings indicate that the proposed Hyena N-D layer boosts the performance of various Vision Transformer architectures, such as ViT, Swin, and DeiT across multiple datasets. Furthermore, in the small dataset regime, our Hyena-based ViT is favorable to ViT variants from the recent literature that are specifically designed for solving the same challenge, i.e., working with small datasets or incorporating image-specific inductive bias into the self-attention mechanism. Finally, we show that a hybrid approach that is based on Hyena N-D for the first layers in ViT, followed by layers that incorporate conventional attention, consistently boosts the performance of various vision transformer architectures.

- **Summary**: Automated image caption generation is a critical area of research that enhances accessibility and understanding of visual content for diverse audiences. In this study, we propose the FaceAtt model, a novel approach to attribute-focused image captioning that emphasizes the accurate depiction of facial attributes within images. FaceAtt automatically detects and describes a wide range of attributes, including emotions, expressions, pointed noses, fair skin tones, hair textures, attractiveness, and approximate age ranges. Leveraging deep learning techniques, we explore the impact of different image feature extraction methods on caption quality and evaluate our model's performance using metrics such as BLEU and METEOR. Our FaceAtt model leverages annotated attributes of portraits as supplementary prior knowledge for our portrait images before captioning. This innovative addition yields a subtle yet discernible enhancement in the resulting scores, exemplifying the potency of incorporating additional attribute vectors during training. Furthermore, our research contributes to the broader discourse on ethical considerations in automated captioning. This study sets the stage for future research in refining attribute-focused captioning techniques, with a focus on enhancing linguistic coherence, addressing biases, and accommodating diverse user needs.

- **Summary**: Since autonomous driving systems usually face dynamic and ever-changing environments, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) has been proposed as a strategy for transferring deployed models to continually changing target domains. However, the pursuit of long-term adaptation often introduces catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation problems, which impede the practical implementation of CTTA in the real world. Recently, existing CTTA methods mainly focus on utilizing a majority of parameters to fit target domain knowledge through self-training. Unfortunately, these approaches often amplify the challenge of error accumulation due to noisy pseudo-labels, and pose practical limitations stemming from the heavy computational costs associated with entire model updates. In this paper, we propose a distribution-aware tuning (DAT) method to make the semantic segmentation CTTA efficient and practical in real-world applications. DAT adaptively selects and updates two small groups of trainable parameters based on data distribution during the continual adaptation process, including domain-specific parameters (DSP) and task-relevant parameters (TRP). Specifically, DSP exhibits sensitivity to outputs with substantial distribution shifts, effectively mitigating the problem of error accumulation. In contrast, TRP are allocated to positions that are responsive to outputs with minor distribution shifts, which are fine-tuned to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem. In addition, since CTTA is a temporal task, we introduce the Parameter Accumulation Update (PAU) strategy to collect the updated DSP and TRP in target domain sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used semantic segmentation CTTA benchmarks, achieving promising performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: 3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of 3D scenes with the specified style, which requires high-quality rendering and keeping multi-view consistency. Benefiting from the ability of 3D representation from Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), existing methods learn the stylized NeRF by giving a reference style from an image. However, they suffer the challenges of high-quality stylization with texture details for multi-style transfer and stylization with multimodal guidance. In this paper, we reveal that the same objects in 3D scenes show various states (color tone, details, etc.) from different views after stylization since previous methods optimized by single-view image-based style loss functions, leading NeRF to tend to smooth texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF, which achieves high-quality 3D multi-style rendering with texture details and can be driven by multimodal-style guidance. First, MM-NeRF adopts a unified framework to project multimodal guidance into CLIP space and extracts multimodal style features to guide the multi-style stylization. To relieve the problem of lacking details, we propose a novel Multi-Head Learning Scheme (MLS), in which each style head predicts the parameters of the color head of NeRF. MLS decomposes the learning difficulty caused by the inconsistency of multi-style transfer and improves the quality of stylization. In addition, the MLS can generalize pre-trained MM-NeRF to any new styles by adding heads with small training costs (a few minutes). Extensive experiments on three real-world 3D scene datasets show that MM-NeRF achieves high-quality 3D multi-style stylization with multimodal guidance, keeps multi-view consistency, and keeps semantic consistency of multimodal style guidance. Codes will be released later.

- **Summary**: No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) plays an essential role in improving the viewing experience of end-users. Driven by deep learning, recent NR-VQA models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved outstanding performance. To build a reliable and practical assessment system, it is of great necessity to evaluate their robustness. However, such issue has received little attention in the academic community. In this paper, we make the first attempt to evaluate the robustness of NR-VQA models against adversarial attacks under black-box setting, and propose a patch-based random search method for black-box attack. Specifically, considering both the attack effect on quality score and the visual quality of adversarial video, the attack problem is formulated as misleading the estimated quality score under the constraint of just-noticeable difference (JND). Built upon such formulation, a novel loss function called Score-Reversed Boundary Loss is designed to push the adversarial video's estimated quality score far away from its ground-truth score towards a specific boundary, and the JND constraint is modeled as a strict $L_2$ and $L_\infty$ norm restriction. By this means, both white-box and black-box attacks can be launched in an effective and imperceptible manner. The source code is available at https://github.com/GZHU-DVL/AttackVQA.

- **Summary**: The availability of vast amounts of visual data with heterogeneous features is a key factor for developing, testing, and benchmarking of new computer vision (CV) algorithms and architectures. Most visual datasets are created and curated for specific tasks or with limited image data distribution for very specific situations, and there is no unified approach to manage and access them across diverse sources, tasks, and taxonomies. This not only creates unnecessary overheads when building robust visual recognition systems, but also introduces biases into learning systems and limits the capabilities of data-centric AI. To address these problems, we propose the Vision Knowledge Graph (VisionKG), a novel resource that interlinks, organizes and manages visual datasets via knowledge graphs and Semantic Web technologies. It can serve as a unified framework facilitating simple access and querying of state-of-the-art visual datasets, regardless of their heterogeneous formats and taxonomies. One of the key differences between our approach and existing methods is that ours is knowledge-based rather than metadatabased. It enhances the enrichment of the semantics at both image and instance levels and offers various data retrieval and exploratory services via SPARQL. VisionKG currently contains 519 million RDF triples that describe approximately 40 million entities, and are accessible at https://vision.semkg.org and through APIs. With the integration of 30 datasets and four popular CV tasks, we demonstrate its usefulness across various scenarios when working with CV pipelines.

- **Summary**: Difference features obtained by comparing the images of two periods play an indispensable role in the change detection (CD) task. However, a pair of bi-temporal images can exhibit diverse changes, which may cause various difference features. Identifying changed pixels with differ difference features to be the same category is thus a challenge for CD. Most nowadays' methods acquire distinctive difference features in implicit ways like enhancing image representation or supervision information. Nevertheless, informative image features only guarantee object semantics are modeled and can not guarantee that changed pixels have similar semantics in the difference feature space and are distinct from those unchanged ones. In this work, the generalized representation of various changes is learned straightforwardly in the difference feature space, and a novel Changes-Aware Transformer (CAT) for refining difference features is proposed. This generalized representation can perceive which pixels are changed and which are unchanged and further guide the update of pixels' difference features. CAT effectively accomplishes this refinement process through the stacked cosine cross-attention layer and self-attention layer. After refinement, the changed pixels in the difference feature space are closer to each other, which facilitates change detection. In addition, CAT is compatible with various backbone networks and existing CD methods. Experiments on remote sensing CD data set and street scene CD data set show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and has excellent generalization.

- **Summary**: Image steganography is a technique of hiding secret information inside another image, so that the secret is not visible to human eyes and can be recovered when needed. Most of the existing image steganography methods have low hiding robustness when the container images affected by distortion. Such as Gaussian noise and lossy compression. This paper proposed PRIS to improve the robustness of image steganography, it based on invertible neural networks, and put two enhance modules before and after the extraction process with a 3-step training strategy. Moreover, rounding error is considered which is always ignored by existing methods, but actually it is unavoidable in practical. A gradient approximation function (GAF) is also proposed to overcome the undifferentiable issue of rounding distortion. Experimental results show that our PRIS outperforms the state-of-the-art robust image steganography method in both robustness and practicability.

- **Summary**: Adapter-style efficient transfer learning (ETL) has shown excellent performance in the tuning of vision-language models (VLMs) under the low-data regime, where only a few additional parameters are introduced to excavate the task-specific knowledge based on the general and powerful representation of VLMs. However, most adapter-style works face two limitations: (i) modeling task-specific knowledge with a single modality only; and (ii) overlooking the exploitation of the inter-class relationships in downstream tasks, thereby leading to sub-optimal solutions. To mitigate that, we propose an effective adapter-style tuning strategy, dubbed GraphAdapter, which performs the textual adapter by explicitly modeling the dual-modality structure knowledge (i.e., the correlation of different semantics/classes in textual and visual modalities) with a dual knowledge graph. In particular, the dual knowledge graph is established with two sub-graphs, i.e., a textual knowledge sub-graph, and a visual knowledge sub-graph, where the nodes and edges represent the semantics/classes and their correlations in two modalities, respectively. This enables the textual feature of each prompt to leverage the task-specific structure knowledge from both textual and visual modalities, yielding a more effective classifier for downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results on 11 benchmark datasets reveal that our GraphAdapter significantly outperforms previous adapter-based methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/lixinustc/GraphAdapter

- **Summary**: Infrared small target detection is a technique for finding small targets from infrared clutter background. Due to the dearth of high-level semantic information, small infrared target features are weakened in the deep layers of the CNN, which underachieves the CNN's representation ability. To address the above problem, in this paper, we propose an infrared low-level network (ILNet) that considers infrared small targets as salient areas with little semantic information. Unlike other SOTA methods, ILNet pays greater attention to low-level information instead of treating them equally. A new lightweight feature fusion module, named Interactive Polarized Orthogonal Fusion module (IPOF), is proposed, which integrates more important low-level features from the shallow layers into the deep layers. A Dynamic One-Dimensional Aggregation layers (DODA) are inserted into the IPOF, to dynamically adjust the aggregation of low dimensional information according to the number of input channels. In addition, the idea of ensemble learning is used to design a Representative Block (RB) to dynamically allocate weights for shallow and deep layers. Experimental results on the challenging NUAA-SIRST (78.22% nIoU and 1.33e-6 Fa) and IRSTD-1K (68.91% nIoU and 3.23e-6 Fa) dataset demonstrate that the proposed ILNet can get better performances than other SOTA methods. Moreover, ILNet can obtain a greater improvement with the increasement of data volume. Training code are available at https://github.com/Li-Haoqing/ILNet.

- **Summary**: Preserving cultural heritage is of paramount importance. In the domain of art restoration, developing a computer vision model capable of effectively restoring deteriorated images of art pieces was difficult, but now we have a good computer vision state-of-art. Traditional restoration methods are often time-consuming and require extensive expertise. The aim of this work is to design an automated solution based on computer vision models that can enhance and reconstruct degraded artworks, improving their visual quality while preserving their original characteristics and artifacts. The model should handle a diverse range of deterioration types, including but not limited to noise, blur, scratches, fading, and other common forms of degradation. We adapt the current state-of-art for the image super-resolution based on the Diffusion Model (DM) and fine-tune it for Image art restoration. Our results show that instead of fine-tunning multiple different models for different kinds of degradation, fine-tuning one super-resolution. We train it on multiple datasets to make it robust. code link: https://github.com/Naagar/art_restoration_DM

- **Summary**: As deep learning methods continue to improve medical image segmentation performance, data annotation is still a big bottleneck due to the labor-intensive and time-consuming burden on medical experts, especially for 3D images. To significantly reduce annotation efforts while attaining competitive segmentation accuracy, we propose a self-learning and one-shot learning based framework for 3D medical image segmentation by annotating only one slice of each 3D image. Our approach takes two steps: (1) self-learning of a reconstruction network to learn semantic correspondence among 2D slices within 3D images, and (2) representative selection of single slices for one-shot manual annotation and propagating the annotated data with the well-trained reconstruction network. Extensive experiments verify that our new framework achieves comparable performance with less than 1% annotated data compared with fully supervised methods and generalizes well on several out-of-distribution testing sets.

- **Summary**: Most existing Image-to-Image Translation (I2IT) methods generate images in a single run of a deep learning (DL) model. However, designing such a single-step model is always challenging, requiring a huge number of parameters and easily falling into bad global minimums and overfitting. In this work, we reformulate I2IT as a step-wise decision-making problem via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and propose a novel framework that performs RL-based I2IT (RL-I2IT). The key feature in the RL-I2IT framework is to decompose a monolithic learning process into small steps with a lightweight model to progressively transform a source image successively to a target image. Considering that it is challenging to handle high dimensional continuous state and action spaces in the conventional RL framework, we introduce meta policy with a new concept Plan to the standard Actor-Critic model, which is of a lower dimension than the original image and can facilitate the actor to generate a tractable high dimensional action. In the RL-I2IT framework, we also employ a task-specific auxiliary learning strategy to stabilize the training process and improve the performance of the corresponding task. Experiments on several I2IT tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method when facing high-dimensional continuous action space problems.

- **Summary**: In the domain of Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) interpretation, prior approaches often imposed a burden on users, requiring them to spell words without hidden characters, which were subsequently corrected using Bangla grammar rules due to the missing classes in BdSL36 dataset. However, this method posed a challenge in accurately guessing the incorrect spelling of words. To address this limitation, we propose a novel real-time finger spelling system based on the YOLOv5 architecture. Our system employs specified rules and numerical classes as triggers to efficiently generate hidden and compound characters, eliminating the necessity for additional classes and significantly enhancing user convenience. Notably, our approach achieves character spelling in an impressive 1.32 seconds with a remarkable accuracy rate of 98\%. Furthermore, our YOLOv5 model, trained on 9147 images, demonstrates an exceptional mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96.4\%. These advancements represent a substantial progression in augmenting BdSL interpretation, promising increased inclusivity and accessibility for the linguistic minority. This innovative framework, characterized by compatibility with existing YOLO versions, stands as a transformative milestone in enhancing communication modalities and linguistic equity within the Bangla Sign Language community.

- **Summary**: Model quantization, which aims to compress deep neural networks and accelerate inference speed, has greatly facilitated the development of cumbersome models on mobile and edge devices. There is a common assumption in quantization methods from prior works that training data is available. In practice, however, this assumption cannot always be fulfilled due to reasons of privacy and security, rendering these methods inapplicable in real-life situations. Thus, data-free network quantization has recently received significant attention in neural network compression. Causal reasoning provides an intuitive way to model causal relationships to eliminate data-driven correlations, making causality an essential component of analyzing data-free problems. However, causal formulations of data-free quantization are inadequate in the literature. To bridge this gap, we construct a causal graph to model the data generation and discrepancy reduction between the pre-trained and quantized models. Inspired by the causal understanding, we propose the Causality-guided Data-free Network Quantization method, Causal-DFQ, to eliminate the reliance on data via approaching an equilibrium of causality-driven intervened distributions. Specifically, we design a content-style-decoupled generator, synthesizing images conditioned on the relevant and irrelevant factors; then we propose a discrepancy reduction loss to align the intervened distributions of the pre-trained and quantized models. It is worth noting that our work is the first attempt towards introducing causality to data-free quantization problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Causal-DFQ.

- **Summary**: Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to remove adverse weather conditions in single images using a single set of pre-trained weights, they fail to restore weather videos due to the absence of temporal information. Furthermore, existing methods for removing adverse weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and snow) from videos can only handle one type of adverse weather. In this work, we propose the first framework for restoring videos from all adverse weather conditions by developing a video adverse-weather-component suppression network (ViWS-Net). To achieve this, we first devise a weather-agnostic video transformer encoder with multiple transformer stages. Moreover, we design a long short-term temporal modeling mechanism for weather messenger to early fuse input adjacent video frames and learn weather-specific information. We further introduce a weather discriminator with gradient reversion, to maintain the weather-invariant common information and suppress the weather-specific information in pixel features, by adversarially predicting weather types. Finally, we develop a messenger-driven video transformer decoder to retrieve the residual weather-specific feature, which is spatiotemporally aggregated with hierarchical pixel features and refined to predict the clean target frame of input videos. Experimental results, on benchmark datasets and real-world weather videos, demonstrate that our ViWS-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of restoring videos degraded by any weather condition.

- **Summary**: Facial biometrics are widely deployed in smartphone-based applications because of their usability and increased verification accuracy in unconstrained scenarios. The evolving applications of smartphone-based facial recognition have also increased Presentation Attacks (PAs), where an attacker can present a Presentation Attack Instrument (PAI) to maliciously gain access to the application. Because the materials used to generate PAI are not deterministic, the detection of unknown presentation attacks is challenging. In this paper, we present an acoustic echo-based face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) on a smartphone in which the PAs are detected based on the reflection profiles of the transmitted signal. We propose a novel transmission signal based on the wide pulse that allows us to model the background noise before transmitting the signal and increase the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The received signal reflections were processed to remove background noise and accurately represent reflection characteristics. The reflection profiles of the bona fide and PAs are different owing to the different reflection characteristics of the human skin and artefact materials. Extensive experiments are presented using the newly collected Acoustic Sound Echo Dataset (ASED) with 4807 samples captured from bona fide and four different types of PAIs, including print (two types), display, and silicone face-mask attacks. The obtained results indicate the robustness of the proposed method for detecting unknown face presentation attacks.

- **Summary**: Style transfer driven by text prompts paved a new path for creatively stylizing the images without collecting an actual style image. Despite having promising results, with text-driven stylization, the user has no control over the stylization. If a user wants to create an artistic image, the user requires fine control over the stylization of various entities individually in the content image, which is not addressed by the current state-of-the-art approaches. On the other hand, diffusion style transfer methods also suffer from the same issue because the regional stylization control over the stylized output is ineffective. To address this problem, We propose a new method Multi-Object Segmented Arbitrary Stylization Using CLIP (MOSAIC), that can apply styles to different objects in the image based on the context extracted from the input prompt. Text-based segmentation and stylization modules which are based on vision transformer architecture, were used to segment and stylize the objects. Our method can extend to any arbitrary objects, styles and produce high-quality images compared to the current state of art methods. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to perform text-guided arbitrary object-wise stylization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing that it can generate visually appealing stylized images with enhanced control over stylization and the ability to generalize to unseen object classes.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing realistic human movements, dynamically responsive to the environment, is a long-standing objective in character animation, with applications in computer vision, sports, and healthcare, for motion prediction and data augmentation. Recent kinematics-based generative motion models offer impressive scalability in modeling extensive motion data, albeit without an interface to reason about and interact with physics. While simulator-in-the-loop learning approaches enable highly physically realistic behaviors, the challenges in training often affect scalability and adoption. We introduce DROP, a novel framework for modeling Dynamics Responses of humans using generative mOtion prior and Projective dynamics. DROP can be viewed as a highly stable, minimalist physics-based human simulator that interfaces with a kinematics-based generative motion prior. Utilizing projective dynamics, DROP allows flexible and simple integration of the learned motion prior as one of the projective energies, seamlessly incorporating control provided by the motion prior with Newtonian dynamics. Serving as a model-agnostic plug-in, DROP enables us to fully leverage recent advances in generative motion models for physics-based motion synthesis. We conduct extensive evaluations of our model across different motion tasks and various physical perturbations, demonstrating the scalability and diversity of responses.

- **Summary**: Wire harnesses are essential hardware for electronic systems in modern automotive vehicles. With a shift in the automotive industry towards electrification and autonomous driving, more and more automotive electronics are responsible for energy transmission and safety-critical functions such as maneuvering, driver assistance, and safety system. This paradigm shift places more demand on automotive wiring harnesses from the safety perspective and stresses the greater importance of high-quality wire harness assembly in vehicles. However, most of the current operations of wire harness assembly are still performed manually by skilled workers, and some of the manual processes are problematic from different perspectives, such as quality control and ergonomics. There is also a persistent demand in the industry to increase competitiveness and gain market share. Hence, assuring assembly quality while improving ergonomics and optimizing labor costs is desired. Robotized assembly, accomplished by robots or in human-robot collaboration, is a key enabler for fulfilling the increasingly demanding quality and safety as it enables more replicable, transparent, and comprehensible processes than completely manual operations. However, robotized assembly of wire harnesses is challenging in real environments due to the flexibility of the deformable objects, though many preliminary automation solutions have been proposed under simplified industrial configurations. Previous research efforts have proposed the use of computer vision technology to facilitate robotized automation of wire harness assembly, enabling the robots to better perceive and manipulate the flexible wire harness. This article presents an overview on computer vision technology proposed for robotized wire harness assembly and derives research gaps that require further study to facilitate a more practical robotized assembly of wire harness.

- **Summary**: The shift towards electrification and autonomous driving in the automotive industry results in more and more automotive wire harnesses being installed in modern automobiles, which stresses the great significance of guaranteeing the quality of automotive wire harness assembly. The mating of connectors is essential in the final assembly of automotive wire harnesses due to the importance of connectors on wire harness connection and signal transmission. However, the current manual operation of mating connectors leads to severe problems regarding assembly quality and ergonomics, where the robotized assembly has been considered, and different vision-based solutions have been proposed to facilitate a better perception of the robot control system on connectors. Nonetheless, there has been a lack of deep learning-based solutions for detecting automotive wire harness connectors in previous literature. This paper presents a deep learning-based connector detection for robotized automotive wire harness assembly. A dataset of twenty automotive wire harness connectors was created to train and evaluate a two-stage and a one-stage object detection model, respectively. The experiment results indicate the effectiveness of deep learning-based connector detection for automotive wire harness assembly but are limited by the design of the exteriors of connectors.

- **Summary**: We participate in the AutoPET II challenge by modifying nnU-Net only through its easy to understand and modify 'nnUNetPlans.json' file. By switching to a UNet with residual encoder, increasing the batch size and increasing the patch size we obtain a configuration that substantially outperforms the automatically configured nnU-Net baseline (5-fold cross-validation Dice score of 65.14 vs 33.28) at the expense of increased compute requirements for model training. Our final submission ensembles the two most promising configurations. At the time of submission our method ranks first on the preliminary test set.

- **Summary**: The field of Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) has received much attention recently, driven by the progress of deep neural networks, especially for image classification. The problem of Re-ID consists in identifying individuals through images captured by surveillance cameras in different scenarios. Governments and companies are investing a lot of time and money in Re-ID systems for use in public safety and identifying missing persons. However, several challenges remain for successfully implementing Re-ID, such as occlusions and light reflections in people's images. In this work, we focus on adversarial attacks on Re-ID systems, which can be a critical threat to the performance of these systems. In particular, we explore the combination of adversarial attacks against Re-ID models, trying to strengthen the decrease in the classification results. We conduct our experiments on three datasets: DukeMTMC-ReID, Market-1501, and CUHK03. We combine the use of two types of adversarial attacks, P-FGSM and Deep Mis-Ranking, applied to two popular Re-ID models: IDE (ResNet-50) and AlignedReID. The best result demonstrates a decrease of 3.36% in the Rank-10 metric for AlignedReID applied to CUHK03. We also try to use Dropout during the inference as a defense method.

- **Summary**: In order to appropriately filter multi-modality data sets on a web-scale, it becomes crucial to employ suitable filtering methods to boost performance and reduce training costs. For instance, LAION papers employs the CLIP score filter to select data with CLIP scores surpassing a certain threshold. On the other hand, T-MARS achieves high-quality data filtering by detecting and masking text within images and then filtering by CLIP score. Through analyzing the dataset, we observe a significant proportion of redundant information, such as numbers, present in the textual content. Our experiments on a subset of the data unveil the profound impact of these redundant elements on the CLIP scores. A logical approach would involve reevaluating the CLIP scores after eliminating these influences. Experimentally, our text-based CLIP filter outperforms the top-ranked method on the ``small scale" of DataComp (a data filtering benchmark) on ImageNet distribution shifts, achieving a 3.6% performance improvement. The results also demonstrate that our proposed text-masked filter outperforms the original CLIP score filter when selecting the top 40% of the data. The impact of numbers on CLIP and their handling provide valuable insights for improving the effectiveness of CLIP training, including language rewrite techniques.

- **Summary**: Identifying and segmenting moving objects from a moving monocular camera is difficult when there is unknown camera motion, different types of object motions and complex scene structures. To tackle these challenges, we take advantage of two popular branches of monocular motion segmentation approaches: point trajectory based and optical flow based methods, by synergistically fusing these two highly complementary motion cues at object level. By doing this, we are able to model various complex object motions in different scene structures at once, which has not been achieved by existing methods. We first obtain object-specific point trajectories and optical flow mask for each common object in the video, by leveraging the recent foundational models in object recognition, segmentation and tracking. We then construct two robust affinity matrices representing the pairwise object motion affinities throughout the whole video using epipolar geometry and the motion information provided by optical flow. Finally, co-regularized multi-view spectral clustering is used to fuse the two affinity matrices and obtain the final clustering. Our method shows state-of-the-art performance on the KT3DMoSeg dataset, which contains complex motions and scene structures. Being able to identify moving objects allows us to remove them for map building when using visual SLAM or SFM.

- **Summary**: Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) can predict the parameters of varying unseen CNN architectures with surprisingly good accuracy at a fraction of the cost of iterative optimization. Following these successes, preliminary research has explored the use of GHNs to predict quantization-robust parameters for 8-bit and 4-bit quantized CNNs. However, this early work leveraged full-precision float32 training and only quantized for testing. We explore the impact of quantization-aware training and/or other quantization-based training strategies on quantized robustness and performance of GHN predicted parameters for low-precision CNNs. We show that quantization-aware training can significantly improve quantized accuracy for GHN predicted parameters of 4-bit quantized CNNs and even lead to greater-than-random accuracy for 2-bit quantized CNNs. These promising results open the door for future explorations such as investigating the use of GHN predicted parameters as initialization for further quantized training of individual CNNs, further exploration of "extreme bitwidth" quantization, and mixed precision quantization schemes.

- **Summary**: In breast surgical planning, accurate registration of MR images across patient positions has the potential to improve the localisation of tumours during breast cancer treatment. While learning-based registration methods have recently become the state-of-the-art approach for most medical image registration tasks, these methods have yet to make inroads into breast image registration due to certain difficulties-the lack of rich texture information in breast MR images and the need for the deformations to be diffeomophic. In this work, we propose learning strategies for breast MR image registration that are amenable to diffeomorphic constraints, together with early experimental results from in-silico and in-vivo experiments. One key contribution of this work is a registration network which produces superior registration outcomes for breast images in addition to providing diffeomorphic guarantees.

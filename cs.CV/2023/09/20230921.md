- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial to modern deep learning applications by identifying and alerting about the OOD samples that should not be tested or used for making predictions. Current OOD detection methods have made significant progress when in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples are drawn from static distributions. However, this can be unrealistic when applied to real-world systems which often undergo continuous variations and shifts in ID and OOD distributions over time. Therefore, for an effective application in real-world systems, the development of OOD detection methods that can adapt to these dynamic and evolving distributions is essential. In this paper, we propose a novel and more realistic setting called continuously adaptive out-of-distribution (CAOOD) detection which targets on developing an OOD detection model that enables dynamic and quick adaptation to a new arriving distribution, with insufficient ID samples during deployment time. To address CAOOD, we develop meta OOD learning (MOL) by designing a learning-to-adapt diagram such that a good initialized OOD detection model is learned during the training process. In the testing process, MOL ensures OOD detection performance over shifting distributions by quickly adapting to new distributions with a few adaptations. Extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks endorse the effectiveness of our method in preserving both ID classification accuracy and OOD detection performance on continuously shifting distributions.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims at identifying the contours of primary foreground objects in videos without any prior knowledge. However, previous methods do not fully use spatial-temporal context and fail to tackle this challenging task in real-time. This motivates us to develop an efficient Long-Short Temporal Attention network (termed LSTA) for unsupervised VOS task from a holistic view. Specifically, LSTA consists of two dominant modules, i.e., Long Temporal Memory and Short Temporal Attention. The former captures the long-term global pixel relations of the past frames and the current frame, which models constantly present objects by encoding appearance pattern. Meanwhile, the latter reveals the short-term local pixel relations of one nearby frame and the current frame, which models moving objects by encoding motion pattern. To speedup the inference, the efficient projection and the locality-based sliding window are adopted to achieve nearly linear time complexity for the two light modules, respectively. Extensive empirical studies on several benchmarks have demonstrated promising performances of the proposed method with high efficiency.

- **Summary**: Referenceless metrics (e.g., CLIPScore) use pretrained vision--language models to assess image descriptions directly without costly ground-truth reference texts. Such methods can facilitate rapid progress, but only if they truly align with human preference judgments. In this paper, we introduce ContextRef, a benchmark for assessing referenceless metrics for such alignment. ContextRef has two components: human ratings along a variety of established quality dimensions, and ten diverse robustness checks designed to uncover fundamental weaknesses. A crucial aspect of ContextRef is that images and descriptions are presented in context, reflecting prior work showing that context is important for description quality. Using ContextRef, we assess a variety of pretrained models, scoring functions, and techniques for incorporating context. None of the methods is successful with ContextRef, but we show that careful fine-tuning yields substantial improvements. ContextRef remains a challenging benchmark though, in large part due to the challenge of context dependence.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is an effective approach to handle the lack of annotations in the target domain for the semantic segmentation task. In this work, we consider a more practical UDA setting where the target domain contains sequential frames of the unlabeled videos which are easy to collect in practice. A recent study suggests self-supervised learning of the object motion from unlabeled videos with geometric constraints. We design a motion-guided domain adaptive semantic segmentation framework (MoDA), that utilizes self-supervised object motion to learn effective representations in the target domain. MoDA differs from previous methods that use temporal consistency regularization for the target domain frames. Instead, MoDA deals separately with the domain alignment on the foreground and background categories using different strategies. Specifically, MoDA contains foreground object discovery and foreground semantic mining to align the foreground domain gaps by taking the instance-level guidance from the object motion. Additionally, MoDA includes background adversarial training which contains a background category-specific discriminator to handle the background domain gaps. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks highlight the effectiveness of MoDA against existing approaches in the domain adaptive image segmentation and domain adaptive video segmentation. Moreover, MoDA is versatile and can be used in conjunction with existing state-of-the-art approaches to further improve performance.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything (SAM), an advanced universal image segmentation model trained on an expansive visual dataset, has set a new benchmark in image segmentation and computer vision. However, it faced challenges when it came to distinguishing between shadows and their backgrounds. To address this, we developed Deshadow-Anything, considering the generalization of large-scale datasets, and we performed Fine-tuning on large-scale datasets to achieve image shadow removal. The diffusion model can diffuse along the edges and textures of an image, helping to remove shadows while preserving the details of the image. Furthermore, we design Multi-Self-Attention Guidance (MSAG) and adaptive input perturbation (DDPM-AIP) to accelerate the iterative training speed of diffusion. Experiments on shadow removal tasks demonstrate that these methods can effectively improve image restoration performance.

- **Summary**: The fine-grained medical action analysis task has received considerable attention from pattern recognition communities recently, but it faces the problems of data and algorithm shortage. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is an essential skill in emergency treatment. Currently, the assessment of CPR skills mainly depends on dummies and trainers, leading to high training costs and low efficiency. For the first time, this paper constructs a vision-based system to complete error action recognition and skill assessment in CPR. Specifically, we define 13 types of single-error actions and 74 types of composite error actions during external cardiac compression and then develop a video dataset named CPR-Coach. By taking the CPR-Coach as a benchmark, this paper thoroughly investigates and compares the performance of existing action recognition models based on different data modalities. To solve the unavoidable Single-class Training & Multi-class Testing problem, we propose a humancognition-inspired framework named ImagineNet to improve the model's multierror recognition performance under restricted supervision. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the framework. We hope this work could advance research toward fine-grained medical action analysis and skill assessment. The CPR-Coach dataset and the code of ImagineNet are publicly available on Github.

- **Summary**: Disease progression simulation is a crucial area of research that has significant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One major challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging monitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop a novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables controlled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise and realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression accurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the iterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an exponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the superiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and Style-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease Classification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from 35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2% of the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our best knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression images meeting real-world standards. It is a promising tool for medical research and clinical practice, potentially allowing healthcare providers to model disease trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses, and improve patient outcomes.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate text and other modalities (especially vision) have achieved unprecedented performance in various multimodal tasks. However, due to the unsolved adversarial robustness problem of vision models, MLLMs can have more severe safety and security risks by introducing the vision inputs. In this work, we study the adversarial robustness of Google's Bard, a competitive chatbot to ChatGPT that released its multimodal capability recently, to better understand the vulnerabilities of commercial MLLMs. By attacking white-box surrogate vision encoders or MLLMs, the generated adversarial examples can mislead Bard to output wrong image descriptions with a 22% success rate based solely on the transferability. We show that the adversarial examples can also attack other MLLMs, e.g., a 26% attack success rate against Bing Chat and a 86% attack success rate against ERNIE bot. Moreover, we identify two defense mechanisms of Bard, including face detection and toxicity detection of images. We design corresponding attacks to evade these defenses, demonstrating that the current defenses of Bard are also vulnerable. We hope this work can deepen our understanding on the robustness of MLLMs and facilitate future research on defenses. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/Attack-Bard.

- **Summary**: The recent development of online static map element (a.k.a. HD Map) construction algorithms has raised a vast demand for data with ground truth annotations. However, available public datasets currently cannot provide high-quality training data regarding consistency and accuracy. To this end, we present CAMA: a vision-centric approach for Consistent and Accurate Map Annotation. Without LiDAR inputs, our proposed framework can still generate high-quality 3D annotations of static map elements. Specifically, the annotation can achieve high reprojection accuracy across all surrounding cameras and is spatial-temporal consistent across the whole sequence. We apply our proposed framework to the popular nuScenes dataset to provide efficient and highly accurate annotations. Compared with the original nuScenes static map element, models trained with annotations from CAMA achieve lower reprojection errors (e.g., 4.73 vs. 8.03 pixels).

- **Summary**: Recently, multi-modality models have been introduced because of the complementary information from different sensors such as LiDAR and cameras. It requires paired data along with precise calibrations for all modalities, the complicated calibration among modalities hugely increases the cost of collecting such high-quality datasets, and hinder it from being applied to practical scenarios. Inherit from the previous works, we not only fuse the information from multi-modality without above issues, and also exhaust the information in the RGB modality. We introduced the 2D Detection Annotations Transmittable Aggregation(\textbf{2DDATA}), designing a data-specific branch, called \textbf{Local Object Branch}, which aims to deal with points in a certain bounding box, because of its easiness of acquiring 2D bounding box annotations. We demonstrate that our simple design can transmit bounding box prior information to the 3D encoder model, proving the feasibility of large multi-modality models fused with modality-specific data.

- **Summary**: In the analysis of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images, the operation of segmenting specific targets is necessary. Existing methods typically train on supervised datasets with limited samples (approximately a few hundred), which can lead to overfitting. To address this, the low-rank adaptation technique is adopted for foundation model fine-tuning and proposed corresponding prompt point generation strategies to process various segmentation tasks on OCTA datasets. This method is named SAM-OCTA and has been experimented on the publicly available OCTA-500 dataset. While achieving state-of-the-art performance metrics, this method accomplishes local vessel segmentation as well as effective artery-vein segmentation, which was not well-solved in previous works. The code is available at: https://github.com/ShellRedia/SAM-OCTA.

- **Summary**: We present a novel adversarial model for authentication systems that use gait patterns recorded by the inertial measurement unit (IMU) built into smartphones. The attack idea is inspired by and named after the concept of a dictionary attack on knowledge (PIN or password) based authentication systems. In particular, this work investigates whether it is possible to build a dictionary of IMUGait patterns and use it to launch an attack or find an imitator who can actively reproduce IMUGait patterns that match the target's IMUGait pattern. Nine physically and demographically diverse individuals walked at various levels of four predefined controllable and adaptable gait factors (speed, step length, step width, and thigh-lift), producing 178 unique IMUGait patterns. Each pattern attacked a wide variety of user authentication models. The deeper analysis of error rates (before and after the attack) challenges the belief that authentication systems based on IMUGait patterns are the most difficult to spoof; further research is needed on adversarial models and associated countermeasures.

- **Summary**: Existing NeRF models for satellite images suffer from slow speeds, mandatory solar information as input, and limitations in handling large satellite images. In response, we present SatensoRF, which significantly accelerates the entire process while employing fewer parameters for satellite imagery of large size. Besides, we observed that the prevalent assumption of Lambertian surfaces in neural radiance fields falls short for vegetative and aquatic elements. In contrast to the traditional hierarchical MLP-based scene representation, we have chosen a multiscale tensor decomposition approach for color, volume density, and auxiliary variables to model the lightfield with specular color. Additionally, to rectify inconsistencies in multi-date imagery, we incorporate total variation loss to restore the density tensor field and treat the problem as a denosing task.To validate our approach, we conducted assessments of SatensoRF using subsets from the spacenet multi-view dataset, which includes both multi-date and single-date multi-view RGB images. Our results clearly demonstrate that SatensoRF surpasses the state-of-the-art Sat-NeRF series in terms of novel view synthesis performance. Significantly, SatensoRF requires fewer parameters for training, resulting in faster training and inference speeds and reduced computational demands.

- **Summary**: Extreme head postures pose a common challenge across a spectrum of facial analysis tasks, including face detection, facial landmark detection (FLD), and head pose estimation (HPE). These tasks are interdependent, where accurate FLD relies on robust face detection, and HPE is intricately associated with these key points. This paper focuses on the integration of these tasks, particularly when addressing the complexities posed by large-angle face poses. The primary contribution of this study is the proposal of a real-time multi-task detection system capable of simultaneously performing joint detection of faces, facial landmarks, and head poses. This system builds upon the widely adopted YOLOv8 detection framework. It extends the original object detection head by incorporating additional landmark regression head, enabling efficient localization of crucial facial landmarks. Furthermore, we conduct optimizations and enhancements on various modules within the original YOLOv8 framework. To validate the effectiveness and real-time performance of our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on 300W-LP and AFLW2000-3D datasets. The results obtained verify the capability of our model to tackle large-angle face pose challenges while delivering real-time performance across these interconnected tasks.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained remarkable success, for which contrastive learning (CL) plays a key role. However, the recent development of new non-CL frameworks has achieved comparable or better performance with high improvement potential, prompting researchers to enhance these frameworks further. Assimilating CL into non-CL frameworks has been thought to be beneficial, but empirical evidence indicates no visible improvements. In view of that, this paper proposes a strategy of performing CL along the dimensional direction instead of along the batch direction as done in conventional contrastive learning, named Dimensional Contrastive Learning (DimCL). DimCL aims to enhance the feature diversity, and it can serve as a regularizer to prior SSL frameworks. DimCL has been found to be effective, and the hardness-aware property is identified as a critical reason for its success. Extensive experimental results reveal that assimilating DimCL into SSL frameworks leads to performance improvement by a non-trivial margin on various datasets and backbone architectures.

- **Summary**: Lidars and cameras are critical sensors that provide complementary information for 3D detection in autonomous driving. While most prevalent methods progressively downscale the 3D point clouds and camera images and then fuse the high-level features, the downscaled features inevitably lose low-level detailed information. In this paper, we propose Fine-Grained Lidar-Camera Fusion (FGFusion) that make full use of multi-scale features of image and point cloud and fuse them in a fine-grained way. First, we design a dual pathway hierarchy structure to extract both high-level semantic and low-level detailed features of the image. Second, an auxiliary network is introduced to guide point cloud features to better learn the fine-grained spatial information. Finally, we propose multi-scale fusion (MSF) to fuse the last N feature maps of image and point cloud. Extensive experiments on two popular autonomous driving benchmarks, i.e. KITTI and Waymo, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Pancreatic cancer is a lethal form of cancer that significantly contributes to cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is essential to improve patient prognosis and survival rates. Despite advances in medical imaging techniques, pancreatic cancer remains a challenging disease to detect. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most effective diagnostic tool for detecting pancreatic cancer. However, it requires expert interpretation of complex ultrasound images to complete a reliable patient scan. To obtain complete imaging of the pancreas, practitioners must learn to guide the endoscope into multiple "EUS stations" (anatomical locations), which provide different views of the pancreas. This is a difficult skill to learn, involving over 225 proctored procedures with the support of an experienced doctor. We build an AI-assisted tool that utilizes deep learning techniques to identify these stations of the stomach in real time during EUS procedures. This computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) will help train doctors more efficiently. Historically, the challenge faced in developing such a tool has been the amount of retrospective labeling required by trained clinicians. To solve this, we developed an open-source user-friendly labeling web app that streamlines the process of annotating stations during the EUS procedure with minimal effort from the clinicians. Our research shows that employing only 43 procedures with no hyperparameter fine-tuning obtained a balanced accuracy of 90%, comparable to the current state of the art. In addition, we employ Grad-CAM, a visualization technology that provides clinicians with interpretable and explainable visualizations.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal unsupervised domain adaptation (MM-UDA) for 3D semantic segmentation is a practical solution to embed semantic understanding in autonomous systems without expensive point-wise annotations. While previous MM-UDA methods can achieve overall improvement, they suffer from significant class-imbalanced performance, restricting their adoption in real applications. This imbalanced performance is mainly caused by: 1) self-training with imbalanced data and 2) the lack of pixel-wise 2D supervision signals. In this work, we propose Multi-modal Prior Aided (MoPA) domain adaptation to improve the performance of rare objects. Specifically, we develop Valid Ground-based Insertion (VGI) to rectify the imbalance supervision signals by inserting prior rare objects collected from the wild while avoiding introducing artificial artifacts that lead to trivial solutions. Meanwhile, our SAM consistency loss leverages the 2D prior semantic masks from SAM as pixel-wise supervision signals to encourage consistent predictions for each object in the semantic mask. The knowledge learned from modal-specific prior is then shared across modalities to achieve better rare object segmentation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a new approach for high-quality multi-exposure image fusion (MEF). We show that the fusion weights of an exposure can be encoded into a 1D lookup table (LUT), which takes pixel intensity value as input and produces fusion weight as output. We learn one 1D LUT for each exposure, then all the pixels from different exposures can query 1D LUT of that exposure independently for high-quality and efficient fusion. Specifically, to learn these 1D LUTs, we involve attention mechanism in various dimensions including frame, channel and spatial ones into the MEF task so as to bring us significant quality improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA). In addition, we collect a new MEF dataset consisting of 960 samples, 155 of which are manually tuned by professionals as ground-truth for evaluation. Our network is trained by this dataset in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of all the newly proposed components, and results show that our approach outperforms the SOTA in our and another representative dataset SICE, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, our 1D LUT approach takes less than 4ms to run a 4K image on a PC GPU. Given its high quality, efficiency and robustness, our method has been shipped into millions of Android mobiles across multiple brands world-wide.

- **Summary**: Recently, end-to-end object detectors have gained significant attention from the research community due to their outstanding performance. However, DETR typically relies on supervised pretraining of the backbone on ImageNet, which limits the practical application of DETR and the design of the backbone, affecting the model's potential generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a new training method called step-by-step training. Specifically, in the first stage, the one-to-many pre-trained YOLO detector is used to initialize the end-to-end detector. In the second stage, the backbone and encoder are consistent with the DETR-like model, but only the detector needs to be trained from scratch. Due to this training method, the object detector does not need the additional dataset (ImageNet) to train the backbone, which makes the design of the backbone more flexible and dramatically reduces the training cost of the detector, which is helpful for the practical application of the object detector. At the same time, compared with the DETR-like model, the step-by-step training method can achieve higher accuracy than the traditional training method of the DETR-like model. With the aid of this novel training method, we propose a brand-new end-to-end real-time object detection model called DEYOv3. DEYOv3-N achieves 41.1% on COCO val2017 and 270 FPS on T4 GPU, while DEYOv3-L achieves 51.3% AP and 102 FPS. Without the use of additional training data, DEYOv3 surpasses all existing real-time object detectors in terms of both speed and accuracy. It is worth noting that for models of N, S, and M scales, the training on the COCO dataset can be completed using a single 24GB RTX3090 GPU.

- **Summary**: In recent years, significant progress has been made in video instance segmentation (VIS), with many offline and online methods achieving state-of-the-art performance. While offline methods have the advantage of producing temporally consistent predictions, they are not suitable for real-time scenarios. Conversely, online methods are more practical, but maintaining temporal consistency remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel online method for video instance segmentation, called TCOVIS, which fully exploits the temporal information in a video clip. The core of our method consists of a global instance assignment strategy and a spatio-temporal enhancement module, which improve the temporal consistency of the features from two aspects. Specifically, we perform global optimal matching between the predictions and ground truth across the whole video clip, and supervise the model with the global optimal objective. We also capture the spatial feature and aggregate it with the semantic feature between frames, thus realizing the spatio-temporal enhancement. We evaluate our method on four widely adopted VIS benchmarks, namely YouTube-VIS 2019/2021/2022 and OVIS, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks without bells-and-whistles. For instance, on YouTube-VIS 2021, TCOVIS achieves 49.5 AP and 61.3 AP with ResNet-50 and Swin-L backbones, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/jun-long-li/TCOVIS.

- **Summary**: Recently, linear computed tomography (LCT) systems have actively attracted attention. To weaken projection truncation and image the region of interest (ROI) for LCT, the backprojection filtration (BPF) algorithm is an effective solution. However, in BPF for LCT, it is difficult to achieve stable interior reconstruction, and for differentiated backprojection (DBP) images of LCT, multiple rotation-finite inversion of Hilbert transform (Hilbert filtering)-inverse rotation operations will blur the image. To satisfy multiple reconstruction scenarios for LCT, including interior ROI, complete object, and exterior region beyond field-of-view (FOV), and avoid the rotation operations of Hilbert filtering, we propose two types of reconstruction architectures. The first overlays multiple DBP images to obtain a complete DBP image, then uses a network to learn the overlying Hilbert filtering function, referred to as the Overlay-Single Network (OSNet). The second uses multiple networks to train different directional Hilbert filtering models for DBP images of multiple linear scannings, respectively, and then overlays the reconstructed results, i.e., Multiple Networks Overlaying (MNetO). In two architectures, we introduce a Swin Transformer (ST) block to the generator of pix2pixGAN to extract both local and global features from DBP images at the same time. We investigate two architectures from different networks, FOV sizes, pixel sizes, number of projections, geometric magnification, and processing time. Experimental results show that two architectures can both recover images. OSNet outperforms BPF in various scenarios. For the different networks, ST-pix2pixGAN is superior to pix2pixGAN and CycleGAN. MNetO exhibits a few artifacts due to the differences among the multiple models, but any one of its models is suitable for imaging the exterior edge in a certain direction.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning, which is a powerful technique for learning image-level representations from unlabeled data, leads a promising direction to dealing with the dilemma between large-scale pre-training and limited labeled data. However, most existing contrastive learning strategies are designed mainly for downstream tasks of natural images, therefore they are sub-optimal and even worse than learning from scratch when directly applied to medical images whose downstream tasks are usually segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric contrastive learning framework named JCL for medical image segmentation with self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, (1) A novel asymmetric contrastive learning strategy is proposed to pre-train both encoder and decoder simultaneously in one-stage to provide better initialization for segmentation models. (2) A multi-level contrastive loss is designed to take the correspondence among feature-level, image-level and pixel-level projections, respectively into account to make sure multi-level representations can be learned by the encoder and decoder during pre-training. (3) Experiments on multiple medical image datasets indicate our JCL framework outperforms existing SOTA contrastive learning strategies.

- **Summary**: Video memorability is a measure of how likely a particular video is to be remembered by a viewer when that viewer has no emotional connection with the video content. It is an important characteristic as videos that are more memorable are more likely to be shared, viewed, and discussed. This paper presents results of a series of experiments where we improved the memorability of a video by selectively cropping frames based on image saliency. We present results of a basic fixed cropping as well as the results from dynamic cropping where both the size of the crop and the position of the crop within the frame, move as the video is played and saliency is tracked. Our results indicate that especially for videos of low initial memorability, the memorability score can be improved.

- **Summary**: Over the last decades, ample achievements have been made on Structure from motion (SfM). However, the vast majority of them basically work in an offline manner, i.e., images are firstly captured and then fed together into a SfM pipeline for obtaining poses and sparse point cloud. In this work, on the contrary, we present an on-the-fly SfM: running online SfM while image capturing, the newly taken On-the-Fly image is online estimated with the corresponding pose and points, i.e., what you capture is what you get. Specifically, our approach firstly employs a vocabulary tree that is unsupervised trained using learning-based global features for fast image retrieval of newly fly-in image. Then, a robust feature matching mechanism with least squares (LSM) is presented to improve image registration performance. Finally, via investigating the influence of newly fly-in image's connected neighboring images, an efficient hierarchical weighted local bundle adjustment (BA) is used for optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that on-the-fly SfM can meet the goal of robustly registering the images while capturing in an online way.

- **Summary**: Event cameras, also known as neuromorphic cameras, are an emerging technology that offer advantages over traditional shutter and frame-based cameras, including high temporal resolution, low power consumption, and selective data acquisition. In this study, we propose to harnesses the capabilities of event-based cameras to capture subtle changes in the surface of the skin caused by the pulsatile flow of blood in the wrist region. We investigate whether an event camera could be used for continuous noninvasive monitoring of heart rate (HR). Event camera video data from 25 participants, comprising varying age groups and skin colours, was collected and analysed. Ground-truth HR measurements obtained using conventional methods were used to evaluate of the accuracy of automatic detection of HR from event camera data. Our experimental results and comparison to the performance of other non-contact HR measurement methods demonstrate the feasibility of using event cameras for pulse detection. We also acknowledge the challenges and limitations of our method, such as light-induced flickering and the sub-conscious but naturally-occurring tremors of an individual during data capture.

- **Summary**: Supervised training of deep learning models for medical imaging applications requires a significant amount of labeled data. This is posing a challenge as the images are required to be annotated by medical professionals. To address this limitation, we introduce the Adaptive Locked Agnostic Network (ALAN), a concept involving self-supervised visual feature extraction using a large backbone model to produce anatomically robust semantic self-segmentation. In the ALAN methodology, this self-supervised training occurs only once on a large and diverse dataset. Due to the intuitive interpretability of the segmentation, downstream models tailored for specific tasks can be easily designed using white-box models with few parameters. This, in turn, opens up the possibility of communicating the inner workings of a model with domain experts and introducing prior knowledge into it. It also means that the downstream models become less data-hungry compared to fully supervised approaches. These characteristics make ALAN particularly well-suited for resource-scarce scenarios, such as costly clinical trials and rare diseases. In this paper, we apply the ALAN approach to three publicly available echocardiography datasets: EchoNet-Dynamic, CAMUS, and TMED-2. Our findings demonstrate that the self-supervised backbone model robustly identifies anatomical subregions of the heart in an apical four-chamber view. Building upon this, we design two downstream models, one for segmenting a target anatomical region, and a second for echocardiogram view classification.

- **Summary**: Learned video compression (LVC) has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. Similar as the traditional video coding, LVC inherits motion estimation/compensation, residual coding and other modules, all of which are implemented with neural networks (NNs). However, within the framework of NNs and its training mechanism using gradient backpropagation, most existing works often struggle to consistently generate stable motion information, which is in the form of geometric features, from the input color features. Moreover, the modules such as the inter-prediction and residual coding are independent from each other, making it inefficient to fully reduce the spatial-temporal redundancy. To address the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Transformer based Video Compression (STT-VC) framework. It contains a Relaxed Deformable Transformer (RDT) with Uformer based offsets estimation for motion estimation and compensation, a Multi-Granularity Prediction (MGP) module based on multi-reference frames for prediction refinement, and a Spatial Feature Distribution prior based Transformer (SFD-T) for efficient temporal-spatial joint residual compression. Specifically, RDT is developed to stably estimate the motion information between frames by thoroughly investigating the relationship between the similarity based geometric motion feature extraction and self-attention. MGP is designed to fuse the multi-reference frame information by effectively exploring the coarse-grained prediction feature generated with the coded motion information. SFD-T is to compress the residual information by jointly exploring the spatial feature distributions in both residual and temporal prediction to further reduce the spatial-temporal redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the best result with 13.5% BD-Rate saving over VTM.

- **Summary**: Text-guided image generation aimed to generate desired images conditioned on given texts, while text-guided image manipulation refers to semantically edit parts of a given image based on specified texts. For these two similar tasks, the key point is to ensure image fidelity as well as semantic consistency. Many previous approaches require complex multi-stage generation and adversarial training, while struggling to provide a unified framework for both tasks. In this work, we propose TextCLIP, a unified framework for text-guided image generation and manipulation without adversarial training. The proposed method accepts input from images or random noise corresponding to these two different tasks, and under the condition of the specific texts, a carefully designed mapping network that exploits the powerful generative capabilities of StyleGAN and the text image representation capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) generates images of up to $1024\times1024$ resolution that can currently be generated. Extensive experiments on the Multi-modal CelebA-HQ dataset have demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, both on text-guided generation tasks and manipulation tasks.

- **Summary**: This paper provides an insight into the possibility of scene recognition from a video sequence with a small set of repeated shooting locations (such as in television series) using artificial neural networks. The basic idea of the presented approach is to select a set of frames from each scene, transform them by a pre-trained singleimage pre-processing convolutional network, and classify the scene location with subsequent layers of the neural network. The considered networks have been tested and compared on a dataset obtained from The Big Bang Theory television series. We have investigated different neural network layers to combine individual frames, particularly AveragePooling, MaxPooling, Product, Flatten, LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM layers. We have observed that only some of the approaches are suitable for the task at hand.

- **Summary**: In open-world semi-supervised learning, a machine learning model is tasked with uncovering novel categories from unlabeled data while maintaining performance on seen categories from labeled data. The central challenge is the substantial learning gap between seen and novel categories, as the model learns the former faster due to accurate supervisory information. To address this, we introduce 1) an adaptive margin loss based on estimated class distribution, which encourages a large negative margin for samples in seen classes, to synchronize learning paces, and 2) pseudo-label contrastive clustering, which pulls together samples which are likely from the same class in the output space, to enhance novel class discovery. Our extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that existing models still hinder novel class learning, whereas our approach strikingly balances both seen and novel classes, achieving a remarkable 3% average accuracy increase on the ImageNet dataset compared to the prior state-of-the-art. Additionally, we find that fine-tuning the self-supervised pre-trained backbone significantly boosts performance over the default in prior literature. After our paper is accepted, we will release the code.

- **Summary**: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting the object in video referred by a natural language query. Existing methods mainly rely on sophisticated pipelines to tackle such cross-modal task, and do not explicitly model the object-level spatial context which plays an important role in locating the referred object. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end RVOS framework completely built upon transformers, termed \textit{Fully Transformer-Equipped Architecture} (FTEA), which treats the RVOS task as a mask sequence learning problem and regards all the objects in video as candidate objects. Given a video clip with a text query, the visual-textual features are yielded by encoder, while the corresponding pixel-level and word-level features are aligned in terms of semantic similarity. To capture the object-level spatial context, we have developed the Stacked Transformer, which individually characterizes the visual appearance of each candidate object, whose feature map is decoded to the binary mask sequence in order directly. Finally, the model finds the best matching between mask sequence and text query. In addition, to diversify the generated masks for candidate objects, we impose a diversity loss on the model for capturing more accurate mask of the referred object. Empirical studies have shown the superiority of the proposed method on three benchmarks, e.g., FETA achieves 45.1% and 38.7% in terms of mAP on A2D Sentences (3782 videos) and J-HMDB Sentences (928 videos), respectively; it achieves 56.6% in terms of $\mathcal{J\&F}$ on Ref-YouTube-VOS (3975 videos and 7451 objects). Particularly, compared to the best candidate method, it has a gain of 2.1% and 3.2% in terms of P$@$0.5 on the former two, respectively, while it has a gain of 2.9% in terms of $\mathcal{J}$ on the latter one.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised representation learning has seen remarkable progress in the last few years, with some of the recent methods being able to learn useful image representations without labels. These methods are trained using backpropagation, the de facto standard. Recently, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the forward-forward algorithm as an alternative training method. It utilizes two forward passes and a separate loss function for each layer to train the network without backpropagation.   In this study, for the first time, we study the performance of forward-forward vs. backpropagation for self-supervised representation learning and provide insights into the learned representation spaces. Our benchmark employs four standard datasets, namely MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10, and three commonly used self-supervised representation learning techniques, namely rotation, flip and jigsaw.   Our main finding is that while the forward-forward algorithm performs comparably to backpropagation during (self-)supervised training, the transfer performance is significantly lagging behind in all the studied settings. This may be caused by a combination of factors, including having a loss function for each layer and the way the supervised training is realized in the forward-forward paradigm. In comparison to backpropagation, the forward-forward algorithm focuses more on the boundaries and drops part of the information unnecessary for making decisions which harms the representation learning goal. Further investigation and research are necessary to stabilize the forward-forward strategy for self-supervised learning, to work beyond the datasets and configurations demonstrated by Geoffrey Hinton.

- **Summary**: We present Ego3DPose, a highly accurate binocular egocentric 3D pose reconstruction system. The binocular egocentric setup offers practicality and usefulness in various applications, however, it remains largely under-explored. It has been suffering from low pose estimation accuracy due to viewing distortion, severe self-occlusion, and limited field-of-view of the joints in egocentric 2D images. Here, we notice that two important 3D cues, stereo correspondences, and perspective, contained in the egocentric binocular input are neglected. Current methods heavily rely on 2D image features, implicitly learning 3D information, which introduces biases towards commonly observed motions and leads to low overall accuracy. We observe that they not only fail in challenging occlusion cases but also in estimating visible joint positions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel approaches. First, we design a two-path network architecture with a path that estimates pose per limb independently with its binocular heatmaps. Without full-body information provided, it alleviates bias toward trained full-body distribution. Second, we leverage the egocentric view of body limbs, which exhibits strong perspective variance (e.g., a significantly large-size hand when it is close to the camera). We propose a new perspective-aware representation using trigonometry, enabling the network to estimate the 3D orientation of limbs. Finally, we develop an end-to-end pose reconstruction network that synergizes both techniques. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Ego3DPose outperforms state-of-the-art models by a pose estimation error (i.e., MPJPE) reduction of 23.1% in the UnrealEgo dataset. Our qualitative results highlight the superiority of our approach across a range of scenarios and challenges.

- **Summary**: We present NeuralLabeling, a labeling approach and toolset for annotating a scene using either bounding boxes or meshes and generating segmentation masks, affordance maps, 2D bounding boxes, 3D bounding boxes, 6DOF object poses, depth maps and object meshes. NeuralLabeling uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as renderer, allowing labeling to be performed using 3D spatial tools while incorporating geometric clues such as occlusions, relying only on images captured from multiple viewpoints as input. To demonstrate the applicability of NeuralLabeling to a practical problem in robotics, we added ground truth depth maps to 30000 frames of transparent object RGB and noisy depth maps of glasses placed in a dishwasher captured using an RGBD sensor, yielding the Dishwasher30k dataset. We show that training a simple deep neural network with supervision using the annotated depth maps yields a higher reconstruction performance than training with the previously applied weakly supervised approach.

- **Summary**: As robotic systems increasingly encounter complex and unconstrained real-world scenarios, there is a demand to recognize diverse objects. The state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation methods rely on object-specific training and therefore do not generalize to unseen objects. Recent novel object pose estimation methods are solving this issue using task-specific fine-tuned CNNs for deep template matching. This adaptation for pose estimation still requires expensive data rendering and training procedures. MegaPose for example is trained on a dataset consisting of two million images showing 20,000 different objects to reach such generalization capabilities. To overcome this shortcoming we introduce ZS6D, for zero-shot novel object 6D pose estimation. Visual descriptors, extracted using pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT), are used for matching rendered templates against query images of objects and for establishing local correspondences. These local correspondences enable deriving geometric correspondences and are used for estimating the object's 6D pose with RANSAC-based PnP. This approach showcases that the image descriptors extracted by pre-trained ViTs are well-suited to achieve a notable improvement over two state-of-the-art novel object 6D pose estimation methods, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments are performed on LMO, YCBV, and TLESS. In comparison to one of the two methods we improve the Average Recall on all three datasets and compared to the second method we improve on two datasets.

- **Summary**: Vision-based mobile robot navigation systems in arable fields are mostly limited to in-row navigation. The process of switching from one crop row to the next in such systems is often aided by GNSS sensors or multiple camera setups. This paper presents a novel vision-based crop row-switching algorithm that enables a mobile robot to navigate an entire field of arable crops using a single front-mounted camera. The proposed row-switching manoeuvre uses deep learning-based RGB image segmentation and depth data to detect the end of the crop row, and re-entry point to the next crop row which would be used in a multi-state row switching pipeline. Each state of this pipeline use visual feedback or wheel odometry of the robot to successfully navigate towards the next crop row. The proposed crop row navigation pipeline was tested in a real sugar beet field containing crop rows with discontinuities, varying light levels, shadows and irregular headland surfaces. The robot could successfully exit from one crop row and re-enter the next crop row using the proposed pipeline with absolute median errors averaging at 19.25 cm and 6.77{\deg} for linear and rotational steps of the proposed manoeuvre.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing a surface from a point cloud is an underdetermined problem. We use a neural network to study and quantify this reconstruction uncertainty under a Poisson smoothness prior. Our algorithm addresses the main limitations of existing work and can be fully integrated into the 3D scanning pipeline, from obtaining an initial reconstruction to deciding on the next best sensor position and updating the reconstruction upon capturing more data.

- **Summary**: Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of infant death in the world. When identified early, it is possible to alter the prognosis of the patient, one could use imaging exams to help in the diagnostic confirmation. Performing and interpreting the exams as soon as possible is vital for a good treatment, with the most common exam for this pathology being chest X-ray. The objective of this study was to develop a software that identify the presence or absence of pneumonia in chest radiographs. The software was developed as a computational model based on machine learning using transfer learning technique. For the training process, images were collected from a database available online with children's chest X-rays images taken at a hospital in China. After training, the model was then exposed to new images, achieving relevant results on identifying such pathology, reaching 98% sensitivity and 97.3% specificity for the sample used for testing. It can be concluded that it is possible to develop a software that identifies pneumonia in chest X-ray images.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised representation learning for human action recognition has developed rapidly in recent years. Most of the existing works are based on skeleton data while using a multi-modality setup. These works overlooked the differences in performance among modalities, which led to the propagation of erroneous knowledge between modalities while only three fundamental modalities, i.e., joints, bones, and motions are used, hence no additional modalities are explored.   In this work, we first propose an Implicit Knowledge Exchange Module (IKEM) which alleviates the propagation of erroneous knowledge between low-performance modalities. Then, we further propose three new modalities to enrich the complementary information between modalities. Finally, to maintain efficiency when introducing new modalities, we propose a novel teacher-student framework to distill the knowledge from the secondary modalities into the mandatory modalities considering the relationship constrained by anchors, positives, and negatives, named relational cross-modality knowledge distillation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, unlocking the efficient use of skeleton-based multi-modality data.

- **Summary**: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection is a critical task and has received increasing attentions in the remote sensing community. However, existing SAR change detection methods are mainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with limited consideration of global attention mechanism. In this letter, we explore Transformer-like architecture for SAR change detection to incorporate global attention. To this end, we propose a convolution and attention mixer (CAMixer). First, to compensate the inductive bias for Transformer, we combine self-attention with shift convolution in a parallel way. The parallel design effectively captures the global semantic information via the self-attention and performs local feature extraction through shift convolution simultaneously. Second, we adopt a gating mechanism in the feed-forward network to enhance the non-linear feature transformation. The gating mechanism is formulated as the element-wise multiplication of two parallel linear layers. Important features can be highlighted, leading to high-quality representations against speckle noise. Extensive experiments conducted on three SAR datasets verify the superior performance of the proposed CAMixer. The source codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/summitgao/CAMixer .

- **Summary**: In the film industry, movie posters have been an essential part of advertising and marketing for many decades, and continue to play a vital role even today in the form of digital posters through online, social media and OTT platforms. Typically, movie posters can effectively promote and communicate the essence of a film, such as its genre, visual style/ tone, vibe and storyline cue/ theme, which are essential to attract potential viewers. Identifying the genres of a movie often has significant practical applications in recommending the film to target audiences. Previous studies on movie genre identification are limited to subtitles, plot synopses, and movie scenes that are mostly accessible after the movie release. Posters usually contain pre-release implicit information to generate mass interest. In this paper, we work for automated multi-label genre identification only from movie poster images, without any aid of additional textual/meta-data information about movies, which is one of the earliest attempts of its kind. Here, we present a deep transformer network with a probabilistic module to identify the movie genres exclusively from the poster. For experimental analysis, we procured 13882 number of posters of 13 genres from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), where our model performances were encouraging and even outperformed some major contemporary architectures.

- **Summary**: Building segmentation is essential in infrastructure development, population management, and geological observations. This article targets shallow models due to their interpretable nature to assess the presence of LiDAR data for supervised segmentation. The benchmark data used in this article are published in NORA MapAI competition for deep learning model. Shallow models are compared with deep learning models based on Intersection over Union (IoU) and Boundary Intersection over Union (BIoU). In the proposed work, boundary masks from the original mask are generated to improve the BIoU score, which relates to building shapes' borderline. The influence of LiDAR data is tested by training the model with only aerial images in task 1 and a combination of aerial and LiDAR data in task 2 and then compared. shallow models outperform deep learning models in IoU by 8% using aerial images (task 1) only and 2% in combined aerial images and LiDAR data (task 2). In contrast, deep learning models show better performance on BIoU scores. Boundary masks improve BIoU scores by 4% in both tasks. Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) performs better than RF and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

- **Summary**: To integrate action recognition methods into autonomous robotic systems, it is crucial to consider adverse situations involving target occlusions. Such a scenario, despite its practical relevance, is rarely addressed in existing self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods. To empower robots with the capacity to address occlusion, we propose a simple and effective method. We first pre-train using occluded skeleton sequences, then use k-means clustering (KMeans) on sequence embeddings to group semantically similar samples. Next, we employ K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) to fill in missing skeleton data based on the closest sample neighbors. Imputing incomplete skeleton sequences to create relatively complete sequences as input provides significant benefits to existing skeleton-based self-supervised models. Meanwhile, building on the state-of-the-art Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL), we introduce an Occluded Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (OPSTL) framework. This enhancement utilizes Adaptive Spatial Masking (ASM) for better use of high-quality, intact skeletons. The effectiveness of our imputation methods is verified on the challenging occluded versions of the NTURGB+D 60 and NTURGB+D 120. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cyfml/OPSTL.

- **Summary**: Conditional GANs are frequently used for manipulating the attributes of face images, such as expression, hairstyle, pose, or age. Even though the state-of-the-art models successfully modify the requested attributes, they simultaneously modify other important characteristics of the image, such as a person's identity. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem by introducing PluGeN4Faces, a plugin to StyleGAN, which explicitly disentangles face attributes from a person's identity. Our key idea is to perform training on images retrieved from movie frames, where a given person appears in various poses and with different attributes. By applying a type of contrastive loss, we encourage the model to group images of the same person in similar regions of latent space. Our experiments demonstrate that the modifications of face attributes performed by PluGeN4Faces are significantly less invasive on the remaining characteristics of the image than in the existing state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: The field of visual object tracking is dominated by methods that combine simple tracking algorithms and ad hoc schemes. Probabilistic tracking algorithms, which are leading in other fields, are surprisingly absent from the leaderboards. We found that accounting for distance in target kinematics, exploiting detector confidence and modelling non-uniform clutter characteristics is critical for a probabilistic tracker to work in visual tracking. Previous probabilistic methods fail to address most or all these aspects, which we believe is why they fall so far behind current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (there are no probabilistic trackers in the MOT17 top 100). To rekindle progress among probabilistic approaches, we propose a set of pragmatic models addressing these challenges, and demonstrate how they can be incorporated into a probabilistic framework. We present BASE (Bayesian Approximation Single-hypothesis Estimator), a simple, performant and easily extendible visual tracker, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MOT17 and MOT20, without using Re-Id.

- **Summary**: For improving image composition and aesthetic quality, most existing methods modulate the captured images by striking out redundant content near the image borders. However, such image cropping methods are limited in the range of image views. Some methods have been suggested to extrapolate the images and predict cropping boxes from the extrapolated image. Nonetheless, the synthesized extrapolated regions may be included in the cropped image, making the image composition result not real and potentially with degraded image quality. In this paper, we circumvent this issue by presenting a joint framework for both unbounded recommendation of camera view and image composition (i.e., UNIC). In this way, the cropped image is a sub-image of the image acquired by the predicted camera view, and thus can be guaranteed to be real and consistent in image quality. Specifically, our framework takes the current camera preview frame as input and provides a recommendation for view adjustment, which contains operations unlimited by the image borders, such as zooming in or out and camera movement. To improve the prediction accuracy of view adjustment prediction, we further extend the field of view by feature extrapolation. After one or several times of view adjustments, our method converges and results in both a camera view and a bounding box showing the image composition recommendation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the datasets constructed upon existing image cropping datasets, showing the effectiveness of our UNIC in unbounded recommendation of camera view and image composition. The source code, dataset, and pretrained models is available at https://github.com/liuxiaoyu1104/UNIC.

- **Summary**: Existing time-resolved non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging methods reconstruct hidden scenes by inverting the optical paths of indirect illumination measured at visible relay surfaces. These methods are prone to reconstruction artifacts due to inversion ambiguities and capture noise, which are typically mitigated through the manual selection of filtering functions and parameters. We introduce a fully-differentiable end-to-end NLOS inverse rendering pipeline that self-calibrates the imaging parameters during the reconstruction of hidden scenes, using as input only the measured illumination while working both in the time and frequency domains. Our pipeline extracts a geometric representation of the hidden scene from NLOS volumetric intensities and estimates the time-resolved illumination at the relay wall produced by such geometric information using differentiable transient rendering. We then use gradient descent to optimize imaging parameters by minimizing the error between our simulated time-resolved illumination and the measured illumination. Our end-to-end differentiable pipeline couples diffraction-based volumetric NLOS reconstruction with path-space light transport and a simple ray marching technique to extract detailed, dense sets of surface points and normals of hidden scenes. We demonstrate the robustness of our method to consistently reconstruct geometry and albedo, even under significant noise levels.

- **Summary**: Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown great potential in medical image analysis, improving the generalizability of the learned features and the performance in individual tasks. However, most of the work on MTL focuses on either architecture design or gradient manipulation, while in both scenarios, features are learned in a competitive manner. In this work, we propose to formulate MTL as a multi/bi-level optimization problem, and therefore force features to learn from each task in a cooperative approach. Specifically, we update the sub-model for each task alternatively taking advantage of the learned sub-models of the other tasks. To alleviate the negative transfer problem during the optimization, we search for flat minima for the current objective function with regard to features from other tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we validate our method on three publicly available datasets. The proposed method shows the advantage of cooperative learning, and yields promising results when compared with the state-of-the-art MTL approaches. The code will be available online.

- **Summary**: Deep learning's immense capabilities are often constrained by the complexity of its models, leading to an increasing demand for effective sparsification techniques. Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial approach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally efficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning applications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural networks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an approximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational inference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is exceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard deep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of Bayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of model weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a post-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior estimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our comparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate of the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference (SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We illustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep learning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks such as Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixers.

- **Summary**: Encoder-decoder networks become a popular choice for various medical image segmentation tasks. When they are trained with a standard loss function, these networks are not explicitly enforced to preserve the shape integrity of an object in an image. However, this ability of the network is important to obtain more accurate results, especially when there is a low-contrast difference between the object and its surroundings. In response to this issue, this work introduces a new shape-aware loss function, which we name FourierLoss. This loss function relies on quantifying the shape dissimilarity between the ground truth and the predicted segmentation maps through the Fourier descriptors calculated on their objects, and penalizing this dissimilarity in network training. Different than the previous studies, FourierLoss offers an adaptive loss function with trainable hyperparameters that control the importance of the level of the shape details that the network is enforced to learn in the training process. This control is achieved by the proposed adaptive loss update mechanism, which end-to-end learns the hyperparameters simultaneously with the network weights by backpropagation. As a result of using this mechanism, the network can dynamically change its attention from learning the general outline of an object to learning the details of its contour points, or vice versa, in different training epochs. Working on 2879 computed tomography images of 93 subjects, our experiments revealed that the proposed adaptive shape-aware loss function led to statistically significantly better results for liver segmentation, compared to its counterparts.

- **Summary**: Tumor segmentation in medical imaging is crucial and relies on precise delineation. Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron-Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) is widely used in clinical practice to detect metabolically active tumors. However, FDG-PET scans may misinterpret irregular glucose consumption in healthy or benign tissues as cancer. Combining PET with Computed Tomography (CT) can enhance tumor segmentation by integrating metabolic and anatomic information. FDG-PET/CT scans are pivotal for cancer staging and reassessment, utilizing radiolabeled fluorodeoxyglucose to highlight metabolically active regions. Accurately distinguishing tumor-specific uptake from physiological uptake in normal tissues is a challenging aspect of precise tumor segmentation. The AutoPET challenge addresses this by providing a dataset of 1014 FDG-PET/CT studies, encouraging advancements in accurate tumor segmentation and analysis within the FDG-PET/CT domain.

- **Summary**: In recent years face recognition systems have been brought to the mainstream due to development in hardware and software. Consistent efforts are being made to make them better and more secure. This has also brought developments in 3D face recognition systems at a rapid pace. These 3DFR systems are expected to overcome certain vulnerabilities of 2DFR systems. One such problem that the domain of 2DFR systems face is face image morphing. A substantial amount of research is being done for generation of high quality face morphs along with detection of attacks from these morphs. Comparatively the understanding of vulnerability of 3DFR systems against 3D face morphs is less. But at the same time an expectation is set from 3DFR systems to be more robust against such attacks. This paper attempts to research and gain more information on this matter. The paper describes a couple of methods that can be used to generate 3D face morphs. The face morphs that are generated using this method are then compared to the contributing faces to obtain similarity scores. The highest MMPMR is obtained around 40% with RMMR of 41.76% when 3DFRS are attacked with look-a-like morphs.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of 3D object detection systems for self-driving cars has significantly improved accuracy. However, these systems struggle to generalize across diverse driving environments, which can lead to safety-critical failures in detecting traffic participants. To address this, we propose a method that utilizes unlabeled repeated traversals of multiple locations to adapt object detectors to new driving environments. By incorporating statistics computed from repeated LiDAR scans, we guide the adaptation process effectively. Our approach enhances LiDAR-based detection models using spatial quantized historical features and introduces a lightweight regression head to leverage the statistics for feature regularization. Additionally, we leverage the statistics for a novel self-training process to stabilize the training. The framework is detector model-agnostic and experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements, achieving up to a 20-point performance gain, especially in detecting pedestrians and distant objects.

- **Summary**: We introduce SANPO, a large-scale egocentric video dataset focused on dense prediction in outdoor environments. It contains stereo video sessions collected across diverse outdoor environments, as well as rendered synthetic video sessions. (Synthetic data was provided by Parallel Domain.) All sessions have (dense) depth and odometry labels. All synthetic sessions and a subset of real sessions have temporally consistent dense panoptic segmentation labels. To our knowledge, this is the first human egocentric video dataset with both large scale dense panoptic segmentation and depth annotations. In addition to the dataset we also provide zero-shot baselines and SANPO benchmarks for future research. We hope that the challenging nature of SANPO will help advance the state-of-the-art in video segmentation, depth estimation, multi-task visual modeling, and synthetic-to-real domain adaptation, while enabling human navigation systems.

- **Summary**: Gloss-free Sign Language Production (SLP) offers a direct translation of spoken language sentences into sign language, bypassing the need for gloss intermediaries. This paper presents the Sign language Vector Quantization Network, a novel approach to SLP that leverages Vector Quantization to derive discrete representations from sign pose sequences. Our method, rooted in both manual and non-manual elements of signing, supports advanced decoding methods and integrates latent-level alignment for enhanced linguistic coherence. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate superior performance of our method over prior SLP methods and highlight the reliability of Back-Translation and Fr\'echet Gesture Distance as evaluation metrics.



### ORTexME: Occlusion-Robust Human Shape and Pose via Temporal Average Texture and Mesh Encoding

- **Summary**: In 3D human shape and pose estimation from a monocular video, models trained with limited labeled data cannot generalize well to videos with occlusion, which is common in the wild videos. The recent human neural rendering approaches focusing on novel view synthesis initialized by the off-the-shelf human shape and pose methods have the potential to correct the initial human shape. However, the existing methods have some drawbacks such as, erroneous in handling occlusion, sensitive to inaccurate human segmentation, and ineffective loss computation due to the non-regularized opacity field. To address these problems, we introduce ORTexME, an occlusion-robust temporal method that utilizes temporal information from the input video to better regularize the occluded body parts. While our ORTexME is based on NeRF, to determine the reliable regions for the NeRF ray sampling, we utilize our novel average texture learning approach to learn the average appearance of a person, and to infer a mask based on the average texture. In addition, to guide the opacity-field updates in NeRF to suppress blur and noise, we propose the use of human body mesh. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves significant improvement on the challenging multi-person 3DPW dataset, where our method achieves 1.8 P-MPJPE error reduction. The SOTA rendering-based methods fail and enlarge the error up to 5.6 on the same dataset.

- **Summary**: Object rearrangement is pivotal in robotic-environment interactions, representing a significant capability in embodied AI. In this paper, we present SG-Bot, a novel rearrangement framework that utilizes a coarse-to-fine scheme with a scene graph as the scene representation. Unlike previous methods that rely on either known goal priors or zero-shot large models, SG-Bot exemplifies lightweight, real-time, and user-controllable characteristics, seamlessly blending the consideration of commonsense knowledge with automatic generation capabilities. SG-Bot employs a three-fold procedure--observation, imagination, and execution--to adeptly address the task. Initially, objects are discerned and extracted from a cluttered scene during the observation. These objects are first coarsely organized and depicted within a scene graph, guided by either commonsense or user-defined criteria. Then, this scene graph subsequently informs a generative model, which forms a fine-grained goal scene considering the shape information from the initial scene and object semantics. Finally, for execution, the initial and envisioned goal scenes are matched to formulate robotic action policies. Experimental results demonstrate that SG-Bot outperforms competitors by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Brain tumors are collections of abnormal cells that can develop into masses or clusters. Because they have the potential to infiltrate other tissues, they pose a risk to the patient. The main imaging technique used, MRI, may be able to identify a brain tumor with accuracy. The fast development of Deep Learning methods for use in computer vision applications has been facilitated by a vast amount of training data and improvements in model construction that offer better approximations in a supervised setting. The need for these approaches has been the main driver of this expansion. Deep learning methods have shown promise in improving the precision of brain tumor detection and classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study on the use of deep learning techniques, especially ResNet50, for brain tumor identification is presented in this abstract. As a result, this study investigates the possibility of automating the detection procedure using deep learning techniques. In this study, I utilized five transfer learning models which are VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, ResNet50 and YOLO V4 where ResNet50 provide the best or highest accuracy 99.54%. The goal of the study is to guide researchers and medical professionals toward powerful brain tumor detecting systems by employing deep learning approaches by way of this evaluation and analysis.

- **Summary**: Photovoltaic (PV) energy is crucial for the decarbonization of energy systems. Due to the lack of centralized data, remote sensing of rooftop PV installations is the best option to monitor the evolution of the rooftop PV installed fleet at a regional scale. However, current techniques lack reliability and are notably sensitive to shifts in the acquisition conditions. To overcome this, we leverage the wavelet scale attribution method (WCAM), which decomposes a model's prediction in the space-scale domain. The WCAM enables us to assess on which scales the representation of a PV model rests and provides insights to derive methods that improve the robustness to acquisition conditions, thus increasing trust in deep learning systems to encourage their use for the safe integration of clean energy in electric systems.

- **Summary**: Biomedical image datasets can be imbalanced due to the rarity of targeted diseases. Generative Adversarial Networks play a key role in addressing this imbalance by enabling the generation of synthetic images to augment datasets. It is important to generate synthetic images that incorporate a diverse range of features to accurately represent the distribution of features present in the training imagery. Furthermore, the absence of diverse features in synthetic images can degrade the performance of machine learning classifiers. The mode collapse problem impacts Generative Adversarial Networks' capacity to generate diversified images. Mode collapse comes in two varieties: intra-class and inter-class. In this paper, both varieties of the mode collapse problem are investigated, and their subsequent impact on the diversity of synthetic X-ray images is evaluated. This work contributes an empirical demonstration of the benefits of integrating the adaptive input-image normalization with the Deep Convolutional GAN and Auxiliary Classifier GAN to alleviate the mode collapse problems. Synthetically generated images are utilized for data augmentation and training a Vision Transformer model. The classification performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, recall, and precision scores. Results demonstrate that the DCGAN and the ACGAN with adaptive input-image normalization outperform the DCGAN and ACGAN with un-normalized X-ray images as evidenced by the superior diversity scores and classification scores.

- **Summary**: Human drivers can seamlessly adapt their driving decisions across geographical locations with diverse conditions and rules of the road, e.g., left vs. right-hand traffic. In contrast, existing models for autonomous driving have been thus far only deployed within restricted operational domains, i.e., without accounting for varying driving behaviors across locations or model scalability. In this work, we propose AnyD, a single geographically-aware conditional imitation learning (CIL) model that can efficiently learn from heterogeneous and globally distributed data with dynamic environmental, traffic, and social characteristics. Our key insight is to introduce a high-capacity geo-location-based channel attention mechanism that effectively adapts to local nuances while also flexibly modeling similarities among regions in a data-driven manner. By optimizing a contrastive imitation objective, our proposed approach can efficiently scale across inherently imbalanced data distributions and location-dependent events. We demonstrate the benefits of our AnyD agent across multiple datasets, cities, and scalable deployment paradigms, i.e., centralized, semi-supervised, and distributed agent training. Specifically, AnyD outperforms CIL baselines by over 14% in open-loop evaluation and 30% in closed-loop testing on CARLA.

- **Summary**: Equipping multi-fingered robots with tactile sensing is crucial for achieving the precise, contact-rich, and dexterous manipulation that humans excel at. However, relying solely on tactile sensing fails to provide adequate cues for reasoning about objects' spatial configurations, limiting the ability to correct errors and adapt to changing situations. In this paper, we present Tactile Adaptation from Visual Incentives (TAVI), a new framework that enhances tactile-based dexterity by optimizing dexterous policies using vision-based rewards. First, we use a contrastive-based objective to learn visual representations. Next, we construct a reward function using these visual representations through optimal-transport based matching on one human demonstration. Finally, we use online reinforcement learning on our robot to optimize tactile-based policies that maximize the visual reward. On six challenging tasks, such as peg pick-and-place, unstacking bowls, and flipping slender objects, TAVI achieves a success rate of 73% using our four-fingered Allegro robot hand. The increase in performance is 108% higher than policies using tactile and vision-based rewards and 135% higher than policies without tactile observational input.

- **Summary**: We tackle the problem of robust novelty detection, where we aim to detect novelties in terms of semantic content while being invariant to changes in other, irrelevant factors. Specifically, we operate in a setup with multiple environments, where we determine the set of features that are associated more with the environments, rather than to the content relevant for the task. Thus, we propose a method that starts with a pretrained embedding and a multi-env setup and manages to rank the features based on their environment-focus. First, we compute a per-feature score based on the feature distribution variance between envs. Next, we show that by dropping the highly scored ones, we manage to remove spurious correlations and improve the overall performance by up to 6%, both in covariance and sub-population shift cases, both for a real and a synthetic benchmark, that we introduce for this task.

- **Summary**: Vector graphics are widely used in digital art and valued by designers for their scalability and layer-wise topological properties. However, the creation and editing of vector graphics necessitate creativity and design expertise, leading to a time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline that generates high-quality customized vector graphics based on textual prompts while preserving the properties and layer-wise information of a given exemplar SVG. Our method harnesses the capabilities of large pre-trained text-to-image models. By fine-tuning the cross-attention layers of the model, we generate customized raster images guided by textual prompts. To initialize the SVG, we introduce a semantic-based path alignment method that preserves and transforms crucial paths from the exemplar SVG. Additionally, we optimize path parameters using both image-level and vector-level losses, ensuring smooth shape deformation while aligning with the customized raster image. We extensively evaluate our method using multiple metrics from vector-level, image-level, and text-level perspectives. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline in generating diverse customizations of vector graphics with exceptional quality.

- **Summary**: Panoramic videos contain richer spatial information and have attracted tremendous amounts of attention due to their exceptional experience in some fields such as autonomous driving and virtual reality. However, existing datasets for video segmentation only focus on conventional planar images. To address the challenge, in this paper, we present a panoramic video dataset, PanoVOS. The dataset provides 150 videos with high video resolutions and diverse motions. To quantify the domain gap between 2D planar videos and panoramic videos, we evaluate 15 off-the-shelf video object segmentation (VOS) models on PanoVOS. Through error analysis, we found that all of them fail to tackle pixel-level content discontinues of panoramic videos. Thus, we present a Panoramic Space Consistency Transformer (PSCFormer), which can effectively utilize the semantic boundary information of the previous frame for pixel-level matching with the current frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with the previous SOTA models, our PSCFormer network exhibits a great advantage in terms of segmentation results under the panoramic setting. Our dataset poses new challenges in panoramic VOS and we hope that our PanoVOS can advance the development of panoramic segmentation/tracking.

- **Summary**: The objective of this work is the effective extraction of spatial and dynamic features for Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR). To accomplish this, we utilise a two-pathway SlowFast network, where each pathway operates at distinct temporal resolutions to separately capture spatial (hand shapes, facial expressions) and dynamic (movements) information. In addition, we introduce two distinct feature fusion methods, carefully designed for the characteristics of CSLR: (1) Bi-directional Feature Fusion (BFF), which facilitates the transfer of dynamic semantics into spatial semantics and vice versa; and (2) Pathway Feature Enhancement (PFE), which enriches dynamic and spatial representations through auxiliary subnetworks, while avoiding the need for extra inference time. As a result, our model further strengthens spatial and dynamic representations in parallel. We demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art performance on popular CSLR datasets, including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, and CSL-Daily.

- **Summary**: The goal of this work is Active Speaker Detection (ASD), a task to determine whether a person is speaking or not in a series of video frames. Previous works have dealt with the task by exploring network architectures while learning effective representations has been less explored. In this work, we propose TalkNCE, a novel talk-aware contrastive loss. The loss is only applied to part of the full segments where a person on the screen is actually speaking. This encourages the model to learn effective representations through the natural correspondence of speech and facial movements. Our loss can be jointly optimized with the existing objectives for training ASD models without the need for additional supervision or training data. The experiments demonstrate that our loss can be easily integrated into the existing ASD frameworks, improving their performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on AVA-ActiveSpeaker and ASW datasets.

- **Summary**: 3D visual grounding is a critical skill for household robots, enabling them to navigate, manipulate objects, and answer questions based on their environment. While existing approaches often rely on extensive labeled data or exhibit limitations in handling complex language queries, we propose LLM-Grounder, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary, Large Language Model (LLM)-based 3D visual grounding pipeline. LLM-Grounder utilizes an LLM to decompose complex natural language queries into semantic constituents and employs a visual grounding tool, such as OpenScene or LERF, to identify objects in a 3D scene. The LLM then evaluates the spatial and commonsense relations among the proposed objects to make a final grounding decision. Our method does not require any labeled training data and can generalize to novel 3D scenes and arbitrary text queries. We evaluate LLM-Grounder on the ScanRefer benchmark and demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot grounding accuracy. Our findings indicate that LLMs significantly improve the grounding capability, especially for complex language queries, making LLM-Grounder an effective approach for 3D vision-language tasks in robotics.

- **Summary**: We present ForceSight, a system for text-guided mobile manipulation that predicts visual-force goals using a deep neural network. Given a single RGBD image combined with a text prompt, ForceSight determines a target end-effector pose in the camera frame (kinematic goal) and the associated forces (force goal). Together, these two components form a visual-force goal. Prior work has demonstrated that deep models outputting human-interpretable kinematic goals can enable dexterous manipulation by real robots. Forces are critical to manipulation, yet have typically been relegated to lower-level execution in these systems. When deployed on a mobile manipulator equipped with an eye-in-hand RGBD camera, ForceSight performed tasks such as precision grasps, drawer opening, and object handovers with an 81% success rate in unseen environments with object instances that differed significantly from the training data. In a separate experiment, relying exclusively on visual servoing and ignoring force goals dropped the success rate from 90% to 45%, demonstrating that force goals can significantly enhance performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal distillation method, called TinyCLIP, for large-scale language-image pre-trained models. The method introduces two core techniques: affinity mimicking and weight inheritance. Affinity mimicking explores the interaction between modalities during distillation, enabling student models to mimic teachers' behavior of learning cross-modal feature alignment in a visual-linguistic affinity space. Weight inheritance transmits the pre-trained weights from the teacher models to their student counterparts to improve distillation efficiency. Moreover, we extend the method into a multi-stage progressive distillation to mitigate the loss of informative weights during extreme compression. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TinyCLIP, showing that it can reduce the size of the pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 by 50%, while maintaining comparable zero-shot performance. While aiming for comparable performance, distillation with weight inheritance can speed up the training by 1.4 - 7.8 $\times$ compared to training from scratch. Moreover, our TinyCLIP ViT-8M/16, trained on YFCC-15M, achieves an impressive zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 41.1% on ImageNet, surpassing the original CLIP ViT-B/16 by 3.5% while utilizing only 8.9% parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the good transferability of TinyCLIP in various downstream tasks. Code and models will be open-sourced at https://aka.ms/tinyclip.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel framework integrating the principles of active stereo in standard passive camera systems without a physical pattern projector. We virtually project a pattern over the left and right images according to the sparse measurements obtained from a depth sensor. Any such devices can be seamlessly plugged into our framework, allowing for the deployment of a virtual active stereo setup in any possible environment, overcoming the limitation of pattern projectors, such as limited working range or environmental conditions. Experiments on indoor/outdoor datasets, featuring both long and close-range, support the seamless effectiveness of our approach, boosting the accuracy of both stereo algorithms and deep networks.

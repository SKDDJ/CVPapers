- **Summary**: Bayes Classifiers are widely used currently for recognition, identification and knowledge discovery. The fields of application are, for example, image processing, medicine, chemistry (QSAR). But by mysterious way the Naive Bayes Classifier usually gives a very nice and good presentation of a recognition. It can not be improved considerably by more complex models of Bayes Classifier. We demonstrate here a very nice and simple proof of the Naive Bayes Classifier optimality, that can explain this interesting fact.The derivation in the current paper is based on arXiv:cs/0202020v1

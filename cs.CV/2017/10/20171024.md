- **Summary**: This paper is concerned with optimization of distributed broadband wireless communication (BWC) systems. BWC systems contain a distributed antenna system (DAS) connected to a base station with optical fiber. Distributed BWC systems have been proposed as a solution to the power constraint problem in traditional cellular networks. So far, the research on BWC systems have advanced on two separate tracks, the design of the system to meet the quality of service requirements (QoS) and optimization of the location of the DAS. In this paper, we consider a combined optimization of BWC systems. We consider uplink communications in distributed BWC systems with multiple levels of priority traffic with arrivals and departures forming renewal processes. We develop an analysis that determines packet delay violation probability for each priority level as a function of the outage probability of the DAS through the application of results from renewal theory. Then, we determine the optimal locations of the antennas that minimize the antenna outage probability. We also study the tradeoff between the packet delay violation probability and packet loss probability. This work will be helpful in the designing of the distributed BWC systems.

- **Summary**: This work proposes a process for efficiently searching over combinations of individual object 6D pose hypotheses in cluttered scenes, especially in cases involving occlusions and objects resting on each other. The initial set of candidate object poses is generated from state-of-the-art object detection and global point cloud registration techniques. The best-scored pose per object by using these techniques may not be accurate due to overlaps and occlusions. Nevertheless, experimental indications provided in this work show that object poses with lower ranks may be closer to the real poses than ones with high ranks according to registration techniques. This motivates a global optimization process for improving these poses by taking into account scene-level physical interactions between objects. It also implies that the Cartesian product of candidate poses for interacting objects must be searched so as to identify the best scene-level hypothesis. To perform the search efficiently, the candidate poses for each object are clustered so as to reduce their number but still keep a sufficient diversity. Then, searching over the combinations of candidate object poses is performed through a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) process that uses the similarity between the observed depth image of the scene and a rendering of the scene given the hypothesized pose as a score that guides the search procedure. MCTS handles in a principled way the tradeoff between fine-tuning the most promising poses and exploring new ones, by using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique. Experimental results indicate that this process is able to quickly identify in cluttered scenes physically-consistent object poses that are significantly closer to ground truth compared to poses found by point cloud registration methods.

- **Summary**: The study of representations invariant to common transformations of the data is important to learning. Most techniques have focused on local approximate invariance implemented within expensive optimization frameworks lacking explicit theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we study kernels that are invariant to a unitary group while having theoretical guarantees in addressing the important practical issue of unavailability of transformed versions of labelled data. A problem we call the Unlabeled Transformation Problem which is a special form of semi-supervised learning and one-shot learning. We present a theoretically motivated alternate approach to the invariant kernel SVM based on which we propose Max-Margin Invariant Features (MMIF) to solve this problem. As an illustration, we design an framework for face recognition and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a large scale semi-synthetic dataset with 153,000 images and a new challenging protocol on Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) while out-performing strong baselines.

- **Summary**: Mass segmentation provides effective morphological features which are important for mass diagnosis. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end network for mammographic mass segmentation which employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) to model a potential function, followed by a CRF to perform structured learning. Because the mass distribution varies greatly with pixel position, the FCN is combined with a position priori. Further, we employ adversarial training to eliminate over-fitting due to the small sizes of mammogram datasets. Multi-scale FCN is employed to improve the segmentation performance. Experimental results on two public datasets, INbreast and DDSM-BCRP, demonstrate that our end-to-end network achieves better performance than state-of-the-art approaches. \footnote{https://github.com/wentaozhu/adversarial-deep-structural-networks.git}



### One pixel attack for fooling deep neural networks

- **Summary**: Recent research has revealed that the output of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) can be easily altered by adding relatively small perturbations to the input vector. In this paper, we analyze an attack in an extremely limited scenario where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution (DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results show that 67.97% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and 16.04% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03% and 22.91% confidence on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating robustness.



### Robust Photometric Stereo via Dictionary Learning

- **Summary**: Photometric stereo is a method that seeks to reconstruct the normal vectors of an object from a set of images of the object illuminated under different light sources. While effective in some situations, classical photometric stereo relies on a diffuse surface model that cannot handle objects with complex reflectance patterns, and it is sensitive to non-idealities in the images. In this work, we propose a novel approach to photometric stereo that relies on dictionary learning to produce robust normal vector reconstructions. Specifically, we develop two formulations for applying dictionary learning to photometric stereo. We propose a model that applies dictionary learning to regularize and reconstruct the normal vectors from the images under the classic Lambertian reflectance model. We then generalize this model to explicitly model non-Lambertian objects. We investigate both approaches through extensive experimentation on synthetic and real benchmark datasets and observe state-of-the-art performance compared to existing robust photometric stereo methods.

- **Summary**: We study the topological construction called Mapper in the context of simply connected domains, in particular on images. The Mapper construction can be considered as a generalization for contour, split, and joint trees on simply connected domains. A contour tree on an image domain assumes the height function to be a piecewise linear Morse function. This is a rather restrictive class of functions and does not allow us to explore the topology for most real world images. The Mapper construction avoids this limitation by assuming only continuity on the height function allowing this construction to robustly deal with a significant larger set of images. We provide a customized construction for Mapper on images, give a fast algorithm to compute it, and show how to simplify the Mapper structure in this case. Finally, we provide a simple procedure that guarantees the equivalence of Mapper to contour, join, and split trees on a simply connected domain.

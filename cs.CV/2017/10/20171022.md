- **Summary**: Camera relocalization plays a vital role in many robotics and computer vision tasks, such as global localization, recovery from tracking failure, and loop closure detection. Recent random forests based methods directly predict 3D world locations for 2D image locations to guide the camera pose optimization. During training, each tree greedily splits the samples to minimize the spatial variance. However, these greedy splits often produce uneven sub-trees in training or incorrect 2D-3D correspondences in testing. To address these problems, we propose a sample-balanced objective to encourage equal numbers of samples in the left and right sub-trees, and a novel backtracking scheme to remedy the incorrect 2D-3D correspondence predictions. Furthermore, we extend the regression forests based methods to use local features in both training and testing stages for outdoor RGB-only applications. Experimental results on publicly available indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, which shows superior or on-par accuracy with several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional semantic segmentation (DCSS) learning doesn't converge to an optimal local minimum with random parameters initializations; a pre-trained model on the same domain becomes necessary to achieve convergence.In this work, we propose a joint cooperative end-to-end learning method for DCSS. It addresses many drawbacks with existing deep semantic segmentation learning; the proposed approach simultaneously learn both segmentation and classification; taking away the essential need of the pre-trained model for learning convergence. We present an improved inception based architecture with partial attention gating (PAG) over encoder information. The PAG also adds to achieve faster convergence and better accuracy for segmentation task. We will show the effectiveness of this learning on a diabetic retinopathy classification and segmentation dataset.

- **Summary**: We model the photo cropping problem as a cascade of attention box regression and aesthetic quality classification, based on deep learning. A neural network is designed that has two branches for predicting attention bounding box and analyzing aesthetics, respectively. The predicted attention box is treated as an initial crop window where a set of cropping candidates are generated around it, without missing important information. Then, aesthetics assessment is employed to select the final crop as the one with the best aesthetic quality. With our network, cropping candidates share features within full-image convolutional feature maps, thus avoiding repeated feature computation and leading to higher computation efficiency. Via leveraging rich data for attention prediction and aesthetics assessment, the proposed method produces high-quality cropping results, even with the limited availability of training data for photo cropping. The experimental results demonstrate the competitive results and fast processing speed (5 fps with all steps).

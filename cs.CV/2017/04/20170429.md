- **Summary**: The experimental results of improved underwater image enhancement algorithms based on partial differential equations (PDEs) are presented in this report. This second work extends the study of previous work and incorporating several improvements into the revised algorithm. Experiments show the evidence of the improvements when compared to previously proposed approaches and other conventional algorithms found in the literature.

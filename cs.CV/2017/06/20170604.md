- **Summary**: Image compositing is a method used to generate realistic yet fake imagery by inserting contents from one image to another. Previous work in compositing has focused on improving appearance compatibility of a user selected foreground segment and a background image (i.e. color and illumination consistency). In this work, we instead develop a fully automated compositing model that additionally learns to select and transform compatible foreground segments from a large collection given only an input image background. To simplify the task, we restrict our problem by focusing on human instance composition, because human segments exhibit strong correlations with their background and because of the availability of large annotated data. We develop a novel branching Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that jointly predicts candidate person locations given a background image. We then use pre-trained deep feature representations to retrieve person instances from a large segment database. Experimental results show that our model can generate composite images that look visually convincing. We also develop a user interface to demonstrate the potential application of our method.

- **Summary**: Age progression is defined as aesthetically re-rendering the aging face at any future age for an individual face. In this work, we aim to automatically render aging faces in a personalized way. Basically, for each age group, we learn an aging dictionary to reveal its aging characteristics (e.g., wrinkles), where the dictionary bases corresponding to the same index yet from two neighboring aging dictionaries form a particular aging pattern cross these two age groups, and a linear combination of all these patterns expresses a particular personalized aging process. Moreover, two factors are taken into consideration in the dictionary learning process. First, beyond the aging dictionaries, each person may have extra personalized facial characteristics, e.g. mole, which are invariant in the aging process. Second, it is challenging or even impossible to collect faces of all age groups for a particular person, yet much easier and more practical to get face pairs from neighboring age groups. To this end, we propose a novel Bi-level Dictionary Learning based Personalized Age Progression (BDL-PAP) method. Here, bi-level dictionary learning is formulated to learn the aging dictionaries based on face pairs from neighboring age groups. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the advantages of the proposed BDL-PAP over other state-of-the-arts in term of personalized age progression, as well as the performance gain for cross-age face verification by synthesizing aging faces.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important technology that supports daily social life and economic activities. It contributes greatly to the sustainable growth of Japan's economy and solves various social problems. In recent years, AI has attracted attention as a key for growth in developed countries such as Europe and the United States and developing countries such as China and India. The attention has been focused mainly on developing new artificial intelligence information communication technology (ICT) and robot technology (RT). Although recently developed AI technology certainly excels in extracting certain patterns, there are many limitations. Most ICT models are overly dependent on big data, lack a self-idea function, and are complicated. In this paper, rather than merely developing next-generation artificial intelligence technology, we aim to develop a new concept of general-purpose intelligence cognition technology called Beyond AI. Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent learning model called Brain Intelligence (BI) that generates new ideas about events without having experienced them by using artificial life with an imagine function. We will also conduct demonstrations of the developed BI intelligence learning model on automatic driving, precision medical care, and industrial robots.

- **Summary**: Faster R-CNN is one of the most representative and successful methods for object detection, and has been becoming increasingly popular in various objection detection applications. In this report, we propose a robust deep face detection approach based on Faster R-CNN. In our approach, we exploit several new techniques including new multi-task loss function design, online hard example mining, and multi-scale training strategy to improve Faster R-CNN in multiple aspects. The proposed approach is well suited for face detection, so we call it Face R-CNN. Extensive experiments are conducted on two most popular and challenging face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER FACE, to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a recently proposed computational imaging technique with both high resolution and wide field-of-view. In current FP experimental setup, the dark-field images with high-angle illuminations are easily submerged by stray light and background noise due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, thus significantly degrading the reconstruction quality and also imposing a major restriction on the synthetic numerical aperture (NA) of the FP approach. To this end, an overall and systematic data preprocessing scheme for noise removal from FP's raw dataset is provided, which involves sampling analysis as well as underexposed/overexposed treatments, then followed by the elimination of unknown stray light and suppression of inevitable background noise, especially Gaussian noise and CCD dark current in our experiments. The reported non-parametric scheme facilitates great enhancements of the FP's performance, which has been demonstrated experimentally that the benefits of noise removal by these methods far outweigh its defects of concomitant signal loss. In addition, it could be flexibly cooperated with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms, producing a stronger robustness of the FP approach in various applications.

- **Summary**: Image or object recognition is an important task in computer vision. With the hight-speed processing power on modern platforms and the availability of mobile phones everywhere, millions of photos are uploaded to the internet per minute, it is critical to establish a generic framework for fast and accurate image processing for automatic recognition and information retrieval. In this paper, we proposed an efficient image recognition and matching method that is originally derived from Naive Bayesian classification method to construct a probabilistic model. Our method support real-time performance and have very high ability to distinguish similar images with high details. Experiments are conducted together with intensive comparison with state-of-the-arts on image matching, such as Ferns recognition and SIFT recognition. The results demonstrate satisfactory performance.

- **Summary**: Intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) is a major risk factor for stroke, and might contribute to dementia and cognitive decline. Reliance on time-consuming manual annotation of ICAC hampers much demanded further research into the relationship between ICAC and neurological diseases. Automation of ICAC segmentation is therefore highly desirable, but difficult due to the proximity of the lesions to bony structures with a similar attenuation coefficient. In this paper, we propose a method for automatic segmentation of ICAC; the first to our knowledge. Our method is based on a 3D fully convolutional neural network that we extend with two regularization techniques. Firstly, we use deep supervision (hidden layers supervision) to encourage discriminative features in the hidden layers. Secondly, we augment the network with skip connections, as in the recently developed ResNet, and dropout layers, inserted in a way that skip connections circumvent them. We investigate the effect of skip connections and dropout. In addition, we propose a simple problem-specific modification of the network objective function that restricts the focus to the most important image regions and simplifies the optimization. We train and validate our model using 882 CT scans and test on 1,000. Our regularization techniques and objective improve the average Dice score by 7.1%, yielding an average Dice of 76.2% and 97.7% correlation between predicted ICAC volumes and manual annotations.

- **Summary**: This work presents a supervised learning based approach to the computer vision problem of frame interpolation. The presented technique could also be used in the cartoon animations since drawing each individual frame consumes a noticeable amount of time. The most existing solutions to this problem use unsupervised methods and focus only on real life videos with already high frame rate. However, the experiments show that such methods do not work as well when the frame rate becomes low and object displacements between frames becomes large. This is due to the fact that interpolation of the large displacement motion requires knowledge of the motion structure thus the simple techniques such as frame averaging start to fail. In this work the deep convolutional neural network is used to solve the frame interpolation problem. In addition, it is shown that incorporating the prior information such as optical flow improves the interpolation quality significantly.

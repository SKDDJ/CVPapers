- **Summary**: We propose a novel motion estimation/compensation (ME/MC) method for wavelet-based (in-band) motion compensated temporal filtering (MCTF), with application to low-bitrate video coding. Unlike the conventional in-band MCTF algorithms, which require redundancy to overcome the shift-variance problem of critically sampled (complete) discrete wavelet transforms (DWT), we perform ME/MC steps directly on DWT coefficients by avoiding the need of shift-invariance. We omit upsampling, the inverse-DWT (IDWT), and the calculation of redundant DWT coefficients, while achieving arbitrary subpixel accuracy without interpolation, and high video quality even at very low-bitrates, by deriving the exact relationships between DWT subbands of input image sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method, confirming that our model for ME/MC effectively improves video coding quality.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation is the process of partitioning the image into significant regions easier to analyze. Nowadays, segmentation has become a necessity in many practical medical imaging methods as locating tumors and diseases. Hidden Markov Random Field model is one of several techniques used in image segmentation. It provides an elegant way to model the segmentation process. This modeling leads to the minimization of an objective function. Conjugate Gradient algorithm (CG) is one of the best known optimization techniques. This paper proposes the use of the Conjugate Gradient algorithm (CG) for image segmentation, based on the Hidden Markov Random Field. Since derivatives are not available for this expression, finite differences are used in the CG algorithm to approximate the first derivative. The approach is evaluated using a number of publicly available images, where ground truth is known. The Dice Coefficient is used as an objective criterion to measure the quality of segmentation. The results show that the proposed CG approach compares favorably with other variants of Hidden Markov Random Field segmentation algorithms.

- **Summary**: Impervious surface area is a direct consequence of the urbanization, which also plays an important role in urban planning and environmental management. With the rapidly technical development of remote sensing, monitoring urban impervious surface via high spatial resolution (HSR) images has attracted unprecedented attention recently. Traditional multi-classes models are inefficient for impervious surface extraction because it requires labeling all needed and unneeded classes that occur in the image exhaustively. Therefore, we need to find a reliable one-class model to classify one specific land cover type without labeling other classes. In this study, we investigate several one-class classifiers, such as Presence and Background Learning (PBL), Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL), OCSVM, BSVM and MAXENT, to extract urban impervious surface area using high spatial resolution imagery of GF-1, China's new generation of high spatial remote sensing satellite, and evaluate the classification accuracy based on artificial interpretation results. Compared to traditional multi-classes classifiers (ANN and SVM), the experimental results indicate that PBL and PUL provide higher classification accuracy, which is similar to the accuracy provided by ANN model. Meanwhile, PBL and PUL outperforms OCSVM, BSVM, MAXENT and SVM models. Hence, the one-class classifiers only need a small set of specific samples to train models without losing predictive accuracy, which is supposed to gain more attention on urban impervious surface extraction or other one specific land cover type.

- **Summary**: Brain imaging data such as EEG or MEG are high-dimensional spatiotemporal data often degraded by complex, non-Gaussian noise. For reliable analysis of brain imaging data, it is important to extract discriminative, low-dimensional intrinsic representation of the recorded data. This work proposes a new method to learn the low-dimensional representations from the noise-degraded measurements. In particular, our work proposes a new deep neural network design that integrates graph information such as brain connectivity with fully-connected layers. Our work leverages efficient graph filter design using Chebyshev polynomial and recent work on convolutional nets on graph-structured data. Our approach exploits graph structure as the prior side information, localized graph filter for feature extraction and neural networks for high capacity learning. Experiments on real MEG datasets show that our approach can extract more discriminative representations, leading to improved accuracy in a supervised classification task.

- **Summary**: Image geolocalization, inferring the geographic location of an image, is a challenging computer vision problem with many potential applications. The recent state-of-the-art approach to this problem is a deep image classification approach in which the world is spatially divided into cells and a deep network is trained to predict the correct cell for a given image. We propose to combine this approach with the original Im2GPS approach in which a query image is matched against a database of geotagged images and the location is inferred from the retrieved set. We estimate the geographic location of a query image by applying kernel density estimation to the locations of its nearest neighbors in the reference database. Interestingly, we find that the best features for our retrieval task are derived from networks trained with classification loss even though we do not use a classification approach at test time. Training with classification loss outperforms several deep feature learning methods (e.g. Siamese networks with contrastive of triplet loss) more typical for retrieval applications. Our simple approach achieves state-of-the-art geolocalization accuracy while also requiring significantly less training data.

The proposed approach shows that aesthetically appealing patterns deliver higher amount of information over multiple levels in comparison with less aesthetically appealing patterns when the same amount of energy is used. The proposed approach is used to classify aesthetically appealing patterns.

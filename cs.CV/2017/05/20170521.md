- **Summary**: To improve segmentation performance, a novel neural network architecture (termed DFCN-DCRF) is proposed, which combines an RGB-D fully convolutional neural network (DFCN) with a depth-sensitive fully-connected conditional random field (DCRF). First, a DFCN architecture which fuses depth information into the early layers and applies dilated convolution for later contextual reasoning is designed. Then, a depth-sensitive fully-connected conditional random field (DCRF) is proposed and combined with the previous DFCN to refine the preliminary result. Comparative experiments show that the proposed DFCN-DCRF has the best performance compared with most state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of fingerprint recognition systems to dictionary attacks based on MasterPrints. MasterPrints are real or synthetic fingerprints that can fortuitously match with a large number of fingerprints thereby undermining the security afforded by fingerprint systems. Previous work by Roy et al. generated synthetic MasterPrints at the feature-level. In this work we generate complete image-level MasterPrints known as DeepMasterPrints, whose attack accuracy is found to be much superior than that of previous methods. The proposed method, referred to as Latent Variable Evolution, is based on training a Generative Adversarial Network on a set of real fingerprint images. Stochastic search in the form of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy is then used to search for latent input variables to the generator network that can maximize the number of impostor matches as assessed by a fingerprint recognizer. Experiments convey the efficacy of the proposed method in generating DeepMasterPrints. The underlying method is likely to have broad applications in fingerprint security as well as fingerprint synthesis.

- **Summary**: We study a class of deep neural networks with networks that form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For backpropagation defined by gradient descent with adaptive momentum, we show weights converge for a large class of nonlinear activation functions. The proof generalizes the results of Wu et al. (2008) who showed convergence for a feed forward network with one hidden layer. For an example of the effectiveness of DAG architectures, we describe an example of compression through an autoencoder, and compare against sequential feed forward networks under several metrics.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture to classify structured objects in datasets with a large number of visually similar categories. We model sequences of images as linear-chain CRFs, and jointly learn the parameters from both local-visual features and neighboring classes. The visual features are computed by convolutional layers, and the class embeddings are learned by factorizing the CRF pairwise potential matrix. This forms a highly nonlinear objective function which is trained by optimizing a local likelihood approximation with batch-normalization. This model overcomes the difficulties of existing CRF methods to learn the contextual relationships thoroughly when there is a large number of classes and the data is sparse. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated on a huge dataset that contains images of retail-store product displays, taken in varying settings and viewpoints, and shows significantly improved results compared to linear CRF modeling and unnormalized likelihood optimization.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new Generative Partition Network (GPN) to address the challenging multi-person pose estimation problem. Different from existing models that are either completely top-down or bottom-up, the proposed GPN introduces a novel strategy--it generates partitions for multiple persons from their global joint candidates and infers instance-specific joint configurations simultaneously. The GPN is favorably featured by low complexity and high accuracy of joint detection and re-organization. In particular, GPN designs a generative model that performs one feed-forward pass to efficiently generate robust person detections with joint partitions, relying on dense regressions from global joint candidates in an embedding space parameterized by centroids of persons. In addition, GPN formulates the inference procedure for joint configurations of human poses as a graph partition problem, and conducts local optimization for each person detection with reliable global affinity cues, leading to complexity reduction and performance improvement. GPN is implemented with the Hourglass architecture as the backbone network to simultaneously learn joint detector and dense regressor. Extensive experiments on benchmarks MPII Human Pose Multi-Person, extended PASCAL-Person-Part, and WAF, show the efficiency of GPN with new state-of-the-art performance.

  wider dataset (section 3.2)
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: While the research community appears to have developed a consensus on the methods of acquiring annotated data, design and training of CNNs, many questions still remain to be answered. In this paper, we explore the following questions that are critical to face recognition research: (i) Can we train on still images and expect the systems to work on videos? (ii) Are deeper datasets better than wider datasets? (iii) Does adding label noise lead to improvement in performance of deep networks? (iv) Is alignment needed for face recognition? We address these questions by training CNNs using CASIA-WebFace, UMDFaces, and a new video dataset and testing on YouTube- Faces, IJB-A and a disjoint portion of UMDFaces datasets. Our new data set, which will be made publicly available, has 22,075 videos and 3,735,476 human annotated frames extracted from them.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the combination of feedforward and iterative computations in the virtual cortex, and taking advantage of the ability of denoising autoencoders to estimate the score of a joint distribution, we propose a novel approach to iterative inference for capturing and exploiting the complex joint distribution of output variables conditioned on some input variables. This approach is applied to image pixel-wise segmentation, with the estimated conditional score used to perform gradient ascent towards a mode of the estimated conditional distribution. This extends previous work on score estimation by denoising autoencoders to the case of a conditional distribution, with a novel use of a corrupted feedforward predictor replacing Gaussian corruption. An advantage of this approach over more classical ways to perform iterative inference for structured outputs, like conditional random fields (CRFs), is that it is not any more necessary to define an explicit energy function linking the output variables. To keep computations tractable, such energy function parametrizations are typically fairly constrained, involving only a few neighbors of each of the output variables in each clique. We experimentally find that the proposed iterative inference from conditional score estimation by conditional denoising autoencoders performs better than comparable models based on CRFs or those not using any explicit modeling of the conditional joint distribution of outputs.

- **Summary**: The method introduced in this paper aims at helping deep learning practitioners faced with an overfit problem. The idea is to replace, in a multi-branch network, the standard summation of parallel branches with a stochastic affine combination. Applied to 3-branch residual networks, shake-shake regularization improves on the best single shot published results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by reaching test errors of 2.86% and 15.85%. Experiments on architectures without skip connections or Batch Normalization show encouraging results and open the door to a large set of applications.

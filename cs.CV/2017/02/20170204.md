- **Summary**: This paper presents a new approach for the challenging problem of geo-locating an image using image matching in a structured database of city-wide reference images with known GPS coordinates. We cast the geo-localization as a clustering problem on local image features. Akin to existing approaches on the problem, our framework builds on low-level features which allow partial matching between images. For each local feature in the query image, we find its approximate nearest neighbors in the reference set. Next, we cluster the features from reference images using Dominant Set clustering, which affords several advantages over existing approaches. First, it permits variable number of nodes in the cluster which we use to dynamically select the number of nearest neighbors (typically coming from multiple reference images) for each query feature based on its discrimination value. Second, as we also quantify in our experiments, this approach is several orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches. Thus, we obtain multiple clusters (different local maximizers) and obtain a robust final solution to the problem using multiple weak solutions through constrained Dominant Set clustering on global image features, where we enforce the constraint that the query image must be included in the cluster. This second level of clustering also bypasses heuristic approaches to voting and selecting the reference image that matches to the query. We evaluated the proposed framework on an existing dataset of 102k street view images as well as a new dataset of 300k images, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 20% and 7%, respectively, on the two datasets.

- **Summary**: Since convolutional neural network(CNN)models emerged,several tasks in computer vision have actively deployed CNN models for feature extraction. However,the conventional CNN models have a high computational cost and require high memory capacity, which is impractical and unaffordable for commercial applications such as real-time on-road object detection on embedded boards or mobile platforms. To tackle this limitation of CNN models, this paper proposes a wide-residual-inception (WR-Inception) network, which constructs the architecture based on a residual inception unit that captures objects of various sizes on the same feature map, as well as shallower and wider layers, compared to state-of-the-art networks like ResNet. To verify the proposed networks, this paper conducted two experiments; one is a classification task on CIFAR-10/100 and the other is an on-road object detection task using a Single-Shot Multi-box Detector(SSD) on the KITTI dataset.

- **Summary**: Weed scouting is an important part of modern integrated weed management but can be time consuming and sparse when performed manually. Automated weed scouting and weed destruction has typically been performed using classification systems able to classify a set group of species known a priori. This greatly limits deployability as classification systems must be retrained for any field with a different set of weed species present within them. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper works towards developing a clustering approach to weed scouting which can be utilized in any field without the need for prior species knowledge. We demonstrate our system using challenging data collected in the field from an agricultural robotics platform. We show that considerable improvements can be made by (i) learning low-dimensional (bottleneck) features using a deep convolutional neural network to represent plants in general and (ii) tying views of the same area (plant) together. Deploying this algorithm on in-field data collected by AgBotII, we are able to successfully cluster cotton plants from grasses without prior knowledge or training for the specific plants in the field.

- **Summary**: The bilateral filter is a useful nonlinear filter which without smoothing edges, it does spatial averaging. In the literature, the effectiveness of this method for image denoising is shown. In this paper, an extension of this method is proposed which is based on complex wavelet transform. In fact, the bilateral filtering is applied to the low-frequency (approximation) subbands of the decomposed image using complex wavelet transform, while the thresholding approach is applied to the high frequency subbands. Using the bilateral filter in the complex wavelet domain forms a new image denoising framework. Experimental results for real data are provided, by which one can see the effectiveness of the proposed method in eliminating noise.

- **Summary**: Deep Learning (DL) methods show very good performance when trained on large, balanced data sets. However, many practical problems involve imbalanced data sets, or/and classes with a small number of training samples. The performance of DL methods as well as more traditional classifiers drops significantly in such settings. Most of the existing solutions for imbalanced problems focus on customizing the data for training. A more principled solution is to use mixed Hinge-Minimax risk [19] specifically designed to solve binary problems with imbalanced training sets. Here we propose a Latent Hinge Minimax (LHM) risk and a training algorithm that generalizes this paradigm to an ensemble of hyperplanes that can form arbitrary complex, piecewise linear boundaries. To extract good features, we combine LHM model with CNN via transfer learning. To solve multi-class problem we map pre-trained category-specific LHM classifiers to a multi-class neural network and adjust the weights with very fast tuning. LHM classifier enables the use of unlabeled data in its training and the mapping allows for multi-class inference, resulting in a classifier that performs better than alternatives when trained on a small number of training samples.

- **Summary**: Predicting a person's gender based on the iris texture has been explored by several researchers. This paper considers several dimensions of experimental work on this problem, including person-disjoint train and test, and the effect of cosmetics on eyelash occlusion and imperfect segmentation. We also consider the use of multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural networks as classifiers, comparing the use of data-driven and hand-crafted features. Our results suggest that the gender-from-iris problem is more difficult than has so far been appreciated. Estimating accuracy using a mean of N person-disjoint train and test partitions, and considering the effect of makeup - a combination of experimental conditions not present in any previous work - we find a much weaker ability to predict gender-from-iris texture than has been suggested in previous work.

- **Summary**: PROBE (Progressive Removal of Blur Residual) is a recursive framework for blind deblurring. Using the elementary modified inverse filter at its core, PROBE's experimental performance meets or exceeds the state of the art, both visually and quantitatively. Remarkably, PROBE lends itself to analysis that reveals its convergence properties. PROBE is motivated by recent ideas on progressive blind deblurring, but breaks away from previous research by its simplicity, speed, performance and potential for analysis. PROBE is neither a functional minimization approach, nor an open-loop sequential method (blur kernel estimation followed by non-blind deblurring). PROBE is a feedback scheme, deriving its unique strength from the closed-loop architecture rather than from the accuracy of its algorithmic components.

- **Summary**: Iris is one of the popular biometrics that is widely used for identity authentication. Different features have been used to perform iris recognition in the past. Most of them are based on hand-crafted features designed by biometrics experts. Due to tremendous success of deep learning in computer vision problems, there has been a lot of interest in applying features learned by convolutional neural networks on general image recognition to other tasks such as segmentation, face recognition, and object detection. In this paper, we have investigated the application of deep features extracted from VGG-Net for iris recognition. The proposed scheme has been tested on two well-known iris databases, and has shown promising results with the best accuracy rate of 99.4\%, which outperforms the previous best result.

- **Summary**: This report describes the experimental results obtained using a proposed variational Retinex algorithm for controlled illumination correction. Two colour restoration and enhancement schemes of the algorithm are presented for drastically improved results. The algorithm modifies the reflectance image using global and local contrast enhancement approaches and gradually removes the residual illumination to yield highly pleasing results. The proposed algorithms are optimized by way of simultaneous perceptual quality metric (PQM) stabilization and entropy maximization for fully automated processing solving the problem of determination of stopping time. The usage of the HSI or HSV colour space ensures a unique solution to the optimization problem unlike in the RGB space where there is none (forcing manual selection of number of iteration. The proposed approach preserves and enhances details in both bright and dark regions of underexposed images in addition to eliminating the colour distortion, over-exposure in bright image regions, halo effect and grey-world violations observed in Retinex-based approaches. Extensive experiments indicate consistent performance as the proposed approach exploits and augments the advantages of PDE-based formulation, performing illumination correction, colour enhancement correction and restoration, contrast enhancement and noise suppression. Comparisons shows that the proposed approach surpasses most of the other conventional algorithms found in the literature.

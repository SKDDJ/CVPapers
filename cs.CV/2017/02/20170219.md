- **Summary**: Convnets have enabled significant progress in pedestrian detection recently, but there are still open questions regarding suitable architectures and training data. We revisit CNN design and point out key adaptations, enabling plain FasterRCNN to obtain state-of-the-art results on the Caltech dataset.   To achieve further improvement from more and better data, we introduce CityPersons, a new set of person annotations on top of the Cityscapes dataset. The diversity of CityPersons allows us for the first time to train one single CNN model that generalizes well over multiple benchmarks. Moreover, with additional training with CityPersons, we obtain top results using FasterRCNN on Caltech, improving especially for more difficult cases (heavy occlusion and small scale) and providing higher localization quality.

- **Summary**: Robust PCA methods are typically batch algorithms which requires loading all observations into memory before processing. This makes them inefficient to process big data. In this paper, we develop an efficient online robust principal component methods, namely online moving window robust principal component analysis (OMWRPCA). Unlike existing algorithms, OMWRPCA can successfully track not only slowly changing subspace but also abruptly changed subspace. By embedding hypothesis testing into the algorithm, OMWRPCA can detect change points of the underlying subspaces. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of OMWRPCA compared with other state-of-art approaches. We also apply the algorithm for real-time background subtraction of surveillance video.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a zoom-out-and-in network for generating object proposals. We utilize different resolutions of feature maps in the network to detect object instances of various sizes. Specifically, we divide the anchor candidates into three clusters based on the scale size and place them on feature maps of distinct strides to detect small, medium and large objects, respectively. Deeper feature maps contain region-level semantics which can help shallow counterparts to identify small objects. Therefore we design a zoom-in sub-network to increase the resolution of high level features via a deconvolution operation. The high-level features with high resolution are then combined and merged with low-level features to detect objects. Furthermore, we devise a recursive training pipeline to consecutively regress region proposals at the training stage in order to match the iterative regression at the testing stage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on ILSVRC DET and MS COCO datasets, where our algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-arts in various evaluation metrics. It also increases average precision by around 2% in the detection system.

- **Summary**: Searching persons in large-scale image databases with the query of natural language description has important applications in video surveillance. Existing methods mainly focused on searching persons with image-based or attribute-based queries, which have major limitations for a practical usage. In this paper, we study the problem of person search with natural language description. Given the textual description of a person, the algorithm of the person search is required to rank all the samples in the person database then retrieve the most relevant sample corresponding to the queried description. Since there is no person dataset or benchmark with textual description available, we collect a large-scale person description dataset with detailed natural language annotations and person samples from various sources, termed as CUHK Person Description Dataset (CUHK-PEDES). A wide range of possible models and baselines have been evaluated and compared on the person search benchmark. An Recurrent Neural Network with Gated Neural Attention mechanism (GNA-RNN) is proposed to establish the state-of-the art performance on person search.

- **Summary**: Most traditional algorithms for compressive sensing image reconstruction suffer from the intensive computation. Recently, deep learning-based reconstruction algorithms have been reported, which dramatically reduce the time complexity than iterative reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esidual \textbf{R}econstruction Network (DR$^{2}$-Net) to reconstruct the image from its Compressively Sensed (CS) measurement. The DR$^{2}$-Net is proposed based on two observations: 1) linear mapping could reconstruct a high-quality preliminary image, and 2) residual learning could further improve the reconstruction quality. Accordingly, DR$^{2}$-Net consists of two components, \emph{i.e.,} linear mapping network and residual network, respectively. Specifically, the fully-connected layer in neural network implements the linear mapping network. We then expand the linear mapping network to DR$^{2}$-Net by adding several residual learning blocks to enhance the preliminary image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the DR$^{2}$-Net outperforms traditional iterative methods and recent deep learning-based methods by large margins at measurement rates 0.01, 0.04, 0.1, and 0.25, respectively. The code of DR$^{2}$-Net has been released on: https://github.com/coldrainyht/caffe\_dr2

- **Summary**: This paper presents a fast and robust method for fixed pattern noise nonuniformity correction of infrared focal plane arrays. The proposed method requires neither shutter nor elaborate calibrations and therefore enables a real time correction with no interruptions. Based on derivative estimation of the fixed pattern noise from pixel sized translations of the focal plane array, the proposed method has the advantages of being invariant to the noise magnitude and robust to unknown camera and inter-scene movements while being virtually transparent to the end-user.

- **Summary**: Deep learning algorithms, in particular convolutional networks, have rapidly become a methodology of choice for analyzing medical images. This paper reviews the major deep learning concepts pertinent to medical image analysis and summarizes over 300 contributions to the field, most of which appeared in the last year. We survey the use of deep learning for image classification, object detection, segmentation, registration, and other tasks and provide concise overviews of studies per application area. Open challenges and directions for future research are discussed.

- **Summary**: Diagnosis of breast carcinomas has so far been limited to the morphological interpretation of epithelial cells and the assessment of epithelial tissue architecture. Consequently, most of the automated systems have focused on characterizing the epithelial regions of the breast to detect cancer. In this paper, we propose a system for classification of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained breast specimens based on convolutional neural networks that primarily targets the assessment of tumor-associated stroma to diagnose breast cancer patients. We evaluate the performance of our proposed system using a large cohort containing 646 breast tissue biopsies. Our evaluations show that the proposed system achieves an area under ROC of 0.92, demonstrating the discriminative power of previously neglected tumor-associated stroma as a diagnostic biomarker.

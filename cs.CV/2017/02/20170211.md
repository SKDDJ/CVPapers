- **Summary**: When integrating computational tools such as automatic segmentation into clinical practice, it is of utmost importance to be able to assess the level of accuracy on new data, and in particular, to detect when an automatic method fails. However, this is difficult to achieve due to absence of ground truth. Segmentation accuracy on clinical data might be different from what is found through cross-validation because validation data is often used during incremental method development, which can lead to overfitting and unrealistic performance expectations. Before deployment, performance is quantified using different metrics, for which the predicted segmentation is compared to a reference segmentation, often obtained manually by an expert. But little is known about the real performance after deployment when a reference is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce the concept of reverse classification accuracy (RCA) as a framework for predicting the performance of a segmentation method on new data. In RCA we take the predicted segmentation from a new image to train a reverse classifier which is evaluated on a set of reference images with available ground truth. The hypothesis is that if the predicted segmentation is of good quality, then the reverse classifier will perform well on at least some of the reference images. We validate our approach on multi-organ segmentation with different classifiers and segmentation methods. Our results indicate that it is indeed possible to predict the quality of individual segmentations, in the absence of ground truth. Thus, RCA is ideal for integration into automatic processing pipelines in clinical routine and as part of large-scale image analysis studies.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an extension to the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), namely as ARTGAN to synthetically generate more challenging and complex images such as artwork that have abstract characteristics. This is in contrast to most of the current solutions that focused on generating natural images such as room interiors, birds, flowers and faces. The key innovation of our work is to allow back-propagation of the loss function w.r.t. the labels (randomly assigned to each generated images) to the generator from the discriminator. With the feedback from the label information, the generator is able to learn faster and achieve better generated image quality. Empirically, we show that the proposed ARTGAN is capable to create realistic artwork, as well as generate compelling real world images that globally look natural with clear shape on CIFAR-10.

- **Summary**: To reduce cost in storing, processing and visualizing a large-scale point cloud, we consider a randomized resampling strategy to select a representative subset of points while preserving application-dependent features. The proposed strategy is based on graphs, which can represent underlying surfaces and lend themselves well to efficient computation. We use a general feature-extraction operator to represent application-dependent features and propose a general reconstruction error to evaluate the quality of resampling. We obtain a general form of optimal resampling distribution by minimizing the reconstruction error. The proposed optimal resampling distribution is guaranteed to be shift, rotation and scale-invariant in the 3D space. We next specify the feature-extraction operator to be a graph filter and study specific resampling strategies based on all-pass, low-pass, high-pass graph filtering and graph filter banks. We finally apply the proposed methods to three applications: large-scale visualization, accurate registration and robust shape modeling. The empirical performance validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed resampling methods.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art methods for 3D hand pose estimation from depth images require large amounts of annotated training data. We propose to model the statistical relationships of 3D hand poses and corresponding depth images using two deep generative models with a shared latent space. By design, our architecture allows for learning from unlabeled image data in a semi-supervised manner. Assuming a one-to-one mapping between a pose and a depth map, any given point in the shared latent space can be projected into both a hand pose and a corresponding depth map. Regressing the hand pose can then be done by learning a discriminator to estimate the posterior of the latent pose given some depth maps. To improve generalization and to better exploit unlabeled depth maps, we jointly train a generator and a discriminator. At each iteration, the generator is updated with the back-propagated gradient from the discriminator to synthesize realistic depth maps of the articulated hand, while the discriminator benefits from an augmented training set of synthesized and unlabeled samples. The proposed discriminator network architecture is highly efficient and runs at 90 FPS on the CPU with accuracies comparable or better than state-of-art on 3 publicly available benchmarks.

- **Summary**: We consider the following problem: a team of robots is deployed in an unknown environment and it has to collaboratively build a map of the area without a reliable infrastructure for communication. The backbone for modern mapping techniques is pose graph optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the robots, from which the map can be easily built. The first contribution of this paper is a set of distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization: rather than sending all sensor data to a remote sensor fusion server, the robots exchange very partial and noisy information to reach an agreement on the pose graph configuration. Our approach can be considered as a distributed implementation of the two-stage approach of Carlone et al., where we use the Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) and the Jacobi Over-Relaxation (JOR) as workhorses to split the computation among the robots. As a second contribution, we extend %and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed distributed algorithms to work with object-based map models. The use of object-based models avoids the exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g., point clouds) further reducing the communication burden. Our third contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques, including tests in realistic Gazebo simulations and field experiments in a military test facility. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that one of the proposed algorithms (the Distributed Gauss-Seidel method or DGS) has excellent performance. The DGS requires minimal information exchange, has an anytime flavor, scales well to large teams, is robust to noise, and is easy to implement. Our field tests show that the combined use of our distributed algorithms and object-based models reduces the communication requirements by several orders of magnitude and enables distributed mapping with large teams of robots in real-world problems.

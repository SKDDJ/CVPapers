- **Summary**: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode different types of information and may thus draw information differently from the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data. This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model, capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how outputs borrow from training data.

- **Summary**: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational complexity.

- **Summary**: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone, subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI, with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR: 0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases, outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review (N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations. TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.



### ResPF: Residual Poisson Flow for Efficient and Physically Consistent Sparse-View CT Reconstruction

- **Summary**: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce radiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and diffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical interpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative sampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image synthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate sparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional guidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to significantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps. However, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce unrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each iteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling relies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by electrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency, resulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we introduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with data-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow models to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical datasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality, faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art iterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.

- **Summary**: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks, is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced "Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality, structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately 10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets. Representing a small fraction of DataSeeds.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog, the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our evaluation publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recent research on generative models has primarily focused on creating product-ready visual outputs; however, designers often favor access to standardized asset libraries, a domain that has yet to be significantly enhanced by generative capabilities. Although open-world scenes provide ample raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results in asset extraction. Project page: AssetDropper.github.io.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs, achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6% and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by 6.3${\times}$.

- **Summary**: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on 2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is vital for robust progress in the field.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper, we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference acceleration.



### You Only Estimate Once: Unified, One-stage, Real-Time Category-level Articulated Object 6D Pose Estimation for Robotic Grasping

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data, which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances. The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or computational complexity.

- **Summary**: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures - weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis, experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit instead of Rosin's measure.

- **Summary**: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking sequence. To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple trajectories, opening up a range of applications in sport analysis and virtual replay.

- **Summary**: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions. However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types, they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/ynklab/FILM

- **Summary**: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale conditions.

- **Summary**: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ) Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/stevenlin510/GazeNLQ.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges. Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions, which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking, listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX 4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45 FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140 ms and 215 ms, respectively.

- **Summary**: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity, noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in https://github.com/barry664/DeformCL

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor. We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community. Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second (MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise levels.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively. Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending, and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile framework for font customization tasks.

- **Summary**: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view), the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective (e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives, thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at https://github.com/lovelyqian/ObjectRelator.

- **Summary**: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field, existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics. Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments, and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

- **Summary**: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT) device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32 images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which leads to a diagnosis.   Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the wheals.   Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted image per SPT as input to our method.   Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional, uniform light.

- **Summary**: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

- **Summary**: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search (NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS, the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS. Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

- **Summary**: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck" without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2) multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and (3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025 Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public baseline by 2.77%.

However, most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders, i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder (SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results of grounding manipulated content.

- **Summary**: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of 28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%, which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper, we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is available at link https://github.com/earis/Offsetadjustment\_Background-location\_Decoder\_Mask2former.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and labor-intensive process of data collection and system evaluation. To address these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset, a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants capable of guiding users through diverse tasks. Project page: https://pro-assist.github.io/

- **Summary**: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate, therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic representation of eye images that contains the information required for verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cryptography.



### Rethinking Semi-supervised Segmentation Beyond Accuracy: Reliability and Robustness

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models. Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world deployment needs.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts. However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role. Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints, we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity, facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless, jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and (2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance, streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static 3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry. Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

- **Summary**: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection. However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research. This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA methods in agricultural image analysis.

- **Summary**: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

- **Summary**: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly, the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

- **Summary**: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

- **Summary**: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI). Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then, based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/SSNI.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information.   To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.

- **Summary**: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums). The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of 97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing and modelling codes are publicly available at https://github.com/diehlj/fast-iterated-sums.

- **Summary**: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed. Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection performance and broad application prospects.

- **Summary**: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates. This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

- **Summary**: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation. However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task, and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges. Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales, thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively, and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of FPDANet.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP, and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

- **Summary**: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield. Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology; (2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements. Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

- **Summary**: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need. Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours. A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration. A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour; these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63 longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields the best results on both test datasets.

- **Summary**: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos, while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human. Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm. Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema, outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with 7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet), transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in real-world settings.

- **Summary**: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations, presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations, elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital health tools across clinical domains.

- **Summary**: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE). Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information, and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

- **Summary**: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion, spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

- **Summary**: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery (SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the optimisation of the learning process.

- **Summary**: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision, speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text, and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4 over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50% boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on LongVideoBench.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained crop type classification serves as the fundamental basis for large-scale crop mapping and plays a vital role in ensuring food security. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed hierarchical classification head with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously delivers multi-level crop type classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive comparisons also confirm our method's higher accuracy over existing deep learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

- **Summary**: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors (e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

- **Summary**: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and physical understanding.

- **Summary**: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability. Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without hardware-specific training.

- **Summary**: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery, exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy, with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from 4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning, are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

- **Summary**: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind, that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction.

- **Summary**: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering, facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica datasets.

- **Summary**: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature, comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.

- **Summary**: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

- **Summary**: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization versus 0-30% with standard configurations.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists, `conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems' capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g., Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form. Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like conceptualization in AI visual models.

- **Summary**: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric (third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years, allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications. Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis, and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally, we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives, evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions. By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner.

- **Summary**: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable, high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge, partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral, ``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length, open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs -- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs. These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

- **Comment**: TLDR: We show for the first time that normalizing flows can be scaled
  for high-resolution and text-conditioned image synthesis
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation, we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity, complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization. STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and resolution.

- **Summary**: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains 3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only 44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various physical and procedural domains.

First, LVLMs exhibit a bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations, we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering, demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM architectures.

- **Summary**: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/TerraFM .

- **Summary**: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area. Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However, these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality, mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing geometry and physical properties from video data.

- **Summary**: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction, registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances. Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

- **Summary**: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots, while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time, multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency, edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive autonomous systems.

- **Summary**: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered fitness tracking.

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However, existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

- **Summary**: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

- **Summary**: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps, enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks. The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%. Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the effects of data poisoning attacks.

- **Summary**: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a) classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with 81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile recycling pipelines.

- **Summary**: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos, leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance. To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset, demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments, leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

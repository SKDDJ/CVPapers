- **Summary**: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss. We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion, achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

- **Summary**: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However, current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency, and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality. Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4% over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making. Code and data are publicly available.



### Zero Shot Composed Image Retrieval

- **Summary**: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\% Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2 with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and 50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy, Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii) uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen. Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

- **Summary**: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity, which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2) limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises 620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis, etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at https://github.com/ZMH-SDUST/PhysLab.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in enhancing classical neural network architectures, particularly in domains involving complex, high-dimensional data. Building upon prior work in temporal sequence modeling, this paper introduces Vision-QRWKV, a hybrid quantum-classical extension of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture, applied for the first time to image classification tasks. By integrating a variational quantum circuit (VQC) into the channel mixing component of RWKV, our model aims to improve nonlinear feature transformation and enhance the expressive capacity of visual representations.   We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of 14 medical and standard image classification benchmarks, including MedMNIST datasets, MNIST, and FashionMNIST. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced model outperforms its classical counterpart on a majority of datasets, particularly those with subtle or noisy class distinctions (e.g., ChestMNIST, RetinaMNIST, BloodMNIST). This study represents the first systematic application of quantum-enhanced RWKV in the visual domain, offering insights into the architectural trade-offs and future potential of quantum models for lightweight and efficient vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end, this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates "image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices; at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.



### Dark Channel-Assisted Depth-from-Defocus from a Single Image

- **Summary**: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges, including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar creation.



### DriveSuprim: Towards Precise Trajectory Selection for End-to-End Planning

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely. Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

  2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization. Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on ground-truth perception. Code will be available at https://github.com/NVlabs/GTRS.



### Flood-DamageSense: Multimodal Mamba with Multitask Learning for Building Flood Damage Assessment using SAR Remote Sensing Imagery

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study, Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints. Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County, Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines, with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate" damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable, building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However, most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs' strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2 capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation. RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2 interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks, RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

- **Summary**: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life, affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer, yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM. Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

- **Summary**: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking, combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic control in high-speed dynamic tasks.

- **Summary**: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks. Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer. These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments. We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena, CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand it better.

- **Summary**: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years, numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures, loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation metrics introduced in this work are publicly available and will be regularly updated. Project page: https://github.com/nqian1/Survey-on-ODISR-and-ODVSR.

- **Summary**: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of initial velocities and initial contours.

- **Summary**: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species. The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the best OOD methods, respectively.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices. VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs. To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably, GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline, showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

However, existing datasets lack fine-grained alignment between recipe goals, step-wise instructions, and visual content. We present RecipeGen, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for recipe-based Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Video (I2V), and Text-to-Video (T2V) generation. RecipeGen contains 26,453 recipes, 196,724 images, and 4,491 videos, covering diverse ingredients, cooking procedures, styles, and dish types. We further propose domain-specific evaluation metrics to assess ingredient fidelity and interaction modeling, benchmark representative T2I, I2V, and T2V models, and provide insights for future recipe generation models.

- **Summary**: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task: SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed. Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time, that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly derived from a single-view SAR image.

- **Summary**: Biometric authentication systems are increasingly being deployed in critical applications, but they remain susceptible to spoofing. Since most of the research efforts focus on modality-specific anti-spoofing techniques, building a unified, resource-efficient solution across multiple biometric modalities remains a challenge. To address this, we propose LitMAS, a $\textbf{Li}$gh$\textbf{t}$ weight and generalizable $\textbf{M}$ulti-modal $\textbf{A}$nti-$\textbf{S}$poofing framework designed to detect spoofing attacks in speech, face, iris, and fingerprint-based biometric systems. At the core of LitMAS is a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss, which enhances inter-class separability while preserving cross-modal consistency and enabling robust spoof detection across diverse biometric traits. With just 6M parameters, LitMAS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by $1.36\%$ in average EER across seven datasets, demonstrating high efficiency, strong generalizability, and suitability for edge deployment.

- **Summary**: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed, low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages, tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets, faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in \textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

- **Summary**: In this study, we introduce LoopDB, which is a challenging loop closure dataset comprising over 1000 images captured across diverse environments, including parks, indoor scenes, parking spaces, as well as centered around individual objects. Each scene is represented by a sequence of five consecutive images. The dataset was collected using a high resolution camera, providing suitable imagery for benchmarking the accuracy of loop closure algorithms, typically used in simultaneous localization and mapping. As ground truth information, we provide computed rotations and translations between each consecutive images. Additional to its benchmarking goal, the dataset can be used to train and fine-tune loop closure methods based on deep neural networks. LoopDB is publicly available at https://github.com/RovisLab/LoopDB.

- **Summary**: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances, frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the "Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model retraining or fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies. Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying. To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations. Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D scenes.

- **Summary**: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process? If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets. Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

- **Summary**: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method disentangles the background and entity components in the model's cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across these criteria.

- **Summary**: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes, characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2 foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks, significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical safety and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases, yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline. Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes. While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

- **Summary**: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda) Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation, window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error. This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction, encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.

- **Summary**: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

- **Summary**: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for research in this field.

- **Summary**: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand. Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models. This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by 50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual, audio, and spatial cues.

- **Summary**: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with a maximum gain of 14.81%.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging, particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance.

- **Summary**: Accurate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is vital for early intervention. This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) and Vision Mamba to detect ASD using eye-tracking data. The model uses attention-based fusion to integrate visual, speech, and facial cues, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Unlike traditional handcrafted methods, it applies state-of-the-art deep learning and explainable AI techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy and transparency. Tested on the Saliency4ASD dataset, the proposed ViT-Mamba model outperformed existing methods, achieving 0.96 accuracy, 0.95 F1-score, 0.97 sensitivity, and 0.94 specificity. These findings show the model's promise for scalable, interpretable ASD screening, especially in resource-constrained or remote clinical settings where access to expert diagnosis is limited.

- **Summary**: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image (I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline (Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.

- **Summary**: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction. Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction. We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance, especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps. Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations, improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at https://github.com/nimajam41/3d-knn-defense).

- **Summary**: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes. While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes (GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more accurate than the state of the art.

- **Summary**: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography (PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy, outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet), exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches (MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data, making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

- **Summary**: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption, consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a wearable RGB camera.

- **Summary**: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities. This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

- **Summary**: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings, effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost) queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to 40% in some settings.

- **Summary**: Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous, specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation box.

- **Summary**: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles, where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full 360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models (SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling, replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware, dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput.

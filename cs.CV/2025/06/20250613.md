- **Summary**: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse, such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy image synthesis.

- **Summary**: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines.

- **Summary**: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment. Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is minimized.

- **Summary**: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial relationships in the image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower, which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial relations.

  Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2025
- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs without diminishing overall performance.

- **Summary**: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions represented as two joints or first predict points before determining connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation properties.



### Auditing Data Provenance in Real-world Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Privacy and Copyright Protection

  scenario
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential in real-world applications. Our code is made available at https://github.com/JiePKU/FSCA.



### TAViS: Text-bridged Audio-Visual Segmentation with Foundation Models

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source, multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just 1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for future research and application in digital pathology.

- **Summary**: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection robustness by integrating the detection scores of both watermarks. GaussMarker efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance under eight image distortions and four advanced attacks across three versions of Stable Diffusion with better recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.

- **Summary**: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making. Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA) mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation. Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717 in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

- **Summary**: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples. Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality, widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability, we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC), and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode, where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously. Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46% under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

- **Summary**: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment in real-world forensic and information security applications.



### Environmental Change Detection: Toward a Practical Task of Scene Change Detection

- **Summary**: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene, rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query. In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead, thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach. These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The implementation is available at github.com/efthimia145/sid-composite-data-augmentation.

- **Summary**: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus, the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

- **Summary**: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations, \textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture. In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion. First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture. We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images, and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance. Code and models are available at https://github.com/LooperXX/ManagerTower.

- **Summary**: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

- **Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization.

- **Summary**: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing significant environmental damage and loss of life. Early detection of such events is essential for improving disaster response. In this work, we propose SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to detect extreme events by incorporating multiple pre-disaster observations. This approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types, offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for large-scale disaster monitoring.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods, which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR) demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing, the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/handsomewzy/FCA2.

- **Summary**: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing, neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78. Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores. Our dataset and metric implementation is available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/CGVQM.

- **Summary**: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design. However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion, revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

- **Summary**: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues, we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain, enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

- **Summary**: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced. However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore, evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction. Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task. We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench, further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

- **Summary**: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic. The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms, which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when applied to diverse real-world environments.

- **Summary**: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning, lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset and evaluation code.

- **Summary**: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data. Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain. In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon acceptance.

In contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics, history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music, mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

- **Summary**: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness. Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

- **Summary**: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations: Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder, based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the generated sign videos.

- **Summary**: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin color in ML models.

- **Summary**: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally, we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical kernel-based methods.

- **Summary**: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

- **Summary**: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis. It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain network analysis research.

- **Summary**: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts (D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

- **Summary**: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis. Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First, it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention. This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions. This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

- **Summary**: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries. Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the classification in Task 2.

- **Summary**: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90% mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately 62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/mtabvqa/MTabVQA-Eval) are available online (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MTabVQA-EMNLP-B16E).

- **Summary**: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020 demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation.

Firstly, we demonstrate the impressive performance of the LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three different tasks: Multi-Image Reasoning, Documents and Knowledge-Based Understanding and Interactive Multi-Modal Communication. Secondly, we add the Dense Channel Integration (DCI) connector to the LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave and compare its performance against the standard model. We find that the standard model achieves the highest overall accuracy, excelling in vision-heavy tasks like VISION, NLVR2, and Fashion200K. Meanwhile, the DCI-enhanced version shows particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or structured change understanding such as MIT-States_PropertyCoherence and SlideVQA. Our results highlight the potential of combining powerful foundation models with plug-and-play techniques for Interleave tasks.

- **Summary**: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However, unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging, which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

- **Summary**: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12 spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency, spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR.

- **Summary**: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR, the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering. Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details, the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well requires training data that captures the diversity across users and environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich, virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings. Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing, which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring any manual data collection efforts.

- **Summary**: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury, and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation, we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation, physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical motion.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.



### GPLQ: A General, Practical, and Lightning QAT Method for Vision Transformers

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop, while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization ``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential ``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32 while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2 quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32 training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting multiple vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component, yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space, leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics. We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex stochastic pattern formation.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source, synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency, (de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization ability.

- **Summary**: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide, requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging, electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity modelling and real-time visualization to improve patient-specific diagnosis and intervention planning.

- **Summary**: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design. Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding (SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/eezkni/SSIU

- **Summary**: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars. Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches while having a runtime of only a third.

- **Summary**: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data. MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities, significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05; BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352), MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli (https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and at brainchop.org.

- **Summary**: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing. Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT) adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5% relative improvement.

We describe 3D metric evaluation tools and workflows that enable automated evaluation based on high-resolution reference airborne lidar, and we present results of analyses with data of varying quality.

- **Summary**: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis, and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

- **Summary**: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry, we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for comprehensive 3D completion.

- **Summary**: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

- **Summary**: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker, the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of 17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

- **Summary**: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

- **Summary**: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models (VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains its original language representations without adaptation to visual data. Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations gradually align with language feature representations, converging in middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation learning.

- **Summary**: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

- **Summary**: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process, enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

- **Summary**: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300 features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels, including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics. NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

- **Summary**: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance. The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

- **Summary**: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions. Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling, sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations, together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

- **Summary**: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization, the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain generalization.

- **Summary**: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development, enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However, fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set. Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module, which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities. Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to individual users.

- **Summary**: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses, that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter sizes.

- **Summary**: Reflection removal technology plays a crucial role in photography and computer vision applications. However, existing techniques are hindered by the lack of high-quality in-the-wild datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for collecting reflection datasets from a fresh perspective. Our approach is convenient, cost-effective, and scalable, while ensuring that the collected data pairs are of high quality, perfectly aligned, and represent natural and diverse scenarios. Following this paradigm, we collect a Real-world, Diverse, and Pixel-aligned dataset (named OpenRR-1k dataset), which contains 1,000 high-quality transmission-reflection image pairs collected in the wild. Through the analysis of several reflection removal methods and benchmark evaluation experiments on our dataset, we demonstrate its effectiveness in improving robustness in challenging real-world environments. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-1k.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

- **Summary**: In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact, and contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are utilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at impact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results of the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis players' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for real-time applications.

- **Summary**: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.

- **Summary**: Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in 3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering, particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene representations.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models, classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work, we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: We introduce AdaAct, a novel optimization algorithm that adjusts learning rates according to activation variance. Our method enhances the stability of neuron outputs by incorporating neuron-wise adaptivity during the training process, which subsequently leads to better generalization -- a complementary approach to conventional activation regularization methods. Experimental results demonstrate AdaAct's competitive performance across standard image classification benchmarks. We evaluate AdaAct on CIFAR and ImageNet, comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, AdaAct effectively bridges the gap between the convergence speed of Adam and the strong generalization capabilities of SGD, all while maintaining competitive execution times.

- **Summary**: Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction, overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type, which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions, without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language systems.

- **Summary**: When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing (DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Mrduckk/DCID.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the performance of existing VLMs remains hindered by object hallucination, a critical challenge to achieving accurate visual understanding. To address this issue, we propose SECOND: Selective and Contrastive Decoding, a novel approach that enables VLMs to effectively leverage multi-scale visual information with an object-centric manner, closely aligning with human visual perception. SECOND progressively selects and integrates multi-scale visual information, facilitating a more precise interpretation of images. By contrasting these visual information iteratively, SECOND significantly reduces perceptual hallucinations and outperforms a wide range of benchmarks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments highlight the largely unexplored potential of multi-scale application in VLMs, showing that prioritizing and contrasting across scales outperforms existing methods.

- **Summary**: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network (RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA, two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1 significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and captioning tasks.

- **Summary**: The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1) noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest, which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text multimodal task into a unified text modality.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy, at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate, several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however, contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.   This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak, which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need for more effective defense methods.

- **Summary**: We present FlagEvalMM, an open-source evaluation framework designed to comprehensively assess multimodal models across a diverse range of vision-language understanding and generation tasks, such as visual question answering, text-to-image/video generation, and image-text retrieval. We decouple model inference from evaluation through an independent evaluation service, thus enabling flexible resource allocation and seamless integration of new tasks and models. Moreover, FlagEvalMM utilizes advanced inference acceleration tools (e.g., vLLM, SGLang) and asynchronous data loading to significantly enhance evaluation efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FlagEvalMM offers accurate and efficient insights into model strengths and limitations, making it a valuable tool for advancing multimodal research.

- **Summary**: While current AI illustration tools can generate high-quality images from text prompts, they rarely reveal the step-by-step procedure that human artists follow. We present SakugaFlow, a four-stage pipeline that pairs diffusion-based image generation with a large-language-model tutor. At each stage, novices receive real-time feedback on anatomy, perspective, and composition, revise any step non-linearly, and branch alternative versions. By exposing intermediate outputs and embedding pedagogical dialogue, SakugaFlow turns a black-box generator into a scaffolded learning environment that supports both creative exploration and skills acquisition.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability, recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this, we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant drop in video quality or image fidelity.

- **Summary**: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation. A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i) the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities, making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench, the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities (AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each, AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next generation of VFMs.

- **Summary**: Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of 500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models. Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment evaluation.

- **Summary**: Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However, these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.

- **Summary**: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

- **Summary**: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization, existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both centralized and federated settings.

- **Summary**: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) has become a core component in modern computer vision models. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to input length poses a significant computational bottleneck in real-time and resource constrained environments. We propose PnP-Nystra, a Nystr\"om based linear approximation of self-attention, developed as a plug-and-play (PnP) module that can be integrated into the pre-trained image and video restoration models without retraining. As a drop-in replacement for MHSA, PnP-Nystra enables efficient acceleration in various window-based transformer architectures, including SwinIR, Uformer, and RVRT. Our experiments across diverse image and video restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution, demonstrate that PnP-Nystra achieves a 2-4x speed-up on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU and a 2-5x speed-up on CPU inference. Despite these significant gains, the method incurs a maximum PSNR drop of only 1.5 dB across all evaluated tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a linear attention functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.

- **Summary**: Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance cues. Despite advances in feature representation, current absolute pose regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric details and contextual cues, preserving spatial precision while adapting to environmental changes. We improve the performance of this architecture with semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural information while suppressing complex environmental interference. Experiments on TartanAir demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pose regression methods in challenging scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes, and occlusions. Our findings show that integrating multi-scale processing with semantic guidance offers a promising strategy for robust visual localization in real-world dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$, achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii) Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments ($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber (A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise, anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module, enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal cardiac assessment.

- **Summary**: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic, real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

- **Summary**: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.

- **Summary**: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP) framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.

- **Summary**: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as task-independent biometric systems.

- **Summary**: Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.



### Generating Vision-Language Navigation Instructions Incorporated Fine-Grained Alignment Annotations

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate environments by integrating visual perception and natural language instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories, which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation, and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop, RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal learning in complex navigation tasks.

- **Summary**: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B), our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without performance degradation.

- **Summary**: Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range dependencies, yet their adoption in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is still emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction, multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles: scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead, and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models, illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining, or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for next-generation HSI applications.

- **Summary**: Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness. Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes. Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of robustness and fairness.

- **Summary**: Deep Learning requires large amounts of data to train models that work well. In data-deficient settings, performance can be degraded. We investigate which Deep Learning methods benefit training models in a data-deficient setting, by organizing the "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning" workshop series, featuring four editions of data-impaired challenges. These challenges address the problem of training deep learning models for computer vision tasks with limited data. Participants are limited to training models from scratch using a low number of training samples and are not allowed to use any form of transfer learning. We aim to stimulate the development of novel approaches that incorporate prior knowledge to improve the data efficiency of deep learning models. Successful challenge entries make use of large model ensembles that mix Transformers and CNNs, as well as heavy data augmentation. Novel prior knowledge-based methods contribute to success in some entries.

- **Summary**: This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for photo-interpretation.   We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation, especially in the marine field.

- **Summary**: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions, we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

- **Summary**: Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering, especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

- **Summary**: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains challenging due to low image quality, high intra-class variability, and significant class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful, biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed" path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies 90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy > 0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer categories. These results demonstrate that biologically inspired modular stacking can yield robust, scalable fetal anatomy recognition in challenging clinical settings.

- **Summary**: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation, dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6% mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

- **Summary**: In this article, we present a novel multimodal feedback framework called MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI, synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others. Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral presentation skills.

- **Summary**: We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can provide improved reconstruction results.

- **Summary**: Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image, guided by strong priors about canonical poses. However, existing 3D generative models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data, limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches. Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.

- **Summary**: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

- **Summary**: Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable. Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video memorability prediction.

- **Summary**: Achieving consistent color reproduction across multiple cameras is essential for seamless image fusion and Image Processing Pipeline (ISP) compatibility in modern devices, but it is a challenging task due to variations in sensors and optics. Existing raw-to-raw conversion methods face limitations such as poor adaptability to changing illumination, high computational costs, or impractical requirements such as simultaneous camera operation and overlapping fields-of-view. We introduce the Neural Physical Model (NPM), a lightweight, physically-informed approach that simulates raw images under specified illumination to estimate transformations between devices. The NPM effectively adapts to varying illumination conditions, can be initialized with physical measurements, and supports training with or without paired data. Experiments on public datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB demonstrate that NPM outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, providing robust chromatic consistency across different sensors and optical systems.

- **Summary**: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance, neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions, which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders, preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.

- **Summary**: Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions. Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models, aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim 0.1${\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada, leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution and continental scale.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown exceptional performance in multimodal tasks, but their effectiveness in complex visual reasoning is still constrained, especially when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting techniques. In this paper, we propose VReST, a novel training-free approach that enhances Reasoning in LVLMs through Monte Carlo Tree Search and Self-Reward mechanisms. VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search tree, where each node encapsulates a reasoning step, and each path delineates a comprehensive reasoning sequence. Our innovative multimodal Self-Reward mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues, all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting methods and secures state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, it substantiates the efficacy of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

- **Summary**: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel- and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main

- **Summary**: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support, refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons, and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models, including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning: even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to 77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3 and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

- **Summary**: High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness. We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning. Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements, suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.

- **Summary**: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.

- **Summary**: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

- **Summary**: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24 AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of 1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93). Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

- **Summary**: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood. Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at https://github.com/Wake1021/InceptionMamba.

- **Summary**: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale, high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. To alleviate this issue, we attempt to introduce the Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets into the SSS task since VFMs possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

- **Summary**: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth imagery. However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet, including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and BigEarthNet-L.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data, which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances. However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method. In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement through extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[ -\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \] where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and $\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map $t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$ using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be generalized to the deep model paradigm.

- **Summary**: Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast, and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns, which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'') to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution $p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

- **Summary**: To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation -- specifically the reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization to novel objects/scenarios, and restricted accessibility -- we introduce HunyuanVideo-HOMA, a weakly conditioned multimodal-driven framework. HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer (MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally, HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

- **Summary**: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

- **Summary**: Video content comprehension is essential for various applications, ranging from video analysis to interactive systems. Despite advancements in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal understanding using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities. By making these resources publicly available, we aim to encourage further exploration in this critical area. Project website:https://video-cot.github.io/ .

- **Summary**: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation methodologies.

- **Summary**: Previous studies on event camera sensing have demonstrated certain detection performance using dense event representations. However, the accumulated noise in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16, which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic systems.

- **Summary**: Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals. Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models.

- **Summary**: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.

- **Summary**: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3) maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily long video streams. Code and models are available at https://github.com/nickwzk/StreamSplat.

- **Summary**: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps. Furthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad potential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction tasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.

- **Summary**: The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1.

Integrating diverse knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

- **Summary**: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures. These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in Synapse https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn66401174/files.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available: https://github.com/j-morano/MIRAGE.

- **Summary**: Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment, which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks: class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in open-environment.

- **Summary**: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and has been publicly released.

- **Summary**: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction. Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2 leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage 1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.

- **Summary**: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

- **Summary**: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, MLLM-based virtual agents have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, existing benchmarks face significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity, extensive manual annotation with limited scenarios, and a lack of multidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce OmniBench, a self-generating, cross-platform, graph-based benchmark with an automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional evaluations for various open-source and closed-source models, revealing their performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future advancements.

- **Summary**: In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models (e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong" consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data, fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably, SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/SSS.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral evaluations.

- **Summary**: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments, utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing the performance of existing models.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance improvement on the DOTA dataset.

- **Summary**: Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of diverse visual scenes, has become an important task in computer vision with the rise of generative models. However, existing datasets lack the diversity and scale required to comprehensively explore real-world scenarios. We introduce ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale, real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique objects, each of which is presented across varied positions and scenes. ORIDa has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background) image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.

- **Summary**: Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model, a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene. These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

- **Summary**: LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia experiences and analysis. Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather. To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS) module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.

- **Summary**: The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges - especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex nature of attributes when evaluating bias.



### Efficient Medical Vision-Language Alignment Through Adapting Masked Vision Models

- **Summary**: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/ALTA.

- **Summary**: Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models, have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to "erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity. We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment. This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second, we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP (+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

- **Summary**: As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

- **Summary**: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover, pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab

- **Summary**: Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster and simpler modifications of all pixels sharing a common modality. In this work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting and reflectance variations, which can be used for downstream editing tasks. We rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over 800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.

- **Summary**: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test samples and the training data distribution to identify differences. State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound, histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of their training data for OOD detection services.

- **Summary**: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.

- **Summary**: We introduce Princeton365, a large-scale diverse dataset of 365 videos with accurate camera pose. Our dataset bridges the gap between accuracy and data diversity in current SLAM benchmarks by introducing a novel ground truth collection framework that leverages calibration boards and a 360-camera. We collect indoor, outdoor, and object scanning videos with synchronized monocular and stereo RGB video outputs as well as IMU. We further propose a new scene scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE), allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also propose a challenging Novel View Synthesis benchmark that covers cases not covered by current NVS benchmarks, such as fully non-Lambertian scenes with 360-degree camera trajectories.

- **Summary**: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.

- **Summary**: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.   Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/cosmos_drive_dreams

- **Summary**: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

- **Summary**: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

- **Summary**: Early and accurate detection of brain abnormalities, such as tumors and strokes, is essential for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we present a deep learning-based system capable of identifying both brain tumors and strokes from MRI images, along with their respective stages. We have executed two groundbreaking strategies involving convolutional neural networks, MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50-optimized through transfer learning to classify MRI scans into five diagnostic categories. Our dataset, aggregated and augmented from various publicly available MRI sources, was carefully curated to ensure class balance and image diversity. To enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting, we applied dropout layers and extensive data augmentation. The models achieved strong performance, with training accuracy reaching 93\% and validation accuracy up to 88\%. While ResNet-50 demonstrated slightly better results, Mobile Net V2 remains a promising option for real-time diagnosis in low resource settings due to its lightweight architecture. This research offers a practical AI-driven solution for early brain abnormality detection, with potential for clinical deployment and future enhancement through larger datasets and multi modal inputs.

- **Summary**: The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Lumbar Degenerative Imaging Spine Classification (LumbarDISC) dataset is the largest publicly available dataset of adult MRI lumbar spine examinations annotated for degenerative changes. The dataset includes 2,697 patients with a total of 8,593 image series from 8 institutions across 6 countries and 5 continents. The dataset is available for free for non-commercial use via Kaggle and RSNA Medical Imaging Resource of AI (MIRA). The dataset was created for the RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification competition where competitors developed deep learning models to grade degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. The degree of spinal canal, subarticular recess, and neural foraminal stenosis was graded at each intervertebral disc level in the lumbar spine. The images were annotated by expert volunteer neuroradiologists and musculoskeletal radiologists from the RSNA, American Society of Neuroradiology, and the American Society of Spine Radiology. This dataset aims to facilitate research and development in machine learning and lumbar spine imaging to lead to improved patient care and clinical efficiency.

- **Summary**: The performance of perception systems in autonomous driving systems (ADS) is strongly influenced by object distance, scene dynamics, and environmental conditions such as weather. AI-based perception outputs are inherently stochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while traditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to capture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected, incorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the SensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a sensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear and daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target objects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the variance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD values across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic thresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall perception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance. Applying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful reliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that static metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure of perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation, while the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation. The SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadrivenwheels/sensorrainfall, and the evaluation code is open-sourced at https://github.com/datadrivenwheels/PCD_Python.

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance. Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability. Project page: https://crepavideo.github.io

- **Summary**: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and $68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial settings.

- **Summary**: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification. Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow & Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and 6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence tasks.

- **Summary**: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction, visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of 10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery, making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a 44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the deployment and performance evaluation of a quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model for real-time object detection in aerial emergency imagery on a resource-constrained edge device the Raspberry Pi 5. The YOLOv4-Tiny model was quantized to INT8 precision using TensorFlow Lite post-training quantization techniques and evaluated for detection speed, power consumption, and thermal feasibility under embedded deployment conditions. The quantized model achieved an inference time of 28.2 ms per image with an average power consumption of 13.85 W, demonstrating a significant reduction in power usage compared to its FP32 counterpart. Detection accuracy remained robust across key emergency classes such as Ambulance, Police, Fire Engine, and Car Crash. These results highlight the potential of low-power embedded AI systems for real-time deployment in safety-critical emergency response applications.

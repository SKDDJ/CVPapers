- **Summary**: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify unlabeled samples by leveraging the base knowledge from labeled ones, where the unlabeled set consists of both base and novel classes. Since clustering methods are time-consuming at inference, parametric-based approaches have become more popular. However, recent parametric-based methods suffer from inferior base discrimination due to unreliable self-supervision. To address this issue, we propose a Reciprocal Learning Framework (RLF) that introduces an auxiliary branch devoted to base classification. During training, the main branch filters the pseudo-base samples to the auxiliary branch. In response, the auxiliary branch provides more reliable soft labels for the main branch, leading to a virtuous cycle. Furthermore, we introduce Class-wise Distribution Regularization (CDR) to mitigate the learning bias towards base classes. CDR essentially increases the prediction confidence of the unlabeled data and boosts the novel class performance. Combined with both components, our proposed method, RLCD, achieves superior performance in all classes with negligible extra computation. Comprehensive experiments across seven GCD datasets validate its superiority. Our codes are available at https://github.com/APORduo/RLCD.

- **Summary**: Traditional approaches -- such as Win Probability Added (WPA)-based ranking or computer vision-driven event detection -- can identify scoring plays but often miss strategic depth, momentum shifts, and storyline progression. Manual curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable. We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9% (WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines. Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular, interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization in sports and beyond.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of autonomous driving and extended reality, efficient transmission of point clouds (PCs) has become increasingly important. In this context, we propose a novel channel-adaptive cross-modal generative semantic communication (SemCom) for PC transmission, called GenSeC-PC. GenSeC-PC employs a semantic encoder that fuses images and point clouds, where images serve as non-transmitted side information. Meanwhile, the decoder is built upon the backbone of PointDif. Such a cross-modal design not only ensures high compression efficiency but also delivers superior reconstruction performance compared to PointDif. Moreover, to ensure robust transmission and reduce system complexity, we design a streamlined and asymmetric channel-adaptive joint semantic-channel coding architecture, where only the encoder needs the feedback of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and available bandwidth. In addition, rectified denoising diffusion implicit models is employed to accelerate the decoding process to the millisecond level, enabling real-time PC communication. Unlike existing methods, GenSeC-PC leverages generative priors to ensure reliable reconstruction even from noisy or incomplete source PCs. More importantly, it supports fully analog transmission, improving compression efficiency by eliminating the need for error-free side information transmission common in prior SemCom approaches. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of cross-modal semantic extraction and dual-metric guided fine-tuning, highlighting the framework's robustness across diverse conditions, including low SNR, bandwidth limitations, varying numbers of 2D images, and previously unseen objects.

- **Summary**: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied artificial intelligence. Although significant progress has been made in semantic map construction and target direction prediction in current research, redundant exploration and exploration failures remain inevitable. A critical but underexplored direction is the timely termination of exploration to overcome these challenges. We observe a diminishing marginal effect between exploration steps and exploration rates and analyze the cost-benefit relationship of exploration. Inspired by this, we propose RATE-Nav, a Region-Aware Termination-Enhanced method. It includes a geometric predictive region segmentation algorithm and region-Based exploration estimation algorithm for exploration rate calculation. By leveraging the visual question answering capabilities of visual language models (VLMs) and exploration rates enables efficient termination.RATE-Nav achieves a success rate of 67.8% and an SPL of 31.3% on the HM3D dataset. And on the more challenging MP3D dataset, RATE-Nav shows approximately 10% improvement over previous zero-shot methods.

- **Summary**: Referring video object segmentation aims to segment the object in a video corresponding to a given natural language expression. While prior works have explored various referring scenarios, including motion-centric or multi-instance expressions, most approaches still focus on localizing a single target object in isolation. However, in comprehensive video understanding, an object's role is often defined by its interactions with other entities, which are largely overlooked in existing datasets and models. In this work, we introduce Interaction-aware referring video object sgementation (InterRVOS), a new task that requires segmenting both actor and target entities involved in an interaction. Each interactoin is described through a pair of complementary expressions from different semantic perspectives, enabling fine-grained modeling of inter-object relationships. To tackle this task, we propose InterRVOS-8K, the large-scale and automatically constructed dataset containing diverse interaction-aware expressions with corresponding masks, including challenging cases such as motion-only multi-instance expressions. We also present a baseline architecture, ReVIOSa, designed to handle actor-target segmentation from a single expression, achieving strong performance in both standard and interaction-focused settings. Furthermore, we introduce an actor-target-aware evalaution setting that enables a more targeted assessment of interaction understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods in modeling complex object interactions for referring video object segmentation task, establishing a strong foundation for future research in interaction-centric video understanding.

- **Summary**: The classification of the type of road surface (RSC) aims to utilize pavement features to identify the roughness, wet and dry conditions, and material information of the road surface. Due to its ability to effectively enhance road safety and traffic management, it has received widespread attention in recent years. In autonomous driving, accurate RSC allows vehicles to better understand the road environment, adjust driving strategies, and ensure a safer and more efficient driving experience. For a long time, vision-based RSC has been favored. However, existing visual classification methods have overlooked the exploration of fine-grained classification of pavement types (such as similar pavement textures). In this work, we propose a pure vision-based fine-grained RSC method for autonomous driving scenarios, which fuses local and global feature information through the stacking of convolutional and transformer modules. We further explore the stacking strategies of local and global feature extraction modules to find the optimal feature extraction strategy. In addition, since fine-grained tasks also face the challenge of relatively large intra-class differences and relatively small inter-class differences, we propose a Foreground-Background Module (FBM) that effectively extracts fine-grained context features of the pavement, enhancing the classification ability for complex pavements. Experiments conducted on a large-scale pavement dataset containing one million samples and a simplified dataset reorganized from this dataset achieved Top-1 classification accuracies of 92.52% and 96.50%, respectively, improving by 5.69% to 12.84% compared to SOTA methods. These results demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms existing methods in RSC tasks, providing significant progress in improving the reliability of pavement perception in autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: Great labels make great models. However, traditional labeling approaches for tasks like object detection have substantial costs at scale. Furthermore, alternatives to fully-supervised object detection either lose functionality or require larger models with prohibitive computational costs for inference at scale. To that end, this paper addresses the problem of training standard object detection models without any ground truth labels. Instead, we configure previously-trained vision-language foundation models to generate application-specific pseudo "ground truth" labels. These auto-generated labels directly integrate with existing model training frameworks, and we subsequently train lightweight detection models that are computationally efficient. In this way, we avoid the costs of traditional labeling, leverage the knowledge of vision-language models, and keep the efficiency of lightweight models for practical application. We perform exhaustive experiments across multiple labeling configurations, downstream inference models, and datasets to establish best practices and set an extensive auto-labeling benchmark. From our results, we find that our approach is a viable alternative to standard labeling in that it maintains competitive performance on multiple datasets and substantially reduces labeling time and costs.



### A TRPCA-Inspired Deep Unfolding Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising via Thresholded t-SVD and Top-K Sparse Transformer

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often degraded by complex mixed noise during acquisition and transmission, making effective denoising essential for subsequent analysis. Recent hybrid approaches that bridge model-driven and data-driven paradigms have shown great promise. However, most of these approaches lack effective alternation between different priors or modules, resulting in loosely coupled regularization and insufficient exploitation of their complementary strengths. Inspired by tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA), we propose a novel deep unfolding network (DU-TRPCA) that enforces stage-wise alternation between two tightly integrated modules: low-rank and sparse. The low-rank module employs thresholded tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), providing a widely adopted convex surrogate for tensor low-rankness and has been demonstrated to effectively capture the global spatial-spectral structure of HSIs. The Top-K sparse transformer module adaptively imposes sparse constraints, directly matching the sparse regularization in TRPCA and enabling effective removal of localized outliers and complex noise. This tightly coupled architecture preserves the stage-wise alternation between low-rank approximation and sparse refinement inherent in TRPCA, while enhancing representational capacity through attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world HSIs demonstrate that DU-TRPCA surpasses state-of-the-art methods under severe mixed noise, while offering interpretability benefits and stable denoising dynamics inspired by iterative optimization.

- **Summary**: Data sampling enhances classifier efficiency and robustness through data compression and quality improvement. Recently, the sampling method based on granular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy classification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence of borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or shrinking due to overlap between GBs. In this paper, an approximate borderline sampling method using GBs is proposed for classification tasks. First, a restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which prevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric representation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of heterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling (GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets. Additionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on borderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method and several representative sampling methods.

### ViTNF: Leveraging Neural Fields to Boost Vision Transformers in Generalized Category Discovery

- **Summary**: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a highly popular task in open-world recognition, aiming to identify unknown class samples using known class data. By leveraging pre-training, meta-training, and fine-tuning, ViT achieves excellent few-shot learning capabilities. Its MLP head is a feedforward network, trained synchronously with the entire network in the same process, increasing the training cost and difficulty without fully leveraging the power of the feature extractor. This paper proposes a new architecture by replacing the MLP head with a neural field-based one. We first present a new static neural field function to describe the activity distribution of the neural field and then use two static neural field functions to build an efficient few-shot classifier. This neural field-based (NF) classifier consists of two coupled static neural fields. It stores the feature information of support samples by its elementary field, the known categories by its high-level field, and the category information of support samples by its cross-field connections. We replace the MLP head with the proposed NF classifier, resulting in a novel architecture ViTNF, and simplify the three-stage training mode by pre-training the feature extractor on source tasks and training the NF classifier with support samples in meta-testing separately, significantly reducing ViT's demand for training samples and the difficulty of model training. To enhance the model's capability in identifying new categories, we provide an effective algorithm to determine the lateral interaction scale of the elementary field. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, CUB-200, and Standard Cars, achieving dramatic accuracy improvements of 19\% and 16\% in new and all classes, respectively, indicating a notable advantage in GCD.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging media representation that reconstructs real-world 3D scenes in high fidelity, enabling 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) navigation in virtual reality (VR). However, developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available 6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion, and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction, adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes. The EyeNavGS dataset is available at: https://symmru.github.io/EyeNavGS/.

- **Summary**: Conventional model-based image denoising optimizations employ convex regularization terms, such as total variation (TV) that convexifies the $\ell_0$-norm to promote sparse signal representation. Instead, we propose a new non-convex total variation term in a graph setting (NC-GTV), such that when combined with an $\ell_2$-norm fidelity term for denoising, leads to a convex objective with no extraneous local minima. We define NC-GTV using a new graph variant of the Huber function, interpretable as a Moreau envelope. The crux is the selection of a parameter $a$ characterizing the graph Huber function that ensures overall objective convexity; we efficiently compute $a$ via an adaptation of Gershgorin Circle Theorem (GCT). To minimize the convex objective, we design a linear-time algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and unroll it into a lightweight feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms unrolled GTV and other representative image denoising schemes, while employing far fewer network parameters.

- **Summary**: Action anticipation, the task of predicting future actions from partially observed videos, is crucial for advancing intelligent systems. Unlike action recognition, which operates on fully observed videos, action anticipation must handle incomplete information. Hence, it requires temporal reasoning, and inherent uncertainty handling. While recent advances have been made, traditional methods often focus solely on visual modalities, neglecting the potential of integrating multiple sources of information. Drawing inspiration from human behavior, we introduce \textit{Multi-level and Multi-modal Action Anticipation (m\&m-Ant)}, a novel multi-modal action anticipation approach that combines both visual and textual cues, while explicitly modeling hierarchical semantic information for more accurate predictions. To address the challenge of inaccurate coarse action labels, we propose a fine-grained label generator paired with a specialized temporal consistency loss function to optimize performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets, including Breakfast, 50 Salads, and DARai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average anticipation accuracy improvement of 3.08\% over existing methods. This work underscores the potential of multi-modal and hierarchical modeling in advancing action anticipation and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.

- **Summary**: Plant Disease Detection (PDD) is a key aspect of precision agriculture. However, existing deep learning methods often rely on extensively annotated datasets, which are time-consuming and costly to generate. Self-supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the abundance of unlabeled data. However, most existing SSL approaches suffer from high computational costs due to convolutional neural networks or transformer-based architectures. Additionally, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies in visual representation and rely on static loss functions that fail to align local and global features effectively. To address these challenges, we propose ConMamba, a novel SSL framework specially designed for PDD. ConMamba integrates the Vision Mamba Encoder (VME), which employs a bidirectional State Space Model (SSM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level contrastive loss with dynamic weight adjustment to optimize local-global feature alignment. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics. This provides an efficient and robust solution for PDD.

- **Summary**: Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently published CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy feature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective detection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network (RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net incorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without introducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in RuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be well maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention aggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and fusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve high-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual information between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence, we design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by integrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate that our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and play module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular IRSTD methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yongxianLiu/ soon.

- **Summary**: While nighttime image dehazing has been extensively studied, converting nighttime hazy images to daytime-equivalent brightness remains largely unaddressed. Existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) datasets overlook the brightness relationship between day and night, resulting in the brightness mapping being inconsistent with the real world during image synthesis; and (2) models do not explicitly incorporate daytime brightness knowledge, limiting their ability to reconstruct realistic lighting. To address these challenges, we introduce the Diffusion-Based Nighttime Dehazing (DiffND) framework, which excels in both data synthesis and lighting reconstruction. Our approach starts with a data synthesis pipeline that simulates severe distortions while enforcing brightness consistency between synthetic and real-world scenes, providing a strong foundation for learning night-to-day brightness mapping. Next, we propose a restoration model that integrates a pre-trained diffusion model guided by a brightness perception network. This design harnesses the diffusion model's generative ability while adapting it to nighttime dehazing through brightness-aware optimization. Experiments validate our dataset's utility and the model's superior performance in joint haze removal and brightness mapping.

- **Summary**: Existing LiDAR semantic segmentation models often suffer from decreased accuracy when exposed to adverse weather conditions. Recent methods addressing this issue focus on enhancing training data through weather simulation or universal augmentation techniques. However, few works have studied the negative impacts caused by the heterogeneous domain shifts in the geometric structure and reflectance intensity of point clouds. In this paper, we delve into this challenge and address it with a novel Geometry-Reflectance Collaboration (GRC) framework that explicitly separates feature extraction for geometry and reflectance. Specifically, GRC employs a dual-branch architecture designed to independently process geometric and reflectance features initially, thereby capitalizing on their distinct characteristic. Then, GRC adopts a robust multi-level feature collaboration module to suppress redundant and unreliable information from both branches. Consequently, without complex simulation or augmentation, our method effectively extracts intrinsic information about the scene while suppressing interference, thus achieving better robustness and generalization in adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GRC through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, showing that our method outperforms previous approaches and establishes new state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: As generative techniques become increasingly accessible, authentic visuals are frequently subjected to iterative alterations by various individuals employing a variety of tools. Currently, to avoid misinformation and ensure accountability, a lot of research on detection and attribution is emerging. Although these methods demonstrate promise in single-stage manipulation scenarios, they fall short when addressing complex real-world iterative manipulation. In this paper, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to systematically model this real-world challenge and introduce a novel method to solve it. We define a task called "Modelship Attribution", which aims to trace the evolution of manipulated images by identifying the generative models involved and reconstructing the sequence of edits they performed. To realistically simulate this scenario, we utilize three generative models, StyleMapGAN, DiffSwap, and FacePartsSwap, that sequentially modify distinct regions of the same image. This process leads to the creation of the first modelship dataset, comprising 83,700 images (16,740 images*5). Given that later edits often overwrite the fingerprints of earlier models, the focus shifts from extracting blended fingerprints to characterizing each model's distinctive editing patterns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the modelship attribution transformer (MAT), a purpose-built framework designed to effectively recognize and attribute the contributions of various models within complex, multi-stage manipulation workflows. Through extensive experiments and comparative analysis with other related methods, our results, including comprehensive ablation studies, demonstrate that the proposed approach is a highly effective solution for modelship attribution.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area. The code is https://github.com/DearCaat/E2E-WSI-ABMILX.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models, while trained for image generation, have emerged as powerful foundational feature extractors for downstream tasks. We find that off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained exclusively to generate natural RGB images, can identify semantically meaningful correspondences in medical images. Building on this observation, we propose to leverage diffusion model features as a similarity measure to guide deformable image registration networks. We show that common intensity-based similarity losses often fail in challenging scenarios, such as when certain anatomies are visible in one image but absent in another, leading to anatomically inaccurate alignments. In contrast, our method identifies true semantic correspondences, aligning meaningful structures while disregarding those not present across images. We demonstrate superior performance of our approach on two tasks: multimodal 2D registration (DXA to X-Ray) and monomodal 3D registration (brain-extracted to non-brain-extracted MRI).

- **Summary**: Multimodal functional neuroimaging enables systematic analysis of brain mechanisms and provides discriminative representations for brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding. However, its acquisition is constrained by high costs and feasibility limitations. Moreover, underrepresentation of specific groups undermines fairness of BCI decoding model. To address these challenges, we propose a unified representation framework for multimodal functional neuroimaging via generative artificial intelligence (AI). By mapping multimodal functional neuroimaging into a unified representation space, the proposed framework is capable of generating data for acquisition-constrained modalities and underrepresented groups. Experiments show that the framework can generate data consistent with real brain activity patterns, provide insights into brain mechanisms, and improve performance on downstream tasks. More importantly, it can enhance model fairness by augmenting data for underrepresented groups. Overall, the framework offers a new paradigm for decreasing the cost of acquiring multimodal functional neuroimages and enhancing the fairness of BCI decoding models.

- **Summary**: Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian sequences across modalities by extracting modality-invariant sequence-level features. As a high-level semantic representation, language provides a consistent description of pedestrian characteristics in both infrared and visible modalities. Leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to generate video-level language prompts and guide the learning of modality-invariant sequence-level features is theoretically feasible. However, the challenge of generating and utilizing modality-shared video-level language prompts to address modality gaps remains a critical problem. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet powerful framework, video-level language-driven VVI-ReID (VLD), which consists of two core modules: invariant-modality language prompting (IMLP) and spatial-temporal prompting (STP). IMLP employs a joint fine-tuning strategy for the visual encoder and the prompt learner to effectively generate modality-shared text prompts and align them with visual features from different modalities in CLIP's multimodal space, thereby mitigating modality differences. Additionally, STP models spatiotemporal information through two submodules, the spatial-temporal hub (STH) and spatial-temporal aggregation (STA), which further enhance IMLP by incorporating spatiotemporal information into text prompts. The STH aggregates and diffuses spatiotemporal information into the [CLS] token of each frame across the vision transformer (ViT) layers, whereas STA introduces dedicated identity-level loss and specialized multihead attention to ensure that the STH focuses on identity-relevant spatiotemporal feature aggregation. The VLD framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two VVI-ReID benchmarks. The code will be released at https://github.com/Visuang/VLD.

- **Summary**: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has significant application potential. However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility. Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency. Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences, with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Despite the significant impact of visual events on human cognition, understanding events in videos remains a challenging task for AI due to their complex structures, semantic hierarchies, and dynamic evolution. To address this, we propose the task of video event understanding that extracts event scripts and makes predictions with these scripts from videos. To support this task, we introduce VidEvent, a large-scale dataset containing over 23,000 well-labeled events, featuring detailed event structures, broad hierarchies, and logical relations extracted from movie recap videos. The dataset was created through a meticulous annotation process, ensuring high-quality and reliable event data. We also provide comprehensive baseline models offering detailed descriptions of their architecture and performance metrics. These models serve as benchmarks for future research, facilitating comparisons and improvements. Our analysis of VidEvent and the baseline models highlights the dataset's potential to advance video event understanding and encourages the exploration of innovative algorithms and models. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at www.videvent.top.

- **Summary**: While diffusion models advance text-to-motion generation, their static semantic conditioning ignores temporal-frequency demands: early denoising requires structural semantics for motion foundations while later stages need localized details for text alignment. This mismatch mirrors biological morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs. Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture. ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii) Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining fidelity. **(iii) Temporal-semantic reweighting:** Quantitatively aligns text influence with phase requirements. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.

- **Summary**: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to online adapt a pre-trained model to changing environments during inference. Most existing methods focus on exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID (Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks, demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet effective principle for CTTA.

- **Summary**: Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'), require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. In contrast, LLM-based methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with light wood furniture') but do not support editing, remain limited to rectangular layouts or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries that frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further introduce a novel voxelization-based evaluation that captures fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass state-of-the-art on object addition while maintaining competitive results on full scene synthesis.

- **Summary**: Continual test-time adaptive object detection (CTTA-OD) aims to online adapt a source pre-trained detector to ever-changing environments during inference under continuous domain shifts. Most existing CTTA-OD methods prioritize effectiveness while overlooking computational efficiency, which is crucial for resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient CTTA-OD method via pruning. Our motivation stems from the observation that not all learned source features are beneficial; certain domain-sensitive feature channels can adversely affect target domain performance. Inspired by this, we introduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and instance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively suppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on invariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation mechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful features and mitigating the risks of early pruning. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method achieves superior adaptation performance while reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs compared to the recent SOTA method.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnostics by providing complementary information across different imaging modalities. However, a common challenge in clinical practice is missing MRI modalities. In this paper, we apply SwinUNETR to the synthesize of missing modalities in brain MRI. SwinUNETR is a novel neural network architecture designed for medical image analysis, integrating the strengths of Swin Transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The Swin Transformer, a variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT), incorporates hierarchical feature extraction and window-based self-attention mechanisms, enabling it to capture both local and global contextual information effectively. By combining the Swin Transformer with CNNs, SwinUNETR merges global context awareness with detailed spatial resolution. This hybrid approach addresses the challenges posed by the varying modality characteristics and complex brain structures, facilitating the generation of accurate and realistic synthetic images. We evaluate the performance of SwinUNETR on brain MRI datasets and demonstrate its superior capability in generating clinically valuable images. Our results show significant improvements in image quality, anatomical consistency, and diagnostic value.

In this work, we propose the High Resolution Temporal Transformer (HRTR), to time-localize and classify high-resolution (fine-grained), sub-second actions in a single-stage transformer, eliminating the need for multi-stage methods and post-processing. Without any refinements, HRTR outperforms state-of-the-art systems on both stroke related and general datasets, achieving Edit Score (ES) of 70.1 on StrokeRehab Video, 69.4 on StrokeRehab IMU, and 88.4 on 50Salads.

- **Summary**: Video super-resolution (VSR) is a prominent research topic in low-level computer vision, where deep learning technologies have played a significant role. The rapid progress in deep learning and its applications in VSR has led to a proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature. However, the usage of these methods is often not adequately explained, and decisions are primarily driven by quantitative improvements. Given the significance of VSR's potential influence across multiple domains, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the elements and deep learning methodologies employed in VSR research. This methodical analysis will facilitate the informed development of models tailored to specific application needs. In this paper, we present an overarching overview of deep learning-based video super-resolution models, investigating each component and discussing its implications. Furthermore, we provide a synopsis of key components and technologies employed by state-of-the-art and earlier VSR models. By elucidating the underlying methodologies and categorising them systematically, we identified trends, requirements, and challenges in the domain. As a first-of-its-kind survey of deep learning-based VSR models, this work also establishes a multi-level taxonomy to guide current and future VSR research, enhancing the maturation and interpretation of VSR practices for various practical applications.

- **Summary**: Perceiving the shape and material of an object from a single image is inherently ambiguous, especially when lighting is unknown and unconstrained. Despite this, humans can often disentangle shape and material, and when they are uncertain, they often move their head slightly or rotate the object to help resolve the ambiguities. Inspired by this behavior, we introduce a novel conditional denoising-diffusion model that generates samples of shape-and-material maps from a short video of an object undergoing differential motions. Our parameter-efficient architecture allows training directly in pixel-space, and it generates many disentangled attributes of an object simultaneously. Trained on a modest number of synthetic object-motion videos with supervision on shape and material, the model exhibits compelling emergent behavior: For static observations, it produces diverse, multimodal predictions of plausible shape-and-material maps that capture the inherent ambiguities; and when objects move, the distributions quickly converge to more accurate explanations. The model also produces high-quality shape-and-material estimates for less ambiguous, real-world objects. By moving beyond single-view to continuous motion observations, our work suggests a generative perception approach for improving visual reasoning in physically-embodied systems.

- **Summary**: Current image de-raining methods primarily learn from a limited dataset, leading to inadequate performance in varied real-world rainy conditions. To tackle this, we introduce a new framework that enables networks to progressively expand their de-raining knowledge base by tapping into a growing pool of datasets, significantly boosting their adaptability. Drawing inspiration from the human brain's ability to continuously absorb and generalize from ongoing experiences, our approach borrow the mechanism of the complementary learning system. Specifically, we first deploy Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to capture and retain the unique features of new data, mirroring the hippocampus's role in learning and memory. Then, the de-raining network is trained with both existing and GAN-synthesized data, mimicking the process of hippocampal replay and interleaved learning. Furthermore, we employ knowledge distillation with the replayed data to replicate the synergy between the neocortex's activity patterns triggered by hippocampal replays and the pre-existing neocortical knowledge. This comprehensive framework empowers the de-raining network to amass knowledge from various datasets, continually enhancing its performance on previously unseen rainy scenes. Our testing on three benchmark de-raining networks confirms the framework's effectiveness. It not only facilitates continuous knowledge accumulation across six datasets but also surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to new real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements, exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full (complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice, Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$, outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$ speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing quality.

- **Summary**: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies. Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability. Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling.

- **Summary**: Although existing semi-supervised image segmentation methods have achieved good performance, they cannot effectively utilize multiple sources of voxel-level uncertainty for targeted learning. Therefore, we propose two main improvements. First, we introduce a novel pignistic co-evidential fusion strategy using generalized evidential deep learning, extended by traditional D-S evidence theory, to obtain a more precise uncertainty measure for each voxel in medical samples. This assists the model in learning mixed labeled information and establishing semantic associations between labeled and unlabeled data. Second, we introduce the concept of information volume of mass function (IVUM) to evaluate the constructed evidence, implementing two evidential learning schemes. One optimizes evidential deep learning by combining the information volume of the mass function with original uncertainty measures. The other integrates the learning pattern based on the co-evidential fusion strategy, using IVUM to design a new optimization objective. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.

- **Summary**: 3D plane reconstruction from a single image is a crucial yet challenging topic in 3D computer vision. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have focused on training their system on a single dataset from either indoor or outdoor domain, limiting their generalizability across diverse testing data. In this work, we introduce a novel framework dubbed ZeroPlane, a Transformer-based model targeting zero-shot 3D plane detection and reconstruction from a single image, over diverse domains and environments. To enable data-driven models across multiple domains, we have curated a large-scale planar benchmark, comprising over 14 datasets and 560,000 high-resolution, dense planar annotations for diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. To address the challenge of achieving desirable planar geometry on multi-dataset training, we propose to disentangle the representation of plane normal and offset, and employ an exemplar-guided, classification-then-regression paradigm to learn plane and offset respectively. Additionally, we employ advanced backbones as image encoder, and present an effective pixel-geometry-enhanced plane embedding module to further facilitate planar reconstruction. Extensive experiments across multiple zero-shot evaluation datasets have demonstrated that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods on both reconstruction accuracy and generalizability, especially over in-the-wild data.

- **Summary**: Evaluation is important for multimodal generation tasks. With the rapid progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task, and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper, we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Long video generation has gained increasing attention due to its widespread applications in fields such as entertainment and simulation. Despite advances, synthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by sequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames and then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However, both of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as temporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the hierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a framework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ the Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames with larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the generated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual transitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame interpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of key frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes complex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently refines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame generation. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x interpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent frames. Experiments show that our method can generate long videos with consistent motion and appearance. Code and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the in-context learning mechanism of large language models (LLMs), a new paradigm of generalizable visual prompt-based image editing is emerging. Existing single-reference methods typically focus on style or appearance adjustments and struggle with non-rigid transformations. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging source-target image pairs to extract and transfer content-aware editing intent to novel query images. To this end, we introduce RelationAdapter, a lightweight module that enables Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based models to effectively capture and apply visual transformations from minimal examples. We also introduce Relation252K, a comprehensive dataset comprising 218 diverse editing tasks, to evaluate model generalization and adaptability in visual prompt-driven scenarios. Experiments on Relation252K show that RelationAdapter significantly improves the model's ability to understand and transfer editing intent, leading to notable gains in generation quality and overall editing performance.



### Enhancing Monocular Height Estimation via Weak Supervision from Imperfect Labels

- **Summary**: Monocular height estimation is considered the most efficient and cost-effective means of 3D perception in remote sensing, and it has attracted much attention since the emergence of deep learning. While training neural networks requires a large amount of data, data with perfect labels are scarce and only available within developed regions. The trained models therefore lack generalizability, which limits the potential for large-scale application of existing methods. We tackle this problem for the first time, by introducing data with imperfect labels into training pixel-wise height estimation networks, including labels that are incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate compared to high-quality labels. We propose an ensemble-based pipeline compatible with any monocular height estimation network. Taking the challenges of noisy labels, domain shift, and long-tailed distribution of height values into consideration, we carefully design the architecture and loss functions to leverage the information concealed in imperfect labels using weak supervision through balanced soft losses and ordinal constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets with different resolutions, DFC23 (0.5 to 1 m) and GBH (3 m). The results indicate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baselines by achieving more balanced performance across various domains, leading to improvements of average root mean square errors up to 22.94 %, and 18.62 % on DFC23 and GBH, respectively. The efficacy of each design component is validated through ablation studies. Code is available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/weakim2h.

- **Summary**: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

- **Summary**: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks.

- **Summary**: Machine unlearning is used to mitigate the privacy risks of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) arising from training on large-scale web data. However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses. We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten targets.

- **Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/nklsKrmnn/HIEGNet.git.

- **Summary**: Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis, enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this, prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead, we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining performance under event-budget constraints.

- **Summary**: In this report, we present a novel three-stage framework developed for the Ego4D Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction, action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences. Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction. Our code will be released at https://github.com/CorrineQiu/Ego4D-LTA-Challenge-2025.

- **Summary**: INTRODUCTION: Quantification of amyloid plaques (A), neurofibrillary tangles (T2), and neurodegeneration (N) using PET and MRI is critical for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and prognosis. Existing pipelines face limitations regarding processing time, variability in tracer types, and challenges in multimodal integration.   METHODS: We developed petBrain, a novel end-to-end processing pipeline for amyloid-PET, tau-PET, and structural MRI. It leverages deep learning-based segmentation, standardized biomarker quantification (Centiloid, CenTauR, HAVAs), and simultaneous estimation of A, T2, and N biomarkers. The pipeline is implemented as a web-based platform, requiring no local computational infrastructure or specialized software knowledge.   RESULTS: petBrain provides reliable and rapid biomarker quantification, with results comparable to existing pipelines for A and T2. It shows strong concordance with data processed in ADNI databases. The staging and quantification of A/T2/N by petBrain demonstrated good agreement with CSF/plasma biomarkers, clinical status, and cognitive performance.   DISCUSSION: petBrain represents a powerful and openly accessible platform for standardized AD biomarker analysis, facilitating applications in clinical research.

- **Summary**: The fusion of sensor data is essential for a robust perception of the environment in autonomous driving. Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles. High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\textrm{F}_1$ score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU. Evaluation on a new large-scale real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Their generalizability is further validated by cross-domain evaluation between urban and highway scenarios. Code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/HiLO .

- **Summary**: Foundation models have achieved transformative success across biomedical domains by enabling holistic understanding of multimodal data. However, their application in surgery remains underexplored. Surgical intelligence presents unique challenges - requiring surgical visual perception, temporal analysis, and reasoning. Existing general-purpose vision-language models fail to address these needs due to insufficient domain-specific supervision and the lack of a large-scale high-quality surgical database. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVLM, one of the first large vision-language foundation models for surgical intelligence, where this single universal model can tackle versatile surgical tasks. To enable this, we construct a large-scale multimodal surgical database, SurgVLM-DB, comprising over 1.81 million frames with 7.79 million conversations, spanning more than 16 surgical types and 18 anatomical structures. We unify and reorganize 23 public datasets across 10 surgical tasks, followed by standardizing labels and doing hierarchical vision-language alignment to facilitate comprehensive coverage of gradually finer-grained surgical tasks, from visual perception, temporal analysis, to high-level reasoning. Building upon this comprehensive dataset, we propose SurgVLM, which is built upon Qwen2.5-VL, and undergoes instruction tuning to 10+ surgical tasks. We further construct a surgical multimodal benchmark, SurgVLM-Bench, for method evaluation. SurgVLM-Bench consists of 6 popular and widely-used datasets in surgical domain, covering several crucial downstream tasks. Based on SurgVLM-Bench, we evaluate the performance of our SurgVLM (3 SurgVLM variants: SurgVLM-7B, SurgVLM-32B, and SurgVLM-72B), and conduct comprehensive comparisons with 14 mainstream commercial VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Qwen2.5-Max).

- **Summary**: Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have achieved significant success in aligning visual and textual representations, becoming essential components of many multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA and OpenFlamingo. However, numerous studies have identified CLIP's limited fine-grained perception as a critical drawback, leading to substantial failures in downstream MLLMs. In contrast, vision-centric foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable capabilities in capturing fine details from images. In this work, we propose a novel kernel-based method to align CLIP's visual representation with that of DINOv2, ensuring that the resulting embeddings maintain compatibility with text embeddings while enhancing perceptual capabilities. Our alignment objective is designed for efficient stochastic optimization. Following this image-only alignment fine-tuning, the visual encoder retains compatibility with the frozen text encoder and exhibits significant improvements in zero-shot object recognition, fine-grained spatial reasoning, and localization. By integrating the aligned visual encoder, downstream MLLMs also demonstrate enhanced performance.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and editing tasks. Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise representation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing, and other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer from an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing flexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both semantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In this work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework that jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the inversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a dual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent noise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design anchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to more accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new understanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks, significantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in reconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability approaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.

- **Summary**: The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However, prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability. In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes, outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead, aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.

- **Summary**: Accurate remote sensing geographic mapping depends heavily on representative and timely sample data. However, rapid changes in land surface dynamics necessitate frequent updates, quickly rendering previously collected samples obsolete and imposing significant labor demands for continuous manual updates. In this study, we aim to address this problem by dynamic sample generation using existing single-date static labeled samples. We introduce TasGen, a two-stage automated framework to automatically generate dynamic samples, designed to simultaneously model spectral and temporal dependencies in time-series remote sensing imagery via temporal-spectral embedding, capturing land surface changes without additional manual annotations.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks can extract more accurate structural information via deep architectures to obtain good performance in image super-resolution. However, it is not easy to find effect of important layers in a single network architecture to decrease performance of super-resolution. In this paper, we design a tree-guided CNN for image super-resolution (TSRNet). It uses a tree architecture to guide a deep network to enhance effect of key nodes to amplify the relation of hierarchical information for improving the ability of recovering images. To prevent insufficiency of the obtained structural information, cosine transform techniques in the TSRNet are used to extract cross-domain information to improve the performance of image super-resolution. Adaptive Nesterov momentum optimizer (Adan) is applied to optimize parameters to boost effectiveness of training a super-resolution model. Extended experiments can verify superiority of the proposed TSRNet for restoring high-quality images. Its code can be obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/TSRNet.

- **Summary**: Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is fundamental to fusing multi-modal perception in autonomous driving and robotic systems. Traditional calibration methods require extensive data collection in controlled environments and cannot compensate for the transformation changes during the vehicle/robot movement. In this paper, we propose the first model that uses bird's-eye view (BEV) features to perform LiDAR camera calibration from raw data, termed BEVCALIB. To achieve this, we extract camera BEV features and LiDAR BEV features separately and fuse them into a shared BEV feature space. To fully utilize the geometric information from the BEV feature, we introduce a novel feature selector to filter the most important features in the transformation decoder, which reduces memory consumption and enables efficient training. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, NuScenes, and our own dataset demonstrate that BEVCALIB establishes a new state of the art. Under various noise conditions, BEVCALIB outperforms the best baseline in the literature by an average of (47.08%, 82.32%) on KITTI dataset, and (78.17%, 68.29%) on NuScenes dataset, in terms of (translation, rotation), respectively. In the open-source domain, it improves the best reproducible baseline by one order of magnitude. Our code and demo results are available at https://cisl.ucr.edu/BEVCalib.

- **Summary**: Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention, but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an advancement in hyperspectral data generation.

- **Summary**: Due to strong learning abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they have become mainstream methods for image super-resolution. However, there are big differences of different deep learning methods with different types. There is little literature to summarize relations and differences of different methods in image super-resolution. Thus, summarizing these literatures are important, according to loading capacity and execution speed of devices. This paper first introduces principles of CNNs in image super-resolution, then introduces CNNs based bicubic interpolation, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, transposed convolution, sub-pixel layer, meta up-sampling for image super-resolution to analyze differences and relations of different CNNs based interpolations and modules, and compare performance of these methods by experiments. Finally, this paper gives potential research points and drawbacks and summarizes the whole paper, which can facilitate developments of CNNs in image super-resolution.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based models have been widely used in various visual generation tasks, showing promising results in image super-resolution (SR), while typically being limited by dozens or even hundreds of sampling steps. Although existing methods aim to accelerate the inference speed of multi-step diffusion-based SR methods through knowledge distillation, their generated images exhibit insufficient semantic alignment with real images, resulting in suboptimal perceptual quality reconstruction, specifically reflected in the CLIPIQA score. These methods still have many challenges in perceptual quality and semantic fidelity. Based on the challenges, we propose VPD-SR, a novel visual perception diffusion distillation framework specifically designed for SR, aiming to construct an effective and efficient one-step SR model. Specifically, VPD-SR consists of two components: Explicit Semantic-aware Supervision (ESS) and High-Frequency Perception (HFP) loss. Firstly, the ESS leverages the powerful visual perceptual understanding capabilities of the CLIP model to extract explicit semantic supervision, thereby enhancing semantic consistency. Then, Considering that high-frequency information contributes to the visual perception quality of images, in addition to the vanilla distillation loss, the HFP loss guides the student model to restore the missing high-frequency details in degraded images that are critical for enhancing perceptual quality. Lastly, we expand VPD-SR in adversarial training manner to further enhance the authenticity of the generated content. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed VPD-SR achieves superior performance compared to both previous state-of-the-art methods and the teacher model with just one-step sampling.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a hierarchical question-answering (QA) approach for scene understanding in autonomous vehicles, balancing cost-efficiency with detailed visual interpretation. The method fine-tunes a compact vision-language model (VLM) on a custom dataset specific to the geographical area in which the vehicle operates to capture key driving-related visual elements. At the inference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of generating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree, where answering high-level questions (e.g., "Is it possible for the ego vehicle to turn left at the intersection?") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g., "Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite direction?"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped based on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted answers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent, contextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on the custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key scene details while achieving significantly lower inference time. Moreover, qualitative results from real-time deployment highlight the proposed approach's capacity to capture key driving elements with minimal latency.

- **Summary**: Understanding and predicting articulated actions is important in robot learning. However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction, showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image 3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in various domains.

- **Summary**: Texture map production is an important part of 3D modeling and determines the rendering quality. Recently, diffusion-based methods have opened a new way for texture generation. However, restricted control flexibility and limited prompt modalities may prevent creators from producing desired results. Furthermore, inconsistencies between generated multi-view images often lead to poor texture generation quality. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FlexPainter}, a novel texture generation pipeline that enables flexible multi-modal conditional guidance and achieves highly consistent texture generation. A shared conditional embedding space is constructed to perform flexible aggregation between different input modalities. Utilizing such embedding space, we present an image-based CFG method to decompose structural and style information, achieving reference image-based stylization. Leveraging the 3D knowledge within the image diffusion prior, we first generate multi-view images simultaneously using a grid representation to enhance global understanding. Meanwhile, we propose a view synchronization and adaptive weighting module during diffusion sampling to further ensure local consistency. Finally, a 3D-aware texture completion model combined with a texture enhancement model is used to generate seamless, high-resolution texture maps. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both flexibility and generation quality.

- **Summary**: Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective, balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost. This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures. Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS, this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process. Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal solutions for heterogeneous task settings.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes ControlMambaIR, a novel image restoration method designed to address perceptual challenges in image deraining, deblurring, and denoising tasks. By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model, the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods in perceptual quality metrics, such as LPIPS and FID, while maintaining comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability. Notably, ablation experiments reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models, outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context. Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual challenges.

- **Summary**: Generating long-term, coherent, and realistic music-conditioned dance sequences remains a challenging task in human motion synthesis. Existing approaches exhibit critical limitations: motion graph methods rely on fixed template libraries, restricting creative generation; diffusion models, while capable of producing novel motions, often lack temporal coherence and musical alignment. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{MotionRAG-Diff}$, a hybrid framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with diffusion-based refinement to enable high-quality, musically coherent dance generation for arbitrary long-term music inputs. Our method introduces three core innovations: (1) A cross-modal contrastive learning architecture that aligns heterogeneous music and dance representations in a shared latent space, establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence without paired data; (2) An optimized motion graph system for efficient retrieval and seamless concatenation of motion segments, ensuring realism and temporal coherence across long sequences; (3) A multi-condition diffusion model that jointly conditions on raw music signals and contrastive features to enhance motion quality and global synchronization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionRAG-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion quality, diversity, and music-motion synchronization accuracy. This work establishes a new paradigm for music-driven dance generation by synergizing retrieval-based template fidelity with diffusion-based creative enhancement.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing the generalization capability of vision-language models (VLMs) during inference. However, existing approaches often incur substantial computational costs and exhibit poor scalability, primarily due to sample-wise adaptation granularity and reliance on costly auxiliary designs such as data augmentation. To address these limitations, we introduce SAIL (Small Aid, Big Leap), a novel adapter-based TTA framework that leverages a lightweight, learnable AdaptNet to enable efficient and scalable model adaptation. As SAIL's core, a frozen pre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based interpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These predictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs through efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational costs without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a gradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which dynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for stable adaptation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks on two scenarios demonstrate that SAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational costs. These results highlight SAIL's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment. The code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited annotations. Current methods typically compare the distance between training and testing samples for mask prediction. However, we find an entanglement problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind sourcedomain patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

- **Summary**: Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to generate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic text-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these models should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but that approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key obstacles: (i) the encoding into a lower-dimensional latent space makes the underlying (forward) mapping non-linear; (ii) the data likelihood term is usually intractable; and (iii) learned generative models struggle to recover rare, atypical data modes during inference. We present FLAIR, a novel training free variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as a prior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective for flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it with deterministic trajectory adjustments to recover atypical modes. To enforce exact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the data fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent calibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated according to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion- and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.

- **Summary**: Geometry problem solving (GPS) represents a critical frontier in artificial intelligence, with profound applications in education, computer-aided design, and computational graphics. Despite its significance, automating GPS remains challenging due to the dual demands of spatial understanding and rigorous logical reasoning. Recent advances in large models have enabled notable breakthroughs, particularly for SAT-level problems, yet the field remains fragmented across methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks. This survey systematically synthesizes GPS advancements through three core dimensions: (1) benchmark construction, (2) textual and diagrammatic parsing, and (3) reasoning paradigms. We further propose a unified analytical paradigm, assess current limitations, and identify emerging opportunities to guide future research toward human-level geometric reasoning, including automated benchmark generation and interpretable neuro-symbolic integration.

- **Summary**: Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) has the potential to revolutionize modern surgery, with surgical scene understanding serving as a critical component in supporting decision-making, improving procedural efficacy, and ensuring intraoperative safety. While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate annotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their lack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts the capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete spatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level surgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal representation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this, we constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and approximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures and over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose SurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a reconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial structures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling. Additionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided by a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical and semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a comprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six surgical procedures across four tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgVISTA consistently outperforms both natural- and surgical-domain pre-trained models, demonstrating strong potential to advance intelligent surgical systems in clinically meaningful scenarios.



### FaceSleuth: Learning-Driven Single-Orientation Attention Verifies Vertical Dominance in Micro-Expression Recognition

- **Summary**: Micro-expression recognition (MER) demands models that can amplify millisecond-level, low-amplitude facial motions while suppressing identity-specific appearance. We introduce FaceSleuth, a dual-stream architecture that (1) enhances motion along the empirically dominant vertical axix through a Continuously Vertical Attention (CVA) block, (2) localises the resulting signals with a Facial Position Focalizer built on hierarchical cross-window attention, and (3) steers feature learning toward physiologically meaningful regions via lightweight Action-Unit embeddings. To examine whether the hand-chosen vertical axis is indeed optimal, we further propose a Single-Orientation Attention (SOA) module that learns its own pooling direction end-to-end. SOA is differentiable, adds only 0.16 % parameters, and collapses to CVA when the learned angle converges to {\Pi}/2. In practice, SOA reliably drifts to 88{\deg}, confirming the effectiveness of the vertical prior while delivering consistent gains. On three standard MER benchmarks, FaceSleuth with CVA already surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods; plugging in SOA lifts accuracy and F1 score performance to 95.1 % / 0.918 on CASME II, 87.1 % / 0.840 on SAMM, and 92.9 % / 0.917 on MMEW without sacrificing model compactness. These results establish a new state of the art and, for the first time, provide empirical evidence that the vertical attention bias is the most discriminative orientation for MER.

- **Summary**: Controllable layout generation aims to create plausible visual arrangements of element bounding boxes within a graphic design according to certain optional constraints, such as the type or position of a specific component. While recent diffusion or flow-matching models have achieved considerable advances in multifarious conditional generation tasks, there remains considerable room for generating optimal arrangements under given conditions. In this work, we propose to carry out layout generation through retrieving by conditions and reference-guided generation. Specifically, we retrieve appropriate layout templates according to given conditions as references. The references are then utilized to guide the denoising or flow-based transport process. By retrieving layouts compatible with the given conditions, we can uncover the potential information not explicitly provided in the given condition. Such an approach offers more effective guidance to the model during the generation process, in contrast to previous models that feed the condition to the model and let the model infer the unprovided layout attributes directly. Meanwhile, we design a condition-modulated attention that selectively absorbs retrieval knowledge, adapting to the difference between retrieved templates and given conditions. Extensive experiment results show that our method successfully produces high-quality layouts that meet the given conditions and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aligns text-to-image (T2I) generation models with human preferences using pairwise preference data. Although substantial resources are expended in collecting and labeling datasets, a critical aspect is often neglected: \textit{preferences vary across individuals and should be represented with more granularity.} To address this, we propose SmPO-Diffusion, a novel method for modeling preference distributions to improve the DPO objective, along with a numerical upper bound estimation for the diffusion optimization objective. First, we introduce a smoothed preference distribution to replace the original binary distribution. We employ a reward model to simulate human preferences and apply preference likelihood averaging to improve the DPO loss, such that the loss function approaches zero when preferences are similar. Furthermore, we utilize an inversion technique to simulate the trajectory preference distribution of the diffusion model, enabling more accurate alignment with the optimization objective. Our approach effectively mitigates issues of excessive optimization and objective misalignment present in existing methods through straightforward modifications. Our SmPO-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in preference evaluation, outperforming baselines across metrics with lower training costs.

- **Summary**: We introduce ToothForge, a spectral approach for automatically generating novel 3D teeth, effectively addressing the sparsity of dental shape datasets. By operating in the spectral domain, our method enables compact machine learning modeling, allowing the generation of high-resolution tooth meshes in milliseconds. However, generating shape spectra comes with the instability of the decomposed harmonics. To address this, we propose modeling the latent manifold on synchronized frequential embeddings. Spectra of all data samples are aligned to a common basis prior to the training procedure, effectively eliminating biases introduced by the decomposition instability. Furthermore, synchronized modeling removes the limiting factor imposed by previous methods, which require all shapes to share a common fixed connectivity. Using a private dataset of real dental crowns, we observe a greater reconstruction quality of the synthetized shapes, exceeding those of models trained on unaligned embeddings. We also explore additional applications of spectral analysis in digital dentistry, such as shape compression and interpolation. ToothForge facilitates a range of approaches at the intersection of spectral analysis and machine learning, with fewer restrictions on mesh structure. This makes it applicable for shape analysis not only in dentistry, but also in broader medical applications, where guaranteeing consistent connectivity across shapes from various clinics is unrealistic.

- **Summary**: Image scoring is a crucial task in numerous real-world applications. To trust a model's judgment, understanding its rationale is essential. This paper proposes a novel training method for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to generate not only image scores but also corresponding justifications in natural language. Leveraging only an image scoring dataset and an instruction-tuned VLM, our method enables self-training, utilizing the VLM's generated text without relying on external data or models. In addition, we introduce a simple method for creating a dataset designed to improve alignment between predicted scores and their textual justifications. By iteratively training the model with Direct Preference Optimization on two distinct datasets and merging them, we can improve both scoring accuracy and the coherence of generated explanations.

- **Summary**: Accurately estimating high-resolution carbon emissions is crucial for effective emission governance and mitigation planning. While conventional methods for precise carbon accounting are hindered by substantial data collection efforts, the rise of open data and advanced learning techniques offers a promising solution. Once an open data-based prediction model is developed and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on available open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open data, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict high-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing macroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively dynamic functionality information. However, estimating high-resolution carbon emissions presents two significant challenges: the intertwined and implicit effects of various functionalities on carbon emissions, and the complex spatial contiguity correlations that give rise to the agglomeration effect. Our model, OpenCarbon, features two major designs that target the challenges: a cross-modality information extraction and fusion module to extract complementary functionality information from two modules and model their interactions, and a neighborhood-informed aggregation module to capture the spatial contiguity correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's superiority, with a significant performance gain of 26.6\% on R2. Further generalizability tests and case studies also show OpenCarbon's capacity to capture the intrinsic relation between urban functionalities and carbon emissions, validating its potential to empower efficient carbon governance and targeted carbon mitigation planning.

- **Summary**: Existing optical flow datasets focus primarily on real-world simulation or synthetic human motion, but few are tailored to Celluloid(cel) anime character motion: a domain with unique visual and motion characteristics. To bridge this gap and facilitate research in optical flow estimation and downstream tasks such as anime video generation and line drawing colorization, we introduce LinkTo-Anime, the first high-quality dataset specifically designed for cel anime character motion generated with 3D model rendering. LinkTo-Anime provides rich annotations including forward and backward optical flow, occlusion masks, and Mixamo Skeleton. The dataset comprises 395 video sequences, totally 24,230 training frames, 720 validation frames, and 4,320 test frames. Furthermore, a comprehensive benchmark is constructed with various optical flow estimation methods to analyze the shortcomings and limitations across multiple datasets.

- **Summary**: Existing semantic SLAM in dynamic environments mainly identify dynamic regions through object detection or semantic segmentation methods. However, in certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks cannot fully cover dynamic regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects. Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2 maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods.

- **Summary**: Compound figures, which are multi-panel composites containing diverse subfigures, are ubiquitous in biomedical literature, yet large-scale subfigure extraction remains largely unaddressed. Prior work on subfigure extraction has been limited in both dataset size and generalizability, leaving a critical open question: How does high-fidelity image-text alignment via large-scale subfigure extraction impact representation learning in vision-language models? We address this gap by introducing a scalable subfigure extraction pipeline based on transformer-based object detection, trained on a synthetic corpus of 500,000 compound figures, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both ImageCLEF 2016 and synthetic benchmarks. Using this pipeline, we release OPEN-PMC-18M, a large-scale high quality biomedical vision-language dataset comprising 18 million clinically relevant subfigure-caption pairs spanning radiology, microscopy, and visible light photography. We train and evaluate vision-language models on our curated datasets and show improved performance across retrieval, zero-shot classification, and robustness benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines. We release our dataset, models, and code to support reproducible benchmarks and further study into biomedical vision-language modeling and representation learning.

- **Summary**: Jointly estimating camera poses and mapping scenes from RGBD images is a fundamental task in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). State-of-the-art methods employ 3D Gaussians to represent a scene, and render these Gaussians through splatting for higher efficiency and better rendering. However, these methods cannot scale up to extremely large scenes, due to the inefficient tracking and mapping strategies that need to optimize all 3D Gaussians in the limited GPU memories throughout the training to maintain the geometry and color consistency to previous RGBD observations. To resolve this issue, we propose novel tracking and mapping strategies to work with a novel 3D representation, dubbed view-tied 3D Gaussians, for RGBD SLAM systems. View-tied 3D Gaussians is a kind of simplified Gaussians, which is tied to depth pixels, without needing to learn locations, rotations, and multi-dimensional variances. Tying Gaussians to views not only significantly saves storage but also allows us to employ many more Gaussians to represent local details in the limited GPU memory. Moreover, our strategies remove the need of maintaining all Gaussians learnable throughout the training, while improving rendering quality, and tracking accuracy. We justify the effectiveness of these designs, and report better performance over the latest methods on the widely used benchmarks in terms of rendering and tracking accuracy and scalability.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling. However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning (MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU) still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially for preservation and robustness.

- **Summary**: Computational human attention modeling in free-viewing and task-specific settings is often studied separately, with limited exploration of whether a common representation exists between them. This work investigates this question and proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon the Human Attention transformer (HAT) to test the hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that free-viewing and visual search can efficiently share a common representation, allowing a model trained in free-viewing attention to transfer its knowledge to task-driven visual search with a performance drop of only 3.86% in the predicted fixation scanpaths, measured by the semantic sequence score (SemSS) metric which reflects the similarity between predicted and human scanpaths. This transfer reduces computational costs by 92.29% in terms of GFLOPs and 31.23% in terms of trainable parameters.

- **Summary**: Stable consumer electronic systems can assist traffic better. Good traffic consumer electronic systems require collaborative work between traffic algorithms and hardware. However, performance of popular traffic algorithms containing vehicle detection methods based on deep networks via learning data relation rather than learning differences in different lighting and occlusions is limited. In this paper, we present a dynamic Transformer network for vehicle detection (DTNet). DTNet utilizes a dynamic convolution to guide a deep network to dynamically generate weights to enhance adaptability of an obtained detector. Taking into relations of different information account, a mixed attention mechanism based channel attention and Transformer is exploited to strengthen relations of channels and pixels to extract more salient information for vehicle detection. To overcome the drawback of difference in an image account, a translation-variant convolution relies on spatial location information to refine obtained structural information for vehicle detection. Experimental results illustrate that our DTNet is competitive for vehicle detection. Code of the proposed DTNet can be obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/DTNet.

- **Summary**: Controllability plays a crucial role in the practical applications of 3D indoor scene synthesis. Existing works either allow rough language-based control, that is convenient but lacks fine-grained scene customization, or employ graph based control, which offers better controllability but demands considerable knowledge for the cumbersome graph design process. To address these challenges, we present FreeScene, a user-friendly framework that enables both convenient and effective control for indoor scene synthesis.Specifically, FreeScene supports free-form user inputs including text description and/or reference images, allowing users to express versatile design intentions. The user inputs are adequately analyzed and integrated into a graph representation by a VLM-based Graph Designer. We then propose MG-DiT, a Mixed Graph Diffusion Transformer, which performs graph-aware denoising to enhance scene generation. Our MG-DiT not only excels at preserving graph structure but also offers broad applicability to various tasks, including, but not limited to, text-to-scene, graph-to-scene, and rearrangement, all within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeScene provides an efficient and user-friendly solution that unifies text-based and graph based scene synthesis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of both generation quality and controllability in a range of applications.

- **Summary**: Objective. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is recognized as a biomarker of secondary brain injury, with a significant linear correlation observed between optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and ICP. Frequent monitoring of ONSD could effectively support dynamic evaluation of ICP. However, ONSD measurement is heavily reliant on the operator's experience and skill, particularly in manually selecting the optimal frame from ultrasound sequences and measuring ONSD. Approach. This paper presents a novel method to automatically identify the optimal frame from video sequences for ONSD measurement by employing the Kernel Correlation Filter (KCF) tracking algorithm and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) segmentation algorithm. The optic nerve sheath is mapped and measured using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with a KL-divergence-based method. Results. When compared with the average measurements of two expert clinicians, the proposed method achieved a mean error, mean squared deviation, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.04, 0.054, and 0.782, respectively. Significance. The findings suggest that this method provides highly accurate automated ONSD measurements, showing potential for clinical application.

- **Summary**: We introduce PhysGaia, a novel physics-aware dataset specifically designed for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (DyNVS), encompassing both structured objects and unstructured physical phenomena. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas, viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information, including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful reconstruction and interpretation of complex dynamic scenes. Our datasets and codes are available in the project website, http://cvlab.snu.ac.kr/research/PhysGaia.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging, security, and beyond.

- **Summary**: In the context of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), each training sample is associated with a set of candidate labels annotated by multiple noisy annotators. With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVa and GPT-4V, the direction of using these models to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve "manual-annotation-free" training for downstream tasks has become a highly promising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial labels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise primarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by pre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of the pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning difficulty for the model. To address this, we simultaneously train two neural networks that implement collaborative purification of training labels through a "Co-Pseudo-Labeling" mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization constraints in both the label space and feature representation space. Our method can also leverage few-shot manually annotated valid labels to further enhance its performances. Comparative experiments with different denoising and disambiguation algorithms, annotation manners, and pre-trained model application schemes fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, while revealing the broad prospects of integrating weakly-supervised learning techniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models.

- **Summary**: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) aims to transfer knowledge from a data-sufficient source domain to data-scarce target domains. Although Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown superior capability in many vision tasks, its transferability against huge domain gaps in CDFSL is still under-explored. In this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon: during the source-domain training, prompt tuning, as a common way to train ViT, could be harmful for the generalization of ViT in target domains, but setting them to random noises (i.e., random registers) could consistently improve target-domain performance. We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that learnable prompts capture domain information during the training on the source dataset, which views irrelevant visual patterns as vital cues for recognition. This can be viewed as a kind of overfitting and increases the sharpness of the loss landscapes. In contrast, random registers are essentially a novel way of perturbing attention for the sharpness-aware minimization, which helps the model find a flattened minimum in loss landscapes, increasing the transferability. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further propose a simple but effective approach for CDFSL to enhance the perturbation on attention maps by adding random registers on the semantic regions of image tokens, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of random registers. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and state-of-the-art performance. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/shuaiyi308/REAP.

- **Summary**: Despite substantial progress in video understanding, most existing datasets are limited to Earth's gravitational conditions. However, microgravity alters human motion, interactions, and visual semantics, revealing a critical gap for real-world vision systems. This presents a challenge for domain-robust video understanding in safety-critical space applications. To address this, we introduce MicroG-4M, the first benchmark for spatio-temporal and semantic understanding of human activities in microgravity. Constructed from real-world space missions and cinematic simulations, the dataset includes 4,759 clips covering 50 actions, 1,238 context-rich captions, and over 7,000 question-answer pairs on astronaut activities and scene understanding. MicroG-4M supports three core tasks: fine-grained multi-label action recognition, temporal video captioning, and visual question answering, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both spatial localization and semantic reasoning in microgravity contexts. We establish baselines using state-of-the-art models. All data, annotations, and code are available at https://github.com/LEI-QI-233/HAR-in-Space.

- **Summary**: We present PBR-SR, a novel method for physically based rendering (PBR) texture super resolution (SR). It outputs high-resolution, high-quality PBR textures from low-resolution (LR) PBR input in a zero-shot manner. PBR-SR leverages an off-the-shelf super-resolution model trained on natural images, and iteratively minimizes the deviations between super-resolution priors and differentiable renderings. These enhancements are then back-projected into the PBR map space in a differentiable manner to produce refined, high-resolution textures. To mitigate view inconsistencies and lighting sensitivity, which is common in view-based super-resolution, our method applies 2D prior constraints across multi-view renderings, iteratively refining the shared, upscaled textures. In parallel, we incorporate identity constraints directly in the PBR texture domain to ensure the upscaled textures remain faithful to the LR input. PBR-SR operates without any additional training or data requirements, relying entirely on pretrained image priors. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-fidelity PBR textures for both artist-designed and AI-generated meshes, outperforming both direct SR models application and prior texture optimization methods. Our results show high-quality outputs in both PBR and rendering evaluations, supporting advanced applications such as relighting.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to understand video content. Nonetheless, processing long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1) event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and (3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.

- **Summary**: Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

- **Summary**: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable. Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM (HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Detecting deepfakes has become a critical challenge in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. Despite significant progress in detection techniques, generalizing them to open-set scenarios continues to be a persistent difficulty. Neural networks are often trained on the closed-world assumption, but with new generative models constantly evolving, it is inevitable to encounter data generated by models that are not part of the training distribution. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose two novel Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection approaches. The first approach is trained to reconstruct the input image, while the second incorporates an attention mechanism for detecting OODs. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our method achieves promising results in deepfake detection and ranks among the top-performing configurations on the benchmark, demonstrating their potential for robust, adaptable solutions in dynamic, real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is a fundamental task with widespread applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and maritime robotics. Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections, low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences, totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios, reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated 14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized tracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking community by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime scenarios.

- **Summary**: Accurate mapping of permafrost landforms, thaw disturbances, and human-built infrastructure at pan-Arctic scale using sub-meter satellite imagery is increasingly critical. Handling petabyte-scale image data requires high-performance computing and robust feature detection models. While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely used for remote sensing (RS),similar to the success in transformer based large language models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs support pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on benchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization, especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as feature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three tasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with location embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks including F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS applications.

- **Summary**: Improving robustness of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to input degradations is critical for its deployment in high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Our approach to this challenge prioritizes three key aspects: first, parameter efficiency to maintain the inherent generalization capability of SAM; second, fine-grained and input-aware robustification to precisely address the input corruption; and third, adherence to standard training protocols for ease of training. To this end, we propose gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module. This adjustment enables fine-grained and input-aware robustification without compromising the generalization capability of SAM. Our model, GaRA-SAM, significantly outperforms prior work on all robust segmentation benchmarks. In particular, it surpasses the previous best IoU score by up to 21.3\%p on ACDC, a challenging real corrupted image dataset.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in automatic facial behavior analysis systems from computing communities such as vision, multimodal interaction, robotics, and affective computing. Building upon the widespread utility of prior open-source facial analysis systems, we introduce OpenFace 3.0, an open-source toolkit capable of facial landmark detection, facial action unit detection, eye-gaze estimation, and facial emotion recognition. OpenFace 3.0 contributes a lightweight unified model for facial analysis, trained with a multi-task architecture across diverse populations, head poses, lighting conditions, video resolutions, and facial analysis tasks. By leveraging the benefits of parameter sharing through a unified model and training paradigm, OpenFace 3.0 exhibits improvements in prediction performance, inference speed, and memory efficiency over similar toolkits and rivals state-of-the-art models. OpenFace 3.0 can be installed and run with a single line of code and operate in real-time without specialized hardware. OpenFace 3.0 code for training models and running the system is freely available for research purposes and supports contributions from the community.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we speed up robust two-view relative pose from dense correspondences. Previous work has shown that dense matchers can significantly improve both accuracy and robustness in the resulting pose. However, the large number of matches comes with a significantly increased runtime during robust estimation in RANSAC. To avoid this, we propose an efficient match summarization scheme which provides comparable accuracy to using the full set of dense matches, while having 10-100x faster runtime. We validate our approach on standard benchmark datasets together with multiple state-of-the-art dense matchers.

- **Summary**: Accurate food volume estimation is crucial for dietary monitoring, medical nutrition management, and food intake analysis. Existing 3D Food Volume estimation methods accurately compute the food volume but lack for food portions selection. We present VolTex, a framework that improves \change{the food object selection} in food volume estimation. Allowing users to specify a target food item via text input to be segmented, our method enables the precise selection of specific food objects in real-world scenes. The segmented object is then reconstructed using the Neural Surface Reconstruction method to generate high-fidelity 3D meshes for volume computation. Extensive evaluations on the MetaFood3D dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in isolating and reconstructing food items for accurate volume estimation. The source code is accessible at https://github.com/GCVCG/VolTex.

- **Summary**: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor, photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark, scenarios, and the underlying codebase.



### Towards Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines: A Benchmark through 3D LiDAR Detection

- **Summary**: A crucial yet under-appreciated prerequisite in machine learning solutions for real-applications is data annotation: human annotators are hired to manually label data according to detailed, expert-crafted guidelines. This is often a laborious, tedious, and costly process. To study methods for facilitating data annotation, we introduce a new benchmark AnnoGuide: Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines. It aims to evaluate automated methods for data annotation directly from expert-defined annotation guidelines, eliminating the need for manual labeling. As a case study, we repurpose the well-established nuScenes dataset, commonly used in autonomous driving research, which provides comprehensive annotation guidelines for labeling LiDAR point clouds with 3D cuboids across 18 object classes. These guidelines include a few visual examples and textual descriptions, but no labeled 3D cuboids in LiDAR data, making this a novel task of multi-modal few-shot 3D detection without 3D annotations. The advances of powerful foundation models (FMs) make AnnoGuide especially timely, as FMs offer promising tools to tackle its challenges. We employ a conceptually straightforward pipeline that (1) utilizes open-source FMs for object detection and segmentation in RGB images, (2) projects 2D detections into 3D using known camera poses, and (3) clusters LiDAR points within the frustum of each 2D detection to generate a 3D cuboid. Starting with a non-learned solution that leverages off-the-shelf FMs, we progressively refine key components and achieve significant performance improvements, boosting 3D detection mAP from 12.1 to 21.9! Nevertheless, our results highlight that AnnoGuide remains an open and challenging problem, underscoring the urgent need for developing LiDAR-based FMs. We release our code and models at GitHub: https://annoguide.github.io/annoguide3Dbenchmark

- **Summary**: Unsigned distance fields (UDFs) are widely used in 3D deep learning due to their ability to represent shapes with arbitrary topology. While prior work has largely focused on learning UDFs from point clouds or multi-view images, extracting meshes from UDFs remains challenging, as the learned fields rarely attain exact zero distances. A common workaround is to reconstruct signed distance fields (SDFs) locally from UDFs to enable surface extraction via Marching Cubes. However, this often introduces topological artifacts such as holes or spurious components. Moreover, local SDFs are inherently incapable of representing non-manifold geometry, leading to complete failure in such cases. To address this gap, we propose MIND (Material Interface from Non-manifold Distance fields), a novel algorithm for generating material interfaces directly from UDFs, enabling non-manifold mesh extraction from a global perspective. The core of our method lies in deriving a meaningful spatial partitioning from the UDF, where the target surface emerges as the interface between distinct regions. We begin by computing a two-signed local field to distinguish the two sides of manifold patches, and then extend this to a multi-labeled global field capable of separating all sides of a non-manifold structure. By combining this multi-labeled field with the input UDF, we construct material interfaces that support non-manifold mesh extraction via a multi-labeled Marching Cubes algorithm. Extensive experiments on UDFs generated from diverse data sources, including point cloud reconstruction, multi-view reconstruction, and medial axis transforms, demonstrate that our approach robustly handles complex non-manifold surfaces and significantly outperforms existing methods.

- **Summary**: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore, inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

- **Summary**: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated representations require features that are jointly informative across clients while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models, while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of language models, unified multimodal understanding and generation have made significant strides, with model architectures evolving from separated components to unified single-model frameworks. This paper explores an efficient training paradigm to build a single transformer for unified multimodal understanding and generation. Specifically, we propose a multimodal warmup strategy utilizing prior knowledge to extend capabilities. To address cross-modal compatibility challenges, we introduce feature pre-scaling and multimodal AdaLN techniques. Integrating the proposed technologies, we present the HaploOmni, a new single multimodal transformer. With limited training costs, HaploOmni achieves competitive performance across multiple image and video understanding and generation benchmarks over advanced unified models.

- **Summary**: The MARIO challenge, held at MICCAI 2024, focused on advancing the automated detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) through the analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Designed to evaluate algorithmic performance in detecting neovascular activity changes within AMD, the challenge incorporated unique multi-modal datasets. The primary dataset, sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies, setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of predicting future evolution (Task 2).

- **Summary**: Photography is the cornerstone of modern astronomical and space research. However, most astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes suffer from atmospheric turbulence, resulting in degraded imaging quality. While multi-frame strategies like lucky imaging can mitigate some effects, they involve intensive data acquisition and complex manual processing. In this paper, we propose AstroDiff, a generative restoration method that leverages both the high-quality generative priors and restoration capabilities of diffusion models to mitigate atmospheric turbulence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AstroDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods in astronomical image turbulence mitigation, providing higher perceptual quality and better structural fidelity under severe turbulence conditions.

- **Summary**: We present PartComposer: a framework for part-level concept learning from single-image examples that enables text-to-image diffusion models to compose novel objects from meaningful components. Existing methods either struggle with effectively learning fine-grained concepts or require a large dataset as input. We propose a dynamic data synthesis pipeline generating diverse part compositions to address one-shot data scarcity. Most importantly, we propose to maximize the mutual information between denoised latents and structured concept codes via a concept predictor, enabling direct regulation on concept disentanglement and re-composition supervision. Our method achieves strong disentanglement and controllable composition, outperforming subject and part-level baselines when mixing concepts from the same, or different, object categories.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of generative models, the realism of AI-generated images has significantly improved, posing critical challenges for verifying digital content authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods often depend on datasets with limited generation models and content diversity that fail to keep pace with the evolving complexity and increasing realism of the AI-generated content. Large multimodal models (LMMs), widely adopted in various vision tasks, have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities, yet their potential in deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{DFBench}, a large-scale DeepFake Benchmark featuring (i) broad diversity, including 540,000 images across real, AI-edited, and AI-generated content, (ii) latest model, the fake images are generated by 12 state-of-the-art generation models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both the detection accuracy of deepfake detectors and the evasion capability of generative models. Based on DFBench, we propose \textbf{MoA-DF}, Mixture of Agents for DeepFake detection, leveraging a combined probability strategy from multiple LMMs. MoA-DF achieves state-of-the-art performance, further proving the effectiveness of leveraging LMMs for deepfake detection.

- **Summary**: BlackSky introduces Smartflow, a cloud-based framework enabling scalable spatiotemporal geospatial research built on open-source tools and technologies. Using STAC-compliant catalogs as a common input, heterogeneous geospatial data can be processed into standardized datacubes for analysis and model training. Model experimentation is managed using a combination of tools, including ClearML, Tensorboard, and Apache Superset. Underpinning Smartflow is Kubernetes, which orchestrates the provisioning and execution of workflows to support both horizontal and vertical scalability. This combination of features makes Smartflow well-suited for geospatial model development and analysis over large geographic areas, time scales, and expansive image archives.   We also present a novel neural architecture, built using Smartflow, to monitor large geographic areas for heavy construction. Qualitative results based on data from the IARPA Space-based Machine Automated Recognition Technique (SMART) program are presented that show the model is capable of detecting heavy construction throughout all major phases of development.

- **Summary**: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns: diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\% attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1), Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$, and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video synthesis.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation models~(e.g., Stable Diffusion) have achieved significant advancements, enabling the creation of high-quality and realistic images based on textual descriptions. Prompt inversion, the task of identifying the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models, which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and unsupervised segmentation.

- **Summary**: Modern Gaussian Splatting methods have proven highly effective for real-time photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, integrating semantic information into this representation remains a significant challenge, especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM -- a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps. With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM.

- **Summary**: Acquiring real-world robotic simulation data through teleoperation is notoriously time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently, action-driven generative models have gained widespread adoption in robot learning and simulation, as they eliminate safety concerns and reduce maintenance efforts. However, the action sequences used in these methods often result in limited control precision and poor generalization due to their globally coarse alignment. To address these limitations, we propose ORV, an Occupancy-centric Robot Video generation framework, which utilizes 4D semantic occupancy sequences as a fine-grained representation to provide more accurate semantic and geometric guidance for video generation. By leveraging occupancy-based representations, ORV enables seamless translation of simulation data into photorealistic robot videos, while ensuring high temporal consistency and precise controllability. Furthermore, our framework supports the simultaneous generation of multi-view videos of robot gripping operations - an important capability for downstream robotic learning tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ORV consistently outperforms existing baseline methods across various datasets and sub-tasks.

- **Summary**: Surgical simulation plays a pivotal role in training novice surgeons, accelerating their learning curve and reducing intra-operative errors. However, conventional simulation tools fall short in providing the necessary photorealism and the variability of human anatomy. In response, current methods are shifting towards generative model-based simulators. Yet, these approaches primarily focus on using increasingly complex conditioning for precise synthesis while neglecting the fine-grained human control aspect. To address this gap, we introduce SG2VID, the first diffusion-based video model that leverages Scene Graphs for both precise video synthesis and fine-grained human control. We demonstrate SG2VID's capabilities across three public datasets featuring cataract and cholecystectomy surgery. While SG2VID outperforms previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, it also enables precise synthesis, providing accurate control over tool and anatomy's size and movement, entrance of new tools, as well as the overall scene layout. We qualitatively motivate how SG2VID can be used for generative augmentation and present an experiment demonstrating its ability to improve a downstream phase detection task when the training set is extended with our synthetic videos. Finally, to showcase SG2VID's ability to retain human control, we interact with the Scene Graphs to generate new video samples depicting major yet rare intra-operative irregularities.

- **Summary**: Human-human interaction generation has garnered significant attention in motion synthesis due to its vital role in understanding humans as social beings. However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a front-end block (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit stronger emergent shape bias and overperform the base CNN architecture by 8.5% on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data augmentation approach by 7.3% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology and training-based machine learning approaches.

- **Summary**: Computer use agents (CUA) are systems that automatically interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete tasks. CUA have made significant progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation. Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.

- **Summary**: Contrastive language-image pre-training aligns the features of text-image pairs in a common latent space via distinct encoders for each modality. While this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work, we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding. Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to baselines on unimodal tasks.

- **Summary**: Emerging embodied AI applications, such as wearable cameras and autonomous agents, have underscored the need for robust reasoning from first person video streams. We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object contacts is essential for realistic manipulation in AI character animation, XR, and robotics, yet it remains challenging due to heavy occlusions, complex surface details, and limitations in existing capture techniques. In this paper, we introduce DyTact, a markerless capture method for accurately capturing dynamic contact in hand-object manipulations in a non-intrusive manner. Our approach leverages a dynamic, articulated representation based on 2D Gaussian surfels to model complex manipulations. By binding these surfels to MANO meshes, DyTact harnesses the inductive bias of template models to stabilize and accelerate optimization. A refinement module addresses time-dependent high-frequency deformations, while a contact-guided adaptive sampling strategy selectively increases surfel density in contact regions to handle heavy occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyTact not only achieves state-of-the-art dynamic contact estimation accuracy but also significantly improves novel view synthesis quality, all while operating with fast optimization and efficient memory usage.

- **Summary**: Editing images with instructions to reflect non-rigid motions, camera viewpoint shifts, object deformations, human articulations, and complex interactions, poses a challenging yet underexplored problem in computer vision. Existing approaches and datasets predominantly focus on static scenes or rigid transformations, limiting their capacity to handle expressive edits involving dynamic motion. To address this gap, we introduce ByteMorph, a comprehensive framework for instruction-based image editing with an emphasis on non-rigid motions. ByteMorph comprises a large-scale dataset, ByteMorph-6M, and a strong baseline model built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), named ByteMorpher. ByteMorph-6M includes over 6 million high-resolution image editing pairs for training, along with a carefully curated evaluation benchmark ByteMorph-Bench. Both capture a wide variety of non-rigid motion types across diverse environments, human figures, and object categories. The dataset is constructed using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence. We further conduct a comprehensive evaluation of recent instruction-based image editing methods from both academic and commercial domains.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable success due to its large-scale pretraining on general domains, but it still faces challenges when applying it to downstream distant domains that have only scarce training data, which gives rise to the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) task. Inspired by Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting phenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image tokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads to a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a marginal decrease in downstream target domains. This questions the role of image tokens' continuity in ViT's generalization under large domain gaps. In this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find continuity aids ViT in learning larger spatial patterns, which are harder to transfer than smaller ones, enlarging domain distances. Meanwhile, it implies that only smaller patterns within each patch could be transferred under extreme domain gaps. Based on this interpretation, we further propose a simple yet effective method for CDFSL that better disrupts the continuity of image tokens, encouraging the model to rely less on large patterns and more on smaller ones. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain gaps and outperforming state-of-the-art works. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/shuaiyi308/ReCIT.

- **Summary**: Large-scale delineation of individual trees from remote sensing imagery is crucial to the advancement of ecological research, particularly as climate change and other environmental factors rapidly transform forest landscapes across the world. Current RGB tree segmentation methods rely on training specialized machine learning models with labeled tree datasets. While these learning-based approaches can outperform manual data collection when accurate, the existing models still depend on training data that's hard to scale. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of using a state-of-the-art image segmentation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in a zero-shot manner for individual tree detection and segmentation. We evaluate a pretrained SAM2 model on two tasks in this domain: (1) zero-shot segmentation and (2) zero-shot transfer by using predictions from an existing tree detection model as prompts. Our results suggest that SAM2 not only has impressive generalization capabilities, but also can form a natural synergy with specialized methods trained on in-domain labeled data. We find that applying large pretrained models to problems in remote sensing is a promising avenue for future progress.

- **Summary**: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across various tasks by leveraging large-scale, unsupervised pre-training. However, they often inherit harmful or unwanted knowledge from noisy internet-sourced datasets, compromising their reliability in real-world applications. Existing model unlearning methods either rely on access to pre-trained datasets or focus on coarse-grained unlearning (e.g., entire classes), leaving a critical gap for fine-grained unlearning. In this paper, we address the challenging scenario of selectively forgetting specific portions of knowledge within a class, without access to pre-trained data, while preserving the model's overall performance. We propose a novel three-stage approach that progressively unlearns targeted knowledge while mitigating over-forgetting. It consists of (1) a forgetting stage to fine-tune the CLIP on samples to be forgotten, (2) a reminding stage to restore performance on retained samples, and (3) a restoring stage to recover zero-shot capabilities using model souping. Additionally, we introduce knowledge distillation to handle the distribution disparity between forgetting, retaining samples, and unseen pre-trained data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and style datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively unlearns specific subgroups while maintaining strong zero-shot performance on semantically similar subgroups and other categories, significantly outperforming baseline unlearning methods, which lose effectiveness under the CLIP unlearning setting.

- **Summary**: 3D human reconstruction and animation are long-standing topics in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods typically rely on sophisticated dense-view capture and/or time-consuming per-subject optimization procedures. To address these limitations, we propose HumanRAM, a novel feed-forward approach for generalizable human reconstruction and animation from monocular or sparse human images. Our approach integrates human reconstruction and animation into a unified framework by introducing explicit pose conditions, parameterized by a shared SMPL-X neural texture, into transformer-based large reconstruction models (LRM). Given monocular or sparse input images with associated camera parameters and SMPL-X poses, our model employs scalable transformers and a DPT-based decoder to synthesize realistic human renderings under novel viewpoints and novel poses. By leveraging the explicit pose conditions, our model simultaneously enables high-quality human reconstruction and high-fidelity pose-controlled animation. Experiments show that HumanRAM significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy, animation fidelity, and generalization performance on real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Existing interpolation methods use pre-trained video diffusion priors to generate intermediate frames between sparsely sampled keyframes. In the absence of 3D geometric guidance, these methods struggle to produce plausible results for complex, articulated human motions and offer limited control over the synthesized dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PoseFuse3D Keyframe Interpolator (PoseFuse3D-KI), a novel framework that integrates 3D human guidance signals into the diffusion process for Controllable Human-centric Keyframe Interpolation (CHKI). To provide rich spatial and structural cues for interpolation, our PoseFuse3D, a 3D-informed control model, features a novel SMPL-X encoder that transforms 3D geometry and shape into the 2D latent conditioning space, alongside a fusion network that integrates these 3D cues with 2D pose embeddings. For evaluation, we build CHKI-Video, a new dataset annotated with both 2D poses and 3D SMPL-X parameters. We show that PoseFuse3D-KI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on CHKI-Video, achieving a 9% improvement in PSNR and a 38% reduction in LPIPS.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable results in video synthesis but require iterative denoising steps, leading to substantial computational overhead. Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)}, where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated animation production. To produce engaging animations, it is essential to generate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character references. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world scenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent character guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a reference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features comprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across shots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an overview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main character profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations decompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene, characters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a dedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each shot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided multi-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The reference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to produce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then used as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot. Experimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves superior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual guidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video generation.

- **Summary**: We introduce native-resolution image synthesis, a novel generative modeling paradigm that enables the synthesis of images at arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional fixed-resolution, square-image methods by natively handling variable-length visual tokens, a core challenge for traditional techniques. To this end, we introduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture designed to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its denoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns intrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of resolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in advanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization performance. It successfully generates high-fidelity images at previously unseen high resolutions (e.g., 1536 x 1536) and diverse aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 3:1, 4:3), as shown in Figure 1. These findings indicate the significant potential of native-resolution modeling as a bridge between visual generative modeling and advanced LLM methodologies.

- **Summary**: Automated interpretation of CT images-particularly localizing and describing abnormal findings across multi-plane and whole-body scans-remains a significant challenge in clinical radiology. This work aims to address this challenge through four key contributions: (i) On taxonomy, we collaborate with senior radiologists to propose a comprehensive hierarchical classification system, with 404 representative abnormal findings across all body regions; (ii) On data, we contribute a dataset containing over 14.5K CT images from multiple planes and all human body regions, and meticulously provide grounding annotations for over 19K abnormalities, each linked to the detailed description and cast into the taxonomy; (iii) On model development, we propose OminiAbnorm-CT, which can automatically ground and describe abnormal findings on multi-plane and whole-body CT images based on text queries, while also allowing flexible interaction through visual prompts; (iv) On benchmarks, we establish three representative evaluation tasks based on real clinical scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that OminiAbnorm-CT can significantly outperform existing methods on all the tasks and metrics.

- **Summary**: We present SA-Radar (Simulate Any Radar), a radar simulation approach that enables controllable and efficient generation of radar cubes conditioned on customizable radar attributes. Unlike prior generative or physics-based simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including 2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real data. Our framework also supports simulation in novel sensor viewpoints and edited scenes, showcasing its potential as a general-purpose radar data engine for autonomous driving applications.

- **Summary**: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential directions for future research.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs have shown promising capabilities for SVG processing, yet existing benchmarks suffer from limited real-world coverage, lack of complexity stratification, and fragmented evaluation paradigms. We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding, editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8 task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels. Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing automated graphic design applications.

- **Summary**: Camera control is crucial for generating expressive and cinematic videos. Existing methods rely on explicit sequences of camera parameters as control conditions, which can be cumbersome for users to construct, particularly for intricate camera movements. To provide a more intuitive camera control method, we propose CamCloneMaster, a framework that enables users to replicate camera movements from reference videos without requiring camera parameters or test-time fine-tuning. CamCloneMaster seamlessly supports reference-based camera control for both Image-to-Video and Video-to-Video tasks within a unified framework. Furthermore, we present the Camera Clone Dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset designed for camera clone learning, encompassing diverse scenes, subjects, and camera movements. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that CamCloneMaster outperforms existing methods in terms of both camera controllability and visual quality.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in interactive video generation have shown promising results, yet existing approaches struggle with scene-consistent memory capabilities in long video generation due to limited use of historical context. In this work, we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during training.

- **Summary**: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment, inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align a dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution. Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7 with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its general-purpose strengths.

- **Summary**: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.

- **Summary**: Although existing unified models achieve strong performance in vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, they remain limited in addressing image perception and manipulation -- capabilities increasingly demanded in practical applications. Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful GPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive image perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through carefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on semantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being commonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this insight, we propose UniWorld, a unified generative framework built upon semantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and contrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source the UniWorld framework, including model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research.

- **Summary**: We present a method for finding cross-modal space-time correspondences. Given two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1) high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2) synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues; and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing controllable video generation methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25% of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges, Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at 93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality impact.

- **Summary**: Recent works on optical flow estimation use neural networks to predict the flow field that maps positions of one image to positions of the other. These networks consist of a feature extractor, a correlation volume, and finally several refinement steps. These refinement steps mimic the iterative refinements performed by classical optimization algorithms and are usually implemented by neural layers (e.g., GRU) which are recurrently executed for a fixed and pre-determined number of steps. However, relying on a fixed number of steps may result in suboptimal performance because it is not tailored to the input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting the derivative of the flow using a continuous model, namely neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). One key advantage of this approach is its capacity to model an equilibrium process, dynamically adjusting the number of compute steps based on the data at hand. By following a particular neural architecture, ODE solver, and associated hyperparameters, our proposed model can replicate the exact same updates as recurrent cells used in existing works, offering greater generality. Through extensive experimental analysis on optical flow benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive improvement over baseline and existing models, all while requiring only a single refinement step.

- **Summary**: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is vital for maintaining the safety and longevity of civil infrastructure, yet current solutions remain constrained by cost, power consumption, scalability, and the complexity of data processing. Here, we present a diffractive vibration monitoring system, integrating a jointly optimized diffractive layer with a shallow neural network-based backend to remotely extract 3D structural vibration spectra, offering a low-power, cost-effective and scalable solution. This architecture eliminates the need for dense sensor arrays or extensive data acquisition; instead, it uses a spatially-optimized passive diffractive layer that encodes 3D structural displacements into modulated light, captured by a minimal number of detectors and decoded in real-time by shallow and low-power neural networks to reconstruct the 3D displacement spectra of structures. The diffractive system's efficacy was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally using millimeter-wave illumination on a laboratory-scale building model with a programmable shake table. Our system achieves more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over conventional optics or separately trained modules, establishing a foundation for high-throughput 3D monitoring of structures. Beyond SHM, the 3D vibration monitoring capabilities of this cost-effective and data-efficient framework establish a new computational sensing modality with potential applications in disaster resilience, aerospace diagnostics, and autonomous navigation, where energy efficiency, low latency, and high-throughput are critical.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in team sports is particularly challenging due to the fast-paced motion and frequent occlusions resulting in motion blur and identity switches, respectively. Predicting player positions in such scenarios is particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion patterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and appearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports scenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not necessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce SportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking in dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold. First, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion by implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a height-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by partial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes. Additionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique, SportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the SportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe occlusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to VIP-HTD, an ice hockey dataset.

- **Summary**: The Arrow of Time (AoT)-time's irreversible flow shaping physical events-is fundamental to video comprehension, yet remains a significant challenge for modern large multimodal models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to perceive and utilize temporal directionality in video when responding to language queries, obstructing deeper temporal understanding. We tackle this deficiency by first providing a critical analysis of existing benchmarks and models. We then introduce ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training strategy with an innovative reverse reward that instills AoT awareness by encouraging divergent video interpretations between forward and reversed visual frames. For rigorous evaluation, we additionally develop AoTBench, a new multi-faceted benchmark probing temporally challenging questions. Experiments show ArrowRL greatly advances temporal perception: it not only achieves substantial improvements on our challenging AoTBench but also demonstrably boosts performance on standard video question answering (VQA) benchmarks (with peak accuracy gains reaching over 20% and 10% respectively). This validates ArrowRL's effectiveness and highlights the critical need for dedicated AoT understanding in LMMs.

- **Summary**: Controlling defects in semiconductor processes is important for maintaining yield, improving production cost, and preventing time-dependent critical component failures. Electron beam-based imaging has been used as a tool to survey wafers in the line and inspect for defects. However, manual classification of images for these nano-scale defects is limited by time, labor constraints, and human biases. In recent years, deep learning computer vision algorithms have shown to be effective solutions for image-based inspection applications in industry. This work proposes application of vision transformer (ViT) neural networks for automatic defect classification (ADC) of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of wafer defects. We evaluated our proposed methods on 300mm wafer semiconductor defect data from our fab in IBM Albany. We studied 11 defect types from over 7400 total images and investigated the potential of transfer learning of DinoV2 and semi-supervised learning for improved classification accuracy and efficient computation. We were able to achieve classification accuracies of over 90% with less than 15 images per defect class. Our work demonstrates the potential to apply the proposed framework for a platform agnostic in-house classification tool with faster turnaround time and flexibility.

- **Summary**: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. When employing our robust CLIP encoders in multimodal retrieval tasks, we improve the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization.

- **Summary**: Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled accurate image-based geolocation, raising serious concerns about location privacy risks in everyday social media posts. However, current benchmarks remain coarse-grained, linguistically biased, and lack multimodal and privacy-aware evaluations. To address these gaps, we present KoreaGEO Bench, the first fine-grained, multimodal geolocation benchmark for Korean street views. Our dataset comprises 1,080 high-resolution images sampled across four urban clusters and nine place types, enriched with multi-contextual annotations and two styles of Korean captions simulating real-world privacy exposure. We introduce a three-path evaluation protocol to assess ten mainstream VLMs under varying input modalities and analyze their accuracy, spatial bias, and reasoning behavior. Results reveal modality-driven shifts in localization precision and highlight structural prediction biases toward core cities.

- **Summary**: Foundation models have begun to transform image analysis by acting as pretrained generalist backbones that can be adapted to many tasks even when post-training data are limited, yet their impact on spatial proteomics, imaging that maps proteins at single-cell resolution, remains limited. Here, we introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering 175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging. We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks, and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.

- **Summary**: As video-sharing platforms have grown over the past decade, child viewership has surged, increasing the need for precise detection of harmful content like violence or explicit scenes. Malicious users exploit moderation systems by embedding unsafe content in minimal frames to evade detection. While prior research has focused on visual cues and advanced such fine-grained detection, audio features remain underexplored. In this study, we embed audio cues with visual for fine-grained child harmful content detection and introduce SNIFR, a novel framework for effective alignment. SNIFR employs a transformer encoder for intra-modality interaction, followed by a cascaded cross-transformer for inter-modality alignment. Our approach achieves superior performance over unimodal and baseline fusion methods, setting a new state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Environmental soundscapes convey substantial ecological and social information regarding urban environments; however, their potential remains largely untapped in large-scale geographic analysis. In this study, we investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio, along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.

- **Summary**: Early detection of crop stress is vital for minimizing yield loss and enabling timely intervention in precision agriculture. Traditional approaches using NDRE often detect stress only after visible symptoms appear or require labeled datasets, limiting scalability. This study introduces EigenCL, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework guided by temporal NDRE dynamics and biologically grounded eigen decomposition. Using over 10,000 Sentinel-2 NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, we constructed five-point NDRE time series per patch and derived an RBF similarity matrix. The principal eigenvector explaining 76% of the variance and strongly correlated (r = 0.95) with raw NDRE values was used to define stress-aware similarity for contrastive embedding learning. Unlike existing methods that rely on visual augmentations, EigenCL pulls embeddings together based on biologically similar stress trajectories and pushes apart divergent ones. The learned embeddings formed physiologically meaningful clusters, achieving superior clustering metrics (Silhouette: 0.748, DBI: 0.35) and enabling 76% early stress detection up to 12 days before conventional NDRE thresholds. Downstream classification yielded 95% k-NN and 91% logistic regression accuracy. Validation on an independent 2023 Nebraska dataset confirmed generalizability without retraining. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable approach for early stress detection that aligns with underlying plant physiology and is suitable for real-world deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments.

- **Summary**: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.   Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.   Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

- **Summary**: Skin cancer is among the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases worldwide, with early detection being critical to patient outcomes. This work presents a hybrid machine and deep learning-based approach for classifying malignant and benign skin lesions using the SLICE-3D dataset from ISIC 2024, which comprises 401,059 cropped lesion images extracted from 3D Total Body Photography (TBP), emulating non-dermoscopic, smartphone-like conditions. Our method combines vision transformers (EVA02) and our designed convolutional ViT hybrid (EdgeNeXtSAC) to extract robust features, employing a segmentation-assisted classification pipeline to enhance lesion localization. Predictions from these models are fused with a gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) ensemble enriched by engineered features and patient-specific relational metrics. To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we augment malignant cases with Stable Diffusion-generated synthetic lesions and apply a diagnosis-informed relabeling strategy to harmonize external datasets into a 3-class format. Using partial AUC (pAUC) above 80 percent true positive rate (TPR) as the evaluation metric, our approach achieves a pAUC of 0.1755 -- the highest among all configurations. These results underscore the potential of hybrid, interpretable AI systems for skin cancer triage in telemedicine and resource-constrained settings.

- **Summary**: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. While several VFM adapters have shown promising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two inefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between convolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer gradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all components, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features, underutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of several VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an extractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning task-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch and introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task head is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient propagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior features from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting. Extensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to $4\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared to other VFM adapters.

- **Summary**: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition in videos requires understanding both visual patterns and geometric relationships as they evolve over time. Visual and geometric features offer complementary strengths. Visual features capture appearance context, while geometric features provide structural patterns. Effectively fusing these multimodal features without compromising their unique characteristics remains challenging. We observe that establishing robust, entity-specific representations before modeling interactions helps preserve the strengths of each modality. Therefore, we hypothesize that a bottom-up approach is crucial for effective multimodal fusion. Following this insight, we propose the Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Network (GeoVis-GNN), which uses dual-attention feature fusion combined with interdependent entity graph learning. It progressively builds from entity-specific representations toward high-level interaction understanding. To advance HOI recognition to real-world scenarios, we introduce the Concurrent Partial Interaction Dataset (MPHOI-120). It captures dynamic multi-person interactions involving concurrent actions and partial engagement. This dataset helps address challenges like complex human-object dynamics and mutual occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various HOI scenarios. These scenarios include two-person interactions, single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent partial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in inversion and instruction-based image editing, existing approaches primarily excel at editing single, prominent objects but significantly struggle when applied to complex scenes containing multiple entities. To quantify this gap, we first introduce RefEdit-Bench, a rigorous real-world benchmark rooted in RefCOCO, where even baselines trained on millions of samples perform poorly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce RefEdit -- an instruction-based editing model trained on our scalable synthetic data generation pipeline. Our RefEdit, trained on only 20,000 editing triplets, outperforms the Flux/SD3 model-based baselines trained on millions of data. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that our model not only excels in referring expression tasks but also enhances performance on traditional benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to closed-source methods. We release data \& checkpoint for reproducibility.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates how rendering engines, like Unreal Engine 4 (UE), can be used to create synthetic images to supplement datasets for deep computer vision (CV) models in image abundant and image limited use cases. Using rendered synthetic images from UE can provide developers and businesses with a method of accessing nearly unlimited, reproducible, agile, and cheap training sets for their customers and applications without the threat of poisoned images from the internet or the cost of collecting them. The validity of these generated images are examined by testing the change in model test accuracy in two different sized CV models across two binary classification cases (Cat vs Dog and Weld Defect Detection). In addition, this paper provides an implementation of how to measure the quality of synthetic images by using pre-trained CV models as auditors. Results imply that for large (VGG16) and small (MobileNetV3-small) parameter deep CV models, adding >60% additional synthetic images to a real image dataset during model training can narrow the test-training accuracy gap to ~1-2% without a conclusive effect on test accuracy compared to using real world images alone. Likewise, adding <10% additional real training images to synthetic only training sets decreased the classification error rate in half, then decreasing further when adding more real training images. For these cases tested, using synthetic images from rendering engines allow researchers to only use 10% of their real images during training, compared to the traditional 50-70%. This research serves as an example of how to create synthetic images, guidelines on how to use the images, potential restrictions and possible performance improvements for data-scarce projects.

- **Summary**: In few-shot learning (FSL), the labeled samples are scarce. Thus, label errors can significantly reduce classification accuracy. Since label errors are inevitable in realistic learning tasks, improving the robustness of the model in the presence of label errors is critical. This paper proposes a new robust neural field-based image approach (RoNFA) for few-shot image classification with noisy labels. RoNFA consists of two neural fields for feature and category representation. They correspond to the feature space and category set. Each neuron in the field for category representation (FCR) has a receptive field (RF) on the field for feature representation (FFR) centered at the representative neuron for its category generated by soft clustering. In the prediction stage, the range of these receptive fields adapts according to the neuronal activation in FCR to ensure prediction accuracy. These learning strategies provide the proposed model with excellent few-shot learning capability and strong robustness against label noises. The experimental results on real-world FSL datasets with three different types of label noise demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FSL methods. Its accuracy obtained in the presence of noisy labels even surpasses the results obtained by state-of-the-art FSL methods trained on clean support sets, indicating its strong robustness against noisy labels.

- **Summary**: Gathering enough images to train a deep computer vision model is a constant challenge. Unfortunately, collecting images from unknown sources can leave your model s behavior at risk of being manipulated by a dirty-label or clean-label attack unless the images are properly inspected. Manually inspecting each image-label pair is impractical and common poison-detection methods that involve re-training your model can be time consuming. This research uses GAN discriminators to protect a single class against mislabeled and different levels of modified images. The effect of said perturbation on a basic convolutional neural network classifier is also included for reference. The results suggest that after training on a single class, GAN discriminator s confidence scores can provide a threshold to identify mislabeled images and identify 100% of the tested poison starting at a perturbation epsilon magnitude of 0.20, after decision threshold calibration using in-class samples. Developers can use this report as a basis to train their own discriminators to protect high valued classes in their CV models.

- **Summary**: Multispectral satellite images play a vital role in agriculture, fisheries, and environmental monitoring. However, their high dimensionality, large data volumes, and diverse spatial resolutions across multiple channels pose significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite data. ImpliSat leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while preserving critical image details.

- **Summary**: With the increasing awareness of health and the growing desire for aesthetic physique, fitness has become a prevailing trend. However, the potential risks associated with fitness training, especially with weight-loaded fitness actions, cannot be overlooked. Action Quality Assessment (AQA), a technology that quantifies the quality of human action and provides feedback, holds the potential to assist fitness enthusiasts of varying skill levels in achieving better training outcomes. Nevertheless, current AQA methodologies and datasets are limited to single-view competitive sports scenarios and RGB modality and lack professional assessment and guidance of fitness actions. To address this gap, we propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action, large-scale dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals into AQA. FLEX utilizes high-precision MoCap to collect 20 different weight-loaded actions performed by 38 subjects across 3 different skill levels for 10 repetitions each, containing 5 different views of the RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological information. Additionally, FLEX incorporates knowledge graphs into AQA, constructing annotation rules in the form of penalty functions that map weight-loaded actions, action keysteps, error types, and feedback. We conducted various baseline methodologies on FLEX, demonstrating that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance model performance. FLEX not only advances AQA methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios but also fosters the integration of artificial intelligence within the fitness domain.

- **Summary**: Steering vision foundation models at inference time without retraining or access to large labeled datasets is a desirable yet challenging objective, particularly in dynamic or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we introduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that guides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features learned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data. Specifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on CUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features using pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative sets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44% on CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2 and VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing that sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or taxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost. Finally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE reconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose Prototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a prototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training while remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though modestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100 with ViT-B/32.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled effective vision-language reasoning, yet the ability to understand video content remains constrained by suboptimal frame selection strategies. Existing approaches often rely on static heuristics or external retrieval modules to feed frame information into video-LLMs, which may fail to provide the query-relevant information. In this work, we introduce ReFoCUS (Reinforcement-guided Frame Optimization for Contextual UnderStanding), a novel frame-level policy optimization framework that shifts the optimization target from textual responses to visual input selection. ReFoCUS learns a frame selection policy via reinforcement learning, using reward signals derived from a reference LMM to reflect the model's intrinsic preferences for frames that best support temporally grounded responses. To efficiently explore the large combinatorial frame space, we employ an autoregressive, conditional selection architecture that ensures temporal coherence while reducing complexity. Our approach does not require explicit supervision at the frame-level and consistently improves reasoning performance across multiple video QA benchmarks, highlighting the benefits of aligning frame selection with model-internal utility.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate heterogeneous modalities into LLMs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diverse scenarios and objects. Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic reasoning capacities.

### ReAgent-V: A Reward-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Video Understanding

- **Summary**: Video understanding is fundamental to tasks such as action recognition, video reasoning, and robotic control. Early video understanding methods based on large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically adopt a single-pass reasoning paradigm without dynamic feedback, limiting the model's capacity to self-correct and adapt in complex scenarios. Recent efforts have attempted to address this limitation by incorporating reward models and reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning, or by employing tool-agent frameworks. However, these approaches face several challenges, including high annotation costs, reward signals that fail to capture real-time reasoning states, and low inference efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose ReAgent-V, a novel agentic video understanding framework that integrates efficient frame selection with real-time reward generation during inference. These reward signals not only guide iterative answer refinement through a multi-perspective reflection mechanism-adjusting predictions from conservative, neutral, and aggressive viewpoints-but also enable automatic filtering of high-quality data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO). ReAgent-V is lightweight, modular, and extensible, supporting flexible tool integration tailored to diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets across three core applications-video understanding, video reasoning enhancement, and vision-language-action model alignment-demonstrate significant gains in generalization and reasoning, with improvements of up to 6.9%, 2.1%, and 9.8%, respectively, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have significantly advanced promptable image segmentation in computer vision. However, extending these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this paper, we introduce SAM-I2V, an effective image-to-video upgradation method for cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video perception, (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant past frames for more effective utilization of historical information, and (iii) a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and enabling broader applications and advancements in the field.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Music performances, characterized by dense and continuous audio as well as seamless audio-visual integration, present unique challenges for multimodal scene understanding and reasoning. Recent Music Performance Audio-Visual Question Answering (Music AVQA) datasets have been proposed to reflect these challenges, highlighting the continued need for more effective integration of audio-visual representations in complex question answering. However, existing Music AVQA methods often rely on dense and unoptimized representations, leading to inefficiencies in the isolation of key information, the reduction of redundancy, and the prioritization of critical samples. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparsify, a sparse learning framework specifically designed for Music AVQA. It integrates three sparsification strategies into an end-to-end pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music AVQA datasets. In addition, it reduces training time by 28.32% compared to its fully trained dense counterpart while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating clear efficiency gains. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a key-subset selection algorithm that selects and uses approximately 25% of MUSIC-AVQA v2.0 training data and retains 70-80% of full-data performance across models.

- **Summary**: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

- **Summary**: Ultra-high-resolution image synthesis holds significant potential, yet remains an underexplored challenge due to the absence of standardized benchmarks and computational constraints. In this paper, we establish Aesthetic-4K, a meticulously curated dataset containing dedicated training and evaluation subsets specifically designed for comprehensive research on ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. This dataset consists of high-quality 4K images accompanied by descriptive captions generated by GPT-4o. Furthermore, we propose Diffusion-4K, an innovative framework for the direct generation of ultra-high-resolution images. Our approach incorporates the Scale Consistent Variational Auto-Encoder (SC-VAE) and Wavelet-based Latent Fine-tuning (WLF), which are designed for efficient visual token compression and the capture of intricate details in ultra-high-resolution images, thereby facilitating direct training with photorealistic 4K data. This method is applicable to various latent diffusion models and demonstrates its efficacy in synthesizing highly detailed 4K images. Additionally, we propose novel metrics, namely the GLCM Score and Compression Ratio, to assess the texture richness and fine details in local patches, in conjunction with holistic measures such as FID, Aesthetics, and CLIPScore, enabling a thorough and multifaceted evaluation of ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. Consequently, Diffusion-4K achieves impressive performance in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, particularly when powered by state-of-the-art large-scale diffusion models (eg, Flux-12B).

- **Summary**: We aim to detect the class and orientation of a vehicle by training a model with synthetic data. However, the distribution of the classes in the training data is imbalanced, and the model trained on the synthetic image is difficult to predict in real-world images. We propose a two-stage detection model with photo-realistic image generation to tackle this issue. Our model mainly takes four steps to detect the class and orientation of the vehicle. (1) It builds a table containing the image, class, and location information of objects in the image, (2) transforms the synthetic images into real-world images style, and merges them into the meta table. (3) Classify vehicle class and orientation using images from the meta-table. (4) Finally, the vehicle class and orientation are detected by combining the pre-extracted location information and the predicted classes. We achieved 4th place in IEEE BigData Challenge 2022 Vehicle class and Orientation Detection (VOD) with our approach.

- **Summary**: This paper rethinks image histogram matching (HM) and proposes a differentiable and parametric HM preprocessing for a downstream classifier. Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated remarkable achievements in classification tasks. However, they often exhibit degraded performance on low-contrast images captured under adverse weather conditions. To maintain classifier performance under low-contrast images, histogram equalization (HE) is commonly used. HE is a special case of HM using a uniform distribution as a target pixel value distribution. In this paper, we focus on the shape of the target pixel value distribution. Compared to a uniform distribution, a single, well-designed distribution could have potential to improve the performance of the downstream classifier across various adverse weather conditions. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a differentiable and parametric HM that optimizes the target distribution using the loss function of the downstream classifier. This method addresses pixel value imbalances by transforming input images with arbitrary distributions into a target distribution optimized for the classifier. Our HM is trained on only normal weather images using the classifier. Experimental results show that a classifier trained with our proposed HM outperforms conventional preprocessing methods under adverse weather conditions.



### Target Driven Adaptive Loss For Infrared Small Target Detection

- **Summary**: We propose a target driven adaptive (TDA) loss to enhance the performance of infrared small target detection (IRSTD). Prior works have used loss functions, such as binary cross-entropy loss and IoU loss, to train segmentation models for IRSTD. Minimizing these loss functions guides models to extract pixel-level features or global image context. However, they have two issues: improving detection performance for local regions around the targets and enhancing robustness to small scale and low local contrast. To address these issues, the proposed TDA loss introduces a patch-based mechanism, and an adaptive adjustment strategy to scale and local contrast. The proposed TDA loss leads the model to focus on local regions around the targets and pay particular attention to targets with smaller scales and lower local contrast. We evaluate the proposed method on three datasets for IRSTD. The results demonstrate that the proposed TDA loss achieves better detection performance than existing losses on these datasets.

- **Summary**: The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain --the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of 66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer interface with multiple modalities. All data, tools, and acquisition protocols are openly shared to foster open science in cognitive computing.



### CLIP-driven rain perception: Adaptive deraining with pattern-aware network routing and mask-guided cross-attention

- **Summary**: Existing deraining models process all rainy images within a single network. However, different rain patterns have significant variations, which makes it challenging for a single network to handle diverse types of raindrops and streaks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-driven rain perception network (CLIP-RPN) that leverages CLIP to automatically perceive rain patterns by computing visual-language matching scores and adaptively routing to sub-networks to handle different rain patterns, such as varying raindrop densities, streak orientations, and rainfall intensity. CLIP-RPN establishes semantic-aware rain pattern recognition through CLIP's cross-modal visual-language alignment capabilities, enabling automatic identification of precipitation characteristics across different rain scenarios. This rain pattern awareness drives an adaptive subnetwork routing mechanism where specialized processing branches are dynamically activated based on the detected rain type, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to handle diverse rainfall conditions. Furthermore, within sub-networks of CLIP-RPN, we introduce a mask-guided cross-attention mechanism (MGCA) that predicts precise rain masks at multi-scale to facilitate contextual interactions between rainy regions and clean background areas by cross-attention. We also introduces a dynamic loss scheduling mechanism (DLS) to adaptively adjust the gradients for the optimization process of CLIP-RPN. Compared with the commonly used $l_1$ or $l_2$ loss, DLS is more compatible with the inherent dynamics of the network training process, thus achieving enhanced outcomes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, particularly excelling in complex mixed datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based food image classification enables precise identification of food categories, further facilitating accurate nutritional analysis. However, real-world food images often show a skewed distribution, with some food types being more prevalent than others. This class imbalance can be problematic, causing models to favor the majority (head) classes with overall performance degradation for the less common (tail) classes. Recently, synthetic data augmentation using diffusion-based generative models has emerged as a promising solution to address this issue. By generating high-quality synthetic images, these models can help uniformize the data distribution, potentially improving classification performance. However, existing approaches face challenges: fine-tuning-based methods need a uniformly distributed dataset, while pre-trained model-based approaches often overlook inter-class separation in synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a two-stage synthetic data augmentation framework, leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for long-tailed food classification. We generate a reference set conditioned by a positive prompt on the generation target and then select a class that shares similar features with the generation target as a negative prompt. Subsequently, we generate a synthetic augmentation set using positive and negative prompt conditions by a combined sampling strategy that promotes intra-class diversity and inter-class separation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on two long-tailed food benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance compared to previous works in terms of top-1 accuracy.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation model has made significant advancements, resulting in high-quality images aligned with an input prompt. However, despite T2I generation's ability to generate fine-grained images, it still faces challenges in accurately generating images when the input prompt contains complex concepts, especially human pose. In this paper, we propose PointT2I, a framework that effectively generates images that accurately correspond to the human pose described in the prompt by using a large language model (LLM). PointT2I consists of three components: Keypoint generation, Image generation, and Feedback system. The keypoint generation uses an LLM to directly generate keypoints corresponding to a human pose, solely based on the input prompt, without external references. Subsequently, the image generation produces images based on both the text prompt and the generated keypoints to accurately reflect the target pose. To refine the outputs of the preceding stages, we incorporate an LLM-based feedback system that assesses the semantic consistency between the generated contents and the given prompts. Our framework is the first approach to leveraging LLM for keypoints-guided image generation without any fine-tuning, producing accurate pose-aligned images based solely on textual prompts.

- **Summary**: Spatial reasoning remains a critical yet underdeveloped capability in existing vision-language models (VLMs), especially for Spatial Visual Question Answering (Spatial VQA) tasks that require understanding relative positions, distances, and object configurations. Inspired by the R1 paradigm introduced in DeepSeek-R1, which enhances reasoning in language models through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we propose SVQA-R1, the first framework to extend R1-style training to spatial VQA. In particular, we introduce Spatial-GRPO, a novel group-wise RL strategy that constructs view-consistent rewards by perturbing spatial relations between objects, e.g., mirror flipping, thereby encouraging the model to develop a consistent and grounded understanding of space. Our model, SVQA-R1, not only achieves dramatically improved accuracy on spatial VQA benchmarks but also exhibits interpretable reasoning paths even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. Extensive experiments and visualization demonstrate the effectiveness of SVQA-R1 across multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for sports analytics, enabling performance evaluation and tactical insights. However, tracking in sports is challenging due to fast movements, occlusions, and camera shifts. Traditional tracking-by-detection methods require extensive tuning, while segmentation-based approaches struggle with track processing. We propose McByte, a tracking-by-detection framework that integrates temporally propagated segmentation mask as an association cue to improve robustness without per-video tuning. Unlike many existing methods, McByte does not require training, relying solely on pre-trained models and object detectors commonly used in the community. Evaluated on SportsMOT, DanceTrack, SoccerNet-tracking 2022 and MOT17, McByte demonstrates strong performance across sports and general pedestrian tracking. Our results highlight the benefits of mask propagation for a more adaptable and generalizable MOT approach. Code will be made available at https://github.com/tstanczyk95/McByte.

- **Summary**: High-Fidelity 3D scene reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving by enabling novel data generation from existing datasets. This allows simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed, noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis. To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR / 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy), demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and scene reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.

- **Summary**: Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field in document intelligence, enabling automated extraction of key information from complex documents across domains such as medical, financial, and educational applications. However, form-like documents pose unique challenges due to their complex layouts, multi-stakeholder involvement, and high structural variability. Addressing these issues, the VRD-IU Competition was introduced, focusing on extracting and localizing key information from multi-format forms within the Form-NLU dataset, which includes digital, printed, and handwritten documents. This paper presents insights from the competition, which featured two tracks: Track A, emphasizing entity-based key information retrieval, and Track B, targeting end-to-end key information localization from raw document images. With over 20 participating teams, the competition showcased various state-of-the-art methodologies, including hierarchical decomposition, transformer-based retrieval, multimodal feature fusion, and advanced object detection techniques. The top-performing models set new benchmarks in VRDU, providing valuable insights into document intelligence.

- **Summary**: Active-stereo-based 3D shape measurement is crucial for various purposes, such as industrial inspection, reverse engineering, and medical systems, due to its strong ability to accurately acquire the shape of textureless objects. Active stereo systems typically consist of a camera and a pattern projector, tightly fixed to each other, and precise calibration between a camera and a projector is required, which in turn decreases the usability of the system. If a camera and a projector can be freely moved during shape scanning process, it will drastically increase the convenience of the usability of the system. To realize it, we propose a technique to recover the shape of the target object by capturing multiple images while both the camera and the projector are in motion, and their relative poses are auto-calibrated by our neural signed-distance-field (NeuralSDF) using novel volumetric differential rendering technique. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated by performing 3D reconstruction using both synthetic and real images.

- **Summary**: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover, most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices. AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and $91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.

- **Summary**: World model based planning has significantly improved decision-making in complex environments by enabling agents to simulate future states and make informed choices. However, ensuring the prediction accuracy of world models often demands substantial computational resources, posing a major challenge for real-time applications. This computational burden is particularly restrictive in robotics, where resources are severely constrained. To address this limitation, we propose a Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model Planning, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens processed during forward prediction. Our method leverages a sparsely trained vision-based world model based on transformers with randomized grouped attention strategy, allowing the model to adaptively adjust the number of tokens processed based on the computational resource. By enabling sparse imagination (rollout), our approach significantly accelerates planning while maintaining high control fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that sparse imagination preserves task performance while dramatically improving inference efficiency, paving the way for the deployment of world models in real-time decision-making scenarios.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the NTIRE 2025 challenge on the 2nd Restore Any Image Model (RAIM) in the Wild. This challenge established a new benchmark for real-world image restoration, featuring diverse scenarios with and without reference ground truth. Participants were tasked with restoring real-captured images suffering from complex and unknown degradations, where both perceptual quality and fidelity were critically evaluated. The challenge comprised two tracks: (1) the low-light joint denoising and demosaicing (JDD) task, and (2) the image detail enhancement/generation task. Each track included two sub-tasks. The first sub-task involved paired data with available ground truth, enabling quantitative evaluation. The second sub-task dealt with real-world yet unpaired images, emphasizing restoration efficiency and subjective quality assessed through a comprehensive user study. In total, the challenge attracted nearly 300 registrations, with 51 teams submitting more than 600 results. The top-performing methods advanced the state of the art in image restoration and received unanimous recognition from all 20+ expert judges. The datasets used in Track 1 and Track 2 are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mgqve-yNcE26IIieI8lMIf-25VvZRs_J and https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UB7nnzLwqDZOwDmD9aT8J0KVg2ag4Qae, respectively.

- **Summary**: The Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) task aims to identify various detailed attributes of an individual, such as clothing, accessories, and gender. To enhance PAR performance, a model must capture features ranging from coarse-grained global attributes (e.g., for identifying gender) to fine-grained local details (e.g., for recognizing accessories) that may appear in diverse regions. Recent research suggests that body part representation can enhance the model's robustness and accuracy, but these methods are often restricted to attribute classes within fixed horizontal regions, leading to degraded performance when attributes appear in varying or unexpected body locations. In this paper, we propose Visual and Textual Attribute Alignment with Attribute Prompting for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition, dubbed as ViTA-PAR, to enhance attribute recognition through specialized multimodal prompting and vision-language alignment. We introduce visual attribute prompts that capture global-to-local semantics, enabling diverse attribute representations. To enrich textual embeddings, we design a learnable prompt template, termed person and attribute context prompting, to learn person and attributes context. Finally, we align visual and textual attribute features for effective fusion. ViTA-PAR is validated on four PAR benchmarks, achieving competitive performance with efficient inference. We release our code and model at https://github.com/mlnjeongpark/ViTA-PAR.

- **Summary**: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

- **Summary**: Visual Semantic Navigation (VSN) is a fundamental problem in robotics, where an agent must navigate toward a target object in an unknown environment, mainly using visual information. Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and real world settings. We also introduce a newly curated dataset, i.e. the SEMNAV dataset, designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models, achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic applications.

- **Summary**: Leveraging the powerful generation capability of large-scale pretrained text-to-image models, training-free methods have demonstrated impressive image editing results. Conventional diffusion-based methods, as well as recent rectified flow (RF)-based methods, typically reverse synthesis trajectories by gradually adding noise to clean images, during which the noisy latent at the current timestep is used to approximate that at the next timesteps, introducing accumulated drift and degrading reconstruction accuracy. Considering the fact that in RF the noisy latent is estimated through direct interpolation between Gaussian noises and clean images at each timestep, we propose Direct Noise Alignment (DNA), which directly refines the desired Gaussian noise in the noise domain, significantly reducing the error accumulation in previous methods. Specifically, DNA estimates the velocity field of the interpolated noised latent at each timestep and adjusts the Gaussian noise by computing the difference between the predicted and expected velocity field. We validate the effectiveness of DNA and reveal its relationship with existing RF-based inversion methods. Additionally, we introduce a Mobile Velocity Guidance (MVG) to control the target prompt-guided generation process, balancing image background preservation and target object editability. DNA and MVG collectively constitute our proposed method, namely DNAEdit. Finally, we introduce DNA-Bench, a long-prompt benchmark, to evaluate the performance of advanced image editing models. Experimental results demonstrate that our DNAEdit achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art text-guided editing methods.

- **Summary**: Color propagation aims to extend local color edits to similar regions across the input image. Conventional approaches often rely on low-level visual cues such as color, texture, or lightness to measure pixel similarity, making it difficult to achieve content-aware color propagation. While some recent approaches attempt to introduce semantic information into color editing, but often lead to unnatural, global color change in color adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we present a semantic palette-guided approach for color propagation. We first extract a semantic palette from an input image. Then, we solve an edited palette by minimizing a well-designed energy function based on user edits. Finally, local edits are accurately propagated to regions that share similar semantics via the solved palette. Our approach enables efficient yet accurate pixel-level color editing and ensures that local color changes are propagated in a content-aware manner. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Although multi-scale concepts have recently proven useful for recurrent network architectures in the field of optical flow and stereo, they have not been considered for image-based scene flow so far. Hence, based on a single-scale recurrent scene flow backbone, we develop a multi-scale approach that generalizes successful hierarchical ideas from optical flow to image-based scene flow. By considering suitable concepts for the feature and the context encoder, the overall coarse-to-fine framework and the training loss, we succeed to design a scene flow approach that outperforms the current state of the art on KITTI and Spring by 8.7%(3.89 vs. 4.26) and 65.8% (9.13 vs. 26.71), respectively.

- **Summary**: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation, we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset, detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

- **Summary**: Sonar imaging is fundamental to underwater exploration, with critical applications in defense, navigation, and marine research. Shadow regions, in particular, provide essential cues for object detection and classification, yet existing studies primarily focus on highlight-based analysis, leaving shadow-based classification underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a Context-adaptive sonar image classification framework that leverages advanced image processing techniques to extract and integrate discriminative shadow and highlight features. Our framework introduces a novel shadow-specific classifier and adaptive shadow segmentation, enabling effective classification based on the dominant region. This approach ensures optimal feature representation, improving robustness against noise and occlusions. In addition, we introduce a Region-aware denoising model that enhances sonar image quality by preserving critical structural details while suppressing noise. This model incorporates an explainability-driven optimization strategy, ensuring that denoising is guided by feature importance, thereby improving interpretability and classification reliability. Furthermore, we present S3Simulator+, an extended dataset incorporating naval mine scenarios with physics-informed noise specifically tailored for the underwater sonar domain, fostering the development of robust AI models. By combining novel classification strategies with an enhanced dataset, our work addresses key challenges in sonar image analysis, contributing   to the advancement of autonomous underwater perception.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, enabling the creation of high-quality, temporally consistent videos. However, generating high frame-rate (FPS) videos remains a significant challenge due to issues such as flickering and degradation in long sequences, particularly in fast-motion scenarios. Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiencies and limitations in maintaining video quality over extended frames. In this paper, we present a novel, training-free approach for high FPS video generation using pre-trained diffusion models. Our method, DiffuseSlide, introduces a new pipeline that leverages key frames from low FPS videos and applies innovative techniques, including noise re-injection and sliding window latent denoising, to achieve smooth, consistent video outputs without the need for additional fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves video quality, offering enhanced temporal coherence and spatial fidelity. The proposed method is not only computationally efficient but also adaptable to various video generation tasks, making it ideal for applications such as virtual reality, video games, and high-quality content creation.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly retrieval aims to localize anomalous events in videos using natural language queries to facilitate public safety. However, existing datasets suffer from severe limitations: (1) data scarcity due to the long-tail nature of real-world anomalies, and (2) privacy constraints that impede large-scale collection. To address the aforementioned issues in one go, we introduce SVTA (Synthetic Video-Text Anomaly benchmark), the first large-scale dataset for cross-modal anomaly retrieval, leveraging generative models to overcome data availability challenges. Specifically, we collect and generate video descriptions via the off-the-shelf LLM (Large Language Model) covering 68 anomaly categories, e.g., throwing, stealing, and shooting. These descriptions encompass common long-tail events. We adopt these texts to guide the video generative model to produce diverse and high-quality videos. Finally, our SVTA involves 41,315 videos (1.36M frames) with paired captions, covering 30 normal activities, e.g., standing, walking, and sports, and 68 anomalous events, e.g., falling, fighting, theft, explosions, and natural disasters. We adopt three widely-used video-text retrieval baselines to comprehensively test our SVTA, revealing SVTA's challenging nature and its effectiveness in evaluating a robust cross-modal retrieval method. SVTA eliminates privacy risks associated with real-world anomaly collection while maintaining realistic scenarios. The dataset demo is available at: [https://svta-mm.github.io/SVTA.github.io/].

- **Summary**: Accurately recognizing and assessing pain in sheep is key to discern animal health and mitigating harmful situations. However, such accuracy is limited by the ability to manage automatic monitoring of pain in those animals. Facial expression scoring is a widely used and useful method to evaluate pain in both humans and other living beings. Researchers also analyzed the facial expressions of sheep to assess their health state and concluded that facial landmark detection and pain level prediction are essential. For this purpose, we propose a novel weighted graph neural network (WGNN) model to link sheep's detected facial landmarks and define pain levels. Furthermore, we propose a new sheep facial landmarks dataset that adheres to the parameters of the Sheep Facial Expression Scale (SPFES). Currently, there is no comprehensive performance benchmark that specifically evaluates the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) on sheep facial landmark data to detect and measure pain levels. The YOLOv8n detector architecture achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 59.30% with the sheep facial landmarks dataset, among seven other detection models. The WGNN framework has an accuracy of 92.71% for tracking multiple facial parts expressions with the YOLOv8n lightweight on-board device deployment-capable model.

- **Summary**: Accurate surgical phase recognition is crucial for computer-assisted interventions and surgical video analysis. Annotating long surgical videos is labor-intensive, driving research toward leveraging unlabeled data for strong performance with minimal annotations. Although self-supervised learning has gained popularity by enabling large-scale pretraining followed by fine-tuning on small labeled subsets, semi-supervised approaches remain largely underexplored in the surgical domain. In this work, we propose a video transformer-based model with a robust pseudo-labeling framework. Our method incorporates temporal consistency regularization for unlabeled data and contrastive learning with class prototypes, which leverages both labeled data and pseudo-labels to refine the feature space. Through extensive experiments on the private RAMIE (Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy) dataset and the public Cholec80 dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By incorporating unlabeled data, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on RAMIE with a 4.9% accuracy increase and obtain comparable results to full supervision while using only 1/4 of the labeled data on Cholec80. Our findings establish a strong benchmark for semi-supervised surgical phase recognition, paving the way for future research in this domain.

- **Summary**: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework, MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients' data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities.

- **Summary**: Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unify visual comprehension and generation. However, these two capabilities remain largely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated within the same model. Consequently, visual comprehension does not enhance visual generation, and the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs have not been fully integrated to revolutionize image generation. In this paper, we propose to enable the collaborative co-evolution of visual comprehension and generation, advancing image generation into an iterative introspective process. We introduce a two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning teaches the MLLM with the foundational ability to generate genuine CoT for visual generation, while reinforcement learning activates its full potential via an exploration-exploitation trade-off. Ultimately, we unlock the Aha moment in visual generation, advancing MLLMs from text-to-image tasks to unified image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in text-to-image generation and image editing, but also functions as a superior image semantic evaluator with enhanced visual comprehension capabilities.

- **Summary**: Dynamic scene graph generation extends scene graph generation from images to videos by modeling entity relationships and their temporal evolution. However, existing methods either generate scene graphs from observed frames without explicitly modeling temporal dynamics, or predict only relationships while assuming static entity labels and locations. These limitations hinder effective extrapolation of both entity and relationship dynamics, restricting video scene understanding. We propose Forecasting Dynamic Scene Graphs (FDSG), a novel framework that predicts future entity labels, bounding boxes, and relationships, for unobserved frames, while also generating scene graphs for observed frames. Our scene graph forecast module leverages query decomposition and neural stochastic differential equations to model entity and relationship dynamics. A temporal aggregation module further refines predictions by integrating forecasted and observed information via cross-attention. To benchmark FDSG, we introduce Scene Graph Forecasting, a new task for full future scene graph prediction. Experiments on Action Genome show that FDSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene graph generation, scene graph anticipation, and scene graph forecasting. Codes will be released upon publication.

- **Summary**: Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully scaled to billion-scale large text-to-image datasets. However, training such models entails a high training cost, limiting some applications and research usage. To reduce the cost, one promising direction is the incorporation of pre-trained models. The existing method of utilizing pre-trained models for a generator significantly reduced the training cost compared with the other large-scale GANs, but we found the model loses the diversity of generation for a given prompt by a large margin. To build an efficient and high-fidelity text-to-image GAN without compromise, we propose to use two specialized discriminators with Slicing Adversarial Networks (SANs) adapted for text-to-image tasks. Our proposed model, called SCAD, shows a notable enhancement in diversity for a given prompt with better sample fidelity. We also propose to use a metric called Per-Prompt Diversity (PPD) to evaluate the diversity of text-to-image models quantitatively. SCAD achieved a zero-shot FID competitive with the latest large-scale GANs at two orders of magnitude less training cost.

- **Summary**: Preference alignment in diffusion models has primarily focused on benign human preferences (e.g., aesthetic). In this paper, we propose a novel perspective: framing unrestricted adversarial example generation as a problem of aligning with adversary preferences. Unlike benign alignment, adversarial alignment involves two inherently conflicting preferences: visual consistency and attack effectiveness, which often lead to unstable optimization and reward hacking (e.g., reducing visual quality to improve attack success). To address this, we propose APA (Adversary Preferences Alignment), a two-stage framework that decouples conflicting preferences and optimizes each with differentiable rewards. In the first stage, APA fine-tunes LoRA to improve visual consistency using rule-based similarity reward. In the second stage, APA updates either the image latent or prompt embedding based on feedback from a substitute classifier, guided by trajectory-level and step-wise rewards. To enhance black-box transferability, we further incorporate a diffusion augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that APA achieves significantly better attack transferability while maintaining high visual consistency, inspiring further research to approach adversarial attacks from an alignment perspective.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) models have made breakthroughs in image embedding extraction, which provide state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as zero-shot image classification. However, the models suffer from a high computational burden. In this paper, we propose a novel speed-up method for ViT models called Attention-aware Token Filtering (ATF). ATF consists of two main ideas: a novel token filtering module and a filtering strategy. The token filtering module is introduced between a tokenizer and a transformer encoder of the ViT model, without modifying or fine-tuning of the transformer encoder. The module filters out tokens inputted to the encoder so that it keeps tokens in regions of specific object types dynamically and keeps tokens in regions that statically receive high attention in the transformer encoder. This filtering strategy maintains task accuracy while filtering out tokens inputted to the transformer encoder. Evaluation results on retrieval tasks show that ATF provides $2.8\times$ speed-up to a ViT model, SigLIP, while maintaining the retrieval recall rate.

- **Summary**: Bias has been a constant in face recognition models. Over the years, researchers have looked at it from both the model and the data point of view. However, their approach to mitigation of data bias was limited and lacked insight on the real nature of the problem. Here, in this document, we propose to revise our use of ethnicity labels as a continuous variable instead of a discrete value per identity. We validate our formulation both experimentally and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset. We further show that models trained on datasets balanced in the continuous space consistently outperform models trained on data balanced in the discrete space. We trained more than 65 different models, and created more than 20 subsets of the original datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper considers the problem of utilizing a large-scale text-to-image diffusion model to tackle the challenging Inexact Segmentation (IS) task. Unlike traditional approaches that rely heavily on discriminative-model-based paradigms or dense visual representations derived from internal attention mechanisms, our method focuses on the intrinsic generative priors in Stable Diffusion~(SD). Specifically, we exploit the pattern discrepancies between original images and mask-conditional generated images to facilitate a coarse-to-fine segmentation refinement by establishing a semantic correspondence alignment and updating the foreground probability. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our plug-and-play design, underscoring the potential of leveraging generation discrepancies to model dense representations and encouraging further exploration of generative approaches for solving discriminative tasks.

- **Summary**: Driving world models are used to simulate futures by video generation based on the condition of the current state and actions. However, current models often suffer serious error accumulations when predicting the long-term future, which limits the practical application. Recent studies utilize the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as the backbone of driving world models to improve learning flexibility. However, these models are always trained on short video clips (high fps and short duration), and multiple roll-out generations struggle to produce consistent and reasonable long videos due to the training-inference gap. To this end, we propose several solutions to build a simple yet effective long-term driving world model. First, we hierarchically decouple world model learning into large motion learning and bidirectional continuous motion learning. Then, considering the continuity of driving scenes, we propose a simple distillation method where fine-grained video flows are self-supervised signals for coarse-grained flows. The distillation is designed to improve the coherence of infinite video generation. The coarse-grained and fine-grained modules are coordinated to generate long-term and temporally coherent videos. In the public benchmark NuScenes, compared with the state-of-the-art front-view model, our model improves FVD by $27\%$ and reduces inference time by $85\%$ for the video task of generating 110+ frames. More videos (including 90s duration) are available at https://Wang-Xiaodong1899.github.io/longdwm/.

- **Summary**: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.

- **Summary**: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to provide a pixel-wise scene understanding in Language-aided Audio-Visual Scenes (LAVS). This task requires the model to continuously segment objects referred to by text and audio from a video. Previous dual-modality methods always fail due to the lack of a third modality and the existing triple-modality method struggles with spatio-temporal consistency, leading to the target shift of different frames. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, termed SAM2-LOVE, which integrates textual, audio, and visual representations into a learnable token to prompt and align SAM2 for achieving Ref-AVS in the LAVS. Technically, our approach includes a multimodal fusion module aimed at improving multimodal understanding of SAM2, as well as token propagation and accumulation strategies designed to enhance spatio-temporal consistency without forgetting historical information. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate that SAM2-LOVE outperforms the SOTA by 8.5\% in $\mathcal{J\&F}$ on the Ref-AVS benchmark and showcase the simplicity and effectiveness of the components. Our code will be available here.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation.

- **Summary**: Generating high-fidelity full-body human interactions with dynamic objects and static scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and animation. Existing methods for human-object interaction often neglect scene context, leading to implausible penetrations, while human-scene interaction approaches struggle to coordinate fine-grained manipulations with long-range navigation. To address these limitations, we propose HOSIG, a novel framework for synthesizing full-body interactions through hierarchical scene perception. Our method decouples the task into three key components: 1) a scene-aware grasp pose generator that ensures collision-free whole-body postures with precise hand-object contact by integrating local geometry constraints, 2) a heuristic navigation algorithm that autonomously plans obstacle-avoiding paths in complex indoor environments via compressed 2D floor maps and dual-component spatial reasoning, and 3) a scene-guided motion diffusion model that generates trajectory-controlled, full-body motions with finger-level accuracy by incorporating spatial anchors and dual-space classifier-free guidance. Extensive experiments on the TRUMANS dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework supports unlimited motion length through autoregressive generation and requires minimal manual intervention. This work bridges the critical gap between scene-aware navigation and dexterous object manipulation, advancing the frontier of embodied interaction synthesis. Codes will be available after publication. Project page: http://yw0208.github.io/hosig

- **Summary**: Learning effective visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation is challenging, as it requires generating precise actions while maintaining computational efficiency. Existing methods remain unsatisfactory due to inherent limitations in the essential action representation and the basic network architectures. We observe that representing actions in the frequency domain captures the structured nature of motion more effectively: low-frequency components reflect global movement patterns, while high-frequency components encode fine local details. Additionally, robotic manipulation tasks of varying complexity demand different levels of modeling precision across these frequency bands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy learning that progressively models hierarchical frequency components. To further enhance precision, we introduce continuous latent representations that maintain smoothness and continuity in the action space. Extensive experiments across diverse 2D and 3D robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, showcasing the potential of a frequency-domain autoregressive framework with continuous tokens for generalized robotic manipulation.

- **Summary**: Recent multi-modal models have shown remarkable versatility in real-world applications. However, their rapid development encounters two critical data challenges. First, the training process requires large-scale datasets, leading to substantial storage and computational costs. Second, these data are typically web-crawled with inevitable noise, i.e., partially mismatched pairs, severely degrading model performance. To these ends, we propose Multi-modal dataset Distillation in the Wild, i.e., MDW, the first framework to distill noisy multi-modal datasets into compact clean ones for effective and efficient model training. Specifically, MDW introduces learnable fine-grained correspondences during distillation and adaptively optimizes distilled data to emphasize correspondence-discriminative regions, thereby enhancing distilled data's information density and efficacy. Moreover, to capture robust cross-modal correspondence prior knowledge from real data, MDW proposes dual-track collaborative learning to avoid the risky data noise, alleviating information loss with certifiable noise tolerance. Extensive experiments validate MDW's theoretical and empirical efficacy with remarkable scalability, surpassing prior methods by over 15% across various compression ratios, highlighting its appealing practicality for applications with diverse efficacy and resource needs.

- **Summary**: Advances in talking-head animation based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) enable the creation of highly realistic, synchronized videos. These fabricated videos are indistinguishable from real ones, increasing the risk of potential misuse for scams, political manipulation, and misinformation. Hence, addressing these ethical concerns has become a pressing issue in AI security. Recent proactive defense studies focused on countering LDM-based models by adding perturbations to portraits. However, these methods are ineffective at protecting reference portraits from advanced image-to-video animation. The limitations are twofold: 1) they fail to prevent images from being manipulated by audio signals, and 2) diffusion-based purification techniques can effectively eliminate protective perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose Silencer, a two-stage method designed to proactively protect the privacy of portraits. First, a nullifying loss is proposed to ignore audio control in talking-head generation. Second, we apply anti-purification loss in LDM to optimize the inverted latent feature to generate robust perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Silencer in proactively protecting portrait privacy. We hope this work will raise awareness among the AI security community regarding critical ethical issues related to talking-head generation techniques. Code: https://github.com/yuangan/Silencer.

- **Summary**: Language-instructed active object localization is a critical challenge for robots, requiring efficient exploration of partially observable environments. However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.

- **Summary**: Understanding behavior requires datasets that capture humans while carrying out complex tasks. The kitchen is an excellent environment for assessing human motor and cognitive function, as many complex actions are naturally exhibited in kitchens from chopping to cleaning. Here, we introduce the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset, collected in a noninvasive motion capture platform inside a kitchen environment. Nine static RGB-D cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs) and one head-mounted HoloLens~2 headset were used to capture 3D hand, body, and eye movements. The EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset is a multi-view action dataset with synchronized exocentric, egocentric, depth, IMUs, eye gaze, body and hand kinematics spanning 29.7 hours of 16 subjects cooking four different recipes. Action sequences were densely annotated with 33.78 action segments per minute. Leveraging this multi-modal dataset, we propose four benchmarks to advance behavior understanding and modeling through 1) a vision-language benchmark, 2) a semantic text-to-motion generation benchmark, 3) a multi-modal action recognition benchmark, 4) a pose-based action segmentation benchmark. We expect the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset to pave the way for better methods as well as insights to understand the nature of ecologically-valid human behavior.

- **Summary**: Visual explanation maps enhance the trustworthiness of decisions made by deep learning models and offer valuable guidance for developing new algorithms in image recognition tasks. Class activation maps (CAM) and their variants (e.g., Grad-CAM and Relevance-CAM) have been extensively employed to explore the interpretability of softmax-based convolutional neural networks, which require a fully connected layer as the classifier for decision-making. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to metric learning models, as such models lack a fully connected layer functioning as a classifier. To address this limitation, we propose a novel visual explanation method termed Similar Feature Activation Map (SFAM). This method introduces the channel-wise contribution importance score (CIS) to measure feature importance, derived from the similarity measurement between two image embeddings. The explanation map is constructed by linearly combining the proposed importance weights with the feature map from a CNN model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that SFAM provides highly promising interpretable visual explanations for CNN models using Euclidean distance or cosine similarity as the similarity metric.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) often struggle to interpret high-resolution images accurately, where fine-grained details are crucial for complex visual understanding. We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and \textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by \textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution multimodal benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance in various vision-language tasks. However, they often struggle to comprehensively understand Earth Observation (EO) data, which is critical for monitoring the environment and the effects of human activity on it. In this work, we present EarthMind, a novel vision-language framework for multi-granular and multi-sensor EO data understanding. EarthMind features two core components: (1) Spatial Attention Prompting (SAP), which reallocates attention within the LLM to enhance pixel-level understanding; and (2) Cross-modal Fusion, which aligns heterogeneous modalities into a shared space and adaptively reweighs tokens based on their information density for effective fusion. To facilitate multi-sensor fusion evaluation, we propose EarthMind-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 2,000 human-annotated multi-sensor image-question pairs, covering a wide range of perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EarthMind. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on EarthMind-Bench, surpassing GPT-4o despite being only 4B in scale. Moreover, EarthMind outperforms existing methods on multiple public EO benchmarks, showcasing its potential to handle both multi-granular and multi-sensor challenges in a unified framework.

- **Summary**: Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their proficiency in fine-grained video motion understanding remains critically limited. They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA, the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset. All the code and annotations will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Can freely moving humans or animals themselves serve as calibration targets for multi-camera systems while simultaneously estimating their correspondences across views? We humans can solve this problem by mentally rotating the observed 2D poses and aligning them with those in the target views. Inspired by this cognitive ability, we propose SteerPose, a neural network that performs this rotation of 2D poses into another view. By integrating differentiable matching, SteerPose simultaneously performs extrinsic camera calibration and correspondence search within a single unified framework. We also introduce a novel geometric consistency loss that explicitly ensures that the estimated rotation and correspondences result in a valid translation estimation. Experimental results on diverse in-the-wild datasets of humans and animals validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct the 3D poses of novel animals in multi-camera setups by leveraging off-the-shelf 2D pose estimators and our class-agnostic model.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present InfoMax, a novel data pruning method, also known as coreset selection, designed to maximize the information content of selected samples while minimizing redundancy. By doing so, InfoMax enhances the overall informativeness of the coreset. The information of individual samples is measured by importance scores, which capture their influence or difficulty in model learning. To quantify redundancy, we use pairwise sample similarities, based on the premise that similar samples contribute similarly to the learning process. We formalize the coreset selection problem as a discrete quadratic programming (DQP) task, with the objective of maximizing the total information content, represented as the sum of individual sample contributions minus the redundancies introduced by similar samples within the coreset. To ensure practical scalability, we introduce an efficient gradient-based solver, complemented by sparsification techniques applied to the similarity matrix and dataset partitioning strategies. This enables InfoMax to seamlessly scale to datasets with millions of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of InfoMax in various data pruning tasks, including image classification, vision-language pre-training, and instruction tuning for large language models.

- **Summary**: Pretrained on web-scale open data, VLMs offer powerful capabilities for solving downstream tasks after being adapted to task-specific labeled data. Yet, data labeling can be expensive and may demand domain expertise. Active Learning (AL) aims to reduce this expense by strategically selecting the most informative data for labeling and model training. Recent AL methods have explored VLMs but have not leveraged publicly available open data, such as VLM's pretraining data. In this work, we leverage such data by retrieving task-relevant examples to augment the task-specific examples. As expected, incorporating them significantly improves AL. Given that our method exploits open-source VLM and open data, we refer to it as Active Learning with Open Resources (ALOR). Additionally, most VLM-based AL methods use prompt tuning (PT) for model adaptation, likely due to its ability to directly utilize pretrained parameters and the assumption that doing so reduces the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. We rigorously compare popular adaptation approaches, including linear probing (LP), finetuning (FT), and contrastive tuning (CT). We reveal two key findings: (1) All adaptation approaches benefit from incorporating retrieved data, and (2) CT resoundingly outperforms other approaches across AL methods. Further analysis of retrieved data reveals a naturally imbalanced distribution of task-relevant classes, exposing inherent biases within the VLM. This motivates our novel Tail First Sampling (TFS) strategy for AL, an embarrassingly simple yet effective method that prioritizes sampling data from underrepresented classes to label. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our final method, contrastively finetuning VLM on both retrieved and TFS-selected labeled data, significantly outperforms existing methods.

- **Summary**: While recent advances in reinforcement learning have significantly enhanced reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), these techniques remain underexplored in multi-modal LLMs for video captioning. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of GRPO-based RL post-training for video MLLMs, with the goal of enhancing video MLLMs' capability of describing actions in videos. Specifically, we develop the VideoCap-R1, which is prompted to first perform structured thinking that analyzes video subjects with their attributes and actions before generating complete captions, supported by two specialized reward mechanisms: a LLM-free think scorer evaluating the structured thinking quality and a LLM-assisted caption scorer assessing the output quality. The RL training framework effectively establishes the connection between structured reasoning and comprehensive description generation, enabling the model to produce captions with more accurate actions. Our experiments demonstrate that VideoCap-R1 achieves substantial improvements over the Qwen2VL-7B baseline using limited samples (1.5k) across multiple video caption benchmarks (DREAM1K: +4.4 event F1, VDC: +4.2 Acc, CAREBENCH: +3.1 action F1, +6.9 object F1) while consistently outperforming the SFT-trained counterparts, confirming GRPO's superiority in enhancing MLLMs' captioning capabilities.

- **Summary**: Visual rating is an essential capability of artificial intelligence (AI) for multi-dimensional quantification of visual content, primarily applied in ordinal regression (OR) tasks such as image quality assessment, facial age estimation, and medical image grading. However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) under-perform in such visual rating ability while also suffering the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In this work, we collect and present STORM, a data collection and benchmark for Stimulating Trustworthy Ordinal Regression Ability of MLLMs for universal visual rating. STORM encompasses 14 ordinal regression datasets across five common visual rating domains, comprising 655K image-level pairs and the corresponding carefully curated VQAs. Importantly, we also propose a coarse-to-fine processing pipeline that dynamically considers label candidates and provides interpretable thoughts, providing MLLMs with a general and trustworthy ordinal thinking paradigm. This benchmark aims to evaluate the all-in-one and zero-shot performance of MLLMs in scenarios requiring understanding of the essential common ordinal relationships of rating labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better fine-tuning strategies. The STORM dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models are available on the following webpage to support further research in this area. Datasets and codes are released on the project page: https://storm-bench.github.io/.

- **Summary**: The increasing availability of wearable XR devices opens new perspectives for Egocentric Action Recognition (EAR) systems, which can provide deeper human understanding and situation awareness. However, deploying real-time algorithms on these devices can be challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between portability, battery life, and computational resources. In this work, we systematically analyze the impact of sampling frequency across different input modalities - RGB video and 3D hand pose - on egocentric action recognition performance and CPU usage. By exploring a range of configurations, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that reducing the sampling rate of RGB frames, when complemented with higher-frequency 3D hand pose input, can preserve high accuracy while significantly lowering CPU demands. Notably, we observe up to a 3x reduction in CPU usage with minimal to no loss in recognition performance. This highlights the potential of multimodal input strategies as a viable approach to achieving efficient, real-time EAR on XR devices.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines.

- **Summary**: We study the challenging problem of unsupervised multi-object segmentation on single images. Existing methods, which rely on image reconstruction objectives to learn objectness or leverage pretrained image features to group similar pixels, often succeed only in segmenting simple synthetic objects or discovering a limited number of real-world objects. In this paper, we introduce unMORE, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to identify many complex objects in real-world images. The key to our approach involves explicitly learning three levels of carefully defined object-centric representations in the first stage. Subsequently, our multi-object reasoning module utilizes these learned object priors to discover multiple objects in the second stage. Notably, this reasoning module is entirely network-free and does not require human labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that unMORE significantly outperforms all existing unsupervised methods across 6 real-world benchmark datasets, including the challenging COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art object segmentation results. Remarkably, our method excels in crowded images where all baselines collapse.

- **Summary**: Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) typically depends on a single visual modality when defending against presentation attacks such as print attacks, screen replays, and 3D masks, resulting in limited generalization across devices, environments, and attack types. Meanwhile, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved breakthroughs in image-text understanding and semantic reasoning, suggesting that integrating visual and linguistic co-inference into FAS can substantially improve both robustness and interpretability. However, the lack of a high-quality vision-language multimodal dataset has been a critical bottleneck. To address this, we introduce FaceCoT (Face Chain-of-Thought), the first large-scale Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset tailored for FAS. FaceCoT covers 14 spoofing attack types and enriches model learning with high-quality CoT VQA annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a caption model refined via reinforcement learning to expand the dataset and enhance annotation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a CoT-Enhanced Progressive Learning (CEPL) strategy to better leverage the CoT data and boost model performance on FAS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with FaceCoT and CEPL outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: High-quality datasets are fundamental to training and evaluating machine learning models, yet their creation-especially with accurate human annotations-remains a significant challenge. Many dataset paper submissions lack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these shortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also frequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties. While existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are largely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for evaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences promote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these limitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic, rubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as submission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective methods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and LLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to action, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the quality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances in LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and actionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and reviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research. We also release code to support reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations at https://github.com/datarubrics/datarubrics.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new task, Referring and Reasoning for Selective Masks (R2SM), which extends text-guided segmentation by incorporating mask-type selection driven by user intent. This task challenges vision-language models to determine whether to generate a modal (visible) or amodal (complete) segmentation mask based solely on natural language prompts. To support the R2SM task, we present the R2SM dataset, constructed by augmenting annotations of COCOA-cls, D2SA, and MUVA. The R2SM dataset consists of both modal and amodal text queries, each paired with the corresponding ground-truth mask, enabling model finetuning and evaluation for the ability to segment images as per user intent. Specifically, the task requires the model to interpret whether a given prompt refers to only the visible part of an object or to its complete shape, including occluded regions, and then produce the appropriate segmentation. For example, if a prompt explicitly requests the whole shape of a partially hidden object, the model is expected to output an amodal mask that completes the occluded parts. In contrast, prompts without explicit mention of hidden regions should generate standard modal masks. The R2SM benchmark provides a challenging and insightful testbed for advancing research in multimodal reasoning and intent-aware segmentation.

- **Summary**: Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.

- **Summary**: The emergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) has brought significant advancements to video generation, especially in text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. Although video generation is widely applied in various fields, most existing models are limited to single scenarios and cannot perform diverse video generation and editing through dynamic content manipulation. We propose OmniV2V, a video model capable of generating and editing videos across different scenarios based on various operations, including: object movement, object addition, mask-guided video edit, try-on, inpainting, outpainting, human animation, and controllable character video synthesis. We explore a unified dynamic content manipulation injection module, which effectively integrates the requirements of the above tasks. In addition, we design a visual-text instruction module based on LLaVA, enabling the model to effectively understand the correspondence between visual content and instructions. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive multi-task data processing system. Since there is data overlap among various tasks, this system can efficiently provide data augmentation. Using this system, we construct a multi-type, multi-scenario OmniV2V dataset and its corresponding OmniV2V-Test benchmark. Extensive experiments show that OmniV2V works as well as, and sometimes better than, the best existing open-source and commercial models for many video generation and editing tasks.

- **Summary**: Learning an animatable and clothed human avatar model with vivid dynamics and photorealistic appearance from multi-view videos is an important foundational research problem in computer graphics and vision. Fueled by recent advances in implicit representations, the quality of the animatable avatars has achieved an unprecedented level by attaching the implicit representation to drivable human template meshes. However, they usually fail to preserve the highest level of detail, particularly apparent when the virtual camera is zoomed in and when rendering at 4K resolution and higher. We argue that this limitation stems from inaccurate surface tracking, specifically, depth misalignment and surface drift between character geometry and the ground truth surface, which forces the detailed appearance model to compensate for geometric errors. To address this, we propose a latent deformation model and supervising the 3D deformation of the animatable character using guidance from foundational 2D video point trackers, which offer improved robustness to shading and surface variations, and are less prone to local minima than differentiable rendering. To mitigate the drift over time and lack of 3D awareness of 2D point trackers, we introduce a cascaded training strategy that generates consistent 3D point tracks by anchoring point tracks to the rendered avatar, which ultimately supervises our avatar at the vertex and texel level. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a novel dataset comprising five multi-view video sequences, each over 10 minutes in duration, captured using 40 calibrated 6K-resolution cameras, featuring subjects dressed in clothing with challenging texture patterns and wrinkle deformations. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved performance in rendering quality and geometric accuracy over the prior state of the art.

- **Summary**: The increasing demand for hygienic and portable biometric systems has underscored the critical need for advancements in contactless fingerprint recognition. Despite its potential, this technology faces notable challenges, including out-of-focus image acquisition, reduced contrast between fingerprint ridges and valleys, variations in finger positioning, and perspective distortion. These factors significantly hinder the accuracy and reliability of contactless fingerprint matching. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-stage transformer-based contactless fingerprint matching approach that first captures global spatial features and subsequently refines localized feature alignment across fingerprint samples. By employing a hierarchical feature extraction and matching pipeline, our method ensures fine-grained, cross-sample alignment while maintaining the robustness of global feature representation. We perform extensive evaluations on publicly available datasets such as HKPolyU and RidgeBase under different evaluation protocols, such as contactless-to-contact matching and contactless-to-contactless matching and demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods, including COTS solutions.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting and its extension to 4D dynamic scenes enable photorealistic, real-time rendering from real-world captures, positioning Gaussian Splats (GS) as a promising format for next-generation immersive media. However, their high storage requirements pose significant challenges for practical use in sharing, transmission, and storage. Despite various studies exploring GS compression from different perspectives, these efforts remain scattered across separate repositories, complicating benchmarking and the integration of best practices. To address this gap, we present GSCodec Studio, a unified and modular framework for GS reconstruction, compression, and rendering. The framework incorporates a diverse set of 3D/4D GS reconstruction methods and GS compression techniques as modular components, facilitating flexible combinations and comprehensive comparisons. By integrating best practices from community research and our own explorations, GSCodec Studio supports the development of compact representation and compression solutions for static and dynamic Gaussian Splats, namely our Static and Dynamic GSCodec, achieving competitive rate-distortion performance in static and dynamic GS compression. The code for our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/JasonLSC/GSCodec_Studio , to advance the research on Gaussian Splats compression.

- **Summary**: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on instruction-following tasks by integrating pretrained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often struggle to ground fine-grained visual concepts in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose MoDA (Modulation Adapter), a lightweight yet effective module designed to refine pre-aligned visual features through instruction-guided modulation. Our approach follows the standard LLaVA training protocol, consisting of a two-stage process: (1) aligning image features to the LLMs input space via a frozen vision encoder and adapter layers, and (2) refining those features using the MoDA adapter during the instructional tuning stage. MoDA employs a Transformer-based cross-attention mechanism to generate a modulation mask over the aligned visual tokens, thereby emphasizing semantically relevant embedding dimensions based on the language instruction. The modulated features are then passed to the LLM for autoregressive language generation. Our experimental evaluation shows that MoDA improves visual grounding and generates more contextually appropriate responses, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general-purpose enhancement for image-based MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Recently, the powerful text-to-image capabilities of ChatGPT-4o have led to growing appreciation for native multimodal large language models. However, its multimodal capabilities remain confined to images and text. Yet beyond images, the ability to understand and generate 3D content is equally crucial. To address this gap, we propose ShapeLLM-Omni-a native 3D large language model capable of understanding and generating 3D assets and text in any sequence. First, we train a 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), which maps 3D objects into a discrete latent space to achieve efficient and accurate shape representation and reconstruction. Building upon the 3D-aware discrete tokens, we innovatively construct a large-scale continuous training dataset named 3D-Alpaca, encompassing generation, comprehension, and editing, thus providing rich resources for future research and training. Finally, by performing instruction-based training of the Qwen-2.5-vl-7B-Instruct model on the 3D-Alpaca dataset. Our work provides an effective attempt at extending multimodal models with basic 3D capabilities, which contributes to future research in 3D-native AI.

- **Summary**: Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse input modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining strong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models, especially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to generalize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve strong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of extending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models, where an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and language data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does modality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging effectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to achieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better knowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through extensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into the feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.

- **Summary**: Widely adopted evaluation metrics for sparse-view CT reconstruction--such as Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio--prioritize pixel-wise fidelity but often fail to capture the completeness of critical anatomical structures, particularly small or thin regions that are easily missed. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of novel anatomy-aware evaluation metrics designed to assess structural completeness across anatomical structures, including large organs, small organs, intestines, and vessels. Building on these metrics, we introduce CARE, a Completeness-Aware Reconstruction Enhancement framework that incorporates structural penalties during training to encourage anatomical preservation of significant structures. CARE is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into analytical, implicit, and generative methods. When applied to these methods, CARE substantially improves structural completeness in CT reconstructions, achieving up to +32% improvement for large organs, +22% for small organs, +40% for intestines, and +36% for vessels.

- **Summary**: Craniosynostosis is a medical condition that affects the growth of babies' heads, caused by an early fusion of cranial sutures. In recent decades, surgical treatments for craniosynostosis have significantly improved, leading to reduced invasiveness, faster recovery, and less blood loss. At Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), the main surgical treatment for patients diagnosed with sagittal craniosynostosis (SC) is spring assisted cranioplasty (SAC). This procedure involves a 15x15 mm2 osteotomy, where two springs are inserted to induce distraction. Despite the numerous advantages of this surgical technique for patients, the outcome remains unpredictable due to the lack of efficient preoperative planning tools. The surgeon's experience and the baby's age are currently relied upon to determine the osteotomy location and spring selection. Previous tools for predicting the surgical outcome of SC relied on finite element modeling (FEM), which involved computed tomography (CT) imaging and required engineering expertise and lengthy calculations. The main goal of this research is to develop a real-time prediction tool for the surgical outcome of patients, eliminating the need for CT scans to minimise radiation exposure during preoperative planning. The proposed methodology involves creating personalised synthetic skulls based on three-dimensional (3D) photographs, incorporating population average values of suture location, skull thickness, and soft tissue properties. A machine learning (ML) surrogate model is employed to achieve the desired surgical outcome. The resulting multi-output support vector regressor model achieves a R2 metric of 0.95 and MSE and MAE below 0.13. Furthermore, in the future, this model could not only simulate various surgical scenarios but also provide optimal parameters for achieving a maximum cranial index (CI).

- **Summary**: Vision-language models pre-trained on large scale of unlabeled biomedical images and associated reports learn generalizable semantic representations. These multi-modal representations can benefit various downstream tasks in the biomedical domain. Contrastive learning is widely used to pre-train vision-language models for general natural images and associated captions. Despite its popularity, we found biomedical texts have complex and domain-specific semantics that are often neglected by common contrastive methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, perturbed report discrimination, for pre-train biomedical vision-language models. First, we curate a set of text perturbation methods that keep the same words, but disrupt the semantic structure of the sentence. Next, we apply different types of perturbation to reports, and use the model to distinguish the original report from the perturbed ones given the associated image. Parallel to this, we enhance the sensitivity of our method to higher level of granularity for both modalities by contrasting attention-weighted image sub-regions and sub-words in the image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple downstream tasks, and our method outperforms strong baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach learns more semantic meaningful and robust multi-modal representations.

- **Summary**: Understanding real-world videos with complex semantics and long temporal dependencies remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in vision-language tasks, while reinforcement learning tuning (RLT) has further improved their reasoning abilities. In this work, we explore RLT as a post-training strategy to enhance the video-specific reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Built upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, we propose a dual-reward formulation that supervises both semantic and temporal reasoning through discrete and continuous reward signals. To facilitate effective preference-based optimization, we introduce a variance-aware data selection strategy based on repeated inference to identify samples that provide informative learning signals. We evaluate our approach across eight representative video understanding tasks, including VideoQA, Temporal Video Grounding, and Grounded VideoQA. Our method consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing RLT baselines, achieving superior performance with significantly less training data. These results underscore the importance of reward design and data selection in advancing reasoning-centric video understanding with MLLMs. Notably, The initial code release (two months ago) has now been expanded with updates, including optimized reward mechanisms and additional datasets.

- **Summary**: Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image datasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise. Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood. Here, we examine a UNet trained for denoising on the ImageNet dataset, to better understand its internal representation and computation of the score. We show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images. We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images from this representation and demonstrate that it recovers a sample from a set of images defined by a target image representation. We then study the properties of the representation and demonstrate that Euclidean distances in the latent space correspond to distances between conditional densities induced by representations as well as semantic similarities in the image space. Applying a clustering algorithm in the representation space yields groups of images that share both fine details (e.g., specialized features, textured regions, small objects), as well as global structure, but are only partially aligned with object identities. Thus, we show for the first time that a network trained solely on denoising contains a rich and accessible sparse representation of images.

- **Summary**: Learning alignment between language and vision is a fundamental challenge, especially as multimodal data becomes increasingly detailed and complex. Existing methods often rely on collecting human or AI preferences, which can be costly and time-intensive. We propose an alternative approach that leverages cycle consistency as a supervisory signal. Given an image and generated text, we map the text back to image space using a text-to-image model and compute the similarity between the original image and its reconstruction. Analogously, for text-to-image generation, we measure the textual similarity between an input caption and its reconstruction through the cycle. We use the cycle consistency score to rank candidates and construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison pairs. The reward model trained on our dataset outperforms state-of-the-art alignment metrics on detailed captioning, with superior inference-time scalability when used as a verifier for Best-of-N sampling. Furthermore, performing DPO and Diffusion DPO using our dataset enhances performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation.

- **Summary**: Text-guided image editing has seen rapid progress in natural image domains, but its adaptation to medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation. Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful medical image editing systems. Project website: https://mliuby.github.io/MedEBench_Website/

- **Summary**: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have shown notable progress in scaling test-time compute effectively. In this work, we investigate how synthesized RL data can further improve RLVR. To this end, we propose \textbf{SynthRL}-a scalable and guaranteed pipeline for automatic data scaling in reasoning-oriented RL training. SynthRL comprises three key stages: (1) selecting seed questions with appropriate distribution, (2) augmenting them into more challenging variants while preserving the original answers, and (3) a guaranteed verification stage that ensures near-perfect correctness and difficulty enhancement. Our empirical experiments demonstrate SynthRL's scalability and effectiveness. When applied to the MMK12 dataset, SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable, challenging questions from approximately 8K seed samples. Models trained with our synthesized data achieve consistent gains across five out-of-domain visual math reasoning benchmarks, with a significant improvement over baseline models trained on seed data alone. Notably, detailed analysis reveals that the gains are more pronounced on the most challenging evaluation samples, highlighting SynthRL's effectiveness in eliciting deeper and more complex reasoning patterns.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images from natural language prompts. However, they often fail to produce semantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations that contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual contradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled associations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware prompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a sequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the semantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while ensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify contradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original intent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information with the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic control and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual contradictions. Experiments across a variety of challenging prompts show substantial improvements in alignment to the textual prompt.

- **Summary**: Spatial intelligence, encompassing 3D reconstruction, perception, and reasoning, is fundamental to applications such as robotics, aerial imaging, and extended reality. A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core 3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel method for low-rank personalization of a generic model for head avatar generation. Prior work proposes generic models that achieve high-quality face animation by leveraging large-scale datasets of multiple identities. However, such generic models usually fail to synthesize unique identity-specific details, since they learn a general domain prior. To adapt to specific subjects, we find that it is still challenging to capture high-frequency facial details via popular solutions like low-rank adaptation (LoRA). This motivates us to propose a specific architecture, a Register Module, that enhances the performance of LoRA, while requiring only a small number of parameters to adapt to an unseen identity. Our module is applied to intermediate features of a pre-trained model, storing and re-purposing information in a learnable 3D feature space. To demonstrate the efficacy of our personalization method, we collect a dataset of talking videos of individuals with distinctive facial details, such as wrinkles and tattoos. Our approach faithfully captures unseen faces, outperforming existing methods quantitatively and qualitatively. We will release the code, models, and dataset to the public.



### Fast and Robust Rotation Averaging with Anisotropic Coordinate Descent

- **Summary**: Anisotropic rotation averaging has recently been explored as a natural extension of respective isotropic methods. In the anisotropic formulation, uncertainties of the estimated relative rotations -- obtained via standard two-view optimization -- are propagated to the optimization of absolute rotations. The resulting semidefinite relaxations are able to recover global minima but scale poorly with the problem size. Local methods are fast and also admit robust estimation but are sensitive to initialization. They usually employ minimum spanning trees and therefore suffer from drift accumulation and can get trapped in poor local minima. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between optimality, robustness and efficiency of anisotropic rotation averaging. We analyze a family of block coordinate descent methods initially proposed to optimize the standard chordal distances, and derive a much simpler formulation and an anisotropic extension obtaining a fast general solver. We integrate this solver into the extended anisotropic large-scale robust rotation averaging pipeline. The resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on public structure-from-motion datasets. Project page: https://ylochman.github.io/acd

- **Summary**: Training large neural networks on large-scale datasets requires substantial computational resources, particularly for dense prediction tasks such as object detection. Although dataset distillation (DD) has been proposed to alleviate these demands by synthesizing compact datasets from larger ones, most existing work focuses solely on image classification, leaving the more complex detection setting largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce OD3, a novel optimization-free data distillation framework specifically designed for object detection. Our approach involves two stages: first, a candidate selection process in which object instances are iteratively placed in synthesized images based on their suitable locations, and second, a candidate screening process using a pre-trained observer model to remove low-confidence objects. We perform our data synthesis framework on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC, two popular detection datasets, with compression ratios ranging from 0.25% to 5%. Compared to the prior solely existing dataset distillation method on detection and conventional core set selection methods, OD3 delivers superior accuracy, establishes new state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior best method by more than 14% on COCO mAP50 at a compression ratio of 1.0%.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in scene understanding have leveraged multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for 3D reasoning by capitalizing on their strong 2D pretraining. However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the 3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework that enhances MLLM 3D representation learning by introducing supervision from pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs -- including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering -- demonstrate consistent performance gains.

- **Summary**: Numerous low-level vision tasks operate in the RAW domain due to its linear properties, bit depth, and sensor designs. Despite this, RAW image datasets are scarce and more expensive to collect than the already large and public sRGB datasets. For this reason, many approaches try to generate realistic RAW images using sensor information and sRGB images. This paper covers the second challenge on RAW Reconstruction from sRGB (Reverse ISP). We aim to recover RAW sensor images from smartphones given the corresponding sRGB images without metadata and, by doing this, ``reverse" the ISP transformation. Over 150 participants joined this NTIRE 2025 challenge and submitted efficient models. The proposed methods and benchmark establish the state-of-the-art for generating realistic RAW data.

- **Summary**: Recent diffusion models have advanced image editing by enhancing visual quality and control, supporting broad applications across creative and personalized domains. However, current image editing largely overlooks multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts, and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit), which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing. To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural alignment and semantic accuracy. The code and model are available at https://github.com/muzishen/IMAGHarmony.

- **Summary**: We introduce DualMap, an online open-vocabulary mapping system that enables robots to understand and navigate dynamically changing environments through natural language queries. Designed for efficient semantic mapping and adaptability to changing environments, DualMap meets the essential requirements for real-world robot navigation applications. Our proposed hybrid segmentation frontend and object-level status check eliminate the costly 3D object merging required by prior methods, enabling efficient online scene mapping. The dual-map representation combines a global abstract map for high-level candidate selection with a local concrete map for precise goal-reaching, effectively managing and updating dynamic changes in the environment. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, efficient scene mapping, and online language-guided navigation.

- **Summary**: Prior methods for controlling image generation are limited in their ability to be taught new tasks. In contrast, vision-language models, or VLMs, can learn tasks in-context and produce the correct outputs for a given input. We propose a dual-process distillation scheme that allows feed-forward image generators to learn new tasks from deliberative VLMs. Our scheme uses a VLM to rate the generated images and backpropagates this gradient to update the weights of the image generator. Our general framework enables a wide variety of new control tasks through the same text-and-image based interface. We showcase a handful of applications of this technique for different types of control signals, such as commonsense inferences and visual prompts. With our method, users can implement multimodal controls for properties such as color palette, line weight, horizon position, and relative depth within a matter of minutes.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new task, Map and Locate, which unifies the traditionally distinct objectives of open-vocabulary segmentation - detecting and segmenting object instances based on natural language queries - and 3D reconstruction, the process of estimating a scene's 3D structure from visual inputs. Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Deformable medical image registration is an essential task in computer-assisted interventions. This problem is particularly relevant to oncological treatments, where precise image alignment is necessary for tracking tumor growth, assessing treatment response, and ensuring accurate delivery of therapies. Recent AI methods can outperform traditional techniques in accuracy and speed, yet they often produce unreliable deformations that limit their clinical adoption. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a novel implicit registration framework that can predict accurate and reliable deformations. Our insight is to reformulate image registration as a signal reconstruction problem: we learn a kernel function that can recover the dense displacement field from sparse keypoint correspondences. We integrate our method in a novel hierarchical architecture, and estimate the displacement field in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our formulation also allows for efficient refinement at test time, permitting clinicians to easily adjust registrations when needed. We validate our method on challenging intra-patient thoracic and abdominal zero-shot registration tasks, using public and internal datasets from the local University Hospital. Our method not only shows competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches, but also bridges the generalization gap between implicit and explicit registration techniques. In particular, our method generates deformations that better preserve anatomical relationships and matches the performance of specialized commercial systems, underscoring its potential for clinical adoption.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancements of Text-to-Image (T2I) models have ushered in a new phase of AI-generated content, marked by their growing ability to interpret and follow user instructions. However, existing T2I model evaluation benchmarks fall short in limited prompt diversity and complexity, as well as coarse evaluation metrics, making it difficult to evaluate the fine-grained alignment performance between textual instructions and generated images. In this paper, we present TIIF-Bench (Text-to-Image Instruction Following Benchmark), aiming to systematically assess T2I models' ability in interpreting and following intricate textual instructions. TIIF-Bench comprises a set of 5000 prompts organized along multiple dimensions, which are categorized into three levels of difficulties and complexities. To rigorously evaluate model robustness to varying prompt lengths, we provide a short and a long version for each prompt with identical core semantics. Two critical attributes, i.e., text rendering and style control, are introduced to evaluate the precision of text synthesis and the aesthetic coherence of T2I models. In addition, we collect 100 high-quality designer level prompts that encompass various scenarios to comprehensively assess model performance. Leveraging the world knowledge encoded in large vision language models, we propose a novel computable framework to discern subtle variations in T2I model outputs. Through meticulous benchmarking of mainstream T2I models on TIIF-Bench, we analyze the pros and cons of current T2I models and reveal the limitations of current T2I benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Previous studies have compared the brain and deep neural networks trained on image classification. Intriguingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification tasks.   We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and, surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Modern AI systems struggle most in environments where reliability is critical - scenes with smoke, poor visibility, and structural deformation. Each year, tens of thousands of firefighters are injured on duty, often due to breakdowns in situational perception. We introduce Fire360, a benchmark for evaluating perception and reasoning in safety-critical firefighting scenarios. The dataset includes 228 360-degree videos from professional training sessions under diverse conditions (e.g., low light, thermal distortion), annotated with action segments, object locations, and degradation metadata. Fire360 supports five tasks: Visual Question Answering, Temporal Action Captioning, Object Localization, Safety-Critical Reasoning, and Transformed Object Retrieval (TOR). TOR tests whether models can match pristine exemplars to fire-damaged counterparts in unpaired scenes, evaluating transformation-invariant recognition. While human experts achieve 83.5% on TOR, models like GPT-4o lag significantly, exposing failures in reasoning under degradation. By releasing Fire360 and its evaluation suite, we aim to advance models that not only see, but also remember, reason, and act under uncertainty. The dataset is available at: https://uofi.box.com/v/fire360dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper critically evaluates the applicability of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide framework to Artificial Intelligence (AI) software projects, highlighting key limitations and proposing tailored adaptations. Unlike traditional projects, AI initiatives rely heavily on complex data, iterative experimentation, and specialized expertise while navigating significant ethical considerations. Our analysis identifies gaps in the PMBOK Guide, including its limited focus on data management, insufficient support for iterative development, and lack of guidance on ethical and multidisciplinary challenges. To address these deficiencies, we recommend integrating data lifecycle management, adopting iterative and AI project management frameworks, and embedding ethical considerations within project planning and execution. Additionally, we explore alternative approaches that better align with AI's dynamic and exploratory nature. We aim to enhance project management practices for AI software projects by bridging these gaps.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks through high-fidelity outputs, yet flow matching (FM) offers faster inference and empirical performance gains. However, current foundation FM models are computationally prohibitive for finetuning, while diffusion models like Stable Diffusion benefit from efficient architectures and ecosystem support. This work addresses the critical challenge of efficiently transferring knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models to flow matching. We propose Diff2Flow, a novel framework that systematically bridges diffusion and FM paradigms by rescaling timesteps, aligning interpolants, and deriving FM-compatible velocity fields from diffusion predictions. This alignment enables direct and efficient FM finetuning of diffusion priors with no extra computation overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that Diff2Flow outperforms na\"ive FM and diffusion finetuning particularly under parameter-efficient constraints, while achieving superior or competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code at https://github.com/CompVis/diff2flow.

- **Summary**: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However, existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1) text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2) unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have yielded unprecedented quality in visual content and semantic coherence. However, current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion, resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and physics-based motion models.

- **Summary**: Active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric videos presents unique challenges due to unstable viewpoints, motion blur, and off-screen speech sources - conditions under which traditional visual-centric methods degrade significantly. We introduce PAIR-Net (Pretrained Audio-Visual Integration with Regularization Network), an effective model that integrates a partially frozen Whisper audio encoder with a fine-tuned AV-HuBERT visual backbone to robustly fuse cross-modal cues. To counteract modality imbalance, we introduce an inter-modal alignment loss that synchronizes audio and visual representations, enabling more consistent convergence across modalities. Without relying on multi-speaker context or ideal frontal views, PAIR-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Ego4D ASD benchmark with 76.6% mAP, surpassing LoCoNet and STHG by 8.2% and 12.9% mAP, respectively. Our results highlight the value of pretrained audio priors and alignment-based fusion for robust ASD under real-world egocentric conditions.

- **Summary**: Estimating agent pose and 3D scene structure from multi-camera rigs is a central task in embodied AI applications such as autonomous driving. Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure.   To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing.   Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.

- **Summary**: Despite advances in multimodal learning, challenging benchmarks for mixed-modal image retrieval that combines visual and textual information are lacking. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. The datasets are accessible through the GitHub page: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit-retrieval.

- **Summary**: Large foundation models trained on extensive datasets demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities in various domains. To replicate their success when data and model size are constrained, knowledge distillation has become an established tool for transferring knowledge from foundation models to small student networks. However, the effectiveness of distillation is critically limited by the available training data. This work addresses the common practical issue of covariate shift in knowledge distillation, where spurious features appear during training but not at test time. We ask the question: when these spurious features are unknown, yet a robust teacher is available, is it possible for a student to also become robust to them? We address this problem by introducing a novel diffusion-based data augmentation strategy that generates images by maximizing the disagreement between the teacher and the student, effectively creating challenging samples that the student struggles with. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves worst group and mean group accuracy on CelebA and SpuCo Birds as well as the spurious mAUC on spurious ImageNet under covariate shift, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based data augmentation baselines

- **Summary**: The inherent complexities of Arabic script; its cursive nature, diacritical marks (tashkeel), and varied typography, pose persistent challenges for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). We present Qari-OCR, a series of vision-language models derived from Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, progressively optimized for Arabic through iterative fine-tuning on specialized synthetic datasets. Our leading model, QARI v0.2, establishes a new open-source state-of-the-art with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.160, Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.061, and BLEU score of 0.737 on diacritically-rich texts. Qari-OCR demonstrates superior handling of tashkeel, diverse fonts, and document layouts, alongside impressive performance on low-resolution images. Further explorations (QARI v0.3) showcase strong potential for structural document understanding and handwritten text. This work delivers a marked improvement in Arabic OCR accuracy and efficiency, with all models and datasets released to foster further research.

- **Summary**: Retinal blood vessel segmentation is crucial for diagnosing ocular and cardiovascular diseases. Although the introduction of U-Net in 2015 by Olaf Ronneberger significantly advanced this field, yet issues like limited training data, imbalance data distribution, and inadequate feature extraction persist, hindering both the segmentation performance and optimal model generalization. Addressing these critical issues, the DEFFA-Unet is proposed featuring an additional encoder to process domain-invariant pre-processed inputs, thereby improving both richer feature encoding and enhanced model generalization. A feature filtering fusion module is developed to ensure the precise feature filtering and robust hybrid feature fusion. In response to the task-specific need for higher precision where false positives are very costly, traditional skip connections are replaced with the attention-guided feature reconstructing fusion module. Additionally, innovative data augmentation and balancing methods are proposed to counter data scarcity and distribution imbalance, further boosting the robustness and generalization of the model. With a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics, extensive validations on four benchmark datasets (DRIVE, CHASEDB1, STARE, and HRF) and an SLO dataset (IOSTAR), demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over both baseline and state-of-the-art models. Particularly the proposed method significantly outperforms the compared methods in cross-validation model generalization.

- **Summary**: Providing effective treatment and making informed clinical decisions are essential goals of modern medicine and clinical care. We are interested in simulating disease dynamics for clinical decision-making, leveraging recent advances in large generative models. To this end, we introduce the Medical World Model (MeWM), the first world model in medicine that visually predicts future disease states based on clinical decisions. MeWM comprises (i) vision-language models to serve as policy models, and (ii) tumor generative models as dynamics models. The policy model generates action plans, such as clinical treatments, while the dynamics model simulates tumor progression or regression under given treatment conditions. Building on this, we propose the inverse dynamics model that applies survival analysis to the simulated post-treatment tumor, enabling the evaluation of treatment efficacy and the selection of the optimal clinical action plan. As a result, the proposed MeWM simulates disease dynamics by synthesizing post-treatment tumors, with state-of-the-art specificity in Turing tests evaluated by radiologists. Simultaneously, its inverse dynamics model outperforms medical-specialized GPTs in optimizing individualized treatment protocols across all metrics. Notably, MeWM improves clinical decision-making for interventional physicians, boosting F1-score in selecting the optimal TACE protocol by 13%, paving the way for future integration of medical world models as the second readers.

- **Summary**: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.

- **Summary**: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information. However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics (segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC), trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining. Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.

- **Summary**: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment. However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed, where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction. Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features, and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised, statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation, thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels. Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs. However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs. Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models, have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content. Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs, i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps. To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e., bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables, receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

- **Summary**: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference. Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling, pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora, Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance, reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video generation in both research and practical applications.

- **Summary**: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas. LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials, and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact, editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark, along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page: https://litereality.github.io; Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecK9m3LXg2c

- **Summary**: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600, UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters, across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

- **Summary**: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is available at: https://github.com/YkiWu/Point3R.

- **Summary**: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the multimodal sim-to-real gap.

- **Summary**: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins. Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy, and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

- **Summary**: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency, and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark, we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

- **Summary**: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data, we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual systems.

- **Summary**: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm) critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest, AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics, contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and broader crop applicability.

- **Summary**: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures, typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics: 99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop yields and strengthening food security.

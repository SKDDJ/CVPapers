- **Summary**: Finetuning from a pretrained deep model is found to yield state-of-the-art performance for many vision tasks. This paper investigates many factors that influence the performance in finetuning for object detection. There is a long-tailed distribution of sample numbers for classes in object detection. Our analysis and empirical results show that classes with more samples have higher impact on the feature learning. And it is better to make the sample number more uniform across classes. Generic object detection can be considered as multiple equally important tasks. Detection of each class is a task. These classes/tasks have their individuality in discriminative visual appearance representation. Taking this individuality into account, we cluster objects into visually similar class groups and learn deep representations for these groups separately. A hierarchical feature learning scheme is proposed. In this scheme, the knowledge from the group with large number of classes is transferred for learning features in its sub-groups. Finetuned on the GoogLeNet model, experimental results show 4.7% absolute mAP improvement of our approach on the ImageNet object detection dataset without increasing much computational cost at the testing stage.

- **Summary**: Cross modal face matching between the thermal and visible spectrum is a much desired capability for night-time surveillance and security applications. Due to a very large modality gap, thermal-to-visible face recognition is one of the most challenging face matching problem. In this paper, we present an approach to bridge this modality gap by a significant margin. Our approach captures the highly non-linear relationship between the two modalities by using a deep neural network. Our model attempts to learn a non-linear mapping from visible to thermal spectrum while preserving the identity information. We show substantive performance improvement on three difficult thermal-visible face datasets. The presented approach improves the state-of-the-art by more than 10\% on UND-X1 dataset and by more than 15-30\% on NVESD dataset in terms of Rank-1 identification. Our method bridges the drop in performance due to the modality gap by more than 40\%.

- **Summary**: In this study, a machine learning algorithm is used for disaggregation of SMAP brightness temperatures (T$_{\textrm{B}}$) from 36km to 9km. It uses image segmentation to cluster the study region based on meteorological and land cover similarity, followed by a support vector machine based regression that computes the value of the disaggregated T$_{\textrm{B}}$ at all pixels. High resolution remote sensing products such as land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, precipitation, soil texture, and land-cover were used for disaggregation. The algorithm was implemented in Iowa, United States, from April to July 2015, and compared with the SMAP L3_SM_AP T$_{\textrm{B}}$ product at 9km. It was found that the disaggregated T$_{\textrm{B}}$ were very similar to the SMAP-T$_{\textrm{B}}$ product, even for vegetated areas with a mean difference $\leq$ 5K. However, the standard deviation of the disaggregation was lower by 7K than that of the AP product. The probability density functions of the disaggregated T$_{\textrm{B}}$ were similar to the SMAP-T$_{\textrm{B}}$. The results indicate that this algorithm may be used for disaggregating T$_{\textrm{B}}$ using complex non-linear correlations on a grid.

- **Summary**: By Emerging huge databases and the need to efficient learning algorithms on these datasets, new problems have appeared and some methods have been proposed to solve these problems by selecting efficient features. Feature selection is a problem of finding efficient features among all features in which the final feature set can improve accuracy and reduce complexity. One way to solve this problem is to evaluate all possible feature subsets. However, evaluating all possible feature subsets is an exhaustive search and thus it has high computational complexity. Until now many heuristic algorithms have been studied for solving this problem. Hyper-heuristic is a new heuristic approach which can search the solution space effectively by applying local searches appropriately. Each local search is a neighborhood searching algorithm. Since each region of the solution space can have its own characteristics, it should be chosen an appropriate local search and apply it to current solution. This task is tackled to a supervisor. The supervisor chooses a local search based on the functional history of local searches. By doing this task, it can trade of between exploitation and exploration. Since the existing heuristic cannot trade of between exploration and exploitation appropriately, the solution space has not been searched appropriately in these methods and thus they have low convergence rate. For the first time, in this paper use a hyper-heuristic approach to find an efficient feature subset. In the proposed method, genetic algorithm is used as a supervisor and 16 heuristic algorithms are used as local searches. Empirical study of the proposed method on several commonly used data sets from UCI data sets indicates that it outperforms recent existing methods in the literature for feature selection.

- **Summary**: Object proposals for detecting moving or static video objects need to address issues such as speed, memory complexity and temporal consistency. We propose an efficient Video Object Proposal (VOP) generation method and show its efficacy in learning a better video object detector. A deep-learning based video object detector learned using the proposed VOP achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on the Youtube-Objects dataset. We further propose a clustering of VOPs which can efficiently be used for detecting objects in video in a streaming fashion. As opposed to applying per-frame convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detection, our proposed method called Objects in Video Enabler thRough LAbel Propagation (OVERLAP) needs to classify only a small fraction of all candidate proposals in every video frame through streaming clustering of object proposals and class-label propagation. Source code will be made available soon.

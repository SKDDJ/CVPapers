- **Summary**: In this paper, a fast and practical GPU-based implementation of Fuzzy C-Means(FCM) clustering algorithm for image segmentation is proposed. First, an extensive analysis is conducted to study the dependency among the image pixels in the algorithm for parallelization. The proposed GPU-based FCM has been tested on digital brain simulated dataset to segment white matter(WM), gray matter(GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soft tissue regions. The execution time of the sequential FCM is 519 seconds for an image dataset with the size of 1MB. While the proposed GPU-based FCM requires only 2.33 seconds for the similar size of image dataset. An estimated 245-fold speedup is measured for the data size of 40 KB on a CUDA device that has 448 processors.

- **Summary**: Many patch-based image denoising algorithms can be formulated as applying a smoothing filter to the noisy image. Expressed as matrices, the smoothing filters must be row normalized so that each row sums to unity. Surprisingly, if we apply a column normalization before the row normalization, the performance of the smoothing filter can often be significantly improved. Prior works showed that such performance gain is related to the Sinkhorn-Knopp balancing algorithm, an iterative procedure that symmetrizes a row-stochastic matrix to a doubly-stochastic matrix. However, a complete understanding of the performance gain phenomenon is still lacking.   In this paper, we study the performance gain phenomenon from a statistical learning perspective. We show that Sinkhorn-Knopp is equivalent to an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm of learning a Gaussian mixture model of the image patches. By establishing the correspondence between the steps of Sinkhorn-Knopp and the EM algorithm, we provide a geometrical interpretation of the symmetrization process. This observation allows us to develop a new denoising algorithm called Gaussian mixture model symmetric smoothing filter (GSF). GSF is an extension of the Sinkhorn-Knopp and is a generalization of the original smoothing filters. Despite its simple formulation, GSF outperforms many existing smoothing filters and has a similar performance compared to several state-of-the-art denoising algorithms.

- **Summary**: Advancements in Sonar image capture have enabled researchers to apply sophisticated object identification algorithms in order to locate targets of interest in images such as mines. Despite progress in this field, modern sonar automatic target recognition (ATR) approaches lack robustness to the amount of noise one would expect in real-world scenarios, the capability to handle blurring incurred from the physics of image capture, and the ability to excel with relatively few training samples. We address these challenges by adapting modern sparsity-based techniques with dictionaries comprising of training from each class. We develop new discriminative (as opposed to generative) sparse representations which can help automatically classify targets in Sonar imaging. Using a simulated SAS data set from the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), we obtained compelling classification rates for multi-class problems even in cases with considerable noise and sparsity in training samples.

- **Summary**: We present a probabilistic graphical model formulation for the graph clustering problem. This enables to locally represent uncertainty of image partitions by approximate marginal distributions in a mathematically substantiated way, and to rectify local data term cues so as to close contours and to obtain valid partitions.   We exploit recent progress on globally optimal MAP inference by integer programming and on perturbation-based approximations of the log-partition function, in order to sample clusterings and to estimate marginal distributions of node-pairs both more accurately and more efficiently than state-of-the-art methods. Our approach works for any graphically represented problem instance. This is demonstrated for image segmentation and social network cluster analysis. Our mathematical ansatz should be relevant also for other combinatorial problems.

- **Summary**: Most image instance retrieval pipelines are based on comparison of vectors known as global image descriptors between a query image and the database images. Due to their success in large scale image classification, representations extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are quickly gaining ground on Fisher Vectors (FVs) as state-of-the-art global descriptors for image instance retrieval. While CNN-based descriptors are generally remarked for good retrieval performance at lower bitrates, they nevertheless present a number of drawbacks including the lack of robustness to common object transformations such as rotations compared with their interest point based FV counterparts.   In this paper, we propose a method for computing invariant global descriptors from CNNs. Our method implements a recently proposed mathematical theory for invariance in a sensory cortex modeled as a feedforward neural network. The resulting global descriptors can be made invariant to multiple arbitrary transformation groups while retaining good discriminativeness.   Based on a thorough empirical evaluation using several publicly available datasets, we show that our method is able to significantly and consistently improve retrieval results every time a new type of invariance is incorporated. We also show that our method which has few parameters is not prone to overfitting: improvements generalize well across datasets with different properties with regard to invariances. Finally, we show that our descriptors are able to compare favourably to other state-of-the-art compact descriptors in similar bitranges, exceeding the highest retrieval results reported in the literature on some datasets. A dedicated dimensionality reduction step --quantization or hashing-- may be able to further improve the competitiveness of the descriptors.

- **Summary**: Multiview learning problem refers to the problem of learning a classifier from multiple view data. In this data set, each data points is presented by multiple different views. In this paper, we propose a novel method for this problem. This method is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that each data point has an intact feature vector, and each view is obtained by a linear transformation from the intact vector. The second assumption is that the intact vectors are discriminative, and in the intact space, we have a linear classifier to separate the positive class from the negative class. We define an intact vector for each data point, and a view-conditional transformation matrix for each view, and propose to reconstruct the multiple view feature vectors by the product of the corresponding intact vectors and transformation matrices. Moreover, we also propose a linear classifier in the intact space, and learn it jointly with the intact vectors. The learning problem is modeled by a minimization problem, and the objective function is composed of a Cauchy error estimator-based view-conditional reconstruction term over all data points and views, and a classification error term measured by hinge loss over all the intact vectors of all the data points. Some regularization terms are also imposed to different variables in the objective function. The minimization problem is solve by an iterative algorithm using alternate optimization strategy and gradient descent algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows it advantage in the compression to other multiview learning algorithms on benchmark data sets.

- **Summary**: Low rank representation (LRR) has recently attracted great interest due to its pleasing efficacy in exploring low-dimensional sub- space structures embedded in data. One of its successful applications is subspace clustering, by which data are clustered according to the subspaces they belong to. In this paper, at a higher level, we intend to cluster subspaces into classes of subspaces. This is naturally described as a clustering problem on Grassmann manifold. The novelty of this paper is to generalize LRR on Euclidean space onto an LRR model on Grassmann manifold in a uniform kernelized LRR framework. The new method has many applications in data analysis in computer vision tasks. The proposed models have been evaluated on a number of practical data analysis applications. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform a number of state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.



### Temporal Action Localization in Untrimmed Videos via Multi-stage CNNs

- **Summary**: We address temporal action localization in untrimmed long videos. This is important because videos in real applications are usually unconstrained and contain multiple action instances plus video content of background scenes or other activities. To address this challenging issue, we exploit the effectiveness of deep networks in temporal action localization via three segment-based 3D ConvNets: (1) a proposal network identifies candidate segments in a long video that may contain actions; (2) a classification network learns one-vs-all action classification model to serve as initialization for the localization network; and (3) a localization network fine-tunes on the learned classification network to localize each action instance. We propose a novel loss function for the localization network to explicitly consider temporal overlap and therefore achieve high temporal localization accuracy. Only the proposal network and the localization network are used during prediction. On two large-scale benchmarks, our approach achieves significantly superior performances compared with other state-of-the-art systems: mAP increases from 1.7% to 7.4% on MEXaction2 and increases from 15.0% to 19.0% on THUMOS 2014, when the overlap threshold for evaluation is set to 0.5.

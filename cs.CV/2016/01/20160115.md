- **Summary**: This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to learn visual features online for improving loop-closure detection and place recognition, based on bag-of-words frameworks. The approach learns a codeword in bag-of-words model from a pair of matched features from two consecutive frames, such that the codeword has temporally-derived perspective invariance to camera motion. The learning algorithm is efficient: the binary descriptor is generated from the mean image patch, and the mask is learned based on discriminative projection by minimizing the intra-class distances among the learned feature and the two original features. A codeword for bag-of-words models is generated by packaging the learned descriptor and mask, with a masked Hamming distance defined to measure the distance between two codewords. The geometric properties of the learned codewords are then mathematically justified. In addition, hypothesis constraints are imposed through temporal consistency in matched codewords, which improves precision. The approach, integrated in an incremental bag-of-words system, is validated on multiple benchmark data sets and compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate improved precision/recall outperforming state of the art with little loss in runtime.

- **Summary**: In [18], Mozerov et al. propose to perform stereo matching as a two-step energy minimization problem. For the first step they solve a fully connected MRF model. And in the next step the marginal output is employed as the unary cost for a locally connected MRF model.   In this paper we intend to combine the two steps of energy minimization in order to improve stereo matching results. We observe that the fully connected MRF leads to smoother disparity maps, while the locally connected MRF achieves superior results in fine-structured regions. Thus we propose to jointly solve the fully connected and locally connected models, taking both their advantages into account. The joint model is solved by mean field approximations. While remaining efficient, our joint model outperforms the two-step energy minimization approach in both time and estimation error on the Middlebury stereo benchmark v3.

- **Summary**: Automatic description generation from natural images is a challenging problem that has recently received a large amount of interest from the computer vision and natural language processing communities. In this survey, we classify the existing approaches based on how they conceptualize this problem, viz., models that cast description as either generation problem or as a retrieval problem over a visual or multimodal representational space. We provide a detailed review of existing models, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we give an overview of the benchmark image datasets and the evaluation measures that have been developed to assess the quality of machine-generated image descriptions. Finally we extrapolate future directions in the area of automatic image description generation.

- **Summary**: Slow feature analysis (SFA) is an unsupervised-learning algorithm that extracts slowly varying features from a multi-dimensional time series. A supervised extension to SFA for classification and regression is graph-based SFA (GSFA). GSFA is based on the preservation of similarities, which are specified by a graph structure derived from the labels. It has been shown that hierarchical GSFA (HGSFA) allows learning from images and other high-dimensional data. The feature space spanned by HGSFA is complex due to the composition of the nonlinearities of the nodes in the network. However, we show that the network discards useful information prematurely before it reaches higher nodes, resulting in suboptimal global slowness and an under-exploited feature space.   To counteract these problems, we propose an extension called hierarchical information-preserving GSFA (HiGSFA), where information preservation complements the slowness-maximization goal. We build a 10-layer HiGSFA network to estimate human age from facial photographs of the MORPH-II database, achieving a mean absolute error of 3.50 years, improving the state-of-the-art performance. HiGSFA and HGSFA support multiple-labels and offer a rich feature space, feed-forward training, and linear complexity in the number of samples and dimensions. Furthermore, HiGSFA outperforms HGSFA in terms of feature slowness, estimation accuracy and input reconstruction, giving rise to a promising hierarchical supervised-learning approach.

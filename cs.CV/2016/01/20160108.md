- **Summary**: Range images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras are corrupted with multipath distortions due to interaction between modulated light signals and scenes. The interaction is often complicated, which makes a model-based solution elusive. We propose a learning-based approach for removing the multipath distortions for a ToF camera in a robotic arm setup. Our approach is based on deep learning. We use the robotic arm to automatically collect a large amount of ToF range images containing various multipath distortions. The training images are automatically labeled by leveraging a high precision structured light sensor available only in the training time. In the test time, we apply the learned model to remove the multipath distortions. This allows our robotic arm setup to enjoy the speed and compact form of the ToF camera without compromising with its range measurement errors. We conduct extensive experimental validations and compare the proposed method to several baseline algorithms. The experiment results show that our method achieves 55% error reduction in range estimation and largely outperforms the baseline algorithms.

- **Summary**: Potholes though seem inconsequential, may cause accidents resulting in loss of human life. In this paper, we present an automated system to efficiently manage the potholes in a ward by deploying geotagging and image processing techniques that overcomes the drawbacks associated with the existing survey-oriented systems. Image processing is used for identification of target pothole regions in the 2D images using edge detection and morphological image processing operations. A method is developed to accurately estimate the dimensions of the potholes from their images, analyze their area and depth, estimate the quantity of filling material required and therefore enabling pothole attendance on a priority basis. This will further enable the government official to have a fully automated system for effectively managing pothole related disasters.

- **Summary**: Human face aging is irreversible process causing changes in human face characteristics such us hair whitening, muscles drop and wrinkles. Due to the importance of human face aging in biometrics systems, age estimation became an attractive area for researchers. This paper presents a novel method to estimate the age from face images, using binarized statistical image features (BSIF) and local binary patterns (LBP)histograms as features performed by support vector regression (SVR) and kernel ridge regression (KRR). We applied our method on FG-NET and PAL datasets. Our proposed method has shown superiority to that of the state-of-the-art methods when using the whole PAL database.

- **Summary**: In this paper we introduce a script identification method based on hand-crafted texture features and an artificial neural network. The proposed pipeline achieves near state-of-the-art performance for script identification of video-text and state-of-the-art performance on visual language identification of handwritten text. More than using the deep network as a classifier, the use of its intermediary activations as a learned metric demonstrates remarkable results and allows the use of discriminative models on unknown classes. Comparative experiments in video-text and text in the wild datasets provide insights on the internals of the proposed deep network.

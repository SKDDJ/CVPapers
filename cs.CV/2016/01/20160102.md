- **Summary**: A new submodule clustering method via sparse and low-rank representation for multi-way data is proposed in this paper. Instead of reshaping multi-way data into vectors, this method maintains their natural orders to preserve data intrinsic structures, e.g., image data kept as matrices. To implement clustering, the multi-way data, viewed as tensors, are represented by the proposed tensor sparse and low-rank model to obtain its submodule representation, called a free module, which is finally used for spectral clustering. The proposed method extends the conventional subspace clustering method based on sparse and low-rank representation to multi-way data submodule clustering by combining t-product operator. The new method is tested on several public datasets, including synthetical data, video sequences and toy images. The experiments show that the new method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, such as Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), Low-Rank Representation (LRR), Ordered Subspace Clustering (OSC), Robust Latent Low Rank Representation (RobustLatLRR) and Sparse Submodule Clustering method (SSmC).

- **Summary**: Active Appearance Models (AAMs) are one of the most popular and well-established techniques for modeling deformable objects in computer vision. In this paper, we study the problem of fitting AAMs using Compositional Gradient Descent (CGD) algorithms. We present a unified and complete view of these algorithms and classify them with respect to three main characteristics: i) cost function; ii) type of composition; and iii) optimization method. Furthermore, we extend the previous view by: a) proposing a novel Bayesian cost function that can be interpreted as a general probabilistic formulation of the well-known project-out loss; b) introducing two new types of composition, asymmetric and bidirectional, that combine the gradients of both image and appearance model to derive better conver- gent and more robust CGD algorithms; and c) providing new valuable insights into existent CGD algorithms by reinterpreting them as direct applications of the Schur complement and the Wiberg method. Finally, in order to encourage open research and facilitate future comparisons with our work, we make the implementa- tion of the algorithms studied in this paper publicly available as part of the Menpo Project.

- **Summary**: Five different texture methods are used to investigate their susceptibility to subtle noise occurring in lung tumor Computed Tomography (CT) images caused by acquisition and reconstruction deficiencies. Noise of Gaussian and Rayleigh distributions with varying mean and variance was encountered in the analyzed CT images. Fisher and Bhattacharyya distance measures were used to differentiate between an original extracted lung tumor region of interest (ROI) with a filtered and noisy reconstructed versions. Through examining the texture characteristics of the lung tumor areas by five different texture measures, it was determined that the autocovariance measure was least affected and the gray level co-occurrence matrix was the most affected by noise. Depending on the selected ROI size, it was concluded that the number of extracted features from each texture measure increases susceptibility to noise.

- **Summary**: With the heterogeneous nature of tissue texture, using a single resolution approach for optimum classification might not suffice. In contrast, a multiresolution wavelet packet analysis can decompose the input signal into a set of frequency subbands giving the opportunity to characterise the texture at the appropriate frequency channel. An adaptive best bases algorithm for optimal bases selection for meningioma histopathological images is proposed, via applying the fractal dimension (FD) as the bases selection criterion in a tree-structured manner. Thereby, the most significant subband that better identifies texture discontinuities will only be chosen for further decomposition, and its fractal signature would represent the extracted feature vector for classification. The best basis selection using the FD outperformed the energy based selection approaches, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.25% as compared to 83.44% and 73.75% for the co-occurrence matrix and energy texture signatures; respectively.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to compare between four different types of feature extraction approaches in terms of texture segmentation. The feature extraction methods that were used for segmentation are Gabor filters (GF), Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF), run-length matrix (RLM) and co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). It was shown that the GF performed best in terms of quality of segmentation while the GLCM localises the texture boundaries better as compared to the other methods.

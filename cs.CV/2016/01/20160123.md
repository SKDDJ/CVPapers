- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hyperspectral image super-resolution by modeling the global spatial-and-spectral correlation and local smoothness properties over hyperspectral images. Specifically, we utilize the tensor nuclear norm and tensor folded-concave penalty functions to describe the global spatial-and-spectral correlation hidden in hyperspectral images, and 3D total variation (TV) to characterize the local spatial-and-spectral smoothness across all hyperspectral bands. Then, we develop an efficient algorithm for solving the resulting optimization problem by combing the local linear approximation (LLA) strategy and alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on one hyperspectral image dataset illustrate the merits of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: This Paper presents a method for lexicon reduction of Printed Farsi subwords based on their holistic shape features. Because of the large number of Persian subwords variously shaped from a simple letter to a complex combination of several connected characters, it is not easy to find a fixed shape descriptor suitable for all subwords. In this paper, we propose to select the descriptor according to the input shape characteristics. To do this, a neural network is trained to predict the appropriate descriptor of the input image. This network is implemented in the proposed lexicon reduction system to decide on the descriptor used for comparison of the query image with the lexicon entries. Evaluating the proposed method on a dataset of Persian subwords allows one to attest the effectiveness of the proposed idea of dealing differently with various query shapes.

- **Summary**: Current person re-identification (ReID) methods typically rely on single-frame imagery features, whilst ignoring space-time information from image sequences often available in the practical surveillance scenarios. Single-frame (single-shot) based visual appearance matching is inherently limited for person ReID in public spaces due to the challenging visual ambiguity and uncertainty arising from non-overlapping camera views where viewing condition changes can cause significant people appearance variations. In this work, we present a novel model to automatically select the most discriminative video fragments from noisy/incomplete image sequences of people from which reliable space-time and appearance features can be computed, whilst simultaneously learning a video ranking function for person ReID. Using the PRID$2011$, iLIDS-VID, and HDA+ image sequence datasets, we extensively conducted comparative evaluations to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over contemporary gait recognition, holistic image sequence matching and state-of-the-art single-/multi-shot ReID methods.

- **Summary**: Dense image matching is a fundamental low-level problem in Computer Vision, which has received tremendous attention from both discrete and continuous optimization communities. The goal of this paper is to combine the advantages of discrete and continuous optimization in a coherent framework. We devise a model based on energy minimization, to be optimized by both discrete and continuous algorithms in a consistent way. In the discrete setting, we propose a novel optimization algorithm that can be massively parallelized. In the continuous setting we tackle the problem of non-convex regularizers by a formulation based on differences of convex functions. The resulting hybrid discrete-continuous algorithm can be efficiently accelerated by modern GPUs and we demonstrate its real-time performance for the applications of dense stereo matching and optical flow.

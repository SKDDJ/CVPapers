- **Summary**: With the rise in militant activity and rogue behaviour in oil and gas regions around the world, oil pipeline disturbances is on the increase leading to huge losses to multinational operators and the countries where such facilities exist. However, this situation can be averted if adequate predictive monitoring schemes are put in place. We propose in the first part of this paper, an artificial intelligence predictive monitoring system capable of predictive classification and pattern recognition of pipeline datasets. The predictive system is based on a highly sparse predictive Deviant Learning Algorithm (p-DLA) designed to synthesize a sequence of memory predictive clusters for eventual monitoring, control and decision making. The DLA (p-DLA) is compared with a popular machine learning algorithm, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which is based on a temporal version of the standard feed-forward back-propagation trained artificial neural networks (ANNs). The results of simulations study show impressive results and validates the sparse memory predictive approach which favours the sub-synthesis of a highly compressed and low dimensional knowledge discovery and information prediction scheme. It also shows that the proposed new approach is competitive with a well-known and proven AI approach such as the LSTM.

- **Summary**: Marker-based and marker-less optical skeletal motion-capture methods use an outside-in arrangement of cameras placed around a scene, with viewpoints converging on the center. They often create discomfort by possibly needed marker suits, and their recording volume is severely restricted and often constrained to indoor scenes with controlled backgrounds. We therefore propose a new method for real-time, marker-less and egocentric motion capture which estimates the full-body skeleton pose from a lightweight stereo pair of fisheye cameras that are attached to a helmet or virtual-reality headset. It combines the strength of a new generative pose estimation framework for fisheye views with a ConvNet-based body-part detector trained on a new automatically annotated and augmented dataset. Our inside-in method captures full-body motion in general indoor and outdoor scenes, and also crowded scenes.

- **Summary**: We present an improved three-step pipeline for the stereo matching problem and introduce multiple novelties at each stage. We propose a new highway network architecture for computing the matching cost at each possible disparity, based on multilevel weighted residual shortcuts, trained with a hybrid loss that supports multilevel comparison of image patches. A novel post-processing step is then introduced, which employs a second deep convolutional neural network for pooling global information from multiple disparities. This network outputs both the image disparity map, which replaces the conventional "winner takes all" strategy, and a confidence in the prediction. The confidence score is achieved by training the network with a new technique that we call the reflective loss. Lastly, the learned confidence is employed in order to better detect outliers in the refinement step. The proposed pipeline achieves state of the art accuracy on the largest and most competitive stereo benchmarks, and the learned confidence is shown to outperform all existing alternatives.

- **Summary**: Airborne LiDAR point cloud representing a forest contains 3D data, from which vertical stand structure even of understory layers can be derived. This paper presents a tree segmentation approach for multi-story stands that stratifies the point cloud to canopy layers and segments individual tree crowns within each layer using a digital surface model based tree segmentation method. The novelty of the approach is the stratification procedure that separates the point cloud to an overstory and multiple understory tree canopy layers by analyzing vertical distributions of LiDAR points within overlapping locales. The procedure does not make a priori assumptions about the shape and size of the tree crowns and can, independent of the tree segmentation method, be utilized to vertically stratify tree crowns of forest canopies. We applied the proposed approach to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest - a natural deciduous forest with complex and highly variable terrain and vegetation structure. The segmentation results showed that using the stratification procedure strongly improved detecting understory trees (from 46% to 68%) at the cost of introducing a fair number of over-segmented understory trees (increased from 1% to 16%), while barely affecting the overall segmentation quality of overstory trees. Results of vertical stratification of the canopy showed that the point density of understory canopy layers were suboptimal for performing a reasonable tree segmentation, suggesting that acquiring denser LiDAR point clouds would allow more improvements in segmenting understory trees. As shown by inspecting correlations of the results with forest structure, the segmentation approach is applicable to a variety of forest types.

- **Summary**: We learn to compute optical flow by combining a classical spatial-pyramid formulation with deep learning. This estimates large motions in a coarse-to-fine approach by warping one image of a pair at each pyramid level by the current flow estimate and computing an update to the flow. Instead of the standard minimization of an objective function at each pyramid level, we train one deep network per level to compute the flow update. Unlike the recent FlowNet approach, the networks do not need to deal with large motions; these are dealt with by the pyramid. This has several advantages. First, our Spatial Pyramid Network (SPyNet) is much simpler and 96% smaller than FlowNet in terms of model parameters. This makes it more efficient and appropriate for embedded applications. Second, since the flow at each pyramid level is small (< 1 pixel), a convolutional approach applied to pairs of warped images is appropriate. Third, unlike FlowNet, the learned convolution filters appear similar to classical spatio-temporal filters, giving insight into the method and how to improve it. Our results are more accurate than FlowNet on most standard benchmarks, suggesting a new direction of combining classical flow methods with deep learning.

- **Summary**: We present a multi-purpose algorithm for simultaneous face detection, face alignment, pose estimation, gender recognition, smile detection, age estimation and face recognition using a single deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed method employs a multi-task learning framework that regularizes the shared parameters of CNN and builds a synergy among different domains and tasks. Extensive experiments show that the network has a better understanding of face and achieves state-of-the-art result for most of these tasks.

- **Summary**: Color channel selection is essential for accurate segmentation of sky and clouds in images obtained from ground-based sky cameras. Most prior works in cloud segmentation use threshold based methods on color channels selected in an ad-hoc manner. In this letter, we propose the use of rough sets for color channel selection in visible-light images. Our proposed approach assesses color channels with respect to their contribution for segmentation, and identifies the most effective ones.

- **Summary**: Transient imaging has recently made a huge impact in the computer graphics and computer vision fields. By capturing, reconstructing, or simulating light transport at extreme temporal resolutions, researchers have proposed novel techniques to show movies of light in motion, see around corners, detect objects in highly-scattering media, or infer material properties from a distance, to name a few. The key idea is to leverage the wealth of information in the temporal domain at the pico or nanosecond resolution, information usually lost during the capture-time temporal integration. This paper presents recent advances in this field of transient imaging from a graphics and vision perspective, including capture techniques, analysis, applications and simulation.

- **Summary**: The pel-recursive computation of 2-D optical flow has been extensively studied in computer vision to estimate motion from image sequences, but it still raises a wealth of issues, such as the treatment of outliers, motion discontinuities and occlusion. It relies on spatio-temporal brightness variations due to motion. Our proposed adaptive regularized approach deals with these issues within a common framework. It relies on the use of a data-driven technique called Mixed Norm (MN) to estimate the best motion vector for a given pixel. In our model, various types of noise can be handled, representing different sources of error. The motion vector estimation takes into consideration local image properties and it results from the minimization of a mixed norm functional with a regularization parameter depending on the kurtosis. This parameter determines the relative importance of the fourth norm and makes the functional convex. The main advantage of the developed procedure is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is necessary. Experiments indicate that this approach provides robust estimates of the optical flow.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has evolved as a clinical standard-of-care imaging modality for cardiac morphology, function assessment, and guidance of cardiac interventions. All these applications rely on accurate extraction of the myocardial tissue and blood pool from the imaging data. Here we propose a framework for left ventricle (LV) segmentation from cardiac cine-MRI. First, we segment the LV blood pool using iterative graph cuts, and subsequently use this information to segment the myocardium. We formulate the segmentation procedure as an energy minimization problem in a graph subject to the shape prior obtained by label propagation from an average atlas using affine registration. The proposed framework has been validated on 30 patient cardiac cine-MRI datasets available through the STACOM LV segmentation challenge and yielded fast, robust, and accurate segmentation results.

- **Summary**: Single particle reconstruction (SPR) from cryo-electron microscopy (EM) is a technique in which the 3D structure of a molecule needs to be determined from its contrast transfer function (CTF) affected, noisy 2D projection images taken at unknown viewing directions. One of the main challenges in cryo-EM is the typically low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the acquired images. 2D classification of images, followed by class averaging, improves the SNR of the resulting averages, and is used for selecting particles from micrographs and for inspecting the particle images. We introduce a new affinity measure, akin to the Mahalanobis distance, to compare cryo-EM images belonging to different defocus groups. The new similarity measure is employed to detect similar images, thereby leading to an improved algorithm for class averaging. We evaluate the performance of the proposed class averaging procedure on synthetic datasets, obtaining state of the art classification.

- **Summary**: Motion capturing and there by segmentation of the motion of any moving object from a sequence of continuous images or a video is not an exceptional task in computer vision area. Smart-phone camera application is an added integration for the development of such tasks and it also provides for a smooth testing. A new approach has been proposed for segmenting out the foreground moving object from the background and then masking the sequential motion with the static background which is commonly known as stroboscopic image. In this paper the whole process of the stroboscopic image construction technique has been clearly described along with some necessary constraints which is due to the traditional problem of estimating and modeling dynamic background changes. The background subtraction technique has been properly estimated here and number of sequential motion have also been calculated with the correlation between the motion of the object and its time of occurrence. This can be a very effective application that can replace the traditional stroboscopic system using high end SLR cameras, tripod stand, shutter speed control and position etc.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the problem of error concealment in video transmission systems over noisy channels employing Bregman divergences along with regularization. Error concealment intends to improve the effects of disturbances at the reception due to bit-errors or cell loss in packet networks. Bregman regularization gives accurate answers after just some iterations with fast convergence, better accuracy, and stability. This technique has an adaptive nature: the regularization functional is updated according to Bregman functions that change from iteration to iteration according to the nature of the neighborhood under study at iteration n. Numerical experiments show that high-quality regularization parameter estimates can be obtained. The convergence is sped up while turning the regularization parameter estimation less empiric, and more automatic.

- **Summary**: We address the novel problem of detecting dynamic regions in CrowdCam images, a set of still images captured by a group of people. These regions capture the most interesting parts of the scene, and detecting them plays an important role in the analysis of visual data. Our method is based on the observation that matching static points must satisfy the epipolar geometry constraints, but computing exact matches is challenging. Instead, we compute the probability that a pixel has a match, not necessarily the correct one, along the corresponding epipolar line. The complement of this probability is not necessarily the probability of a dynamic point because of occlusions, noise, and matching errors. Therefore, information from all pairs of images is aggregated to obtain a high quality dynamic probability map, per image. Experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on a broad range of settings; no prior knowledge about the scene, the camera characteristics or the camera locations is required.

- **Summary**: Visual inspection of x-ray scattering images is a powerful technique for probing the physical structure of materials at the molecular scale. In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning to develop methods for automatically analyzing x-ray scattering images. In particular, we apply Convolutional Neural Networks and Convolutional Autoencoders for x-ray scattering image classification. To acquire enough training data for deep learning, we use simulation software to generate synthetic x-ray scattering images. Experiments show that deep learning methods outperform previously published methods by 10\% on synthetic and real datasets.

- **Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicles now make it possible to obtain high quality aerial imagery at a low cost, but processing those images into a single, useful entity is neither simple nor seamless. Specifically, there are factors that must be addressed when merging multiple images into a single coherent one. While ortho-rectification can be done, it tends to be expensive and time consuming. Image stitching offers a more economical, low-tech approach. However direct application tends to fail for low-elevation imagery due to one or more factors including insufficient keypoints, parallax issues, and homogeneity of the surveyed area. This paper discusses these problems and possible solutions when using techniques such as image stitching and structure from motion for generating ortho-rectified imagery. These are presented in terms of actual Irish projects including the Boland's Mills building in Dublin's city centre, the Kilmoon Cross Farm, and the Richview buildings on the University College Dublin campus. Implications for various Irish industries are explained in terms of both urban and rural projects.

- **Summary**: Statistical methods are usually applied in the processing of digital images for the analysis of the textures displayed by them. Aiming to evaluate the urbanization of a given location from satellite or aerial images, here we consider a simple processing to distinguish in them the 'urban' from the 'rural' texture. The method is based on the mean values and the standard deviations of the colour tones of image pixels. The processing of the input images allows to obtain some maps from which a quantitative evaluation of the textures can be obtained.

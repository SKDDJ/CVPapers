- **Summary**: Probabilistic-driven classification techniques extend the role of traditional approaches that output labels (usually integer numbers) only. Such techniques are more fruitful when dealing with problems where one is not interested in recognition/identification only, but also into monitoring the behavior of consumers and/or machines, for instance. Therefore, by means of probability estimates, one can take decisions to work better in a number of scenarios. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic-based Optimum Path Forest (OPF) classifier to handle with binary classification problems, and we show it can be more accurate than naive OPF in a number of datasets. In addition to being just more accurate or not, probabilistic OPF turns to be another useful tool to the scientific community.

- **Summary**: A calculation formula of volume of revolution with integration by parts of definite integral is derived based on monotone function, and extended to a general case that curved trapezoids is determined by continuous, piecewise strictly monotone and differential function. And, two examples are given, ones curvilinear trapezoids is determined by Kepler equation, and the other curvilinear trapezoids is a function transmuted from Kepler equation.

- **Summary**: We propose novel methods of solving two tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks, firstly the task of generating HDR map of a static scene using differently exposed LDR images of the scene captured using conventional cameras and secondly the task of finding an optimal tone mapping operator that would give a better score on the TMQI metric compared to the existing methods. We quantitatively show the performance of our networks and illustrate the cases where our networks performs good as well as bad.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the finding that vanishing point (road tangent) guides driver's gaze, in our previous work we showed that vanishing point attracts gaze during free viewing of natural scenes as well as in visual search (Borji et al., Journal of Vision 2016). We have also introduced improved saliency models using vanishing point detectors (Feng et al., WACV 2016). Here, we aim to predict vanishing points in naturalistic environments by training convolutional neural networks in an end-to-end manner over a large set of road images downloaded from Youtube with vanishing points annotated. Results demonstrate effectiveness of our approach compared to classic approaches of vanishing point detection in the literature.

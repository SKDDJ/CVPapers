- **Summary**: We present a convolutional approach to reflection symmetry detection in 2D. Our model, built on the products of complex-valued wavelet convolutions, simplifies previous edge-based pairwise methods. Being parameter-centered, as opposed to feature-centered, it has certain computational advantages when the object sizes are known a priori, as demonstrated in an ellipse detection application. The method outperforms the best-performing algorithm on the CVPR 2013 Symmetry Detection Competition Database in the single-symmetry case. Code and a new database for 2D symmetry detection is available.

- **Summary**: Robotic challenges like the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC) or the DARPA Challenges are an established and important way to drive scientific progress. They make research comparable on a well-defined benchmark with equal test conditions for all participants. However, such challenge events occur only occasionally, are limited to a small number of contestants, and the test conditions are very difficult to replicate after the main event. We present a new physical benchmark challenge for robotic picking: the ACRV Picking Benchmark (APB). Designed to be reproducible, it consists of a set of 42 common objects, a widely available shelf, and exact guidelines for object arrangement using stencils. A well-defined evaluation protocol enables the comparison of \emph{complete} robotic systems -- including perception and manipulation -- instead of sub-systems only. Our paper also describes and reports results achieved by an open baseline system based on a Baxter robot.

- **Summary**: Data generated from real world events are usually temporal and contain multimodal information such as audio, visual, depth, sensor etc. which are required to be intelligently combined for classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel generalized deep neural network architecture where temporal streams from multiple modalities are combined. There are total M+1 (M is the number of modalities) components in the proposed network. The first component is a novel temporally hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that exploits the complimentary nature of the multimodal temporal information by allowing the network to learn both modality specific temporal dynamics as well as the dynamics in a multimodal feature space. M additional components are added to the network which extract discriminative but non-temporal cues from each modality. Finally, the predictions from all of these components are linearly combined using a set of automatically learned weights. We perform exhaustive experiments on three different datasets spanning four modalities. The proposed network is relatively 3.5%, 5.7% and 2% better than the best performing temporal multimodal baseline for UCF-101, CCV and Multimodal Gesture datasets respectively.

- **Summary**: Liveliness detection acts as a safe guard against spoofing attacks. Most of the researchers used vision based techniques to detect liveliness of the user, but they are highly sensitive to illumination effects. Therefore it is very hard to design a system, which will work robustly under all circumstances. Literature shows that most of the research utilize eye blink or mouth movement to detect the liveliness, while the other group used face texture to distinguish between real and imposter. The classification results of all these approaches decreases drastically in variable light conditions. Hence in this paper we are introducing fuzzy expert system which is sufficient enough to handle most of the cases comes in real time. We have used two testing parameters, (a) under bad illumination and (b) less movement in eyes and mouth in case of real user to evaluate the performance of the system. The system is behaving well in all, while in first case its False Rejection Rate (FRR) is 0.28, and in second case its FRR is 0.4.

- **Summary**: Learning articulated object pose is inherently difficult because the pose is high dimensional but has many structural constraints. Most existing work do not model such constraints and does not guarantee the geometric validity of their pose estimation, therefore requiring a post-processing to recover the correct geometry if desired, which is cumbersome and sub-optimal. In this work, we propose to directly embed a kinematic object model into the deep neutral network learning for general articulated object pose estimation. The kinematic function is defined on the appropriately parameterized object motion variables. It is differentiable and can be used in the gradient descent based optimization in network training. The prior knowledge on the object geometric model is fully exploited and the structure is guaranteed to be valid. We show convincing experiment results on a toy example and the 3D human pose estimation problem. For the latter we achieve state-of-the-art result on Human3.6M dataset.

- **Summary**: Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) models arise naturally as simple reformulations of many standard clustering algorithms including the popular spectral clustering method. Recent work has demonstrated that an elementary instance of SNMF provides superior clustering quality compared to many classic clustering algorithms on a variety of synthetic and real world data sets. In this work, we present novel reformulations of this instance of SNMF based on the notion of variable splitting and produce two fast and effective algorithms for its optimization using i) the provably convergent Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) procedure and ii) a heuristic version of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework. Our two algorithms present an interesting tradeoff between computational speed and mathematical convergence guarantee: while the former method is provably convergent it is considerably slower than the latter approach, for which we also provide significant but less stringent mathematical proof regarding its convergence. Through extensive experiments we show not only that the efficacy of these approaches is equal to that of the state of the art SNMF algorithm, but also that the latter of our algorithms is extremely fast being one to two orders of magnitude faster in terms of total computation time than the state of the art approach, outperforming even spectral clustering in terms of computation time on large data sets.

- **Summary**: Multimodal registration is a challenging problem in medical imaging due the high variability of tissue appearance under different imaging modalities. The crucial component here is the choice of the right similarity measure. We make a step towards a general learning-based solution that can be adapted to specific situations and present a metric based on a convolutional neural network. Our network can be trained from scratch even from a few aligned image pairs. The metric is validated on intersubject deformable registration on a dataset different from the one used for training, demonstrating good generalization. In this task, we outperform mutual information by a significant margin.

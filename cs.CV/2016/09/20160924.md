- **Summary**: In this project, we develop an android app that uses on computer vision techniques to estimate an object dimension present in field of view. The app while having compact size, is accurate upto +/- 5 mm and robust towards touch inputs. We use single-view metrology to compute accurate measurement. Unlike previous approaches, our technique does not rely on line detection and can be generalize to any object shape easily.

- **Summary**: Single feature is inefficient to describe content of an image, which is a shortcoming in traditional image retrieval task. We know that one image can be described by different features. Multi-feature fusion ranking can be utilized to improve the ranking list of query. In this paper, we first analyze graph structure and multi-feature fusion re-ranking from manifold aspect. Then, Three Tiers Neighborhood Graph (TTNG) is constructed to re-rank the original ranking list by single feature and to enhance precision of single feature. Furthermore, we propose Multi-graph Fusion Ranking (MFR) for multi-feature ranking, which considers the correlation of all images in multiple neighborhood graphs. Evaluations are conducted on UK-bench, Corel-1K, Corel-10K and Cifar-10 benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our TTNG and MFR outperform than other state-of-the-art methods. For example, we achieve competitive results N-S score 3.91 and precision 65.00% on UK-bench and Corel-10K datasets respectively.

- **Summary**: Incompatibility of image descriptor and ranking is always neglected in image retrieval. In this paper, manifold learning and Gestalt psychology theory are involved to solve the incompatibility problem. A new holistic descriptor called Perceptual Uniform Descriptor (PUD) based on Gestalt psychology is proposed, which combines color and gradient direction to imitate the human visual uniformity. PUD features in the same class images distributes on one manifold in most cases because PUD improves the visual uniformity of the traditional descriptors. Thus, we use manifold ranking and PUD to realize image retrieval. Experiments were carried out on five benchmark data sets, and the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of image retrieval. Our experimental results in the Ukbench and Corel-1K datasets demonstrated that N-S score reached to 3.58 (HSV 3.4) and mAP to 81.77% (ODBTC 77.9%) respectively by utilizing PUD which has only 280 dimension. The results are higher than other holistic image descriptors (even some local ones) and state-of-the-arts retrieval methods.

- **Summary**: The usage of linear transformations has great relevance for data decorrelation applications, like image and video compression. In that sense, the discrete Tchebichef transform (DTT) possesses useful coding and decorrelation properties. The DTT transform kernel does not depend on the input data and fast algorithms can be developed to real time applications. However, the DTT fast algorithm presented in literature possess high computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a new low-complexity approximation for the DTT. The fast algorithm of the proposed transform is multiplication-free and requires a reduced number of additions and bit-shifting operations. Image and video compression simulations in popular standards shows good performance of the proposed transform. Regarding hardware resource consumption for FPGA shows 43.1% reduction of configurable logic blocks and ASIC place and route realization shows 57.7% reduction in the area-time figure when compared with the 2-D version of the exact DTT.

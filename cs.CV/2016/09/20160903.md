- **Summary**: Dictionary plays an important role in multi-instance data representation. It maps bags of instances to histograms. Earth mover's distance (EMD) is the most effective histogram distance metric for the application of multi-instance retrieval. However, up to now, there is no existing multi-instance dictionary learning methods designed for EMD based histogram comparison. To fill this gap, we develop the first EMD-optimal dictionary learning method using stochastic optimization method. In the stochastic learning framework, we have one triplet of bags, including one basic bag, one positive bag, and one negative bag. These bags are mapped to histograms using a multi-instance dictionary. We argue that the EMD between the basic histogram and the positive histogram should be smaller than that between the basic histogram and the negative histogram. Base on this condition, we design a hinge loss. By minimizing this hinge loss and some regularization terms of the dictionary, we update the dictionary instances. The experiments over multi-instance retrieval applications shows its effectiveness when compared to other dictionary learning methods over the problems of medical image retrieval and natural language relation classification.

- **Summary**: Are we ready to segment consumer stereo videos? The amount of this data type is rapidly increasing and encompasses rich information of appearance, motion and depth cues. However, the segmentation of such data is still largely unexplored. First, we propose therefore a new benchmark: videos, annotations and metrics to measure progress on this emerging challenge. Second, we evaluate several state of the art segmentation methods and propose a novel ensemble method based on recent spectral theory. This combines existing image and video segmentation techniques in an efficient scheme. Finally, we propose and integrate into this model a novel regressor, learnt to optimize the stereo segmentation performance directly via a differentiable proxy. The regressor makes our segmentation ensemble adaptive to each stereo video and outperforms the segmentations of the ensemble as well as a most recent RGB-D segmentation technique.

- **Summary**: The detection of abnormal behaviours in crowded scenes has to deal with many challenges. This paper presents an efficient method for detection and localization of anomalies in videos. Using fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) and temporal data, a pre-trained supervised FCN is transferred into an unsupervised FCN ensuring the detection of (global) anomalies in scenes. High performance in terms of speed and accuracy is achieved by investigating the cascaded detection as a result of reducing computation complexities. This FCN-based architecture addresses two main tasks, feature representation and cascaded outlier detection. Experimental results on two benchmarks suggest that detection and localization of the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy.

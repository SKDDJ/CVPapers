- **Summary**: A picture is worth a thousand words. Not until recently, however, we noticed some success stories in understanding of visual scenes: a model that is able to detect/name objects, describe their attributes, and recognize their relationships/interactions. In this paper, we propose a phrase-based hierarchical Long Short-Term Memory (phi-LSTM) model to generate image description. The proposed model encodes sentence as a sequence of combination of phrases and words, instead of a sequence of words alone as in those conventional solutions. The two levels of this model are dedicated to i) learn to generate image relevant noun phrases, and ii) produce appropriate image description from the phrases and other words in the corpus. Adopting a convolutional neural network to learn image features and the LSTM to learn the word sequence in a sentence, the proposed model has shown better or competitive results in comparison to the state-of-the-art models on Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets.

- **Summary**: Recently, convolutional networks (convnets) have proven useful for predicting optical flow. Much of this success is predicated on the availability of large datasets that require expensive and involved data acquisition and laborious la- beling. To bypass these challenges, we propose an unsuper- vised approach (i.e., without leveraging groundtruth flow) to train a convnet end-to-end for predicting optical flow be- tween two images. We use a loss function that combines a data term that measures photometric constancy over time with a spatial term that models the expected variation of flow across the image. Together these losses form a proxy measure for losses based on the groundtruth flow. Empiri- cally, we show that a strong convnet baseline trained with the proposed unsupervised approach outperforms the same network trained with supervision on the KITTI dataset.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a non-convex formulation to recover the authentic structure from the corrupted real data. Typically, the specific structure is assumed to be low rank, which holds for a wide range of data, such as images and videos. Meanwhile, the corruption is assumed to be sparse. In the literature, such a problem is known as Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), which usually recovers the low rank structure by approximating the rank function with a nuclear norm and penalizing the error by an $\ell_1$-norm. Although RPCA is a convex formulation and can be solved effectively, the introduced norms are not tight approximations, which may cause the solution to deviate from the authentic one. Therefore, we consider here a non-convex relaxation, consisting of a Schatten-$p$ norm and an $\ell_q$-norm that promote low rank and sparsity respectively. We derive a proximal iteratively reweighted algorithm (PIRA) to solve the problem. Our algorithm is based on an alternating direction method of multipliers, where in each iteration we linearize the underlying objective function that allows us to have a closed form solution. We demonstrate that solutions produced by the linearized approximation always converge and have a tighter approximation than the convex counterpart. Experimental results on benchmarks show encouraging results of our approach.

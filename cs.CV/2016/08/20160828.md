- **Summary**: We present an empirical model for noises in color measurements from OLED displays. According to measured data the noise is not isotropic in the XYZ space, instead most of the noise is along an axis that is parallel to a vector from origin to measured XYZ vector. The presented empirical model is simple and depends only on the measured XYZ values. Our tests show that the variations between multiple panels of the same type have similar distribution as the temporal noise in measurements from a single panel, but a larger magnitude.

- **Summary**: We present a novel algorithm for blind denoising of images corrupted by mixed impulse, Poisson, and Gaussian noises. The algorithm starts by applying the Anscombe variance-stabilizing transformation to convert the Poisson into white Gaussian noise. Then it applies a combinatorial optimization technique to denoise the mixed impulse Gaussian noise using proximal algorithms. The result is then processed by the inverse Anscombe transform. We compare our algorithm to state of the art methods on standard images, and show its superior performance in various noise conditions.

- **Summary**: Tracking of motion objects in the surveillance videos is useful for the monitoring and analysis. The performance of the surveillance system will deteriorate when shadows are detected as moving objects. Therefore, shadow detection and elimination usually benefits the next stages. To overcome this issue, a method for detection and elimination of shadows is proposed. This paper presents a method for segmenting moving objects in video sequences based on determining the Euclidian distance between two pixels considering neighborhood values in temporal domain. Further, a method that segments cast and self shadows in video sequences by computing the Eigen values for the neighborhood of each pixel is proposed. The dual-map for cast and self shadow pixels is represented based on the interval of Eigen values. The proposed methods are tested on the benchmark IEEE CHANGE DETECTION 2014 dataset.

- **Summary**: Total variation has proved its effectiveness in solving inverse problems for compressive sensing. Besides, the nonlocal means filter used as regularization preserves texture better for recovered images, but it is quite complex to implement. In this paper, based on existence of both noise and image information in the Lagrangian multiplier, we propose a simple method in term of implementation called nonlocal Lagrangian multiplier (NLLM) in order to reduce noise and boost useful image information. Experimental results show that the proposed NLLM is superior both in subjective and objective qualities of recovered image over other recovery algorithms.

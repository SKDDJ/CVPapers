- **Summary**: Previous studies have proposed image-based clutter measures that correlate with human search times and/or eye movements. However, most models do not take into account the fact that the effects of clutter interact with the foveated nature of the human visual system: visual clutter further from the fovea has an increasing detrimental influence on perception. Here, we introduce a new foveated clutter model to predict the detrimental effects in target search utilizing a forced fixation search task. We use Feature Congestion (Rosenholtz et al.) as our non foveated clutter model, and we stack a peripheral architecture on top of Feature Congestion for our foveated model. We introduce the Peripheral Integration Feature Congestion (PIFC) coefficient, as a fundamental ingredient of our model that modulates clutter as a non-linear gain contingent on eccentricity. We finally show that Foveated Feature Congestion (FFC) clutter scores r(44) = -0.82 correlate better with target detection (hit rate) than regular Feature Congestion r(44) = -0.19 in forced fixation search. Thus, our model allows us to enrich clutter perception research by computing fixation specific clutter maps. A toolbox for creating peripheral architectures: Piranhas: Peripheral Architectures for Natural, Hybrid and Artificial Systems will be made available.

- **Summary**: We propose a robust method for estimating dynamic 3D curvilinear branching structure from monocular images. While 3D reconstruction from images has been widely studied, estimating thin structure has received less attention. This problem becomes more challenging in the presence of camera error, scene motion, and a constraint that curves are attached in a branching structure. We propose a new general-purpose prior, a branching Gaussian processes (BGP), that models spatial smoothness and temporal dynamics of curves while enforcing attachment between them. We apply this prior to fit 3D trees directly to image data, using an efficient scheme for approximate inference based on expectation propagation. The BGP prior's Gaussian form allows us to approximately marginalize over 3D trees with a given model structure, enabling principled comparison between tree models with varying complexity. We test our approach on a novel multi-view dataset depicting plants with known 3D structures and topologies undergoing small nonrigid motion. Our method outperforms a state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction method designed for non-moving thin structure. We evaluate under several common measures, and we propose a new measure for reconstructions of branching multi-part 3D scenes under motion.

- **Summary**: Region-based methods have proven necessary for improving segmentation accuracy of neuronal structures in electron microscopy (EM) images. Most region-based segmentation methods use a scoring function to determine region merging. Such functions are usually learned with supervised algorithms that demand considerable ground truth data, which are costly to collect. We propose a semi-supervised approach that reduces this demand. Based on a merge tree structure, we develop a differentiable unsupervised loss term that enforces consistent predictions from the learned function. We then propose a Bayesian model that combines the supervised and the unsupervised information for probabilistic learning. The experimental results on three EM data sets demonstrate that by using a subset of only 3% to 7% of the entire ground truth data, our approach consistently performs close to the state-of-the-art supervised method with the full labeled data set, and significantly outperforms the supervised method with the same labeled subset.

- **Summary**: Global scout views have been previously used to reduce interior reconstruction artifacts in high-resolution micro-CT and C-arm systems. However these methods cannot be directly used in the all-important domain of clinical CT. This is because when the CT scan is truncated, the scout views are also truncated. However many cases of truncation in clinical CT involve partial truncation, where the anterio-posterior (AP) scout is truncated, but the medio-lateral (ML) scout is non-truncated. In this paper, we show that in such cases of partially truncated CT scans, a modified configuration may be used to acquire non-truncated AP scout view, and ultimately allow for highly accurate interior reconstruction.

- **Summary**: With the agreement of my coauthors, I Zhangyang Wang would like to withdraw the manuscript "Stacked Approximated Regression Machine: A Simple Deep Learning Approach". Some experimental procedures were not included in the manuscript, which makes a part of important claims not meaningful. In the relevant research, I was solely responsible for carrying out the experiments; the other coauthors joined in the discussions leading to the main algorithm.   Please see the updated text for more details.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) brought revolution without any doubt to various challenging tasks, mainly in computer vision. However, their model designing still requires attention to reduce number of learnable parameters, with no meaningful reduction in performance. In this paper we investigate to what extend CNN may take advantage of pyramid structure typical of biological neurons. A generalized statement over convolutional layers from input till fully connected layer is introduced that helps further in understanding and designing a successful deep network. It reduces ambiguity, number of parameters, and their size on disk without degrading overall accuracy. Performance are shown on state-of-the-art models for MNIST, Cifar-10, Cifar-100, and ImageNet-12 datasets. Despite more than 80% reduction in parameters for Caffe_LENET, challenging results are obtained. Further, despite 10-20% reduction in training data along with 10-40% reduction in parameters for AlexNet model and its variations, competitive results are achieved when compared to similar well-engineered deeper architectures.

- **Summary**: Gesture recognition is a very essential technology for many wearable devices. While previous algorithms are mostly based on statistical methods including the hidden Markov model, we develop two dynamic hand gesture recognition techniques using low complexity recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms. One is based on video signal and employs a combined structure of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an RNN. The other uses accelerometer data and only requires an RNN. Fixed-point optimization that quantizes most of the weights into two bits is conducted to optimize the amount of memory size for weight storage and reduce the power consumption in hardware and software based implementations.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the influence of both long and short skip connections on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) for biomedical image segmentation. In standard FCNs, only long skip connections are used to skip features from the contracting path to the expanding path in order to recover spatial information lost during downsampling. We extend FCNs by adding short skip connections, that are similar to the ones introduced in residual networks, in order to build very deep FCNs (of hundreds of layers). A review of the gradient flow confirms that for a very deep FCN it is beneficial to have both long and short skip connections. Finally, we show that a very deep FCN can achieve near-to-state-of-the-art results on the EM dataset without any further post-processing.

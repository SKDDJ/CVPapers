- **Summary**: Limited angle problem is a challenging issue in x-ray computed tomography (CT) field. Iterative reconstruction methods that utilize the additional prior can suppress artifacts and improve image quality, but unfortunately require increased computation time. An interesting way is to restrain the artifacts in the images reconstructed from the practical filtered back projection (FBP) method. Frikel and Quinto have proved that the streak artifacts in FBP results could be characterized. It indicates that the artifacts created by FBP method have specific and similar characteristics in a stationary limited-angle scanning configuration. Based on this understanding, this work aims at developing a method to extract and suppress specific artifacts of FBP reconstructions for limited-angle tomography. A data-driven learning-based method is proposed based on a deep convolutional neural network. An end-to-end mapping between the FBP and artifact-free images is learned and the implicit features involving artifacts will be extracted and suppressed via nonlinear mapping. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations of experimental results indicate that the proposed method show a stable and prospective performance on artifacts reduction and detail recovery for limited angle tomography. The presented strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for improving image quality of the reconstruction results from limited projection data.

- **Summary**: Current state of the art object recognition architectures achieve impressive performance but are typically specialized for a single depictive style (e.g. photos only, sketches only). In this paper, we present SwiDeN : our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which recognizes objects regardless of how they are visually depicted (line drawing, realistic shaded drawing, photograph etc.). In SwiDeN, we utilize a novel `deep' depictive style-based switching mechanism which appropriately addresses the depiction-specific and depiction-invariant aspects of the problem. We compare SwiDeN with alternative architectures and prior work on a 50-category Photo-Art dataset containing objects depicted in multiple styles. Experimental results show that SwiDeN outperforms other approaches for the depiction-invariant object recognition problem.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, we can find several diseases related to the unhealthy diet habits of the population, such as diabetes, obesity, anemia, bulimia and anorexia. In many cases, these diseases are related to the food consumption of people. Mediterranean diet is scientifically known as a healthy diet that helps to prevent many metabolic diseases. In particular, our work focuses on the recognition of Mediterranean food and dishes. The development of this methodology would allow to analise the daily habits of users with wearable cameras, within the topic of lifelogging. By using automatic mechanisms we could build an objective tool for the analysis of the patient's behaviour, allowing specialists to discover unhealthy food patterns and understand the user's lifestyle.   With the aim to automatically recognize a complete diet, we introduce a challenging multi-labeled dataset related to Mediterranean diet called FoodCAT. The first type of label provided consists of 115 food classes with an average of 400 images per dish, and the second one consists of 12 food categories with an average of 3800 pictures per class. This dataset will serve as a basis for the development of automatic diet recognition. In this context, deep learning and more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), currently are state-of-the-art methods for automatic food recognition. In our work, we compare several architectures for image classification, with the purpose of diet recognition. Applying the best model for recognising food categories, we achieve a top-1 accuracy of 72.29\%, and top-5 of 97.07\%. In a complete diet recognition of dishes from Mediterranean diet, enlarged with the Food-101 dataset for international dishes recognition, we achieve a top-1 accuracy of 68.07\%, and top-5 of 89.53\%, for a total of 115+101 food classes.

- **Summary**: There is considerable interest in the task of automatically generating image captions. However, evaluation is challenging. Existing automatic evaluation metrics are primarily sensitive to n-gram overlap, which is neither necessary nor sufficient for the task of simulating human judgment. We hypothesize that semantic propositional content is an important component of human caption evaluation, and propose a new automated caption evaluation metric defined over scene graphs coined SPICE. Extensive evaluations across a range of models and datasets indicate that SPICE captures human judgments over model-generated captions better than other automatic metrics (e.g., system-level correlation of 0.88 with human judgments on the MS COCO dataset, versus 0.43 for CIDEr and 0.53 for METEOR). Furthermore, SPICE can answer questions such as `which caption-generator best understands colors?' and `can caption-generators count?'

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm for the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices that considers the geometry of SPD matrices and provides a low dimensional representation of the manifold with high class discrimination. The proposed algorithm, tries to preserve the local structure of the data by preserving distance to local mean (DPLM) and also provides an implicit projection matrix. DPLM is linear in terms of the number of training samples and may use the label information when they are available in order to performance improvement in classification tasks. We performed several experiments on the multi-class dataset IIa from BCI competition IV. The results show that our approach as dimensionality reduction technique - leads to superior results in comparison with other competitor in the related literature because of its robustness against outliers. The experiments confirm that the combination of DPLM with FGMDM as the classifier leads to the state of the art performance on this dataset.

- **Summary**: Discrete energy minimization is widely-used in computer vision and machine learning for problems such as MAP inference in graphical models. The problem, in general, is notoriously intractable, and finding the global optimal solution is known to be NP-hard. However, is it possible to approximate this problem with a reasonable ratio bound on the solution quality in polynomial time? We show in this paper that the answer is no. Specifically, we show that general energy minimization, even in the 2-label pairwise case, and planar energy minimization with three or more labels are exp-APX-complete. This finding rules out the existence of any approximation algorithm with a sub-exponential approximation ratio in the input size for these two problems, including constant factor approximations. Moreover, we collect and review the computational complexity of several subclass problems and arrange them on a complexity scale consisting of three major complexity classes -- PO, APX, and exp-APX, corresponding to problems that are solvable, approximable, and inapproximable in polynomial time. Problems in the first two complexity classes can serve as alternative tractable formulations to the inapproximable ones. This paper can help vision researchers to select an appropriate model for an application or guide them in designing new algorithms.

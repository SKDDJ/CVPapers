- **Summary**: Prison facilities, mental correctional institutions, sports bars and places of public protest are prone to sudden violence and conflicts. Surveillance systems play an important role in mitigation of hostile behavior and improvement of security by detecting such provocative and aggressive activities. This research proposed using automatic aggressive behavior and anger detection to improve the effectiveness of the surveillance systems. An emotion and aggression aware component will make the surveillance system highly responsive and capable of alerting the security guards in real time. This research proposed facial expression, head, hand and body movement and speech tracking for detecting anger and aggressive actions. Recognition was achieved using support vector machines and rule based features. The multimodal affect recognition precision rate for anger improved by 15.2% and recall rate improved by 11.7% when behavioral rule based features were used in aggressive action detection.

- **Summary**: Emotional and physical well-being at workplace is important for a positive work environment and higher productivity. Jobs such as software programming lead to a sedentary lifestyle and require high interaction with computers. Working at the same job for years can cause a feeling of intellectual stagnation and lack of drive. Many employees experience lack of motivation, mild to extreme depression due to reasons such as aversion towards job responsibilities and incompatibility with coworkers or boss. This research proposed an affect monitoring system EmoFit that would play the role of psychological and physical health trainer. The day to day computer activity and body language was analyzed to detect the physical and emotional well-being of the user. Keystrokes, activity interruptions, eye tracking, facial expressions, body posture and speech were monitored to gauge the users health. The system also provided activities such as at-desk exercise and stress relief game and motivational quotes in an attempt to promote users well-being. The experimental results and positive feedback from test subjects showed that EmoFit would help improve emotional and physical well-being at jobs that involve significant computer usage.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation, the task of partitioning an image into meaningful parts, is an important step toward automating medical image analysis and is at the crux of a variety of medical imaging applications, such as computer aided diagnosis, therapy planning and delivery, and computer aided interventions. However, the existence of noise, low contrast and objects' complexity in medical images are critical obstacles that stand in the way of achieving an ideal segmentation system. Incorporating prior knowledge into image segmentation algorithms has proven useful for obtaining more accurate and plausible results. This paper surveys the different types of prior knowledge that have been utilized in different segmentation frameworks. We focus our survey on optimization-based methods that incorporate prior information into their frameworks. We review and compare these methods in terms of the types of prior employed, the domain of formulation (continuous vs. discrete), and the optimization techniques (global vs. local). We also created an interactive online database of existing works and categorized them based on the type of prior knowledge they use. Our website is interactive so that researchers can contribute to keep the database up to date. We conclude the survey by discussing different aspects of designing an energy functional for image segmentation, open problems, and future perspectives.

- **Summary**: We present a novel form of interactive video object segmentation where a few clicks by the user helps the system produce a full spatio-temporal segmentation of the object of interest. Whereas conventional interactive pipelines take the user's initialization as a starting point, we show the value in the system taking the lead even in initialization. In particular, for a given video frame, the system precomputes a ranked list of thousands of possible segmentation hypotheses (also referred to as object region proposals) using image and motion cues. Then, the user looks at the top ranked proposals, and clicks on the object boundary to carve away erroneous ones. This process iterates (typically 2-3 times), and each time the system revises the top ranked proposal set, until the user is satisfied with a resulting segmentation mask. Finally, the mask is propagated across the video to produce a spatio-temporal object tube. On three challenging datasets, we provide extensive comparisons with both existing work and simpler alternative methods. In all, the proposed Click Carving approach strikes an excellent balance of accuracy and human effort. It outperforms all similarly fast methods, and is competitive or better than those requiring 2 to 12 times the effort.



### Learning the semantic structure of objects from Web supervision

- **Summary**: While recent research in image understanding has often focused on recognizing more types of objects, understanding more about the objects is just as important. Recognizing object parts and attributes has been extensively studied before, yet learning large space of such concepts remains elusive due to the high cost of providing detailed object annotations for supervision. The key contribution of this paper is an algorithm to learn the nameable parts of objects automatically, from images obtained by querying Web search engines. The key challenge is the high level of noise in the annotations; to address it, we propose a new unified embedding space where the appearance and geometry of objects and their semantic parts are represented uniformly. Geometric relationships are induced in a soft manner by a rich set of nonsemantic mid-level anchors, bridging the gap between semantic and non-semantic parts. We also show that the resulting embedding provides a visually-intuitive mechanism to navigate the learned concepts and their corresponding images.

- **Summary**: In this paper a number of problems are considered which are related to the modelling of eye guidance under visual attention in a natural setting. From a crude discussion of a variety of available models spelled in probabilistic terms, it appears that current approaches in computational vision are hitherto far from achieving the goal of an active observer relying upon eye guidance to accomplish real-world tasks. We argue that this challenging goal not only requires to embody, in a principled way, the problem of eye guidance within the action/perception loop, but to face the inextricable link tying up visual attention, emotion and executive control, in so far as recent neurobiological findings are weighed up.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Feature Selection Library (FSLib) is a widely applicable MATLAB library for Feature Selection (FS). FS is an essential component of machine learning and data mining which has been studied for many years under many different conditions and in diverse scenarios. These algorithms aim at ranking and selecting a subset of relevant features according to their degrees of relevance, preference, or importance as defined in a specific application. Because feature selection can reduce the amount of features used for training classification models, it alleviates the effect of the curse of dimensionality, speeds up the learning process, improves model's performance, and enhances data understanding. This short report provides an overview of the feature selection algorithms included in the FSLib MATLAB toolbox among filter, embedded, and wrappers methods.

- **Summary**: Previous part-based attribute recognition approaches perform part detection and attribute recognition in separate steps. The parts are not optimized for attribute recognition and therefore could be sub-optimal. We present an end-to-end deep learning approach to overcome the limitation. It generates object parts from key points and perform attribute recognition accordingly, allowing adaptive spatial transform of the parts. Both key point estimation and attribute recognition are learnt jointly in a multi-task setting. Extensive experiments on two datasets verify the efficacy of proposed end-to-end approach.

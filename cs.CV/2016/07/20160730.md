- **Summary**: Face recognition has been an active research area in the past few decades. In general, face recognition can be very challenging due to variations in viewpoint, illumination, facial expression, etc. Therefore it is essential to extract features which are invariant to some or all of these variations. Here a new image representation, called scattering transform/network, has been used to extract features from faces. The scattering transform is a kind of convolutional network which provides a powerful multi-layer representation for signals. After extraction of scattering features, PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data and then a multi-class support vector machine is used to perform recognition. The proposed algorithm has been tested on three face datasets and achieved a very high recognition rate.

- **Summary**: Detection of non-calcified plaques in the coronary tree is a challenging problem due to the nature of comprising substances. Hard plaques are easily discernible in CTA data cloud due to apparent bright behaviour, therefore many approaches have been proposed for automatic segmentation of calcified plaques. In contrast soft plaques show very small difference in intensity with respect to surrounding heart tissues & blood voxels. This similarity in intensity makes the isolation and detection of soft plaques very difficult. This work aims to develop framework for segmentation of vulnerable plaques with minimal user dependency. In first step automatic seed point has been established based on the fact that coronary artery behaves as tubular structure through axial slices. In the following step the behaviour of contrast agent has been modelled mathematically to reflect the dye diffusion in respective CTA volume. Consequently based on detected seed point & intensity behaviour, localized active contour segmentation has been applied to extract complete coronary tree. Bidirectional segmentation has been applied to avoid loss of coronary information due to the seed point location whereas auto adjustment feature of contour grabs new emerging branches. Medial axis for extracted coronary tree is generated using fast marching method for obtaining curve planar reformation for validation of contrast agent behaviour. Obtained coronary tree is to be evaluated for soft plaques in second phase of this research.

- **Summary**: Multi-task learning (MTL) is useful for domains in which data originates from multiple sources that are individually under-sampled. MTL methods are able to learn classification models that have higher performance as compared to learning a single model by aggregating all the data together or learning a separate model for each data source. The performance of these methods relies on label accuracy. We address the problem of simultaneously learning multiple classifiers in the MTL framework when the training data has imprecise labels. We assume that there is an additional source of information that provides a score for each instance which reflects the certainty about its label. Modeling this score as being generated by an underlying ranking function, we augment the MTL framework with an added layer of supervision. This results in new MTL methods that are able to learn accurate classifiers while preserving the domain structure provided through the rank information. We apply these methods to the task of detecting abnormal cortical regions in the MRIs of patients suffering from focal epilepsy whose MRI were read as normal by expert neuroradiologists. In addition to the noisy labels provided by the results of surgical resection, we employ the results of an invasive intracranial-EEG exam as an additional source of label information. Our proposed methods are able to successfully detect abnormal regions for all patients in our dataset and achieve a higher performance as compared to baseline methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper we aim to determine the location and orientation of a ground-level query image by matching to a reference database of overhead (e.g. satellite) images. For this task we collect a new dataset with one million pairs of street view and overhead images sampled from eleven U.S. cities. We explore several deep CNN architectures for cross-domain matching -- Classification, Hybrid, Siamese, and Triplet networks. Classification and Hybrid architectures are accurate but slow since they allow only partial feature precomputation. We propose a new loss function which significantly improves the accuracy of Siamese and Triplet embedding networks while maintaining their applicability to large-scale retrieval tasks like image geolocalization. This image matching task is challenging not just because of the dramatic viewpoint difference between ground-level and overhead imagery but because the orientation (i.e. azimuth) of the street views is unknown making correspondence even more difficult. We examine several mechanisms to match in spite of this -- training for rotation invariance, sampling possible rotations at query time, and explicitly predicting relative rotation of ground and overhead images with our deep networks. It turns out that explicit orientation supervision also improves location prediction accuracy. Our best performing architectures are roughly 2.5 times as accurate as the commonly used Siamese network baseline.

- **Summary**: Recently, sparse representation based visual tracking methods have attracted increasing attention in the computer vision community. Although achieve superior performance to traditional tracking methods, however, a basic problem has not been answered yet --- that whether the sparsity constrain is really needed for visual tracking? To answer this question, in this paper, we first propose a robust non-sparse representation based tracker and then conduct extensive experiments to compare it against several state-of-the-art sparse representation based trackers. Our experiment results and analysis indicate that the proposed non-sparse tracker achieved competitive tracking accuracy with sparse trackers while having faster running speed, which support our non-sparse tracker to be used in practical applications.

- **Summary**: Automatic extraction of road curbs from uneven, unorganized, noisy and massive 3D point clouds is a challenging task. Existing methods often project 3D point clouds onto 2D planes to extract curbs. However, the projection causes loss of 3D information which degrades the performance of the detection. This paper presents a robust, accurate and efficient method to extract road curbs from 3D mobile LiDAR point clouds. Our method consists of two steps: 1) extracting the candidate points of curbs based on the proposed novel energy function and 2) refining the candidate points using the proposed least cost path model. We evaluated our method on a large-scale of residential area (16.7GB, 300 million points) and an urban area (1.07GB, 20 million points) mobile LiDAR point clouds. Results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness, accuracy and efficiency. The proposed curb extraction method achieved a completeness of 78.62% and a correctness of 83.29%. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising solution to extract road curbs from mobile LiDAR point clouds.

- **Summary**: In this paper we outline a PhD research plan. This research contributes to the field of one-class incremental learning and classification in case of non-stationary environments. The goal of this PhD is to define a new classification framework able to deal with very small learning dataset at the beginning of the process and with abilities to adjust itself according to the variability of the incoming data which create large scale datasets. As a preliminary work, incremental Covariance-guided One-Class Support Vector Machine is proposed to deal with sequentially obtained data. It is inspired from COSVM which put more emphasis on the low variance directions while keeping the basic formulation of incremental One-Class Support Vector Machine untouched. The incremental procedure is introduced by controlling the possible changes of support vectors after the addition of new data points, thanks to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, that have to be maintained on all previously acquired data. Comparative experimental results with contemporary incremental and non-incremental one-class classifiers on numerous artificial and real data sets show that our method results in significantly better classification performance.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a practical approach to addressing limitations posed by use of single active electrodes in applications for sleep stage classification. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based characterizations of sleep stage progression contribute the diagnosis and monitoring of the many pathologies of sleep. Several prior reports have explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep EEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable discrimination of sleep stages in order to make it possible to perform sleep studies at lower cost in the home (rather than only in specialized clinical facilities). However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes placed on the cranial vertex or occiput, which can be uncomfortable or difficult for subjects to position. Those that have utilized single EEG channels which contain less sleep information, have showed poor classification performance. We have taken advantage of Rectifier Neural Network for feature detection and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential data learning to optimize classification performance with single electrode recordings. After exploring alternative electrode placements, we found a comfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have shown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous recording of the electroocuolgram (EOG). Evaluation of data from 62 people (with 494 hours sleep) demonstrated better performance of our analytical algorithm for automated sleep classification than existing approaches using vertex or occipital electrode placements. Use of this recording configuration with neural network deconvolution promises to make clinically indicated home sleep studies practical.

- **Summary**: Collecting training images for all visual categories is not only expensive but also impractical. Zero-shot learning (ZSL), especially using attributes, offers a pragmatic solution to this problem. However, at test time most attribute-based methods require a full description of attribute associations for each unseen class. Providing these associations is time consuming and often requires domain specific knowledge. In this work, we aim to carry out attribute-based zero-shot classification in an unsupervised manner. We propose an approach to learn relations that couples class embeddings with their corresponding attributes. Given only the name of an unseen class, the learned relationship model is used to automatically predict the class-attribute associations. Furthermore, our model facilitates transferring attributes across data sets without additional effort. Integrating knowledge from multiple sources results in a significant additional improvement in performance. We evaluate on two public data sets: Animals with Attributes and aPascal/aYahoo. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predicting class-attribute associations and unsupervised ZSL by a large margin.

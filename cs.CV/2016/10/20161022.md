- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose and compare two spectral angle based approaches for spatial-spectral classification. Our methods use the spectral angle to generate unary energies in a grid-structured Markov random field defined over the pixel labels of a hyperspectral image. The first approach is to use the exponential spectral angle mapper (ESAM) kernel/covariance function, a spectral angle based function, with the support vector machine and the Gaussian process classifier. The second approach is to directly use the minimum spectral angle between the test pixel and the training pixels as the unary energy. We compare the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art Markov random field methods that use support vector machines and Gaussian processes with squared exponential kernel/covariance function. In our experiments with two datasets, it is seen that using minimum spectral angle as unary energy produces better or comparable results to the existing methods at a smaller running time.

- **Summary**: Statistical models have been successful in accurately estimating the biochemical contents of vegetation from the reflectance spectra. However, their performance deteriorates when there is a scarcity of sizable amount of ground truth data for modeling the complex non-linear relationship occurring between the spectrum and the biochemical quantity. We propose a novel Gaussian process based multitask learning method for improving the prediction of a biochemical through the transfer of knowledge from the learned models for predicting related biochemicals. This method is most advantageous when there are few ground truth data for the biochemical of interest, but plenty of ground truth data for related biochemicals. The proposed multitask Gaussian process hypothesizes that the inter-relationship between the biochemical quantities is better modeled by using a combination of two or more covariance functions and inter-task correlation matrices. In the experiments, our method outperformed the current methods on two real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Kernel normalization methods have been employed to improve robustness of optimization methods to reparametrization of convolution kernels, covariate shift, and to accelerate training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, our understanding of theoretical properties of these methods has lagged behind their success in applications. We develop a geometric framework to elucidate underlying mechanisms of a diverse range of kernel normalization methods. Our framework enables us to expound and identify geometry of space of normalized kernels. We analyze and delineate how state-of-the-art kernel normalization methods affect the geometry of search spaces of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms in CNNs. Following our theoretical results, we propose a SGD algorithm with assurance of almost sure convergence of the methods to a solution at single minimum of classification loss of CNNs. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for major image classification benchmarks with CNNs.

- **Summary**: The ability to accurately identify human activities is essential for developing automatic rehabilitation and sports training systems. In this paper, large-scale exercise motion data obtained from a forearm-worn wearable sensor are classified with a convolutional neural network (CNN). Time-series data consisting of accelerometer and orientation measurements are formatted as images, allowing the CNN to automatically extract discriminative features. A comparative study on the effects of image formatting and different CNN architectures is also presented. The best performing configuration classifies 50 gym exercises with 92.1% accuracy.

- **Summary**: Deep learning is quickly becoming the leading methodology for medical image analysis. Given a large medical archive, where each image is associated with a diagnosis, efficient pathology detectors or classifiers can be trained with virtually no expert knowledge about the target pathologies. However, deep learning algorithms, including the popular ConvNets, are black boxes: little is known about the local patterns analyzed by ConvNets to make a decision at the image level. A solution is proposed in this paper to create heatmaps showing which pixels in images play a role in the image-level predictions. In other words, a ConvNet trained for image-level classification can be used to detect lesions as well. A generalization of the backpropagation method is proposed in order to train ConvNets that produce high-quality heatmaps. The proposed solution is applied to diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in a dataset of almost 90,000 fundus photographs from the 2015 Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy competition and a private dataset of almost 110,000 photographs (e-ophtha). For the task of detecting referable DR, very good detection performance was achieved: $A_z = 0.954$ in Kaggle's dataset and $A_z = 0.949$ in e-ophtha. Performance was also evaluated at the image level and at the lesion level in the DiaretDB1 dataset, where four types of lesions are manually segmented: microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates and cotton-wool spots. The proposed detector outperforms recent algorithms trained to detect those lesions specifically, as well as competing heatmap generation algorithms for ConvNets. This detector is part of the Messidor system for mobile eye pathology screening. Because it does not rely on expert knowledge or manual segmentation for detecting relevant patterns, the proposed solution is a promising image mining tool, which has the potential to discover new biomarkers in images.

- **Summary**: Geometric model fitting is a fundamental task in computer graphics and computer vision. However, most geometric model fitting methods are unable to fit an arbitrary geometric model (e.g. a surface with holes) to incomplete data, due to that the similarity metrics used in these methods are unable to measure the rigid partial similarity between arbitrary models. This paper hence proposes a novel rigid geometric similarity metric, which is able to measure both the full similarity and the partial similarity between arbitrary geometric models. The proposed metric enables us to perform partial procedural geometric model fitting (PPGMF). The task of PPGMF is to search a procedural geometric model space for the model rigidly similar to a query of non-complete point set. Models in the procedural model space are generated according to a set of parametric modeling rules. A typical query is a point cloud. PPGMF is very useful as it can be used to fit arbitrary geometric models to non-complete (incomplete, over-complete or hybrid-complete) point cloud data. For example, most laser scanning data is non-complete due to occlusion. Our PPGMF method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to optimize the proposed similarity metric over the model space. To accelerate the optimization process, the method also employs a novel coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to reject dissimilar models in advance. Our method has been demonstrated on a variety of geometric models and non-complete data. Experimental results show that the PPGMF method based on the proposed metric is able to fit non-complete data, while the method based on other metrics is unable. It is also shown that our method can be accelerated by several times via early rejection.

- **Summary**: Automatic attribute discovery methods have gained in popularity to extract sets of visual attributes from images or videos for various tasks. Despite their good performance in some classification tasks, it is difficult to evaluate whether the attributes discovered by these methods are meaningful and which methods are the most appropriate to discover attributes for visual descriptions. In its simplest form, such an evaluation can be performed by manually verifying whether there is any consistent identifiable visual concept distinguishing between positive and negative exemplars labelled by an attribute. This manual checking is tedious, expensive and labour intensive. In addition, comparisons between different methods could also be problematic as it is not clear how one could quantitatively decide which attribute is more meaningful than the others. In this paper, we propose a novel attribute meaningfulness metric to address this challenging problem. With this metric, automatic quantitative evaluation can be performed on the attribute sets; thus, reducing the enormous effort to perform manual evaluation. The proposed metric is applied to some recent automatic attribute discovery and hashing methods on four attribute-labelled datasets. To further validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we conducted a user study. In addition, we also compared our metric with a semi-supervised attribute discover method using the mixture of probabilistic PCA. In our evaluation, we gleaned several insights that could be beneficial in developing new automatic attribute discovery methods.

- **Summary**: Fuzzy logic is a powerful tool to model knowledge uncertainty, measurements imprecision, and vagueness. However, there is another type of vagueness that arises when data have multiple forms of expression that fuzzy logic does not address quite well. This is the case for multiple instance learning problems (MIL). In MIL, an object is represented by a collection of instances, called a bag. A bag is labeled negative if all of its instances are negative, and positive if at least one of its instances is positive. Positive bags encode ambiguity since the instances themselves are not labeled. In this paper, we introduce fuzzy inference systems and neural networks designed to handle bags of instances as input and capable of learning from ambiguously labeled data. First, we introduce the Multiple Instance Sugeno style fuzzy inference (MI-Sugeno) that extends the standard Sugeno style inference to handle reasoning with multiple instances. Second, we use MI-Sugeno to define and develop Multiple Instance Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (MI-ANFIS). We expand the architecture of the standard ANFIS to allow reasoning with bags and derive a learning algorithm using backpropagation to identify the premise and consequent parameters of the network. The proposed inference system is tested and validated using synthetic and benchmark datasets suitable for MIL problems. We also apply the proposed MI-ANFIS to fuse the output of multiple discrimination algorithms for the purpose of landmine detection using Ground Penetrating Radar.

- **Summary**: Automatic video captioning is challenging due to the complex interactions in dynamic real scenes. A comprehensive system would ultimately localize and track the objects, actions and interactions present in a video and generate a description that relies on temporal localization in order to ground the visual concepts. However, most existing automatic video captioning systems map from raw video data to high level textual description, bypassing localization and recognition, thus discarding potentially valuable information for content localization and generalization. In this work we present an automatic video captioning model that combines spatio-temporal attention and image classification by means of deep neural network structures based on long short-term memory. The resulting system is demonstrated to produce state-of-the-art results in the standard YouTube captioning benchmark while also offering the advantage of localizing the visual concepts (subjects, verbs, objects), with no grounding supervision, over space and time.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel framework to encode the local connectivity patterns of brain, using Fisher Vectors (FV), Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) and Bag-of-Words (BoW) methods. We first obtain local descriptors, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs) from fMRI data, by forming local meshes around anatomical regions, and estimating their relationship within a neighborhood. Then, we extract a dictionary of relationships, called \textit{brain connectivity dictionary} by fitting a generative Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to a set of MADs, and selecting the codewords at the mean of each component of the mixture. Codewords represent the connectivity patterns among anatomical regions. We also encode MADs by VLAD and BoW methods using the k-Means clustering.   We classify the cognitive states of Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI dataset, where we train support vector machines (SVM) by the encoded MADs. Results demonstrate that, FV encoding of MADs can be successfully employed for classification of cognitive tasks, and outperform the VLAD and BoW representations. Moreover, we identify the significant Gaussians in mixture models by computing energy of their corresponding FV parts, and analyze their effect on classification accuracy. Finally, we suggest a new method to visualize the codewords of brain connectivity dictionary.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (re-id) is the task of matching multiple occurrences of the same person from different cameras, poses, lighting conditions, and a multitude of other factors which alter the visual appearance. Typically, this is achieved by learning either optimal features or matching metrics which are adapted to specific pairs of camera views dictated by the pairwise labelled training datasets. In this work, we formulate a deep learning based novel approach to automatic prototype-domain discovery for domain perceptive (adaptive) person re-id (rather than camera pair specific learning) for any camera views scalable to new unseen scenes without training data. We learn a separate re-id model for each of the discovered prototype-domains and during model deployment, use the person probe image to select automatically the model of the closest prototype domain. Our approach requires neither supervised nor unsupervised domain adaptation learning, i.e. no data available from the target domains. We evaluate extensively our model under realistic re-id conditions using automatically detected bounding boxes with low-resolution and partial occlusion. We show that our approach outperforms most of the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods on the latest CUHK-SYSU and PRW benchmarks.



### Structured Sparse Subspace Clustering: A Joint Affinity Learning and Subspace Clustering Framework

- **Summary**: Subspace clustering refers to the problem of segmenting data drawn from a union of subspaces. State-of-the-art approaches for solving this problem follow a two-stage approach. In the first step, an affinity matrix is learned from the data using sparse or low-rank minimization techniques. In the second step, the segmentation is found by applying spectral clustering to this affinity. While this approach has led to state-of-the-art results in many applications, it is sub-optimal because it does not exploit the fact that the affinity and the segmentation depend on each other. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization framework --- Structured Sparse Subspace Clustering (S$^3$C) --- for learning both the affinity and the segmentation. The proposed S$^3$C framework is based on expressing each data point as a structured sparse linear combination of all other data points, where the structure is induced by a norm that depends on the unknown segmentation. Moreover, we extend the proposed S$^3$C framework into Constrained Structured Sparse Subspace Clustering (CS$^3$C) in which available partial side-information is incorporated into the stage of learning the affinity. We show that both the structured sparse representation and the segmentation can be found via a combination of an alternating direction method of multipliers with spectral clustering. Experiments on a synthetic data set, the Extended Yale B data set, the Hopkins 155 motion segmentation database, and three cancer data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Many standard robotic platforms are equipped with at least a fixed 2D laser range finder and a monocular camera. Although those platforms do not have sensors for 3D depth sensing capability, knowledge of depth is an essential part in many robotics activities. Therefore, recently, there is an increasing interest in depth estimation using monocular images. As this task is inherently ambiguous, the data-driven estimated depth might be unreliable in robotics applications. In this paper, we have attempted to improve the precision of monocular depth estimation by introducing 2D planar observation from the remaining laser range finder without extra cost. Specifically, we construct a dense reference map from the sparse laser range data, redefining the depth estimation task as estimating the distance between the real and the reference depth. To solve the problem, we construct a novel residual of residual neural network, and tightly combine the classification and regression losses for continuous depth estimation. Experimental results suggest that our method achieves considerable promotion compared to the state-of-the-art methods on both NYUD2 and KITTI, validating the effectiveness of our method on leveraging the additional sensory information. We further demonstrate the potential usage of our method in obstacle avoidance where our methodology provides comprehensive depth information compared to the solution using monocular camera or 2D laser range finder alone.

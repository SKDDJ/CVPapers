- **Summary**: Since time immemorial, noise has been a constant source of disturbance to the various entities known to mankind. Noise models of different kinds have been developed to study noise in more detailed fashion over the years. Image processing, particularly, has extensively implemented several algorithms to reduce noise in photographs and pictorial documents to alleviate the effect of noise. Images with sparse colours-lesser number of distinct colours in them-are common nowadays, especially in astronomy and astrophysics where black and white colours form the main components. Additive noise of Gaussian type is the most common form of noise to be studied and analysed in majority of communication channels, namely-satellite links, mobile base station to local cellular tower communication channel,et. al. Most of the time, we encounter images from astronomical sources being distorted with noise maximally as they travel long distance from telescopes in outer space to Earth. Considering Additive White Gaussian Noise(AWGN) to be the common noise in these long distance channels, this paper provides an insight and an algorithmic approach to pixel-specific de-noising of sparse-coloured images affected by AWGN. The paper concludes with some essential future avenues and applications of this de-noising method in industry and academia.

- **Summary**: In oncology, Positron Emission Tomography imaging is widely used in diagnostics of cancer metastases, in monitoring of progress in course of the cancer treatment, and in planning radiotherapeutic interventions. Accurate and reproducible delineation of the tumor in the Positron Emission Tomography scans remains a difficult task, despite being crucial for delivering appropriate radiation dose, minimizing adverse side-effects of the therapy, and reliable evaluation of treatment. In this piece of research we attempt to solve the problem of automated delineation of the tumor using 3d implementations of the spatial distance weighted fuzzy c-means, the deep convolutional neural network and a dictionary model. The methods, in diverse ways, combine intensity and spatial information.

- **Summary**: A statistical approach for combination of channel phases is developed for optimizing the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) in Susceptibility Weighted Images (SWI) acquired using autocalibrating partially parallel techniques. The unwrapped phase images of each coil are filtered using local random field based probabilistic weights, derived using energy functions representative of noisy sensitivity and tissue information pertaining to venous structure in the individual channel phase images. The channel energy functions are obtained as functions of local image intensities, first or second order clique phase difference and a threshold scaling parameter dependent on the input noise level. Whereas the expectation of the individual energy functions with respect to the noise distribution in clique phase differences is to be maximized for optimal filtering, the expectation of tissue energy function decreases and noise energy function increases with increase in threshold scale parameter. The optimum scaling parameter is shown to occur at the point where expectations of both energy functions contribute to the largest possible extent. It is shown that implementation of the filter in the same lines as that of Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) algorithm provides structural enhancement in the coil combined phase, with reduced noise amplification. Application to simulated and in vivo multi-channel SWI shows that CNR of combined phase obtained using MAP-MRF filter is higher as compared to that of coil combination using weighted average.

- **Summary**: This paper was originally submitted to Xinova as a response to a Request for Invention (RFI) on new event monitoring methods. In this paper, a new object tracking algorithm using multiple cameras for surveillance applications is proposed. The proposed system can detect sudden-appearance-changes and occlusions using a hidden Markovian statistical model. The experimental results confirm that our system detect the sudden-appearance changes and occlusions reliably.

- **Summary**: Aiming at automatic, convenient and non-instrusive motion capture, this paper presents a new generation markerless motion capture technique, the FlyCap system, to capture surface motions of moving characters using multiple autonomous flying cameras (autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles(UAV) each integrated with an RGBD video camera). During data capture, three cooperative flying cameras automatically track and follow the moving target who performs large scale motions in a wide space. We propose a novel non-rigid surface registration method to track and fuse the depth of the three flying cameras for surface motion tracking of the moving target, and simultaneously calculate the pose of each flying camera. We leverage the using of visual-odometry information provided by the UAV platform, and formulate the surface tracking problem in a non-linear objective function that can be linearized and effectively minimized through a Gaussian-Newton method. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the competent and plausible surface and motion reconstruction results

- **Summary**: Many applications benefit from sampling algorithms where a small number of well chosen samples are used to generalize different properties of a large dataset. In this paper, we use diverse sampling for streaming video summarization. Several emerging applications support streaming video, but existing summarization algorithms need access to the entire video which requires a lot of memory and computational power. We propose a memory efficient and computationally fast, online algorithm that uses competitive learning for diverse sampling. Our algorithm is a generalization of online K-means such that the cost function reduces clustering error, while also ensuring a diverse set of samples. The diversity is measured as the volume of a convex hull around the samples. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is measured against human users for 50 videos in the VSUMM dataset. The algorithm performs better than batch mode summarization, while requiring significantly lower memory and computational requirements.

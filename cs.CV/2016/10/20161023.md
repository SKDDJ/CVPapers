- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the multi-view subspace clustering problem. Our method utilizes the circulant algebra for tensor, which is constructed by stacking the subspace representation matrices of different views and then rotating, to capture the low rank tensor subspace so that the refinement of the view-specific subspaces can be achieved, as well as the high order correlations underlying multi-view data can be explored.} By introducing a recently proposed tensor factorization, namely tensor-Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) \cite{kilmer13}, we can impose a new type of low-rank tensor constraint on the rotated tensor to capture the complementary information from multiple views. Different from traditional unfolding based tensor norm, this low-rank tensor constraint has optimality properties similar to that of matrix rank derived from SVD, so the complementary information among views can be explored more efficiently and thoroughly. The established model, called t-SVD based Multi-view Subspace Clustering (t-SVD-MSC), falls into the applicable scope of augmented Lagrangian method, and its minimization problem can be efficiently solved with theoretical convergence guarantee and relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental testing on eight challenging image dataset shows that the proposed method has achieved highly competent objective performance compared to several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach for real-time joint reconstruction of 3D scene motion and geometry from binocular stereo videos. Our approach is based on a novel variational halfway-domain scene flow formulation, which allows us to obtain highly accurate spatiotemporal reconstructions of shape and motion. We solve the underlying optimization problem at real-time frame rates using a novel data-parallel robust non-linear optimization strategy. Fast convergence and large displacement flows are achieved by employing a novel hierarchy that stores delta flows between hierarchy levels. High performance is obtained by the introduction of a coarser warp grid that decouples the number of unknowns from the input resolution of the images. We demonstrate our approach in a live setup that is based on two commodity webcams, as well as on publicly available video data. Our extensive experiments and evaluations show that our approach produces high-quality dense reconstructions of 3D geometry and scene flow at real-time frame rates, and compares favorably to the state of the art.

- **Summary**: 3D hand pose tracking/estimation will be very important in the next generation of human-computer interaction. Most of the currently available algorithms rely on low-cost active depth sensors. However, these sensors can be easily interfered by other active sources and require relatively high power consumption. As a result, they are currently not suitable for outdoor environments and mobile devices. This paper aims at tracking/estimating hand poses using passive stereo which avoids these limitations. A benchmark with 18,000 stereo image pairs and 18,000 depth images captured from different scenarios and the ground-truth 3D positions of palm and finger joints (obtained from the manual label) is thus proposed. This paper demonstrates that the performance of the state-of-the art tracking/estimation algorithms can be maintained with most stereo matching algorithms on the proposed benchmark, as long as the hand segmentation is correct. As a result, a novel stereo-based hand segmentation algorithm specially designed for hand tracking/estimation is proposed. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is suitable for the state-of-the-art hand pose tracking/estimation algorithms and the tracking quality is comparable to the use of active depth sensors under different challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: In most computer vision and image analysis problems, it is necessary to define a similarity measure between two or more different objects or images. Template matching is a classic and fundamental method used to score similarities between objects using certain mathematical algorithms. In this paper, we reviewed the basic concept of matching, as well as advances in template matching and applications such as invariant features or novel applications in medical image analysis. Additionally, deformable models and templates originating from classic template matching were discussed. These models have broad applications in image registration, and they are a fundamental aspect of novel machine vision or deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which perform shift and scale invariant functions followed by classification. In general, although template matching methods have restrictions which limit their application, they are recommended for use with other object recognition methods as pre- or post-processing steps. Combining a template matching technique such as normalized cross-correlation or dice coefficient with a robust decision-making algorithm yields a significant improvement in the accuracy rate for object detection and recognition.



### SPiKeS: Superpixel-Keypoints Structure for Robust Visual Tracking

- **Summary**: In visual tracking, part-based trackers are attractive since they are robust against occlusion and deformation. However, a part represented by a rectangular patch does not account for the shape of the target, while a superpixel does thanks to its boundary evidence. Nevertheless, tracking superpixels is difficult due to their lack of discriminative power. Therefore, to enable superpixels to be tracked discriminatively as object parts, we propose to enhance them with keypoints. By combining properties of these two features, we build a novel element designated as a Superpixel-Keypoints structure (SPiKeS). Being discriminative, these new object parts can be located efficiently by a simple nearest neighbor matching process. Then, in a tracking process, each match votes for the target's center to give its location. In addition, the interesting properties of our new feature allows the development of an efficient model update for more robust tracking. According to experimental results, our SPiKeS-based tracker proves to be robust in many challenging scenarios by performing favorably against the state-of-the-art.

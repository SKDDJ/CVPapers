- **Summary**: This paper strives to find the sentence best describing the content of an image or video. Different from existing works, which rely on a joint subspace for image / video to sentence matching, we propose to do so in a visual space only. We contribute Word2VisualVec, a deep neural network architecture that learns to predict a deep visual encoding of textual input based on sentence vectorization and a multi-layer perceptron. We thoroughly analyze its architectural design, by varying the sentence vectorization strategy, network depth and the deep feature to predict for image to sentence matching. We also generalize Word2VisualVec for matching a video to a sentence, by extending the predictive abilities to 3-D ConvNet features as well as a visual-audio representation. Experiments on four challenging image and video benchmarks detail Word2VisualVec's properties, capabilities for image and video to sentence matching, and on all datasets its state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Object categorization is a hot issue of an image mining. Contextual information between objects is one of the important semantic knowledge of an image. However, the previous researches for an object categorization have not made full use of the contextual information, especially the spatial relations between objects. In addition, the object categorization methods, which generally use the probabilistic graphical models to implement the incorporation of contextual information with appearance of objects, are almost inevitable to evaluate the intractable partition function for normalization. In this work, we introduced fully-connected fuzzy spatial relations including directional, distance and topological relations between object regions, so the spatial relational information could be fully utilized. Then, the spatial relations were considered as well as co-occurrence and appearance of objects by using energy-based model, where the energy function was defined as the region-object association potential and the configuration potential of objects. Minimizing the energy function of whole image arrangement, we obtained the optimal label set about the image regions and addressed the evaluation of intractable partition function in conditional random fields. Experimental results show the validity and reliability of this proposed method.

- **Summary**: The prevalent scene text detection approach follows four sequential steps comprising character candidate detection, false character candidate removal, text line extraction, and text line verification. However, errors occur and accumulate throughout each of these sequential steps which often lead to low detection performance. To address these issues, we propose a unified scene text detection system, namely Text Flow, by utilizing the minimum cost (min-cost) flow network model. With character candidates detected by cascade boosting, the min-cost flow network model integrates the last three sequential steps into a single process which solves the error accumulation problem at both character level and text line level effectively. The proposed technique has been tested on three public datasets, i.e, ICDAR2011 dataset, ICDAR2013 dataset and a multilingual dataset and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all three datasets with much higher recall and F-score. The good performance on the multilingual dataset shows that the proposed technique can be used for the detection of texts in different languages.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel information theoretic framework for dictionary learning (DL) and sparse coding (SC) on a statistical manifold (the manifold of probability distributions). Unlike the traditional DL and SC framework, our new formulation {\it does not explicitly incorporate any sparsity inducing norm in the cost function but yet yields SCs}. Moreover, we extend this framework to the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, $\mathcal{P}_n$. Our algorithm approximates the data points, which are probability distributions, by the weighted Kullback-Leibeler center (KL-center) of the dictionary atoms. The KL-center is the minimizer of the maximum KL-divergence between the unknown center and members of the set whose center is being sought. Further, {\it we proved that this KL-center is a sparse combination of the dictionary atoms}. Since, the data reside on a statistical manifold, the data fidelity term can not be as simple as in the case of the vector-space data. We therefore employ the geodesic distance between the data and a sparse approximation of the data element. This cost function is minimized using an acceleterated gradient descent algorithm. An extensive set of experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We present several experiments involving a variety of classification problems in Computer Vision applications. Further, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by comparing it to several state-of-the-art methods both in terms of classification accuracy and sparsity.

- **Summary**: Deep residual networks have recently shown appealing performance on many challenging computer vision tasks. However, the original residual structure still has some defects making it difficult to converge on very deep networks. In this paper, we introduce a weighted residual network to address the incompatibility between \texttt{ReLU} and element-wise addition and the deep network initialization problem. The weighted residual network is able to learn to combine residuals from different layers effectively and efficiently. The proposed models enjoy a consistent improvement over accuracy and convergence with increasing depths from 100+ layers to 1000+ layers. Besides, the weighted residual networks have little more computation and GPU memory burden than the original residual networks. The networks are optimized by projected stochastic gradient descent. Experiments on CIFAR-10 have shown that our algorithm has a \emph{faster convergence speed} than the original residual networks and reaches a \emph{high accuracy} at 95.3\% with a 1192-layer model.

- **Summary**: The Color is one of the most important and easily identifiable features for describing the visual content. The MPEG standard has developed a number of descriptors that covers different aspects of the visual content. The Dominant color descriptor is one of them. This paper proposes a channelized binning approach a novel method for extraction of the dominant color pixel value which is a variant of the dominant color descriptor. The Channelized binning method treats the problem as a statistical problem and tries to avoid color quantization and interpolation guessing of number and centroid of dominant colors. Channelized binning is an iterative approach which automatically estimates the number of dominant pixel values and their centroids. It operates on 24 bit full RGB color space, by considering one color channel at a time and hence avoiding the color quantization. Results show that the proposed method can successfully extract dominant color pixel values.

- **Summary**: Key frames play an important role in video annotation. It is one of the widely used methods for video abstraction as this will help us for processing a large set of video data with sufficient content representation in faster way. In this paper a novel approach for key-frame extraction using entropy value is proposed. The proposed approach classifies frames based on entropy values as global feature and selects frame from each class as representative key-frame. It also eliminates redundant frames from selected key-frames using entropy value as local feature. Evaluation of the approach on several video clips has been presented. Results show that the algorithm is successful in helping annotators automatically identify video key-frames.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel sparse coding and counting method under Bayesian framwork for visual tracking. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed method employs the combination of L0 and L1 norm to regularize the linear coefficients of incrementally updated linear basis. The sparsity constraint enables the tracker to effectively handle difficult challenges, such as occlusion or image corruption. To achieve realtime processing, we propose a fast and efficient numerical algorithm for solving the proposed model. Although it is an NP-hard problem, the proposed accelerated proximal gradient (APG) approach is guaranteed to converge to a solution quickly. Besides, we provide a closed solution of combining L0 and L1 regularized representation to obtain better sparsity. Experimental results on challenging video sequences demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results both in accuracy and speed.

- **Summary**: Topological data analysis is becoming a popular way to study high dimensional feature spaces without any contextual clues or assumptions. This paper concerns itself with one popular topological feature, which is the number of $d-$dimensional holes in the dataset, also known as the Betti$-d$ number. The persistence of the Betti numbers over various scales is encoded into a persistence diagram (PD), which indicates the birth and death times of these holes as scale varies. A common way to compare PDs is by a point-to-point matching, which is given by the $n$-Wasserstein metric. However, a big drawback of this approach is the need to solve correspondence between points before computing the distance; for $n$ points, the complexity grows according to $\mathcal{O}($n$^3)$. Instead, we propose to use an entirely new framework built on Riemannian geometry, that models PDs as 2D probability density functions that are represented in the square-root framework on a Hilbert Sphere. The resulting space is much more intuitive with closed form expressions for common operations. The distance metric is 1) correspondence-free and also 2) independent of the number of points in the dataset. The complexity of computing distance between PDs now grows according to $\mathcal{O}(K^2)$, for a $K \times K$ discretization of $[0,1]^2$. This also enables the use of existing machinery in differential geometry towards statistical analysis of PDs such as computing the mean, geodesics, classification etc. We report competitive results with the Wasserstein metric, at a much lower computational load, indicating the favorable properties of the proposed approach.

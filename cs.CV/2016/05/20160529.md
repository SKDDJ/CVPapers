- **Summary**: In some of object recognition problems, labeled data may not be available for all categories. Zero-shot learning utilizes auxiliary information (also called signatures) describing each category in order to find a classifier that can recognize samples from categories with no labeled instance. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised zero-shot learning method that works on an embedding space corresponding to abstract deep visual features. We seek a linear transformation on signatures to map them onto the visual features, such that the mapped signatures of the seen classes are close to labeled samples of the corresponding classes and unlabeled data are also close to the mapped signatures of one of the unseen classes.   We use the idea that the rich deep visual features provide a representation space in which samples of each class are usually condensed in a cluster. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on four public benchmarks improving the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on three of them.

- **Summary**: We consider the task of predicting various traits of a person given an image of their face. We estimate both objective traits, such as gender, ethnicity and hair-color; as well as subjective traits, such as the emotion a person expresses or whether he is humorous or attractive. For sizeable experimentation, we contribute a new Face Attributes Dataset (FAD), having roughly 200,000 attribute labels for the above traits, for over 10,000 facial images. Due to the recent surge of research on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we begin by using a CNN architecture for estimating facial attributes and show that they indeed provide an impressive baseline performance. To further improve performance, we propose a novel approach that incorporates facial landmark information for input images as an additional channel, helping the CNN learn better attribute-specific features so that the landmarks across various training images hold correspondence. We empirically analyse the performance of our method, showing consistent improvement over the baseline across traits.

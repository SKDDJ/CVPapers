- **Summary**: This paper shows that it is possible to train large and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for JPEG compression artifacts reduction, and that such networks can provide significantly better reconstruction quality compared to previously used smaller networks as well as to any other state-of-the-art methods. We were able to train networks with 8 layers in a single step and in relatively short time by combining residual learning, skip architecture, and symmetric weight initialization. We provide further insights into convolution networks for JPEG artifact reduction by evaluating three different objectives, generalization with respect to training dataset size, and generalization with respect to JPEG quality level.

- **Summary**: By thoroughly revisiting the classic human action recognition paradigm, this paper aims at proposing a new approach for the design of effective action classification systems. Taking as testbed publicly available three-dimensional (MoCap) action/activity datasets, we analyzed and validated different training/testing strategies. In particular, considering that each human action in the datasets is performed several times by different subjects, we were able to precisely quantify the effect of inter- and intra-subject variability, so as to figure out the impact of several learning approaches in terms of classification performance. The net result is that standard testing strategies consisting in cross-validating the algorithm using typical splits of the data (holdout, k-fold, or one-subject-out) is always outperformed by a "personalization" strategy which learns how a subject is performing an action. In other words, it is advantageous to customize (i.e., personalize) the method to learn the actions carried out by each subject, rather than trying to generalize the actions executions across subjects. Consequently, we finally propose an action recognition framework consisting of a two-stage classification approach where, given a test action, the subject is first identified before the actual recognition of the action takes place. Despite the basic, off-the-shelf descriptors and standard classifiers adopted, we noted a relevant increase in performance with respect to standard state-of-the-art algorithms, so motivating the usage of personalized approaches for designing effective action recognition systems.

- **Summary**: Identification of minimum number of local regions of a handwritten character image, containing well-defined discriminating features which are sufficient for a minimal but complete description of the character is a challenging task. A new region selection technique based on the idea of an enhanced Harmony Search methodology has been proposed here. The powerful framework of Harmony Search has been utilized to search the region space and detect only the most informative regions for correctly recognizing the handwritten character. The proposed method has been tested on handwritten samples of Bangla Basic, Compound and mixed (Basic and Compound characters) characters separately with SVM based classifier using a longest run based feature-set obtained from the image subregions formed by a CG based quad-tree partitioning approach. Applying this methodology on the above mentioned three types of datasets, respectively 43.75%, 12.5% and 37.5% gains have been achieved in terms of region reduction and 2.3%, 0.6% and 1.2% gains have been achieved in terms of recognition accuracy. The results show a sizeable reduction in the minimal number of descriptive regions as well a significant increase in recognition accuracy for all the datasets using the proposed technique. Thus the time and cost related to feature extraction is decreased without dampening the corresponding recognition accuracy.

- **Summary**: It is a consensus in signal processing that the Gaussian kernel and its partial derivatives enable the development of robust algorithms for feature detection. Fourier analysis and convolution theory have central role in such development. In this paper we collect theoretical elements to follow this avenue but using the q-Gaussian kernel that is a nonextensive generalization of the Gaussian one. Firstly, we review some theoretical elements behind the one-dimensional q-Gaussian and its Fourier transform. Then, we consider the two-dimensional q-Gaussian and we highlight the issues behind its analytical Fourier transform computation. We analyze the q-Gaussian kernel in the space and Fourier domains using the concepts of space window, cut-off frequency, and the Heisenberg inequality.

- **Summary**: We introduce the Multi30K dataset to stimulate multilingual multimodal research. Recent advances in image description have been demonstrated on English-language datasets almost exclusively, but image description should not be limited to English. This dataset extends the Flickr30K dataset with i) German translations created by professional translators over a subset of the English descriptions, and ii) descriptions crowdsourced independently of the original English descriptions. We outline how the data can be used for multilingual image description and multimodal machine translation, but we anticipate the data will be useful for a broader range of tasks.

- **Summary**: The vast majority of modern consumer-grade cameras employ a rolling shutter mechanism. In dynamic geometric computer vision applications such as visual SLAM, the so-called rolling shutter effect therefore needs to be properly taken into account. A dedicated relative pose solver appears to be the first problem to solve, as it is of eminent importance to bootstrap any derivation of multi-view geometry. However, despite its significance, it has received inadequate attention to date.   This paper presents a detailed investigation of the geometry of the rolling shutter relative pose problem. We introduce the rolling shutter essential matrix, and establish its link to existing models such as the push-broom cameras, summarized in a clean hierarchy of multi-perspective cameras. The generalization of well-established concepts from epipolar geometry is completed by a definition of the Sampson distance in the rolling shutter case. The work is concluded with a careful investigation of the introduced epipolar geometry for rolling shutter cameras on several dedicated benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce several new schemes for calculation of discrete wavelet transforms of images. These schemes reduce the number of steps and, as a consequence, allow to reduce the number of synchronizations on parallel architectures. As an additional useful property, the proposed schemes can reduce also the number of arithmetic operations. The schemes are primarily demonstrated on CDF 5/3 and CDF 9/7 wavelets employed in JPEG 2000 image compression standard. However, the presented method is general, and it can be applied on any wavelet transform. As a result, our scheme requires only two memory barriers for 2-D CDF 5/3 transform compared to four barriers in the original separable form or three barriers in the non-separable scheme recently published. Our reasoning is supported by exhaustive experiments on high-end graphics cards.

- **Summary**: Optical flow estimation is a widely known problem in computer vision introduced by Gibson, J.J(1950) to describe the visual perception of human by stimulus objects. Estimation of optical flow model can be achieved by solving for the motion vectors from region of interest in the the different timeline. In this paper, we assumed slightly uniform change of velocity between two nearby frames, and solve the optical flow problem by traditional method, Lucas-Kanade(1981). This method performs minimization of errors between template and target frame warped back onto the template. Solving minimization steps requires optimization methods which have diverse convergence rate and error. We explored first and second order optimization methods, and compare their results with Gauss-Newton method in Lucas-Kanade. We generated 105 videos with 10,500 frames by synthetic objects, and 10 videos with 1,000 frames from real world footage. Our experimental results could be used as tuning parameters for Lucas-Kanade method.

- **Summary**: Our work introduces a novel way to increase pose estimation accuracy by discovering parts from unannotated regions of training images. Discovered parts are used to generate more accurate appearance likelihoods for traditional part-based models like Pictorial Structures [13] and its derivatives. Our experiments on images of a hawkmoth in flight show that our proposed approach significantly improves over existing work [27] for this application, while also being more generally applicable. Our proposed approach localizes landmarks at least twice as accurately as a baseline based on a Mixture of Pictorial Structures (MPS) model. Our unique High-Resolution Moth Flight (HRMF) dataset is made publicly available with annotations.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of accurately and efficiently querying a remote server to retrieve information about images captured by a mobile device. In addition to reduced transmission overhead and computational complexity, the retrieval protocol should be robust to variations in the image acquisition process, such as translation, rotation, scaling, and sensor-related differences. We propose to extract scale-invariant image features and then perform clustering to reduce the number of features needed for image matching. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are investigated as candidate clustering approaches. The image matching complexity at the database server is quadratic in the (small) number of clusters, not in the (very large) number of image features. We employ an image-dependent information content metric to approximate the model order, i.e., the number of clusters, needed for accurate matching, which is preferable to setting the model order using trial and error. We show how to combine the hypotheses provided by PCA and NMF factor loadings, thereby obtaining more accurate retrieval than using either approach alone. In experiments on a database of urban images, we obtain a top-1 retrieval accuracy of 89% and a top-3 accuracy of 92.5%.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider a natural extension of the edge-preserving bilateral filter for vector-valued images. The direct computation of this non-linear filter is slow in practice. We demonstrate how a fast algorithm can be obtained by first approximating the Gaussian kernel of the bilateral filter using raised-cosines, and then using Monte Carlo sampling. We present simulation results on color images to demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithm and the speedup over the direct implementation.

- **Summary**: The bilateral filter is an edge-preserving smoother that has diverse applications in image processing, computer vision, computer graphics, and computational photography. The filter uses a spatial kernel along with a range kernel to perform edge-preserving smoothing. In this paper, we consider the Gaussian bilateral filter where both the kernels are Gaussian. A direct implementation of the Gaussian bilateral filter requires $O(\sigma_s^2)$ operations per pixel, where $\sigma_s$ is the standard deviation of the spatial Gaussian. In fact, it is well-known that the direct implementation is slow in practice. We present an approximation of the Gaussian bilateral filter, whereby we can cut down the number of operations to $O(1)$ per pixel for any arbitrary $\sigma_s$, and yet achieve very high-quality filtering that is almost indistinguishable from the output of the original filter. We demonstrate that the proposed approximation is few orders faster in practice compared to the direct implementation. We also demonstrate that the approximation is competitive with existing fast algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy.

- **Summary**: A novel probabilistic perception algorithm is presented as a real-time joint solution to data association, object tracking, and object classification for an autonomous ground vehicle in all-weather conditions. The presented algorithm extends a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter originally built with a particle filter for data association and a Kalman filter for multi-object tracking (Miller et al. 2011a) to now also include multiple model tracking for classification. Additionally a state-of-the-art vision detection algorithm that includes heading information for autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) applications was implemented. Cornell's AGV from the DARPA Urban Challenge was upgraded and used to experimentally examine if and how state-of-the-art vision algorithms can complement or replace lidar and radar sensors. Sensor and algorithm performance in adverse weather and lighting conditions is tested. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust all-weather data association, tracking, and classification where camera, lidar, and radar sensors complement each other inside the joint probabilistic perception algorithm.

- **Summary**: Estimates of image gradients play a ubiquitous role in image segmentation and classification problems since gradients directly relate to the boundaries or the edges of a scene. This paper proposes an unified approach to gradient estimation based on fractional calculus that is computationally cheap and readily applicable to any existing algorithm that relies on image gradients. We show experiments on edge detection and image segmentation on the Stanford Backgrounds Dataset where these improved local gradients outperforms state of the art, achieving a performance of 79.2% average accuracy.

- **Summary**: Cloud imaging using ground-based whole sky imagers is essential for a fine-grained understanding of the effects of cloud formations, which can be useful in many applications. Some such imagers are available commercially, but their cost is relatively high, and their flexibility is limited. Therefore, we built a new daytime Whole Sky Imager (WSI) called Wide Angle High-Resolution Sky Imaging System. The strengths of our new design are its simplicity, low manufacturing cost and high resolution. Our imager captures the entire hemisphere in a single high-resolution picture via a digital camera using a fish-eye lens. The camera was modified to capture light across the visible as well as the near-infrared spectral ranges. This paper describes the design of the device as well as the geometric and radiometric calibration of the imaging system.

- **Summary**: Computer vision algorithms are known to be extremely sensitive to the environmental conditions in which the data is captured, e.g., lighting conditions and target density. Tuning of parameters or choosing a completely new algorithm is often needed to achieve a certain performance level, especially when there is a limitation of the computation source. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a framework to adaptively select the "best" algorithm-parameter combination and the computation platform under performance and cost constraints at design time, and adapt the algorithms at runtime based on real-time inputs. This necessitates developing a mechanism to switch between different algorithms as the nature of the input video changes. Our proposed algorithm calculates a similarity function between a test video scenario and each training scenario, where the similarity calculation is based on learning a manifold of image features that is shared by both the training and test datasets. Similarity between training and test dataset indicates the same algorithm can be applied to both of them and achieve similar performance. We design a cost function with this similarity measure to find the most similar training scenario to the test data. The "best" algorithm under a given platform is obtained by selecting the algorithm with a specific parameter combination that performs the best on the corresponding training data. The proposed framework can be used first offline to choose the platform based on performance and cost constraints, and then online whereby the "best" algorithm is selected for each new incoming video segment for a given platform. In the experiments, we apply our algorithm to the problems of pedestrian detection and tracking. We show how to adaptively select platforms and algorithm-parameter combinations. Our results provide optimal performance on 3 publicly available datasets.

- **Summary**: We address the difficult problem of distinguishing fine-grained object categories in low resolution images. Wepropose a simple an effective deep learning approach that transfers fine-grained knowledge gained from high resolution training data to the coarse low-resolution test scenario. Such fine-to-coarse knowledge transfer has many real world applications, such as identifying objects in surveillance photos or satellite images where the image resolution at the test time is very low but plenty of high resolution photos of similar objects are available. Our extensive experiments on two standard benchmark datasets containing fine-grained car models and bird species demonstrate that our approach can effectively transfer fine-detail knowledge to coarse-detail imagery.

- **Summary**: The diagnosis of epilepsy generally includes a visual inspection of EEG recorded data by the Neurologist, with the purpose of checking the occurrence of transient waveforms called interictal epileptiform discharges. These waveforms have short duration (less than 100 ms), so the inspection process is usually time-consuming, particularly for ambulatory long term EEG records. Therefore, an automatic detection system of epileptiform discharges can be a valuable tool for a Neurology service. The proposed approach is the development of a multi stage detection algorithm, which processes the complete EEG signals and applies decision criteria to selected waveforms. It employs EEG analysis techniques such as Wavelet Transform and Mimetic Analysis, complemented with a classification based on Fuzzy Logic. In order to evaluate the algorithm's performance, data were collected from several epileptic patients, with epileptiform activity marked by a Neurologist. The average values obtained for both Sensitivity and Specificity were respectively higher than 80 and 70 percent.

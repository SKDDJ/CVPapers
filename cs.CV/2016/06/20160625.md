- **Summary**: In a given scene, humans can often easily predict a set of immediate future events that might happen. However, generalized pixel-level anticipation in computer vision systems is difficult because machine learning struggles with the ambiguity inherent in predicting the future. In this paper, we focus on predicting the dense trajectory of pixels in a scene, specifically what will move in the scene, where it will travel, and how it will deform over the course of one second. We propose a conditional variational autoencoder as a solution to this problem. In this framework, direct inference from the image shapes the distribution of possible trajectories, while latent variables encode any necessary information that is not available in the image. We show that our method is able to successfully predict events in a wide variety of scenes and can produce multiple different predictions when the future is ambiguous. Our algorithm is trained on thousands of diverse, realistic videos and requires absolutely no human labeling. In addition to non-semantic action prediction, we find that our method learns a representation that is applicable to semantic vision tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper we introduce the problem of determining the topic that a set of images is describing, where every topic is represented as a set of words. Different from other problems like tag assignment or similar, a) we assume multiple images are used as input instead of single image, b) Input images are typically not visually related, c) Input images are not necessarily semantically close, and d) Output word space is unconstrained. In our proposed solution, visual information of each query image is used to retrieve similar images with text labels (tags) from an image database. We consider a scenario where the tags are very noisy and diverse, given that they were obtained by implicit crowd-sourcing in a database of 1 million images and over seventy seven thousand tags. The words or tags associated to each query are processed jointly in a word selection algorithm using random walks that allows to refine the search topic, rejecting words that are not part of the topic and produce a set of words that fairly describe the topic. Experiments on a dataset of 300 topics, with up to twenty images per topic, show that our algorithm performs better than the proposed baseline for any number of query images. We also present a new Conditional Random Field (CRF) word mapping algorithm that preserves the semantic similarity of the mapped words, increasing the performance of the results over the baseline.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is a non-invasive tool for watching the microstructure of fibrous nerve and muscle tissue. From dMRI, it is possible to estimate 2-rank diffusion tensors imaging (DTI) fields, that are widely used in clinical applications: tissue segmentation, fiber tractography, brain atlas construction, brain conductivity models, among others. Due to hardware limitations of MRI scanners, DTI has the difficult compromise between spatial resolution and signal noise ratio (SNR) during acquisition. For this reason, the data are often acquired with very low resolution. To enhance DTI data resolution, interpolation provides an interesting software solution. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology for DTI interpolation that enhance the spatial resolution of DTI fields. We assume that a DTI field follows a recently introduced stochastic process known as a generalized Wishart process (GWP), which we use as a prior over the diffusion tensor field. For posterior inference, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We perform experiments in toy and real data. Results of GWP outperform other methods in the literature, when compared in different validation protocols.

- **Summary**: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is an emerging medical technique used for describing water diffusion in an organic tissue. Typically, rank-2 tensors quantify this diffusion. From this quantification, it is possible to calculate relevant scalar measures (i.e. fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) employed in clinical diagnosis of neurological diseases. Nonetheless, 2nd-order tensors fail to represent complex tissue structures like crossing fibers. To overcome this limitation, several researchers proposed a diffusion representation with higher order tensors (HOT), specifically 4th and 6th orders. However, the current acquisition protocols of dMRI data allow images with a spatial resolution between 1 $mm^3$ and 2 $mm^3$. This voxel size is much smaller than tissue structures. Therefore, several clinical procedures derived from dMRI may be inaccurate. Interpolation has been used to enhance resolution of dMRI in a tensorial space. Most interpolation methods are valid only for rank-2 tensors and a generalization for HOT data is missing. In this work, we propose a novel stochastic process called Tucker decomposition process (TDP) for performing HOT data interpolation. Our model is based on the Tucker decomposition and Gaussian processes as parameters of the TDP. We test the TDP in 2nd, 4th and 6th rank HOT fields. For rank-2 tensors, we compare against direct interpolation, log-Euclidean approach and Generalized Wishart processes. For rank-4 and rank-6 tensors we compare against direct interpolation. Results obtained show that TDP interpolates accurately the HOT fields and generalizes to any rank.

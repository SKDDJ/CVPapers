- **Summary**: We consider the problem of scale detection in images where a region of interest is present together with a measurement tool (e.g. a ruler). For the segmentation part, we focus on the graph based method by Flenner and Bertozzi which reinterprets classical continuous Ginzburg-Landau minimisation models in a totally discrete framework. To overcome the numerical difficulties due to the large size of the images considered we use matrix completion and splitting techniques. The scale on the measurement tool is detected via a Hough transform based algorithm. The method is then applied to some measurement tasks arising in real-world applications such as zoology, medicine and archaeology.

- **Summary**: We develop an algorithm for single-image superresolution of remotely sensed data, based on the discrete shearlet transform. The shearlet transform extracts directional features of signals, and is known to provide near-optimally sparse representations for a broad class of images. This often leads to superior performance in edge detection and image representation when compared to isotropic frames. We justify the use of shearlets mathematically, before presenting a denoising single-image superresolution algorithm that combines the shearlet transform with sparse mixing estimators (SME). Our algorithm is compared with a variety of single-image superresolution methods, including wavelet SME superresolution. Our numerical results demonstrate competitive performance in terms of PSNR and SSIM.

- **Summary**: Existing video indexing and retrieval methods on popular web-based multimedia sharing websites are based on user-provided sparse tagging. This paper proposes a very specific way of searching for video clips, based on the content of the video. We present our work on Content-based Video Indexing and Retrieval using the Correspondence-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (corr-LDA) probabilistic framework. This is a model that provides for auto-annotation of videos in a database with textual descriptors, and brings the added benefit of utilizing the semantic relations between the content of the video and text. We use the concept-level matching provided by corr-LDA to build correspondences between text and multimedia, with the objective of retrieving content with increased accuracy. In our experiments, we employ only the audio components of the individual recordings and compare our results with an SVM-based approach.

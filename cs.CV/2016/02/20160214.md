- **Summary**: In this work, we study the challenging problem of identifying the irregular status of objects from images in an "open world" setting, that is, distinguishing the irregular status of an object category from its regular status as well as objects from other categories in the absence of "irregular object" training data. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach by inspecting the distribution of the detection scores at multiple image regions based on the detector trained from the "regular object" and "other objects". The key observation motivating our approach is that for "regular object" images as well as "other objects" images, the region-level scores follow their own essential patterns in terms of both the score values and the spatial distributions while the detection scores obtained from an "irregular object" image tend to break these patterns. To model this distribution, we propose to use Gaussian Processes (GP) to construct two separate generative models for the case of the "regular object" and the "other objects". More specifically, we design a new covariance function to simultaneously model the detection score at a single region and the score dependencies at multiple regions. We finally demonstrate the superior performance of our method on a large dataset newly proposed in this paper.

- **Summary**: We study classifiers operating under severe classification time constraints, corresponding to 1-1000 CPU microseconds, using Convolutional Tables Ensemble (CTE), an inherently fast architecture for object category recognition. The architecture is based on convolutionally-applied sparse feature extraction, using trees or ferns, and a linear voting layer. Several structure and optimization variants are considered, including novel decision functions, tree learning algorithm, and distillation from CNN to CTE architecture. Accuracy improvements of 24-45% over related art of similar speed are demonstrated on standard object recognition benchmarks. Using Pareto speed-accuracy curves, we show that CTE can provide better accuracy than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for a certain range of classification time constraints, or alternatively provide similar error rates with 5-200X speedup.

- **Summary**: Binary features have been incrementally popular in the past few years due to their low memory footprints and the efficient computation of Hamming distance between binary descriptors. They have been shown with promising results on some real time applications, e.g., SLAM, where the matching operations are relative few. However, in computer vision, there are many applications such as 3D reconstruction requiring lots of matching operations between local features. Therefore, a natural question is that is the binary feature still a promising solution to this kind of applications? To get the answer, this paper conducts a comparative study of binary features and their matching methods on the context of 3D reconstruction in a recently proposed large scale mutliview stereo dataset. Our evaluations reveal that not all binary features are capable of this task. Most of them are inferior to the classical SIFT based method in terms of reconstruction accuracy and completeness with a not significant better computational performance.

- **Summary**: After decades of study, automatic face detection and recognition systems are now accurate and widespread. Naturally, this means users who wish to avoid automatic recognition are becoming less able to do so. Where do we stand in this cat-and-mouse race? We currently live in a society where everyone carries a camera in their pocket. Many people willfully upload most or all of the pictures they take to social networks which invest heavily in automatic face recognition systems. In this setting, is it still possible for privacy-conscientious users to avoid automatic face detection and recognition? If so, how? Must evasion techniques be obvious to be effective, or are there still simple measures that users can use to protect themselves?   In this work, we find ways to evade face detection on Facebook, a representative example of a popular social network that uses automatic face detection to enhance their service. We challenge widely-held beliefs about evading face detection: do our old techniques such as blurring the face region or wearing "privacy glasses" still work? We show that in general, state-of-the-art detectors can often find faces even if the subject wears occluding clothing or even if the uploader damages the photo to prevent faces from being detected.

- **Summary**: Microtask crowdsourcing has enabled dataset advances in social science and machine learning, but existing crowdsourcing schemes are too expensive to scale up with the expanding volume of data. To scale and widen the applicability of crowdsourcing, we present a technique that produces extremely rapid judgments for binary and categorical labels. Rather than punishing all errors, which causes workers to proceed slowly and deliberately, our technique speeds up workers' judgments to the point where errors are acceptable and even expected. We demonstrate that it is possible to rectify these errors by randomizing task order and modeling response latency. We evaluate our technique on a breadth of common labeling tasks such as image verification, word similarity, sentiment analysis and topic classification. Where prior work typically achieves a 0.25x to 1x speedup over fixed majority vote, our approach often achieves an order of magnitude (10x) speedup.

- **Summary**: Despite the evaluation systems of human movement that have been advancing in recent decades, their use are not feasible for clinical practice because it has a high cost and scarcity of trained operators to interpret their results. An ideal videogrammetry system should be easy to use, low cost, with minimal equipment, and fast realization. The CvMob is a free tool for dynamic evaluation of human movements that express measurements in figures, tables, and graphics. This paper aims to determine if CvMob is a reliable tool for the evaluation of two dimensional human gait. This is a validity and reliability study. The sample was composed of 56 healthy individuals who walked on a 9-meterlong walkway and were simultaneously filmed by CvMob and Vicon system cameras. Linear trajectories and angular measurements were compared to validate the CvMob system, and inter and intrarater findings of the same measurements were used to determine reliability. A strong correlation (rs mean = 0.988) of the linear trajectories between systems and inter and intrarater analysis were found. According to the Bland-Altman method, the angles that had good agreement between systems were maximum flexion and extension (stance and swing) of the knee and dorsiflexion range of motion and stride length. The CvMob is a reliable tool for analysis of linear motion and lengths in two-dimensional evaluations of human gait. The angular measurements demonstrate high agreement for the knee joint; however, the hip and ankle measurements were limited by differences between systems.

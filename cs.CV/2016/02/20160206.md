- **Summary**: Design of false color palette is quite easy but some effort has to be done to achieve good dynamic range, contrast and overall appearance of the palette. Such palettes, for instance, are commonly used in scientific papers for presenting the data. However, to lower the cost of the paper most scientists decide to let the data to be printed in grayscale. The same applies to e-book readers based on e-ink where most of them are still grayscale. For majority of false color palettes reproducing them in grayscale results in ambiguous mapping of the colors and may be misleading for the reader. In this article design of false color palettes suitable for grayscale reproduction is described. Due to the monotonic change of luminance of these palettes grayscale representation is very similar to the data directly presented with a grayscale palette. Some suggestions and examples how to design such palettes are provided.

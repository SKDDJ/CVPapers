- **Summary**: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a very important super-resolution microscopy technique, which provides high speed super-resolution with about two-fold spatial resolution enhancement. Several attempts aimed at improving the performance of SIM reconstruction algorithm have been reported. However, most of these highlight only one specific aspect of the SIM reconstruction -- such as the determination of the illumination pattern phase shift accurately -- whereas other key elements -- such as determination of modulation factor, estimation of object power spectrum, Wiener filtering frequency components with inclusion of object power spectrum information, translocating and the merging of the overlapping frequency components -- are usually glossed over superficially. In addition, most of the work reported lie scattered throughout the literature and a comprehensive review of the theoretical background is found lacking. The purpose of the present work is two-fold: 1) to collect the essential theoretical details of SIM algorithm at one place, thereby making them readily accessible to readers for the first time; and 2) to provide an open source SIM reconstruction code (named OpenSIM), which enables users to interactively vary the code parameters and study it's effect on reconstructed SIM image.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a new method for face verification across large age gaps and also a dataset containing variations of age in the wild, the Large Age-Gap (LAG) dataset, with images ranging from child/young to adult/old. The proposed method exploits a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) pre-trained for the face recognition task on a large dataset and then fine-tuned for the large age-gap face verification task. Finetuning is performed in a Siamese architecture using a contrastive loss function. A feature injection layer is introduced to boost verification accuracy, showing the ability of the DCNN to learn a similarity metric leveraging external features. Experimental results on the LAG dataset show that our method is able to outperform the face verification solutions in the state of the art considered.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of model-based 3D-tracking of objects given dense depth images as input. Two difficulties preclude the application of a standard Gaussian filter to this problem. First of all, depth sensors are characterized by fat-tailed measurement noise. To address this issue, we show how a recently published robustification method for Gaussian filters can be applied to the problem at hand. Thereby, we avoid using heuristic outlier detection methods that simply reject measurements if they do not match the model. Secondly, the computational cost of the standard Gaussian filter is prohibitive due to the high-dimensional measurement, i.e. the depth image. To address this problem, we propose an approximation to reduce the computational complexity of the filter. In quantitative experiments on real data we show how our method clearly outperforms the standard Gaussian filter. Furthermore, we compare its performance to a particle-filter-based tracking method, and observe comparable computational efficiency and improved accuracy and smoothness of the estimates.

- **Summary**: A multi-scale greedy-based object proposal generation approach is presented. Based on the multi-scale nature of objects in images, our approach is built on top of a hierarchical segmentation. We first identify the representative and diverse exemplar clusters within each scale by using a diversity ranking algorithm. Object proposals are obtained by selecting a subset from the multi-scale segment pool via maximizing a submodular objective function, which consists of a weighted coverage term, a single-scale diversity term and a multi-scale reward term. The weighted coverage term forces the selected set of object proposals to be representative and compact; the single-scale diversity term encourages choosing segments from different exemplar clusters so that they will cover as many object patterns as possible; the multi-scale reward term encourages the selected proposals to be discriminative and selected from multiple layers generated by the hierarchical image segmentation. The experimental results on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and PASCAL VOC2012 segmentation dataset demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our object proposal model. Additionally, we validate our object proposals in simultaneous segmentation and detection and outperform the state-of-art performance.

- **Summary**: We can better understand deep neural networks by identifying which features each of their neurons have learned to detect. To do so, researchers have created Deep Visualization techniques including activation maximization, which synthetically generates inputs (e.g. images) that maximally activate each neuron. A limitation of current techniques is that they assume each neuron detects only one type of feature, but we know that neurons can be multifaceted, in that they fire in response to many different types of features: for example, a grocery store class neuron must activate either for rows of produce or for a storefront. Previous activation maximization techniques constructed images without regard for the multiple different facets of a neuron, creating inappropriate mixes of colors, parts of objects, scales, orientations, etc. Here, we introduce an algorithm that explicitly uncovers the multiple facets of each neuron by producing a synthetic visualization of each of the types of images that activate a neuron. We also introduce regularization methods that produce state-of-the-art results in terms of the interpretability of images obtained by activation maximization. By separately synthesizing each type of image a neuron fires in response to, the visualizations have more appropriate colors and coherent global structure. Multifaceted feature visualization thus provides a clearer and more comprehensive description of the role of each neuron.

- **Summary**: Generative reconstruction methods compute the 3D configuration (such as pose and/or geometry) of a shape by optimizing the overlap of the projected 3D shape model with images. Proper handling of occlusions is a big challenge, since the visibility function that indicates if a surface point is seen from a camera can often not be formulated in closed form, and is in general discrete and non-differentiable at occlusion boundaries. We present a new scene representation that enables an analytically differentiable closed-form formulation of surface visibility. In contrast to previous methods, this yields smooth, analytically differentiable, and efficient to optimize pose similarity energies with rigorous occlusion handling, fewer local minima, and experimentally verified improved convergence of numerical optimization. The underlying idea is a new image formation model that represents opaque objects by a translucent medium with a smooth Gaussian density distribution which turns visibility into a smooth phenomenon. We demonstrate the advantages of our versatile scene model in several generative pose estimation problems, namely marker-less multi-object pose estimation, marker-less human motion capture with few cameras, and image-based 3D geometry estimation.

- **Summary**: Automatic recognition of the quality of movement in human beings is a challenging task, given the difficulty both in defining the constraints that make a movement correct, and the difficulty in using noisy data to determine if these constraints were satisfied. This paper presents a method for the detection of deviations from the correct form in movements from physical therapy routines based on Hidden Markov Models, which is compared to Dynamic Time Warping. The activities studied include upper an lower limbs movements, the data used comes from a Kinect sensor. Correct repetitions of the activities of interest were recorded, as well as deviations from these correct forms. The ability of the proposed approach to detect these deviations was studied. Results show that a system based on HMM is much more likely to determine if a certain movement has deviated from the specification.

- **Summary**: The common graph Laplacian regularizer is well-established in semi-supervised learning and spectral dimensionality reduction. However, as a first-order regularizer, it can lead to degenerate functions in high-dimensional manifolds. The iterated graph Laplacian enables high-order regularization, but it has a high computational complexity and so cannot be applied to large problems. We introduce a new regularizer which is globally high order and so does not suffer from the degeneracy of the graph Laplacian regularizer, but is also sparse for efficient computation in semi-supervised learning applications. We reduce computational complexity by building a local first-order approximation of the manifold as a surrogate geometry, and construct our high-order regularizer based on local derivative evaluations therein. Experiments on human body shape and pose analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

- **Summary**: In many learning tasks, the structure of the target space of a function holds rich information about the relationships between evaluations of functions on different data points. Existing approaches attempt to exploit this relationship information implicitly by enforcing smoothness on function evaluations only. However, what happens if we explicitly regularize the relationships between function evaluations? Inspired by homophily, we regularize based on a smooth relationship function, either defined from the data or with labels. In experiments, we demonstrate that this significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms in semi-supervised classification and in spectral data embedding for constrained clustering and dimensionality reduction.

- **Summary**: Real-time marker-less hand tracking is of increasing importance in human-computer interaction. Robust and accurate tracking of arbitrary hand motion is a challenging problem due to the many degrees of freedom, frequent self-occlusions, fast motions, and uniform skin color. In this paper, we propose a new approach that tracks the full skeleton motion of the hand from multiple RGB cameras in real-time. The main contributions include a new generative tracking method which employs an implicit hand shape representation based on Sum of Anisotropic Gaussians (SAG), and a pose fitting energy that is smooth and analytically differentiable making fast gradient based pose optimization possible. This shape representation, together with a full perspective projection model, enables more accurate hand modeling than a related baseline method from literature. Our method achieves better accuracy than previous methods and runs at 25 fps. We show these improvements both qualitatively and quantitatively on publicly available datasets.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral signature classification is a quantitative analysis approach for hyperspectral imagery which performs detection and classification of the constituent materials at the pixel level in the scene. The classification procedure can be operated directly on hyperspectral data or performed by using some features extracted from the corresponding hyperspectral signatures containing information like the signature's energy or shape. In this paper, we describe a technique that applies non-homogeneous hidden Markov chain (NHMC) models to hyperspectral signature classification. The basic idea is to use statistical models (such as NHMC) to characterize wavelet coefficients which capture the spectrum semantics (i.e., structural information) at multiple levels. Experimental results show that the approach based on NHMC models can outperform existing approaches relevant in classification tasks.

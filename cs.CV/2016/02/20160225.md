- **Summary**: In this work we explore the previously proposed approach of direct blind deconvolution and denoising with convolutional neural networks in a situation where the blur kernels are partially constrained. We focus on blurred images from a real-life traffic surveillance system, on which we, for the first time, demonstrate that neural networks trained on artificial data provide superior reconstruction quality on real images compared to traditional blind deconvolution methods. The training data is easy to obtain by blurring sharp photos from a target system with a very rough approximation of the expected blur kernels, thereby allowing custom CNNs to be trained for a specific application (image content and blur range). Additionally, we evaluate the behavior and limits of the CNNs with respect to blur direction range and length.

- **Summary**: Binary codes can be used to speed up nearest neighbor search tasks in large scale data sets as they are efficient for both storage and retrieval. In this paper, we propose a robust auto-encoder model that preserves the geometric relationships of high-dimensional data sets in Hamming space. This is done by considering a noise-removing function in a region surrounding the manifold where the training data points lie. This function is defined with the property that it projects the data points near the manifold into the manifold wisely, and we approximate this function by its first order approximation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better than state-of-the-art results on three large scale high dimensional data sets.

- **Summary**: Systems based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology can provide important functionality in computer assisted language learning applications. This is a young but growing area of research motivated by the large number of students studying foreign languages. Here we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based method to detect mispronunciations. Exploiting the specific dialog scripting employed in language learning software, HMMs are trained for different pronunciations. New adaptive features have been developed and obtained through an adaptive warping of the frequency scale prior to computing the cepstral coefficients. The optimization criterion used for the warping function is to maximize separation of two major groups of pronunciations (native and non-native) in terms of classification rate. Experimental results show that the adaptive frequency scale yields a better coefficient representation leading to higher classification rates in comparison with conventional HMMs using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients.

- **Summary**: In recent years, consumer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have become very popular, everyone can buy and fly a drone without previous experience, which raises concern in regards to regulations and public safety. In this paper, we present a novel approach towards enabling safe operation of such vehicles in urban areas. Our method uses geodetically accurate dataset images with Geographical Information System (GIS) data of road networks and buildings provided by Google Maps, to compute a weighted A* shortest path from start to end locations of a mission. Weights represent the potential risk of injuries for individuals in all categories of land-use, i.e. flying over buildings is considered safer than above roads. We enable safe UAV operation in regards to 1- land-use by computing a static global path dependent on environmental structures, and 2- avoiding flying over moving objects such as cars and pedestrians by dynamically optimizing the path locally during the flight. As all input sources are first geo-registered, pixels and GPS coordinates are equivalent, it therefore allows us to generate an automated and user-friendly mission with GPS waypoints readable by consumer drones' autopilots. We simulated 54 missions and show significant improvement in maximizing UAV's standoff distance to moving objects with a quantified safety parameter over 40 times better than the naive straight line navigation.

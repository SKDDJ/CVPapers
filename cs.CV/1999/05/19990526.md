- **Summary**: The interactive game theoretical approach to the description of perception processes is proposed. The subject is treated formally in terms of a new class of the verbalizable interactive games which are called the perception games. An application of the previously elaborated formalism of dialogues and verbalizable interactive games to the visual perception allows to combine the linguistic (such as formal grammars), psycholinguistic and (interactive) game theoretical methods for analysis of the image understanding by a human that may be also useful for the elaboration of computer vision systems. By the way the interactive game theoretical aspects of interpretational geometries are clarified.

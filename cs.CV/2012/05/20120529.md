- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of approximate MAP-MRF inference in general graphical models. Following [36], we consider a family of linear programming relaxations of the problem where each relaxation is specified by a set of nested pairs of factors for which the marginalization constraint needs to be enforced. We develop a generalization of the TRW-S algorithm [9] for this problem, where we use a decomposition into junction chains, monotonic w.r.t. some ordering on the nodes. This generalizes the monotonic chains in [9] in a natural way. We also show how to deal with nested factors in an efficient way. Experiments show an improvement over min-sum diffusion, MPLP and subgradient ascent algorithms on a number of computer vision and natural language processing problems.

- **Summary**: This note presents some representative methods which are based on dictionary learning (DL) for classification. We do not review the sophisticated methods or frameworks that involve DL for classification, such as online DL and spatial pyramid matching (SPM), but rather, we concentrate on the direct DL-based classification methods. Here, the "so-called direct DL-based method" is the approach directly deals with DL framework by adding some meaningful penalty terms. By listing some representative methods, we can roughly divide them into two categories, i.e. (1) directly making the dictionary discriminative and (2) forcing the sparse coefficients discriminative to push the discrimination power of the dictionary. From this taxonomy, we can expect some extensions of them as future researches.

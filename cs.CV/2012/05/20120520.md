- **Summary**: In many classification systems, sensing modalities have different acquisition costs. It is often {\it unnecessary} to use every modality to classify a majority of examples. We study a multi-stage system in a prediction time cost reduction setting, where the full data is available for training, but for a test example, measurements in a new modality can be acquired at each stage for an additional cost. We seek decision rules to reduce the average measurement acquisition cost. We formulate an empirical risk minimization problem (ERM) for a multi-stage reject classifier, wherein the stage $k$ classifier either classifies a sample using only the measurements acquired so far or rejects it to the next stage where more attributes can be acquired for a cost. To solve the ERM problem, we show that the optimal reject classifier at each stage is a combination of two binary classifiers, one biased towards positive examples and the other biased towards negative examples. We use this parameterization to construct stage-by-stage global surrogate risk, develop an iterative algorithm in the boosting framework and present convergence and generalization results. We test our work on synthetic, medical and explosives detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that substantial cost reduction without a significant sacrifice in accuracy is achievable.

- **Summary**: Fractal image compression is attractive except for its high encoding time requirements. The image is encoded as a set of contractive affine transformations. The image is partitioned into non-overlapping range blocks, and a best matching domain block larger than the range block is identified. There are many attempts on improving the encoding time by reducing the size of search pool for range-domain matching. But these methods are attempting to prepare a static domain pool that remains unchanged throughout the encoding process. This paper proposes dynamic preparation of separate domain pool for each range block. This will result in significant reduction in the encoding time. The domain pool for a particular range block can be selected based upon a parametric value. Here we use classification based on local fractal dimension.

- **Summary**: Spectral graph theory is well known and widely used in computer vision. In this paper, we analyze image segmentation algorithms that are based on spectral graph theory, e.g., normalized cut, and show that there is a natural connection between spectural graph theory based image segmentationand and edge preserving filtering. Based on this connection we show that the normalized cut algorithm is equivalent to repeated iterations of bilateral filtering. Then, using this equivalence we present and implement a fast normalized cut algorithm for image segmentation. Experiments show that our implementation can solve the original optimization problem in the normalized cut algorithm 10 to 100 times faster. Furthermore, we present a new algorithm called conditioned normalized cut for image segmentation that can easily incorporate color image patches and demonstrate how this segmentation problem can be solved with edge preserving filtering.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this work, we define a new pilgrims face recognition dataset, called HUFRD dataset. The new developed dataset presents various pilgrims' images taken from outside the Holy Masjid El-Harram in Makkah during the 2011-2012 Hajj and Umrah seasons. Such dataset will be used to test our developed facial recognition and detection algorithms, as well as assess in the missing and found recognition system \cite{crowdsensing}.
